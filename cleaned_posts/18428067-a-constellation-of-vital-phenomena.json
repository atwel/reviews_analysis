must read this book","2":" i would give this book 4 5 stars if i could marra's prose is beautiful even as the events he depicts are horrifying we see torture and sex trafficking drug abuse and lust betrayal and euthanasia each tragedy makes sense in its time and in the connections between the characters even as the horror of the novel's totality mounts the novel's title comes from a definition in sonja's medical dictionary \"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" and indeed the novel is about life and all its vital phenomena ultimately we see the power of love and compassion amidst the ugliness of war but to say any more would be a spoiler for more of my review see http mthupp wordpress com 2014 10 2","3":"warning you must get past the dark and gritty story before you can begin to enjoy the characters in the book once you see the connections and you learn more about each character you fall in love with most for me it happened when achmed drew natasha's portrait i love that you were told what happens to each character in the future i doubt the story will leave my mind for a long time","4":" i'm not saying i didn't like the beginning of this novel but when i arrived at page 139 i became hooked absolutely hooked the passage actually one long sentence is about a younger brother along with his family whom the readers never see again at the village doctor's a better artist than he is a doctor to describe his 'disappeared' older brother in order for the doctor to draw his portrait the lyricism of the long sentence is what captivated me at the time but it also encapsulates much of what else is also wonderful about this book e g the omniscient voice that many times gives us a glimpse of the future and the author's handling of time in general as to the latter it's only as you keep reading that you realize how impressive that handling of time is and how it reflects one of the themes the characters sometimes think of an event matter of factly that's not immediately explained to the reader eventually the writer takes us back in time maybe one year maybe seven and then we know too the technique creates tension in the reader that merely hints at thank goodness for us the tension felt in the daily lives of these characters who are not participants in the wars but villagers and a few remaining city dwellers trying to survive as best they can the one torture scene is like a feverish nightmare that feels even longer that it actually is one you want to read between your fingers but the book needs it to be there and you are grateful for it being only the one it stays in your mind and stands for many more in my reading of it i could only think of it as also being an indictment against the dangerous territory the u s seems to have found its way toward as well when i first read about this book i found it eerie that its release date was so soon less than a month after the boston marathon bombing which was orchestrated by two self identified chechen brothers perhaps i thought this novel could shed some light on their mindset that would be a tall order of course and not within the novel's scope by any stretch of the imagination but a light is shed on a people who were forced from their homeland many of course were killed allowed to return over a decade later then persecuted again the tragic history of ethnic purging once again seems all too familiar and absurd","5":" yet again i've ignored a friend's recommendation for too long half way through this was a four which turned into a four and a half and ended as a five so public yes you were right credit is due to someone being replete with spoilers there's not a great deal to say about the story other than the sheer elegance of its construction the raw beauty of its sentiment and the emotional sucker punches of its endings anthony marra channels the spirit of russian literature the miseries of history and fate the glory of the individual the love hate bonds of family all wrapped up in an understated little novel that affirms your doubts about humanity before turning around to crush those doubts with the infinite bounds of human goodness just like the imaginary lines that connect the dots of the constellations life is fragile and ambiguous and marra's book is the perfect study of life's constellation of vital phenomena for while the dots of our lives may seemingly always be falling apart they are actually rendered indissoluble by invisibly powerful forces around us also on twitter and tumblr","6":"heavy going but worth it in the end","7":" the story is set in chechnya mostly during the two chechan wars with russia and focuses on a few characters sonja an ethnic russian doctor who returned from training in the uk to find her sister havaa an ethnic chechan girl who witnesses her father taken away by the federalists and her house burned to the ground at the beginning of the book and akhmed an ethnic chechan who takes havaa to the city to seek refuge with sonya the story moves in time but rather than feeling disjointed it feels like an elegant spiral showing our connectedness this book has stayed with me in the weeks since i finished it highly recommended","8":" but inside us there's a word we can't pronounce and that's who we are mind blowing i absolutely loved everything about it quite cynical at times but i guess considering the setting of the novel it's expected i loved that about it just the right amount of emotional reflects on human relations and what makes us do what we do how we get to a certain place the actions that lead us to it i find that quite fascinating i had no certain expectations for it but they exceeded them anyway dbound for a second read in the near future","9":"an emotional journey i gulped back sobs at the beginning of several sentences deeply powerful","10":" i'm going to be honest and admit that prior to reading 'a constellation of vital phenomena' i didn't even really know where chechnya was my best guess would have been somewhere russia ish in the eastern half of the world i certainly wasn't aware of the way people live in that part of the world for the most part i have been happy in my ignorance occasionally reading a book about a country where you expect wars and danger like afghanistan despite my ignorance i dove in to the pages and found myself engrossed in the characters and events this story was just my cup of tea it told the story of war torn chechnya and a couple of doctors who find their lives thrown together while hiding a little girl whose father was taken to a prison camp it is a dark and heart breaking story but is told so beautifully that you won't be able to get enough i love books that tie multiple events and stories together but often find that they aren't executed well by the author this is one of the successful ones i've never read anything previously by the author but his story telling ability is phenomenal the book awarded me with not only an immensely enjoyable tale but also a desire to learn a little more about our friends in chechnya","11":" this is the best book i've read so far this year i hadn't read a book i liked as much since a light between oceans over the past day i've been thinking about why the books reminded me of each other here's what i came up with both books are similar in that they are beautifully written take the reader backwards and forwards in time explore complex relationships between characters and examine human nature the central theme in both books is about saving improving the life of a little girl and to what lengths the adults who love her will go to ensure the best outcome for her both writers weave the lives of their characters together in unexpected ways so as a reader you have to piece the story together the authors ask you consider what you would do if you found yourself in the same situation as one of the characters i spent about 8 9 days reading this book it's not a quick read or an easy one but it's well worth it","12":"category author under 30","13":" i loved this portrait of ordinary people doing their extraordinary best under the duress of war in chechnya their human spirit shines through like the grass that grows in the cracks of a sidewalk i was inspired with marra's ability to portray how in the face of war's devastation people focus their purpose on whatever family members or shreds of community they retain and when even that is gone they forge a virtual family most of the story takes place in a few days in 2004 with flashbacks to the two periods of invasion of chechnya by russian federation forces in 1994 and 1999 which was marked by massive civilian casualties by bombings and artillery strikes during extended periods of occupation systematic repression and torture was rampant to assure that this republic did not break away as so many other soviet states did after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 the book is not concerned with the politics and combat of the specific war but with the miracles of human nature within the society impacted by such events marra stretches hard to make language capture this life as \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" almost everyone is a hero in this tale the two main characters are doctors akhmed is a muslim primary care doctor in a rural community in southern chechnya he saves an orphan girl havaa from federal forces that killed her father and burned her home in the first pages we experience him finding eight year old havaa and placing her in sanctuary at the hospital in the nearby city of volchansk sonja is a female surgeon of ethnic russian origin who has taken over the running of the hospital in this bombed out city the price she asks of akhmed in return for the favor is for him to serve on her medical staff which calls for daily forays from his caretaker role for his disabled wife the evolution of akhmed and sonja's relationship was wonderful for me she is superbly competent but gruff and cynical with no bedside manner whereas akhmed is warm and self deprecating but poorly equipped for the task he was always more interested in art than medicine his most recent art was putting up around his village large portraits on panels of the disappeared a touching act marra bases on a real event sonya schools him in trauma care and lessens his despair by instilling a sense of purpose and he in turn helps humanizes her makes her laugh and raises her hopes of finding her missing sister humor helps break down barriers between them he was an incompetent doctor but a decent man he believed compensating for his physician limitations with his empathy for the patient his understanding of pain ...\"i shouldn't spend so much time with you you'll turn me into a first rate surgeon and a boor \"\"i think it's the other way around\" she said a gauze of afternoon cloud cover had wrapped around the sky and she looked up and into it \"i'm overcome by the inexplicable desire to speak to you with common courtesy \"havaa's story of resilience and poignant efforts to make sense of her family's loss makes her a hero too although sonja generally hates kids we see havaa's precocity begin to win her heart when the child first speaks to her of her \"disappeared\" father \"he's an arborist he knows everything about trees i'm still a minimalist \"\"do you know what that is \"havaa nodded expecting the question \"it's a nice way of saying you have nothing \"\"it's important to know big word\" the girl said repeating her father's maxim \"no one can take what's indside your head once it's there \"\"you sound like a solipsist \"another key character is khassan a friend and neighbor of akhmed who has worked his whole life on a 3 000 page history of the chechen the muted voice of the people is epitomized by the succession of regimes that have refused to allow him to publish any of it except the segments up to the middle ages he is further silenced by the interruption of his friendship and regular chess playing with havaa's father and by his termination of all communication with his remaining family member a son who has been tortured into becoming an informer for russian security forces the most moving part of the book for me lies in khassan's finding relief from his isolation by disclosure of the story of a secret love affair from his past to akhmed's bedridden and demented wife this story takes place against the background of stalin's transplantation of their families along with half a million of native chechens to kazakhstan which lasted from 1944 until repatriation of survivors in 1957 the prose in this book is what often makes it special to me sometimes it calls too much attention to itself and sometimes it comes off as clumsy requiring reading the sentences more than once to achieve understanding as an example of success here the torment of khassan's son is captured as he experiences the impact of having to become an informer snow had thickened the ground the quiet of the house followed him into the woods two hundred meters in raising his head in a long scream he tore a hole in the silence through which he could walk more freely here is an example that does well at first in capturing akhmed's shock of dealing with a victim of a landmine but to me it overreaches toward the end ... he wasn't the first man he had seen writhing like a noodle in a pot of boiling water not the first he had seen with half his shin hanging by a hinge of sinew but when he saw this man it was like seeing the first man for the first time he couldn't think couldn't act could only stand in shock as the air where the man's leg should have been filled the floor and the room and his open mouth ...then the man's pulse was a haphazard exertion against his finger i admire marra so much for trying and often succeeding that i have to forgive him for flying too close to the sun sometimes here is a final example which sings so well about ahkmed's feeling of loss of his wife to dementia but to me stumbles at the end he was losing her incrementally it might be a few stray brown hairs listless on the pillow or the crescents of fingernails tossed behind the headboard or a dark shape dissolving in soap as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there the dishes no longer prepared or eaten the walks no longer walked the summer woods the undergrowth parted by their shins the arguments no longer argued no stakes nothing either wanted or could lose the love no longer made desired imagined or mourned the illness had resorted to an innocence he was unwilling to pollute and the warmth of her flesh cocooning his was a shard of their life dislodged from both their memories against the forces of erasure the characters nurture life through their memories spark hopes for each other and find windows for humor and for love morality is frequently compromised but the wellsprings of their personal integrity are preserved no wonder 13 out of 15 of my gr friends rendered 4 or 5 stars for this debut novel marra looks too young to believe he could create this out of imagination research and visits to chechnya but he wrote it at 28 years of age and a stanford professor where he was a graduate student in creative writing was quoted as saying his skills were already fully developed in an interview included at the end of this book he cites the influence of benioff's \"city of thieves\" which despite its portrayal of suffering at the siege of leningrad is \"filled to the brim with life love humor even joy all of which only enhance and make more real the underlying historical tragedy \"","14":"whoever makes this chillingly brilliant work of literature into a movie will win all of the oscars","15":"i loved this book it's been a while since i've read something as compelling and well written i would have given it a 5 but there was one plot point that was fairly pivotal that didn't really add up for me i can let that go though and heartily recommend this book it's different and gripping while the plot is knitted together with a finesse you don't see too often try it","16":"brutal and brilliant one of the best books i've read","17":" the title is what drew me to this book i had to read it if only to find out about that title as it turns out this novel is the strongest boldest story i've read in quite awhile and i've read some really good books chechnya in the last decade of the 20th century and first decade of the 21st is violent brutal and no place for any chechen to have a decent life much less a child there are several major characters to keep straight and i didn't always do a good job occasionally having to pause to remind myself who the person was and the story jumps back and forth in time even though the author makes it clear with chapter headings and graphics when the story takes place i had trouble keeping the time line straight but although this may sound like whining it is not it challenged me and i like a book that makes me think the characters are desperate and there are no good solutions for them there is loyalty and betrayal bravery and understandable cowardice none of the characters are quite as good as they could be and none are as flawed as their circumstances would excuse what beautiful characters in most novels if there are too many coincidences that easily tie the story together i like the story less because it seems the coincidences were written for the convenience of the author in this there were lots of those coincidences but it didn't bother me instead it added to the story it was the story it showed the interconnectedness of all things how nothing is as simple or clear as it may seem the author has a wonderful way of frequently telling us what will happen to a person in x number of years and months \"in ingushetia he had an eleven year old daughter he didn't know about who was waiting for him to call in two and a half years he would hear her voice for the first time \"the writing is graceful and beautiful the story is strong and sad and heartbreaking and hopeful and hopeless the characters became real people to me and this is a book i will not soon forget highly recommended i was given an advance copy of this book for review","18":"i downloaded this via audiobooks to my phone and listened to this book during my commute but i was so enthralled that i even brought it inside with me a few times i know nothing about chechnya and even the recent decade of war and violence boiled down to vaguely remembered reports about chechen rebels i am ashamed to admit that now that i have read this haunting novel about the terror loss violence torture and deprivation suffered by these poor people i must thank the author for bringing these characters alive for me to grow to know them to see them in all their good and bad and to watch them struggle with their emotions was a gift none of these people pretended to be perfect or even good they just did what they could loved where their hearts took them and desperately tried to retain a sense of community and family i missed the book group meeting at which this book was discussed so i have only my own reaction to consider the author wrote skillfully with wonderful even masterful choices of words that conjured vivid pictures many of which made me flinch while others brought a smile of recognition to my face he created a world in which the indomitable human spirit is at the very core how each character chose to act when faced with both everyday frustrations and unbelievably horrific circumstances frequently gave me chills as they did not always act as i might expect yet when their back stories are revealed along the way i can see how they could react in no other manner i did so like the way she told us what would befall people in 6 months 2 years and three month 99 years etc it was reassuring to know how people ended up whether good or bad and the souvenirs that havah collected were such a treasure trove of cherished talismans just listing them could evoke mental images of the sad yet determined refugees as they departed for parts unknown this is a very well written tale about a horrific chapter in world history it may not apeal to all btu i would suggest that everyone read it anyway as we must not be permitted to claim ignorance about such things","19":"this isn't like me i normally do not give a book a rating of 3 out of 5 this is simply because if the book rates this in my opinion i just don't do the book fifty pages in and i'm outta here but i hung in for this one got it on the audio version and plowed through the tracks hoping it was going to give me some kinda peace some closure is it just me or is the book written in such a convoluted way that one thing repeats itself after another it's not that it's not interesting the content is compelling actually not saying i entirely like the characters but i tended to be there for them but i just got a feeling of being muddled who is who it was like looking at a painting that has all told too much information in it maybe i gotta do it again sometime and i will if it comes up for a read again i will give it a shot but for now i was relieved to be on the last set of tracks i normally do not mark a book as being 'read' until i have devoured everything i'm the kind that reads the prologue the closing acknowledgments and all that jazz but here i'm gonna allow myself to say 'read' because i am sure there's going to be nothing in there i haven't already been told in previous parts of the story","20":"a les miserable of the two chechen wars marra weaves a story that cuts to the heart of humanity and the awfulness that is war three cheers to him for a fabulous first novel","21":"patron review excellent narrative that tells the story exceptionally well also gives reader insights into conditions on civil war","22":"epic in scope and topic constellation is beautifully written deeply compassionate and funny in a way only appropriate for survivors best book i've read in a long time","23":"i definitely liked this book i thought there were some wonderful turns of phrase and some very real moments laying bare some very real stuff but i expected to love it more and i can't quite put my finger on why i didn't maybe partly the skipping chronology although that did really come together at the end maybe the references to what would happen to a character in ten twenty fifty years time this seemed a little heavy authorial for me probably the biggest thing was that although i loved much of the lyricism for me it almost seemed laid on too thickly i think sometimes i would have preferred plainer prose so as not to draw attention to itself and to leave the moment to leave what was happening to be the star if it sounds like i didn't like it that's not the case but i'd heard so much raving about it that i perhaps expected too much as it was it was a well enough written tale about people in a too little known war with some beautiful prose and an ending set of endings that nearly pulled it into the realm of the very good instead of the simply good","24":"well written and a piece of history i knew nothing about sad but a great story","25":" in 1994 a beautiful girl named natasha sat on the floor reading the definition of life through her sister's russian medical textbook life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i picked this up without reading any synopsis or anything simply seduced by that title i didn't know it was a historical fiction or that i was a historical fiction in chechnya had i known i would have expected another story by khaled elhusseny and it wasn't it was much more elegant than anything he would have written missing that sad dull damp depression that was his main theme but with the same desperation in it and plenty of humor and it's a debut novel i'll definitely be looking out for marra in the future taken place within 5 days from the abduction of dokka and his friend's effort to keep havaa dokka's 8 year old girl safe those 5 days told the story of the last 10 years in the life of a small chechen village and one number 6 hospital it told history and future predictions memories and hopes secret desires and sacrifices of every single characters as well as some objects not leaving even a single individual without adding a slice of depth and reality to their characters in the most romantic reflective way possible with everyone's cross path in each other's tales with great writing and throwing in some gorgeous prose every now and then just to remind you of the powerful voice telling the story","26":"i finished it on feb 1 it was 4 am and tears were seeping down my cheeks for me this book has everything a compelling and unique narrative complex sympathetic and unsympathetic characters beautiful writing provocative ideas and i learned a little about chechnya and its history and now i want to learn more it is a great big wow i could not recommend it more strongly","27":"marra had such a great idea for this novel so i was excited to read it the book is roughly 400 pages and i personally didn't find it as riveting as i was hoping it would be but it did become great to read and extremely hard to put down about 300 pages later a bit slow in the beginning and middle clearly but most definitely worth it especially for a book about war which is something i'm not entirely interested in as a genre","28":"loved the writer's style and the hauntingly beautiful story set in chechnya a good accompaniment is the may 2013 nyt article about anthony marra and his first novel can't wait to meet the author at the 2014 nantucket book festival and read his future pieces","29":"4 5 really good story","30":" she had believed happiness to be an absence of fear of pain of grief but here it roared in her as powerful as any sadness this is a novel of many things of sadness portrayed powerfully and beautifully brief bouts of happiness amid steely denouncements of the pain of war pain bold and brusque the absence of sentimentality as one should expect when reading about the perils of war write what you know this is what they teach you in mfa programs and yet marra iowa workshop mfa graduate and stegner fellow each year i look forward to one or two great books to emerge from stanford's lineup of talented writers and this book was one is emboldened to write about what he does not know war and chechyna i should add that marra did travel to chechnya to interview survivors of this disaster of emotional truth how can someone who hasn't been through war bring the experience to the page so vividly like adichie did in half of a yellow sun marra insists upon the emotional truths of his characters the intellectually arrogant and indomitable doctor sonja who runs a small hospital that would serve as a setting for this novel the observant and inquisitive little orphan havaa who seeks refuge at this hospital the diffident yet resolute akhmed who must protect this little girl care for his bed ridden wife and remember how to be a doctor the beautiful and downtrodden natasha who finds it difficult to rebuild a friendship with her sister sonja because she secretly deals with personal trauma of human suffering in each section suffering is distilled you don't hear of chechnya often in fact you don't hear about the major wars of the 1990s often because although it is a decade marred by cataclysmic events for some those events are juxtaposed with years of prosperity for most most wars of the 90s haven't quite made it to the mainstream literary circles and the first and second chechen wars between the russian federation and the chechen republic are included the story unfolds seamlessly traveling back and forth through time and place the narration is a rare mix sometimes so close that your heart beats through your ears sometimes with enough distance to give you perspective and oddly at times even omniscient because you learn things that even the characters whose heads you're in don't know about themselves or each other and will never know throughout the book of the unpredictability of war war is unnatural here the spotlight zooms in on the unnatural things that people do during war it will remind you of how one can never judge a survivor of war unless one has lived through the gall of it had it been you what would you have done will you ever know could you even imagine grozny is referenced a lot the chechen capital which was flattened in 1994 and rebuilt warring groups are referred to as 'the feds' or 'the rebels ' should you choose to read this novel and can't figure out which group is doing what admittedly this does get confusing at times a quick read up here might help of death and destruction this is not a spoiler by the way the youngest brother is the one who six months later would be disappeared in the back of the truck as his older brother was who would know the landfill through his blindfolding gag by the rich scent of clay as his older brother had known whose fingers would be wound with the electrical wires that had been welded to his older brother's wounds who would stand above a mass grave his brother had dug and would fall in it as his older brother had though taking six more minutes and four more bullets to die who would be buried in arms length of dirt above his brother and his bones would find over time those of his older brother and so at that indeterminate point in the future answer his mother's prayer that her boys find each other wherever they go","31":"every once in a while an artist comes along and crafts a stunning portrait anthony marra is one of those","32":"i believe this will remain as one of my favorite books ever beautifully written heartbreakingly detailed truly memorable","33":"i had a hard time through to the last 100 pages was a little disjointed but the ending so good very well written overall nn","34":" 3 5 stars \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" reminded me a lot of \"everything is illuminated \" both books center around a small village in eastern europe and a persecuted minority both use a combination of present discovery and past flashbacks to unfold the plot and both were written by young authors by that token \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" succeeds and fails where \"everything is illuminated\" did the book is emotionally powerful lots of sadness and the characters are well developed but on the other hand the book seem more foreign than it needs to be at times it intersperses magical realist tricks oddly to make the book read as unnecessarily otherworldly e g the author will sometimes introduce a character and then tell their future in a short sentence and it has a few hokey scenes e g the description of life as a \"constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation\" and the author dances around the chechnyan conflict giving the reader a sense of how civilians experienced it without giving the reader background on the greater forces behind it maybe it's not really the role of the author to play historian behind such a fraught conflict still i felt like a short description of the years leading up to and following the dissolution of the soviet states and islam in the caucasus would have been helpful outside of the content of the book \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" made me think about who should tell stories of ethnic conflict i feel like novels written about ethnic conflicts by complete outsiders lack the force that those written by members of the ethnicity have at the same time fiction is about fabrication storytelling and relating specific experiences to the broader world it's not about who wrote the book but about what the book does with the exception of books where the author writes himself into the book or presents the book as part of his life e g in \"the things they carried\"--in those instances i think who the author is does matter i wish i didn't care as much as i do about who wrote a book--a book should be judged for its content and not its author moreover an author that writes capably about something foreign to him her is arguably more talented than an author who writes about something familiar to him her i guess it's clear that i'm still debating whether the author being a young american makes \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" more impressive or less impressive or whether the issue is completely irrelevant","35":"wow i knew somehow these lives would be intertwined but i did not predict how goes to my belief that that we are all connected and small decisions create big consequences the war mongers among us should read fiction like this","36":"so glad i came across this in a local bookstore until i saw it on the shelves i hadn't heard about it this took me a little while to read but i loved it the writing is so beautiful and i like that the story is non linear the last two chapters are simply overwhelming","37":"thank god this depressing confusing novel is over","38":"amazing story by a new author i had had no knowledge of chechnya it's geographical or historical reference in recent russian events the story alternates between the 1990's and 2004 wars for control of a part of russia which highlight the human cost of war using 2 shared narratives of islamic and christian beliefs the book tells the stories of 8 characters what would could a parent do if asked to sacrifice a child what would could humans do to save their own lives in the face of war i wish that i had started the book at a time when i could have devoted more time to appreciating the author's use of words to describe these wars and its people but there were several pages that i marked because i found the words so apt or moving for example the author describes the landfill a place where people are disappeared to a large pit filled with mud and water prisoners are lowered into the landfill where they carve their names into the mud walls after summoned to be questioned most do not return the remaining residents then cover the disappeared names with mud no body to bury no name to remember","39":"4 5 stars marra is an exceptional writer this book contained some of the most beautiful prose i have ever read the character development is subtle and natural though not simplistic i am knocking half a star off because there were a few moments when i was a bit bored with the actual storyline i found myself reading simply so i could enjoy marra's writing style rather than out of interest for the actual story","40":"best book i've read in the past few years beautiful haunting glorious use of words","41":" 3 5 stars he writes most definitely with beauty and skill and the lives of those enduring a hard and brutal life in chechnya were vividly brought to light however i found many parts could not hold my attention and i was simply not compelled enough to really want to sit and read i found some parts to be tedious to read and some of the characters difficult to endure my favourite storyline character though would have been ramzan the despised informer but whom gave heartbreaking reasons why he had to do what he had to do sonja was difficult to read i was annoyed with her","42":"phenomenal best thing i've read since billy lynn's long halftime walk","43":" disappointed expectations describes my experience with marra's book as a lover of historical fiction i thought i would learn about the issues underpinnings and back story behind the conflict between chechnya and russia instead it was a look into a war zone that felt like a look into most every war zone no matter what you read and when the human toll the destruction the twisted thinking the cruelty the loss of innocence and the horror is gut wrenching did marra create compelling characters yes was the plot line interesting and believable not really too often he muddied the flow with his tendency to lavish in description so laden with imagery and metaphor that it intruded on the storytelling there was an odd compulsion to put events on timetables spelled out in years months and days the flow of events were stalled by flashbacks and insertions about the characters lives then and now i have huge admiration for anyone who writes to be published and i love good writing in this case i thought the writer got in his own way in an attempt to build visuals and his characters the title's connection with the ultimate theme of the book still eludes me that said it was an admirable undertaking","44":"i just couldn't get into this book sorry book i need something light and dumb","45":"for a debut novel i'm extremely extremely impressed definitely one of my favorite historical fiction novels since edward p jones's the known world jones questioned the interpretation of american history on a wide scale marra hones his book to follow only a handful of characters during the recent chechen war i was introduced to this novel at the whiting award reading in nyc where the author read a few paragraphs from the first chapter instantaneously hooked a number of the book's bleak scenes are written in a playful and sardonic tone creating a distant and whimsical feel to an otherwise brutal war marra weaves this tone throughout the narrative and unleashes moments of his story with punctuated clarity the structure of the book is extremely impressive sometimes marra will follow the simple plot of a single relationship sometimes he leaps around to connect individual plots over distances in space and time the result is an complex illustration of a small community from numerous points of view which lends itself to more philosophical questions concerning history how do we form and relate to histories on a personal level for the majority of the book marra's interwoven relationships obscures individual interpretations of chechen history focusing instead on the individual characters as a result he achieves emotional intimacy on a detailed level","46":"the best fiction book i've read in a few months beautiful writing complex characters whose tragic stories all eventually fold together","47":"at the beginning and for parts in the middle i wasn't sure i was smart enough to engage with this book fully the history of chechnya embarrassingly unknown to me the prose at times eluded me the timeline at times confused me but the end of the book redeemed itself to tell the story of everyday people in war the sadness and the hope","48":" life a constellation of vital pheonomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaption this book was amazingly composed by anthony marra war is not a pleasant subject to write or read about but the devastation and brutality etched throughout this book is partnered with deep unconditional love and hope for the future while the ending isn't a fairy tale it does leave you satisfied havaa dokka akhmed sonja natasha and khassan were beautiful characters each with their own struggles each with their own journeys but through out the page turning they somehow get intricately woven together view spoiler havaa while forced to grow up quickly was loved dearly by her father and others i think because of her sonja was able to find peace when she saw the nutcracker from london she had given to natasha all that time it had been in havaa's bag dokka and akhmed at the very end bonded one last time through her safety one little girl meant so much it was an incredible part of the book hide spoiler i didn't want this book to end but the ending was actually the best part i think marra did an amazing job of tieing up all the loose ends i can't praise him enough while this book was amazing and beautiful the beginning was a little slow which is why i gave it four stars","49":"another reviewer said only this about this book hot damn now that's a book and that about sums it up a constellation of vital phenomenon is beautiful and haunting and wonderfully written i especially loved the way the author told us exactly what happened to the characters even the ones that seemed trivial and played only a fleeting role in the story for me this book was damn near perfect one note i knew embarrassingly little about chechnya's painful history before reading this book i spent a large part of the beginning of the book confused until i researched chechnya a bit before you read this take some time to read about the chechen people and all they've endured it will help you understand the story and its characters much better","50":"started off slow or hard to understand maybe i'm used to easier reads but i soon enjoyed the authors use of words imagery well written","51":"i liked this book because it gave me a view into a part of the world i hadn't visited before the writing was excellent and i'll be looking for his next book","52":" i didn't like anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena but i could not put it down i read every single brutal passage it was exquisitely painful marra dropped me in russia smack dab down in the political conflict of chechnya a recent time in history yet so out of my radar marra's fictional work got right in my face history as seen from the civilians living this life the personalization of war and all its horrors a constellation of vital phenomena is presented to us in non linear alternating time lines from 1994 2004 this allows marra to flesh out the point of view of his main six narrators he does this beautifully and we always know where we are in time and which character is speaking i really appreciated this a constellation of vital phenomena begins in 2004 when the feds burn the house of akhmed's neighbor dokka dokka becomes one of the so called disappeared but who is left behind is his daughter eight year old havaa akhmed rescues havaa from her hiding place in the woods and then must find her a safe place to live certainly not his own home that he shares with his ill wife ula he takes havaa to the only place he can think of a war torn hospital and a doctor he knows only by reputation of sewing up a man's chest with dental floss this doctor sonja andreyevna rabina reluctantly agrees to harbor havaa in exchange for akhmed's agreement to work at the hospital the intertwining of the lives of these and the other characters is told in 400 gut wrenching pages interspersed with sparks of humor that somehow keep spirit alive under horrific conditions thank heavens for these glimpses of hope i don't think i came away with a clearer understanding of the chechnya wars but i can put a face to the people isn't this what it comes down to in the end the people i didn't like a constellation of vital phenomena but i wouldn't have missed it for anything a superior debut there is an excellent interview with anthony marra at you wrote the book the reader's podcast","53":"i thought it was boring a hard audio to follow i appreciated it more after book club","54":"this book is amazing the events are so sad and horrific but the story is writen with such compassion humor and strength the characters are post soviet matter of fact performing unimaginable tasks but still humane and seeking some normalcy","55":"interesting setting vital subject well recommended book but somehow for me a little lacking in compelling heart that i needed to fall in love with the characters there was some empathy but","56":"wow heavy very well written but heavy make sure you are in the right frame of mind","57":"war torn chechnya has never been more than a passing interest on my radar i half listened to major network news reports this novel which i would call an historical fiction novel taking place between the years of 1994 2004 educated me to the tragedy and horror that was taking place while i was blissfully ignorant in my american home beautifully written with lyrical prose this captivating novel gives the reader a glimpse into the human conflicts resulting from political and social anarchy i did have difficulty with all the russian and chechen names at the beginning of the novel i should have written notes to follow the names marra does provide time lines in which he uses flashbacks to explain the present which i needed to refresh my memory after the first couple of chapters i was mesmerized marra shows human complexity even in some of the more despicable characters there are basically four main characters sonja a brilliant russian doctor natasha who is sonja's sister akhmed who is an incompetent yet kind chechen doctor and havaa who is an 8 year old girl who witnessed her father's abduction by russian soldiers akhmed wants to save havaa at all costs because he knows the russians are after her sonja is a brilliant dr who comes back to russia to find her sister and is staying at a war torn hospital waiting for her sister to come back to her natasha became a social victim in the war and ended with ptsd and a heroin addiction and who disappears while working for sonja there are many other secondary characters who provide rich reading akhmed brings havaa to sonja's hospital to keep her safe sonja is tired bitter and far from maternal yet akhmed persuades sonja to keep havaa safe marra uses havaa's innocent perspective to show the reader the confusion of war on the young and to provide the reader relief from reading all the war atrocities the novel in it's \"present\" sense takes place over 6 days in those 6 days sonja's heart softens and she takes on the care of havaa it's a tender story it's a horror story it's a tragedy it's a love story it's a story of betrayal it will be one of the top books of 2013 i loved it marra is an extraordinary writer u2028","58":"while it broke my heart in the process this story was a wonder and a joy to read anthony is a skilled wordsmith and researcher but his greatest talent in my eyes is his ability to remind us of our shared humanity and interdependence bravo","59":"this is a really great book the writing is excellent along with the plot development history characters everything it is heavy to read but worth it he writes of hard subjects death and war without it being haunting he writes about love and respect without it being shameful or lustful one of the best books i have read in a long time","60":"a haunting story of a conflict most americans are not as in touch with this emerging writer leaves nothing on the table in talent as he describes the lives of 5 chechneyans they battle the russians","61":"so sad and beautifully written the characters present themselves like russian dolls one must split apart completely for the next to be revealed such a tragic chain of events so glad i switched from audio to print with this one","62":" while it ends on a hopeful note this book is rather sad it is a beautiful tragic exploration of war i enjoyed getting to know the characters although the summary made it seem as though havaa would feature more prominently in the plot than she did but i was quite moved by this book and it's population i also think i've gotten a greater appreciation for the conflict in chechnya the author found an interesting way of showing us the future of characters their ultimate fates outside the bounds of this particular story that on the surface seems like it should have broken the narrative flow however it worked well for me and i am glad marra didn't leave the reader hanging after creating so much to care about","63":"six stars why can't i give it six stars this is the best book i have read in a long time","64":"i wrote to a friend i'm on page 20 and can't put it down by page 75 i didn't care if i ever picked it up again halfway through and i stopped altogether when i start skimming large sections it's never a good sign set mainly in the second of the wars in chechnya i thought i'd learn in depth about the wars not really the language of the characters was strange the story line was hard to follow some of the writing seemed like writing just for the sake of hearing a clicking keyboard the author also used a device that drives me crazy i'm not going to search for a specific example so i'll make one up they held hands as they walked on the beach in three years time one of them would die a horrific death they had no way of knowing who no bleep maybe use it once ok but since i only made it halfway and the author did it at least 4 times overused i like descriptive dark and grim writing heavy reading philosophical topics the struggle of survival but this just didn't do it for me i might put it on my try again at a later date list but for now it's going back to the library where there are 100 people waiting to read it i don't understand the rave reviews","65":"wow this is one depressing book gave me a little insight into a period of time and place in the world which i know very little about i enjoyed reading it but it was also a little too blatantly emotional for my taste","66":"logged in to update my rating from 4 to 5 stars half a year later and i still think of this book at least once a week i'd read it again if i didn't have such a long want to read list to get through","67":" a constellation of vital phenomena is easily the best book i have read this year debut novelist anthony marra weaves together the lives of several people in a small town in chechnya a region in russia i had never heard of until the boston marathon bombings havaa a young girl trying to make sense of her war torn life dokka havaa's father who harbors refugees despite having all ten fingers removed by the russian military akhmed an incompetent doctor who tries to protect havaa after her father is taken in the night ramzan the old friend of dokka and akhmed who becomes an informer to protect his father khassan ramzan's father overtaken by shame for his son's actions sonja the doctor at a nearby hospital who takes in havaa and natasha sonja's sister who disappeared several years prior the novel takes place from 1994 2004 but in a non linear format as it moves between the first and second wars between chechen rebels wanting independence and the russian feds trying to keep the region under control the political and religious motivations for the wars are vastly complicated but marra successfully uses the setting as a way to explore human life amid atrocious circumstances these characters their struggles and their world are brought vividly to life by marra's beautiful prose my poor book is dog eared beyond recognition and i often had to close the book to savor the stark imagery and truly unique way of looking at everyday things marra writes about life not as it is happening but as if it is on a continuum so that his omniscient narrator can explain the fates of minor characters into the distant future my favorite example being the two brothers killed six months apart at the landfill whose bones eventually come to rest together fulfilling their mother's wish that the two always find each other wherever they go this novel is devastatingly beautiful but it also shows the resiliency of human spirit that allows us to survive and connect with people even when it seems impossible marra's dark humor brings out some absurd moments that feel too strange to not be true such as the smuggler whose chauffeur drives his mercedes in circles on the only piece of asphalt not broken by the land mines who utters my favorite nonsense of the novel don't insult me everyone knows a turtle is a crustacean on its mother's side a lizard f s a crab and nine months later a turtle pops out it's called evolution i cannot recommend a constellation of vital phenomena highly enough especially for readers who appreciate books that must be slowly savored and puzzled over absolutely fantastic i know i will reread this but i envy those readers who can read it for the first time with fresh eyes","68":"hard to put down","69":"truly excellent","70":"one of the best books i've read in years it took me weeks to complete because of time spent reading and re reading passages that were so beautiful it took my breath away few books can tell a story that is engrossing with prose that is lyrical bordering on the poetic the descriptive powers of this author are astounding if you haven't read this book yet you are missing a real treat","71":"wow one of the saddest books i have read in quite a while but one i could not put down so well written highly recommend this one","72":" i enjoyed this book the writing is exquisite the characters are memorable and some haunting images i did not know much about the war in chechnya but this gives some real insight into how brutal it was for civilians with a child central to the story and the european setting it did remind me of all the light we cannot see and city of thieves and it is certainly in the same league as those fantastic books highly recommended but this is not light reading i will avoid a plot summary it defies categorization","73":"the first 100 pages or so takes some effort it is not easy to keep the various time frames and points of view straight however the last 100 pages are some of the best that i have read in awhile i would probably read this one again i imagine that there is a lot that i would pick up on the second time through","74":"sonja the doctor achmed and havaa chechnya excellent","75":"i stayed up into the middle of the night finishing this one a constellation of vital phenomena is on par with the orphan master's son in terms of gravity and insight into a secret but very tangible world one of the best books i've read all year","76":"this was a challenging piece of historical albeit modern history fiction i was interested in the setting chechnya in light of recent events surrounding the boston marathon bombing i knew almost nothing about that region and found it helpful as other reviewers suggested to do a little homework on chechnya even having done that i struggled with the story as at jumped back and forth along a timeline this is a heavy dark read but incredibly interesting and beautifully written i almost gave up on it a few times but glad i stuck with it as the author rewarded me with a nice wrap up at the end thank you for that in a way this book reminded me of the tiger's wife","77":"what a remarkable story probably not the book to read over the holidays the images are so powerful and still haunt me 3 months later i highly recommend reading this so many parallels to what is happening in crimea u0026amp ukraine when will it end","78":"one of the best novels i've read in years compelling story and fascinating characters make this a book i want to recommend to all my reading friends","79":" there is no way that i can do justice to this book in my review i don't have the words to describe how amazing this book is this book has opened my eyes to the horrors that happen all over the world to the terror that others live through on a daily basis and yet it has done so beautifully showing that whatever the situation the human heart is still capable of love of kindness and of an unfathomable amount of bravery the book details what it's like to be chechnyan to be under the thumb of the russians a man named akhmed saves his neighbor dokka's daughter when dokka is taken in the middle of the night to a place called the landfill at the landfill people are tortured asked to inform on their friends and neighbors and almost always killed afterward akhmed takes havaa to a place where she will be safe and ends up with a new purpose in life this book should be required reading for everyone not only is it beautifully written and a wonderful piece of literature but the world needs to be aware that the things that take place in this book are actually happening","80":"informative but depressing novel that takes place during the two recent chechen wars marra does a nice job defining characters and describing the war torn environment it's well written but often confusing as events jump forward and back in time and marra constantly chimes in with information about a character's past or future","81":"amazing book the writing is beautiful the story jumps around a bit in time which can be a bit confusing the book explores the points of view of a number of different characters in war torn chechnya it is a very powerful story and i couldn't put it down","82":"one of the best books of the year easily","83":"if i could give this a higher rating i would all i can say is wow","84":"i got this book as an arc at the northeast independent booksellers conference in providence and could not wait for it to come out so i could press it on anyone who would listen as the best book they will ever read tony marra's story and setting are unique his characters complex and layered and most of all his writing is pure magic","85":"if you read no other book this year let it be this fantastic insightful novel everything i read after it seemed to fall short in some way not for the faint of heart the characters seem to jump right out of the pages and they all touch you in different ways i would rate it way higher than 5 stars","86":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here for some reason i couldn't get into this book will probably try again another time","87":"i feel like this book is better read in consecutive sittings i picked it up and put it down a lot i still loved it but was sometimes hard to pick up where i left off as it spans more than a decade","88":"such a haunting novel i definitely shed a tear towards the end i would recommend this book as long as you don't expect a happy go lucky ending it is after all a story about a war in russia","89":" a disturbing well written book about life during wartime in chechnya the book takes it's tile from the textbook definition of life \"a constellation of vital phenomena -- organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" i had to stop reading it before bed so i could fall asleep and not wake up with images of torture deals with the aftermath of torture and the hell of war in sometimes upbeat prose that adds to the horror the characters are so well drawn many of them clinging to shreds of pleasure and empathy that it was impossible for me not to read to the end pertinent to what is happening in new today","90":"this was a tough read in many places but i guess ultimately hopeful the author encourages us by mentioning future wheres doing whats for some characters both minor and major some beautiful tender moments mixed in with the horrors and stupidity of war","91":"beautifully written debut novel about the chetchen wars sad great characters i think i am going to read it again because every sentence is so wonderful","92":" this is a beautifully constructed book as the reader moves along the characters and plot unfold as layers in an onion one by one thinly veiled from the next but tightly coupled nonetheless it's the telling of a story that has beauty in its bleakness and it is bleak set in chechnya over the time period of 1994 2004 it's the story of how people survive some with the help of others and some despite others the characters all tie together eventually through the telling of their histories they are all forced to lay bare their souls at one point or another and are tested mercilessly just to survive that said it's also a story of hope and triumph marra did an excellent job of intricately describing a period of time and circumstances based on careful research","93":"a painfully human narration of ordinary people living through the ethnic conflict in chechnya i found the book to be captivating and painful to read the purges the freedom gained and later the ethnic marginalizing of chechens mostly muslims sheds light on the complex issues and corruption rampant in the states broken away from the formee ussr beautiful story telling without judgement","94":" it's so hard to imagine waking up daily in my safe and secure world that there are actually people nations that awake daily to war random interrogations torture disappearances shortages a general lack of normal life and some of them even survive it amazing in and of itself i found this novel slow going for me but worth sticking to i even found myself laughing a few times the courage is a character like sonja the resilience of havaa even the persistence of akhmed definitely amazing","95":" this book was recommended to me by so many people that even though i had a hard time with the first 100 pages i knew i couldn't stop i'm so very glad i didn't i know very little history of chechnya and the conflicts with russia so at times it was overwhelming the characters were survivors eking out a life in a war torn region the writing was beautiful and lyrical this is a book that i will be thinking about for a long time full of characters that i'm sad to say good bye to highly recommend it","96":"beautifully told joyous and heartbreaking a constellation of vital phenomena is a look at a culture and a war that i have hardly had any experience with i appreciate the wonderful learning experience there are some wonderful truths to be learned from this story","97":"it took some time to get into this book but overall i thought it was good extremely well written","98":"this is the best book i've read in years maybr ever need more stars","99":" i'm giving this one 5 stars because of the author only a handful of times has a first novel wowed me as much as this marra's writing is sophisticated complex riveting choose a superlative adjective the characters are realistically drawn and the often brutal circumstances of their lives are presented directly and honestly beyond the writing the subject matter the terrible history of chechnya is obscure and so important to understand if you're serious about your reading you must read this","100":"a wonderfully written story of the terrible effects of the war in chechnya and the consequences of it with such engrossing detail despite the atrocities there are still wonderful human beings who reject evil and those who conform to evil loved this book","101":"i struggled through this novel but it ended beautifully","102":"absolutely riveting story excellent prose engaging characters terrible circumstances a must read","103":"a heartbreaking story so beautifully written love in the midst of such cruelty and deprivation this is a powerful look into life in chechnya after the fall of the soviet union","104":"one of the best books that i've ever read such a beautiful story and i probably won't be able to stop thinking about it for a long time","105":"beautifully written book with wonderful character development about an area of the world about which i knew nothing","106":"fantastic book must read","107":"while i felt compelled to give this book the full 5 stars i will also say that i did not enjoy quite a large chunk of the journey that constituted my reading of this novel it is set between 1994 and 2004 in war torn chechneya there are three main characters ten year old havaa the incompetent doctor but very kind hearted man achmed and the brilliant but bone weary surgeon sonja as the story begins havaa sees her father dokka killed and she runs off into the forest with her already packed suitcase to hide childless achmed who is married to a severely mentally ill woman and loves havaa as if she were his own determines to find havaa and save her if possible miraculously achmed does find havaa whom the authorities are looking for and takes her to the one hospital in the area it is at that point we meet sonja a rather cold woman with no desire for children hers or anyone else's sonja left a good life and fiancee who loved her back in london to return to chechneya to try to rebuild her relationship with her sister by the time she meets achmed and havaa sonja's sister natasha is missing and sonja despite endless effort has been unable to find her this novel is written in an unusual recursive style that would probably be confusing if not for the helpful timeline atop each chapter head that style made skipping portions unwise and there was one very specific torture scene that i would have preferred to have skipped spoiler alert i really could have skipped the details there the story came together in the end logically and beautifully this book certainly made me even more grateful to be an american who has never had to endure anything remotely like what these characters experienced in the end there was something to like in almost every one of the characters except for ramzan fairly late in the novel we learn how he became what he was however the terrible things that happened to him still could not excuse him for his actions this is far from a simple beach read but i am glad that i stuck with it and do recommend it highly","108":" marra takes us to russia from the mid 1990's to 2004 a period of war in chechnya he introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters a young girl who is orphaned an incompetent physician who is also an incredibly talented artist and his mentally ill wife a tough surgeon and her heroin addicted sister an informer and his elderly father each character is developed thoroughly in this tale of love loss and betrayal i really cannot recommend this book to every reader because it is only in hindsight that the book becomes a glowing five stars it is absolutely beautifully written prose so if you can appreciate a book just for that component then definitely read it but the initial 75% is slow reading the characters are revealed slowly the timeline and settings are non linear which makes it harder to read and follow and also less compelling to pick up once set down however for the patient reader all i can say is that the payoff at the end is really great the last 25% of the book is a masterpiece of well written literature the characters lives all begin to intersect and the intersections are both unexpected and yet clearly and cleverly telegraphed in the preceding pages as everything comes together the book becomes more of a can't put it down read and at the end it is just purely satisfying for a literary patient reader i recommend this book wholeheartedly you will appreciate the beautiful prose the well developed characters the challenging format and the excellent insight into the human condition this book has all of the qualities of a classic if you are looking for a fast paced read about love and war that sucks you in and doesn't let go look elsewhere","109":"very sad and eye opening to the fact that there are atrocities happening in the world around us without our knowledge there were maybe one too many characters for any one storyline to maintain my interest so i found it a bit slow going still a good first novel from this author i'm curious to learn more about chechnya now","110":"a must read haunting and amazing","111":"gifted writer who educated me about a little known war loved his prose","112":"i liked it i learned a lot about chechnya and the 2 wars there a bit slow for me in the first half but overall very good i would recommend it","113":"although it's incredibly somber this book is absolutely beautiful also eye opening as to the modern atrocities that are occurring throughout the world i highly recommend just be prepared to be sad afterward aka don't read it on a beach","114":"i found this book haunting disturbing and gripping about war in chechnya about which i know little the book explores loyalties service lives and family love and relationships in a very dysfunctional war environment a beautifully written book","115":"this book was one of the few books to evoke so much emotion into me it seamed all of me months later i am still craving for a book just as beautiful impacting and memorable","116":"i was so frustrated by this book it was hard to get through it didn't pick up until i was more than half way through the book it was worth reading but it was a difficult read i'd give it two and a half stars","117":"the glowing reviews for this book are well deserved the writing is beautiful you can feel taste heat smell all the atrocities of war poverty and yes joy i found it a bit slow and sometimes confusing to keep all the timeliness and stories straight","118":"once a student in st petersburg russia anthony mara became interested in the tragedy of chechnya the book is a constellation of six viewpoints hence the name biological life is structured on a constellation of six phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptability this comment just gives insight into the intelligence and imagination and creativity of this book","119":"this took me a while to read because it was a fairly grim and depressing book however it was also filled with moments of beauty kindness and humanity the end of the book made me smile and tear up at the same time it wasn't a contrived tear jerker ending but rather some beautiful moments in the midst of horror and desolation","120":" wow i just loved mink river a sweet poetic tale of the simplicity and synchroncity of a small peaceful oregan town and its stories and now this novel almost the opposite of it amazes me even more less poetic but with some of the most distinct prose metaphors and allusions to the future i've ever read this novel moves back and forth across a complex ten year tale of survival connection recollection and reconnection in the midst of chechnyan russian strife war yes it is pretty gorey but at the same time it manages to be tender and truthful in a way that helps me believe that goodness prevails","121":"one of the best i've read when i was in school writing was called composition marra puts words together like he was arranging the notes in a symphony with the instruments playing the characters he takes the heart wrenching horror of war and weaves it into something unforgettable like a tune that keeps going through your mind","122":"fabulous language amazing evocation of life during a war s the lengths ends that a person goes to the depravity and the humanity depicted clearly a place i haven't understood nor really heard much about unless there was 'war' in the sentence chechnya","123":"i found this book to be utterly compelling and it opened my eyes to the devestation of conflicts all over the world while the book is centered on a small villiage during the chechn conflict of the late 1990s it could be the story of any village ransacked by war and the need push for survival although a novel with compelling characters it is also a story of universal loss trauma and misconnection","124":" it took me almost two months to read this book which is ridiculous i wish i had had more time to dedicate to it because i think i would have absorbed the story better had i read it in a shorter timeframe but jan and feb have been busy and this book is heavy the setting is chechnya amidst the war between the feds and the chechen rebels there were descriptions of torture in this book that made my stomach turn and sadness so much sadness but the web of relationships were intriguing and the fluidity of the story between different time periods and settings pulled me in and the writing is almost lyrical which kept the story from being overly depressing this wasn't a book i wanted to curl up on the couch with after a long day of work but it was a book i wanted to complete for someone like me far from truly educated about the details of conflicts in other countries this was a timely book to read","125":"this novel set in chechnya is packed full of stories that intersect and go back and forth in time sad events happen to all main characters but beautifully written hard to let go of","126":"really ended up liking this a lot it's definitely one that you need to take your time with because the time intervals can be a little distracting amazes me every time i read a novel of suffering the unbelievable strength of the human spirit in those that survive","127":"for me it did not live up to the glowing reviews i found the structure confusing and the myriad of characters were hard for me to become involved with","128":"this is a beautifully written book detailing the fictional lives of a handful of people that live through the two wars in chechnya the heartbreak and loss is unfathomable but there is also so much more i really enjoyed this novel","129":"i loved this book it was beautifully written while being searing in its descriptions of the chechen wars this is the book i now want to reco to all my friends","130":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a work of art marra's use of imagery is among the best that i have ever read in my life but marra should also be congratulated on his complex dispersal of time frames his development of characters and ultimately the most important feature of all his story telling constellation relates a story of chechnya in the modern era a country that has suffered through innumerable challenges and tragedies it is a story of human nature both good and bad and how the micro of life of its characters is affected by the macro of events surrounding them","131":"beautifully written poignant and evocative some sections are very graphic at times it was almost too much to take even though i'm sure it couldn't come close to conveying the reality overall i don't think it's even appropriate to say i enjoyed it but i'm glad i read it","132":"distressingfeb 2015 reread for a book club was better able to appreciate just how well written it is and recognize the hope in the despair upgraded to 4 stars","133":"this book was amazing i actually cried at one point while reading which never happens definitely the best book i have read this year the character development is excellent and the fluid timeline makes for interesting reading hard to put down","134":"utterly bleak and heartwrenching and beautifully written this book illustrates so vividly how war can destroy friendships community family and humanity i found the story of ramzan to be particularly moving and heartbreaking and was surprised at the twists and turns in perspective i took as more was revealed","135":"i came across this book when i saw it on the top 100 books for 2013 from npr books i looked for books with really great writing and this one came up my library happened to have it and i am so glad it did i absolutely loved this book i would read it again in a heartbeat","136":"somehow this notably well reviewed novel slipped under my radar even past its release only upon perusing the blogging for books offerings did i discover it and i am glad i chose to give it a try if you haven't heard about a constellation of vital phenomena yet or if it has been sitting on your to read or consideration list i'd recommend getting a copy asap then clear some nights for engrossed reading for those not familiar with the plot of anthony marra's award winning novel it is set in the war ravaged region of chechnya and traces the intersecting experiences of a small cast of characters as they struggle for life a combination of survival and purpose when russian soldiers come for her father eight year old havaa flees into the surrounding chechen woods where her father's friend akhmed rescues her and takes her to hide at the nearly deserted hospital there the sole doctor left in this war torn wasteland is sonja a european trained physician who has returned through a sense of responsibility both to home and to a sister that has gone missing reluctantly sonja agrees to help care for havaa and - in testament to dire conditions - accepts the inept medical help of akhmed who has failed out of medical school and yearns more for artistic expressions thrown together in awful circumstances these characters share a stubborn commitment to hope for individuals and a future that fights against the despair surrounding them with recollections of the past years of the chechen conflict and the constant threat that present friends may turn on them for personal gain with the russians these characters discover their lives intertwined past present and future the novel's title comes from a definition for life given by a medical text dictionary in the novel the term is remarkably difficult to biologically define in one sentence typically biologists will talk of characteristics of life rather than settling on a strict definition but the one here given title is particularly resonant in capturing the essential sum of those characteristics of life they form an interlocking constellation of phenomena individual traits that put together form a picture unique and new with a story similarly like stars each of the characters in marra's novel interact together to form a constellation in this historical space of humanity metaphorically one could speak of a certain balance between the stars in forming a constellation similarly marra's novel succeeds so well because of the careful balance he is able to strike in its construction the shifts in time from chapter to chapter or even within chapters is managed without any sense of rupture or confusion each of the characters is an interesting balance of strengths and weaknesses and even the villains are shown with traits of sympathy and compassion the novel does appropriately stay focused on the chechens the russians in the novels are an outside force of the plot and setting more so than characters and the villains heroes or mixtures in the story are each chechen here the emotional weight of a constellation of vital phenomena could quickly take it into a story that feels utterly bleak marra nicely finds balance here as well with the character's vital hopes and perseverance working to counter the negative and the young havaa in particular offers a bright ray of humor and compassion that symbolizes a certain hope for the lives of a future generation the events of the novel's 'present day' plot consist of a mere five days but a constellation of vital phenomena takes these points to form a picture over decades of conflict personal and spiritual the novel will pass similarly fast while reading but its power and humanity will echo with the reader far longer disclaimer i received a free copy of this from the crown publishing group via their blogging for books program in exchange for an honest review originally posted at http reading1000lives wordpress com","137":" marra's story is set in a small town in chechnya alternating between the 1994 and 2994 uprisings against russia as the story opens young haava's fathered is disappeared by russian troops she is rescued from the forest by neighbor ahkmed a very inept doctor who takes her to a hospital in a nearby town hoping the female surgeon sonja there will help protect her the interrelationships between these characters are very complex they are in fact frequently unaware of the interconnections and wonderfully drawn the story is beautifully written although sometimes the alternating time periods can be a bit confusing the author sometimes writes in an ironic voice that lightens the mood but not by much the difficulty both political and physical and the uncertainly of life in a war region are painful to read about this book has everything going for it but it's so damn depressing it is very hard to read it left me so down i debated lowering the rating but then perhaps that was the goal","138":" devestation everywhere the structure of this book adds to the terror we can see from the start that it encompasses only five days and it soon becomes difficult to imagine what it might mean for things to end well time is stretched and inverts even as our empathy is stretched and knotted after page one it felt like a moral imperative to stay with these characters journey with them and hold out hope for them midway through and to the end it felt like an honor to be trusted with their stories","139":"the story of a young chechen girl and those that help to save her life beautiful tragic haunting book i just loved it","140":"i found this book to be much like hosseini's and the mountains echoed but set in a war torn and ravaged chechnya a young girl havaa hides as russian soldiers abduct her father dokka in the middle of the night but is rescued by their neighbor akhmed fearing for havaa's life akhmed takes her to the local hospital which is subsiding on the efforts of a single doctor sonja sonja agrees to hide her in return for akhmed's help who had been a poor medical student sonja is obsessed with her sister natasha who was drugged and forced to work as a prostitute after sonja went to medical school in london akhmed commutes from home where he is caring for his bedridden wife and worrying about his neighbor and childhood friend who is an informant for the russians my favorite line scrap metal and disappearances our national industries","141":"i truly liked this book the characters were full of surprises and everything just connected in this giant circle the betrayal in this book just shocked me not a book i would normally pick up but so glad i did","142":"a good story but sometimes hard to follow it helped when i read a little about the history of chechnya","143":"i know war is bad and bad things happen in wars but i dont need to read how to amputate a led in gory detail among other things and when the author goes off and tells you what an insignificant character in the book will do in 10 days 5 years 10 years 20 years i didn't care this was a book club for our reading group only one of the group read it all the way through she had some good incite about the book but not enough for the rest of us to complete reading the book","144":"i had to abandon this book i was really enjoying the vividly drawn setting and characters and the humor the author finds amid civil war however the jumping around on the timeline was a poor fit for my style of grabbing a few minutes of reading every few days and i got hopelessly lost this is best read in large satisfying chunks","145":"loved this book very well told and engaging particularly interesting because it provided an excellent portrayal of the struggles in chechnya something i knew very little about","146":"i could never get into this book it felt disjointed and at times i was confused which character the narrator was supposed to be i was happy that i even finished the book","147":"this is an ambitious and beautiful first novel by anthony marra explores how eight people in war torn chechnya live love and create their own definitions of family and honor","148":"some of the best writing i've read all year the author anthony marra is a professor at stanford where adam johnson also teaches johnson wrote my favorite novel of 2014 the orphan master's son and it's clear that the two influenced each other i recommend this book for anyone who does not read lightly it's a thick engrossing novel and you have to be invested to the story's slow arc but i highly recommend it","149":"could i give this six stars","150":" there is such a sadness to this book yet i loved it war is hell on so many levels marra's beautiful writing takes us into the lives of ordinary people and the trauma suffered both during and after years living in a nation in conflict i knew very little about the chechnya region or its people prior to reading and feel i got a glimpse of both in this novel it took me a couple of chapters to engage probably because i was so ignorant of the history in this part of the world but the characters drew me in and there i remained","151":"the writing alone made this a five star book it made me want to read tolstoy a beautiful story about war and family i loved it but i'll need a lighter read to follow","152":"i'm still thinking about this powerful book so","153":"i very rarely don't finish a book but this was very hard to get through not sure how the ratings are so high on this one","154":"i recognize and applaud the sheer genius at work here i just couldn't make it all the way through because the story was so unrelenting in its misery and tragedy it was too much to bear","155":"took me a while to connect to this one but worth the effort story of a small group of people who's lives are overturned by not one war but two in rapid succession in chechenya nothing made sense friends become informants torture was rampant here the good are very good but still human and the weak well don't do so well grim but also touching amazing portrayal of ethnic russian surgeon and her sister take a deep breath and then

takes her to a nearby hospital and begs the doctor to take in the child slowly the author reveals the many interlocking stories that bind all of the characters together the author moves back and forth between the present and the past describing the war and its many atrocities big and small more","157":"a rarity for my book discussion group everyone liked it setting is 5 days in chechnya in 2004 during the 2d chechnyan war chapters set in 2004 were interspersed with chapters filling in background information about the characters fascinating","158":"the most amazing book and unlike any i've ever read the richest character development the most compelling narrative and the most exquisite perfect language a must read again and again","159":"gruesome faith in humanity lost then restored","160":"definitely worth reading though it was hard to read at times due to the topic there were some great characters though","161":" i have mixed feelings about this book it came highly recommended and although the overall book was fine this isn't a book to read in one sitting the story has many characters interwoven through various periods in their life and have survived war ridden times three stars because i was amazed by the author's work to make a tragic time in people's lives beautiful and interconnecting lives but unfortunately the lengthy descriptions of towns buildings people's lack of knowledge i e ronald mcdonald on issues was repetitive making it dull it was hard to keep reading but since it came with high reviews i was determined to finish finish thankfully i did since the last 100 pages of the book made the book worth my time","162":" it took me a while to get into this but i did enjoy it various characters in the novel take turns narrating but it's done in a way that's easy to follow and makes sense for the progression of the plot this also allows the author to slowly reveal that the characters are more connected than it may seem on the surface there were some parts that were hard to read action in the novel takes place during the first and second chechen wars so there are a few rather gruesome torture passages but the novel ends on an uplifting note that doesn't seem forced","163":"a great debut novel by anthony marra loved every minute of reading it but it is not a light read by any means i was heavy hearted and teary eyed when i finished the book","164":"this book is funny sad horrific and uplifting it's the best book containing torture that i've ever read in fact it's probably the only book containing torture that i've ever been able to finish it's that good","165":"this has been the summer for reading amazing books this book winner of the 2014 annisfield wolf book award lives up to and exceeds its award winning status its intricate plot line takes a little work to follow but it is clearly drawn the characters are nuanced with flaws and redeeming aspects the horrors of war and conflicts in chechnya are graphically depicted and require some places in this book to be read in small quantities i have grown from reading this beautifully written novel","166":"first five star book of the year","167":"a little hard for me to get started but really turned out to be a good book","168":" there are debut novelists and then may be after reading him i can safely say that there is anthony marra this is after reading his book \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" and the fact that i could not stop sighing and being spectacularly amazed by most of his writing as the pages were turned the writing does not seem as though it belongs to a debut writer or maybe i am just underestimating debut writers but this one is sure to look out for for one no one or maybe very few people would have heard of the chechen wars before reading this book it was certainly an eye opener for me and i can only thank anthony enough for introducing me to this side of the world as well \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is not going to be an easy read it is not even a happy read as far as i am concerned it has its moments of happiness and then it gets quite dreary what does one expect of a novel told in the time of war and unrest well for most things one expects humanity and marra delivers like a charm with reference to that expectation thereby not only fulfilling but also surpassing it the book passes through or rather is told through a decade - from 1996 to 2004 and speaks of lives that were embroiled during the chechen war with the russian history but of course making an appearance time and again in the book the history of chechnya is long and often confusing anthony marra on the other hand does not give us complete details of the land instead he chooses to talk about ordinary lives and the impact of ethnic strife on them and how their lives change beyond recognition this worked with me as a reader on most levels i guess all readers want to know more of the humane side of the story than anything else and marra most certainly delivers on that one in this hard hitting novel anthony takes us back and forth in the lives of the major characters surrounded by the secondary characters that are equally integral to the plot and structure there is akhmed an incompetent doctor with a big heart and an invalid wife sonja a surgeon who labours each and every day at a bombed hospital and living with her own demons and havaa an eight year old girl who has lost her family and is now about to start a new life centered around these are the other characters that make up the entire concept of six degrees of separation that runs strongly throughout the book the cycle of life is seen through the book - birth changes adaptation movement growth and sometimes death is what holds the book strong marra's writing is surreal and often had me wonder where did the stories come from what is the deal with the plot the title in itself is intriguing and as you move through the novel you understand its importance the novel is intense and deep and yet the moments of compassion are plenty that take you by surprise after all sometimes all one needs is compassion to get one through in times of uncertainty and a war torn land and a heart that needs much more the emotional highs are plenty and that is precisely why i was urging everyone to read this book it may be dark and depressing in places but for me it filled my heart with joy in most places a must read","169":"solid book for some reason i struggled a little with the keeping the characters straight i wanted to like this book more and maybe if i had a clearer grasp of the characters i would have still very compelling in most parts and moving ending","170":"i think it's only natural to have high expectations of a new writer that insists on quoting an old tolstoy story in its introduction an apposite analog might be a yet unknown musician doing a cover of an iconic michael jackson track before a national television audience it had better be good http www youtube com watch v h_aiaw well i think anthony marra has indited a tremendous debut novel that is sure to reward his patient readers i will admit there were a few moments when i thought i might give up on the book despite marra's brilliant passages and creation of indelible characters at particular points the story felt too ornate i am glad i stuck through it because a constellation of vital phenomena is a terrific and highly recommended novel favorite quotes and passages work isn't meaningful just because you spend your life doing it insulting yet witty his nose was long enough to keep the tips of his toes dry in a rain shower entire years had passed when he was rich enough in time to disregard the loose change of a minute but now he obsesses over each one #passageoftime","171":" an impressive first novel very tough to read at times but ultimately rewarding and satisfying war and the normal difficulties of life combine to affect eight different people whose lives are intertwined in complex ways the characters are beautifully realized and marra's technique of suddenly projecting us into the future of any character's life even very minor ones who make only a cameo appearance affirms the view that life will continue and events evolve even in the face of war and violence in terms of depicting chechnya as a place part of what initially drew me to this novel i am not convinced that marra successfully captured it or what life is like there but the novel is moving and well written in any case the same criticism might be made about the characters it seemed to me that they could be placed into another novel set in another location or time but in the end this did not prevent me from enjoying the novel as a work of fiction that illuminates deeper truths about life suffering and our relationships with family both the families we are born into and the ones we choose","172":" absolutely stunning an amazing book enough accolades hard to describe the reasons i think so highly of this book excellent insight into a culture that i know nothing about emotionally hard hitting intertwining of various stories done in a seamless way that reminds me of an intricate dance weaving in and out of various characters lives beautifully written tragic but always with an undercurrent of hope and a sense of the honor and dignity that makes us human ironic that my two 5 star reads this year are both about war and the ravages man inflicts on himself and others the long narrow road to the deep north","173":"this one was awesome not so common perspective that jumps to different points in time and people but all intertwines and leads to an excellent resolution highly recommended","174":"superb if you only read 10 books in your lifetime make sure this is one of them","175":"spectacular this book touched me on all levels wrenched my heart and informed me this first novel is so well written what a gift some of his phrasing was like poetry without affectation a very powerful telling of the wars in chechnya shows the absolute horror of war along with our humanity i loved this book 1 01 14 favorite book of 2013 it broke my heart but at the same time gave me hope gave it to my brother for christmas it will always hold a special place in my heart","176":" this debut novel is about the residents of a small town in chechnya during 10 years of almost non stop war the three main characters are sonja a highly regarded physician - and the only doctor at the local hospital akhmed a not so highly regarded physician and 8 year old haava who is rescued by akhmed after the feds seize her father and burn her house in the middle of the night if i try to explain more than that i'll be writing a novel myself on the most basic level it's about how ordinary people respond to extraordinary circumstances gorgeous writing layered characters and an intricate and well designed plot - i'm pretty sure this has earned a spot in my all time top 10 novels the story is non linear which can be hard to follow but each chapter starts with a timeline showing the year in bold font once you get into the chapter the timeline might jump around but it's usually clear and provides vital understanding of the evolution and relationships of each character as the story unfolds one of my favorite writing techniques is used extensively... informing the reader about something that happens to the character in the future this is applied even to cameo characters making them memorable this book requires a lot of concentration but is well worth it most of the circumstances within the story are horrific but the underlying stoic humor characters i cared deeply about and their tenacity always made me want to keep reading","177":"a difficult story to tell and to read but it is worth reading especially in these times mr maara is very young and has a superbly wonderful talent giving the story up in bits and pieces and pulling it all together if i had purchased the book it would be filled with highlights","178":"interesting how lives intertwine with or without knowing it","179":" review first published on my blog http memoriesfrombooks blogspot com a medical dictionary defines life as a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation according to the author this definition led to the title for this book a six pointed definition of life leads to a six perspective story of the chechan wars as such it is not as much a story of war but of the choices people make to survive as one character says war is unnatural it causes people to act unnaturally haava is the young girl who is born into the war and who has seen her mother die her father taken away and her home destroyed because of the war akhmed is the neighbor and friend who attempts to save haava sonja is the doctor who leaves her life in london to return to chechnya to look for her sister and now runs a hospital natasha is sonja's sister who was left behind when sonja left for london and who is now missing ramzan is a young man from haava's village who has turned on his friends and neighbors and is now an informant khassan is ramzan's father caught between the love for his son and his dislike of the path his son has chosen it took me a while to get into this book perhaps because the main story occurs over five days but the book weaves back and forth over a decade to provide the back story and perhaps because chechnya is not a part of the world that i know as such the book took longer to engage me however once it did i could not stop reading the weaving timeline becomes like lines connecting the dots of a constellation each revelation makes another part of the story clear and gradually an entire connected image emerges the final picture is filled with sadness and horror of war but also ultimately with survival and love a beautiful debut novel","180":"not what i would normally read but somewhere between the middle and the end of the book i was hooked and kept wondering whose story line i'd hear next","181":"enjoyed what a way to look at war and learn some history of another part of the world i haven't ever given much thought to the characters all brought something to thought not a read for everyone but a yes for compassion and understanding","182":"just couldn't get into this book though i did laugh at times it wasn't enough to keep me reading i just didn't connect with the characters","183":"i was really excited to read this book after looking at all the amazing reviews at first i thought i must have the wrong book a slow start and then the darkness got to me i actually stopped ~ read something else ~ and came back if i had it to do over ~ i would read this instead of listen to it it is well worth reading just not easy","184":"although a work of fiction \"vital\" is a dark almost non fictional account of war torn chechnya during the decade of 1994 2004 it is both the author's first novel as well as apparently his phd dissertation - but very literate and well written their citizens experienced essentially the same type of horrors as during the holocaust including being thrown into pits murdered at will tortured including amputations for fun and so on we mainly follow two characters an eight year old girl havaa who was rescued when her father was \"disappeared\" along with their house burnt down and neighbor man akhmed whose relationships with his wife and other prominent characters around town are the main thrusts of the tale his efforts to become a doctor he had former medical training at the one surviving hospital with the one surviving doctor are both heroic and desperate as is much of the entire story now approaching seven decades of life little of which has seen our world at peace we were depressed at the horrors reported herein man's inhumanity is well known and while many readers apparently found elements of humor and hope we were glad when this very sad tale ended","185":"this was a stunningly beautifully written book on a very difficult topic i knew nothing of the wars of the former ussr this novel was certainly an awakening about chechnya and also presumably what happened in georgia and is now in ukraine","186":"anthony marra weaves a beautiful story from a constellation of characters caught in the tornado of two wars in chechnya each character is so battered he offers them in all their brokenness and beauty you hold each with tenderness and don't want to let them go this is such an affecting story with a satisfying finish","187":" anthony marra hits the ground from the first page and doesn't let up this beautiful novel is one of the best debuts i've read and while it evokes memories of the tiger's wife it occupies a larger canvas read from the perspective of an american who has never experienced war's devastation first hand it presents a community determined to survive the three central characters demonstrate a resilience seemingly beyond what humans are capable of enduring americans have not been informed about the chechan wars as completely as the strifes in the former yugoslavia possibly because of the lack of un forces which paved the way for journalists to report those events to the rest of the world so unfamiliar was i with the area i had to look it up in order to orient myself not only with the geography but also with the facts of the wars the devastation of cities such as grozny was as total but did not receive the saturation coverage accorded to other wars but it is the strength of the storytelling that propels the plot and the beauty of the characters marra employs a timeline at the start of each chapter to firmly root the reader in time there is never a doubt as to who is being developed in relation to others in addition to the three central characters an incompetent doctor a female surgeon and an 8 year old girl there is an entire community of characters each of whom could serve as the central figure in a book of their own it really does take a village to save a child a second reading only enhances the strengths of this luminescent novel","188":"an amazing and heartbreaking story of interwoven wives in war torn chechnya a very moving and powerful book that takes you back in time forward in time and into the hearts and minds of the protagonists","189":"not a disney flick i had difficulty getting into the story at first then i started to enjoy it more although enjoyment is not quite the right word the authors swooshy style had a way of making me numb to the atrocities maybe that was his intent","190":"i loved parts of this but found myself putting this book aside often and not just because of the emotional intensity i felt myself frustrated at times by the many digressions the many fragmentary scene but in the end i found that they resolved into a rather impressive whole also holy crap is this a sad book","191":" \"excessive\" is the best description for this critically acclaimed book by first time novelist anthony marra foremost among the work's faults is the unfortunate habit of telling the future history of each character 10 20 30 or 100 years after the end of the story whether meant as a revelation of truth told by an omniscient narrator or the hopeful imagination of whichever character's viewpoint is foremost in a given chapter it's overall effect is to control and limit the reader's imagination such amateurish stuff is usually cut out of novels by a good editor unfortunately this bad habit is one of the few threads that holds the book together the other major fault is a common one for beginning writers too many characters and plot points and no overall theme while i'm sure marra did a lot of homework about chechnya packing everything into one novel two wars wartime medicine 100 years of chechen history gun running loyalty vs informing the nature of historical narratives immigration u0026amp emigration the definition of family the psychology of torture the sex trade etc just becomes too much to weave together into a coherent work with an overarching theme the end of the book which is meant to be hopeful just seems tediously artificial as carefully massaged to a cheerful conclusion as the character khassan's history of chechnya rewritten multiple times to pass the changing whims of soviet censors marra shows promise with his characterizations and descriptive strengths but he lacks focus hopefully his future novels with be more polished","192":" i had to spend a little extra time with this book than i normally would simply because i found myself jotting down quotes left and right and loving loving loving so much of it there are just certain books that cast you into their depths so completely that you come out of it feeling like your life has been fleshed out by it's prose it's paysage there's just so many wonderful things put forth in this book and in them you can hear the author's voice clearly without it detracting from the depth of the characters or plot an instant favorite i can't wait to read more by marra","193":"good story about the impact the wars in chechnya had have on the people who live there","194":" many things to admire about this book but not an easy read note not a beach read do not bring on vacation to sunny locale anyone who is interested in the sad and horrific recent history of chechnya should certainly read this book i admired the author's ability to depict story elements like torture and being disappeared in a way that went beyond the horror of the actual events and focused more on the thoughts and feelings of the victims as they went through this even when the characters were fearful and uncertain they seemed noble and brave perhaps the best example of this is the character of ramzan the village informer when the author finally describes what he went through to become a man that has informed on a dozen neighbors resulting in their torture and deaths you end up while not forgiving him at least understanding and that's quite a hat trick the writing is very good and quite beautiful in places but i withhold a star because there were more than a few sentences or paragraphs where i had to read them several times to figure out what he was trying to say at one point i looked to see if this was a translation from a nonenglish language also i found jumping back and forth between the years was confusing despite the clever and useful timeline at the beginning of each chapter but overall a great piece of story telling that makes you feel just how it was for these characters so get ready because it's quite a bumpy ride","195":"i tried for 2 days straight but just couldn't get into it the story was taking too long to develop and there wasn't anything distinguishing about the characters","196":"tedious too much detail goes back and forth to different years about 70 percent into the book i find myself sort of interested it was hard to get into and hard to keep reading but it was a book club selection and read it","197":"phenomenal writing incredibly sad if you're looking for a pick me up this isn't it if you're looking for a strong meditation on the devastation uselessness and terror of the war in chechnya on which i knew barely anything coupled with excellently written characters then pick this up","198":"loved i've read several good books lately including lahiri's newest one but this one outshines them all bleak and desolate like seemingly all lit set in russia technically it's set in chechnya great character and plot development and i learned a bit more about life in contemporary chechnya too","199":"powerful writing but this book will not be for everyone","200":" these kinds of books are ones i usually pass by they are difficult for me to follow and i often find myself to be somewhat uninterested after a certain point in the story this one was one of few exceptions the title of this book beautifully ties together the message marra tried to get across in regards to people's connections with each other in their lives and about the consequences and future of actions and people the story is rich with enough information to keep the reader in the know but in decent doses that it doesn't come rushing out right away because of my own background and ability to speak russian i didn't have any difficulty with the terms sprinkles across the book though i'm not too sure if that would be the same case with other non native speakers one thing i found rather unique and well executed in this book was the narration and the intertwining of the past present and future the ending is especially beautiful in this aspect the way that marr chose to directly parallel the present day conversation of sonja and haava with their futures giving specific intervals and saying how many years will pass until a certain event will occur with either of them this happens throughout the whole book especially with khassan and the mentions of his manuscript as well as the struggles he endured in his life and dealing with his own son the story line is something one needs to pay close attention to as all the characters are so closely related together it's somewhat easy to lose track or get confused even for a second this book is an interesting and bittersweet coming to terms with life i'd say something i felt i haven't found properly depicted in other books i've read of course this one had its flaws probably the only ones simply being the bumps in the storyline in the parts where it dragged on and forced me to take breaks from the reading yet i don't regret picking this one up i learned something more based on the historical context of this book i challenged myself in reading a book from a genre i'm not too fond of and i was introduced to a cast of characters that stuck with me until the end and i felt emotions and ties with and was sad to let go with the last turn of the page i'll be revisiting this book in a few years for sure it has much to offer and i feel a lot of it will be absorbed with time age and experience i look forward to my future encounters with this one and i'm glad i took a chance with it","201":"this book really stuck with me which is always the sign of a good book to me it was deeply sad and moving and really affected me","202":"despite not knowing a lot about chechnya's history which relates heavily to the story i still managed to feel how the plot went through it golden ending golden story","203":" this book was difficult to read without any background in chechen history or the modern russian chechen conflicts the first third of the book is much less engaging than the later sections the author moves between several time periods and while uses this device successfully to develop characters it does require the reader to pay close attention and to read the book in large segments per sitting rather than in a few pages per night all of the characters are deeply flawed understandably so after enduring decades of war however i did become invested enough in them that i wanted to complete the book and learn their fate","204":" wow what a great read one of those i can't put it down books the author anthony marra has impressive credentials and has put them to very good use i was completely smitten with a constellation of vital phenomena this novel is another entry in the war torn genre set in muslim countries the prose is beautiful the characters vivid and the story line demanding because of the flashbacks and foreshadowing this story will not only take you on a great ride you will find the writing most rewarding and find yourself pondering its demanding dilemmas","205":" this book is not for the faint of heart it was heart breaking and touching and disturbing and beautifully written and gut wrenching warning it is about chechnya and there is a lot of brutality and all the evils that come along with war there is profanity fear torture betrayal but also love and hope and goodness i absolutely loved the letter khassan wrote to havaa about her parents and her birth he wrote your father and i helped your mother climb the stairs when her feet failed we carried her she was worried her hips would crush you even before you were born she worried for you it was amazing to see her love you before you even met perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read what is written for their entire lives even before they met your mother and father held their love for you inside their hearts like an acorn holds an oak tree you were their rain and sun their morning and night you were born within the memory of a kinder past she your mother looked at you as if she had been born to you she passed you to your father the corners of his eyes crinkled his heart had been the acorn now it was the oak tree just so beautiful the story travels back and forth in time but focussing on the events of just a few days and then telling the back story that allows you to understand those few days and to see how the characters' lives are all interwoven how small acts both of cruelty and kindness ripple out and affect lives and change the future how each character's life is connected by threads to the others i also really appreciated the author's note which made me appreciate his writing and all that was incorporated even more i suspect i will be thinking about this for some time to come well worth reading but not an easy read thought provoking","206":"beautiful prose telling the story of a number of characters in war ravaged chechnya while an impressive piece of writing the layers upon layers of tragedy made it hard to read it's rare that i need to take breaks from reading something because it's just too painful but that was definitely the case with this one i would give it 3 5 stars if i could and if you can stomach reading about lives utterly and completely torn apart by senseless violence then the writing here is worth it","207":" i thought this was a truly splendid book i was variously moved and horrified at what mr marra describes whilst acknowledging its a work of fiction in this book and that it occurred in our time i read it whilst the events and horrors in syria were are unfolding and it made me wonder at our ability to inflict such horrors against each other i knew very little about chechnya and its struggle for independence luckily for us mr marra provides us with his reference sources i loved the casual way in which the author gave us an insight into the future lives of the various characters as i often wonder about the lives of the characters of a book and how they might have unfolded i often kiss a book once finished this one left me tearful and grateful to be living in a country that is truly free something we take for granted i have shared this book with friends who love it too mr marra we wait with bated breath for your next work thank you","208":"this book was incredibly powerful and moving the sentences were absolutely beautiful it blew me away repeatedly it was sad but considering the setting and the events around which it centered to be anything less than sad and beautiful would be a cop out","209":"i can take a bleak book prefer them these days but this is depressing in a way that i'm not sure i can glean any meaning from it extremely well written and educational but i'm having a hard time relating to someone who would give up a burgeoning successful professional career and engagement in a first world country to move back to a war torn wasteland and people who don't really care about you all this suffering doesn't seem to have any resolution in sight","210":"i thought this book was well written a little slow moving at first but turned out to be a good read","211":"a few chapters from the end of this astonishing book i suddenly started crying and i didn't stop until i'd reached the last page despite the subject matter the destruction of chechnya and its inhabitants over the course of two wars the book itself wasn't depressing but it was deeply moving and by the end i wasn't sure if i was crying from sadness or relief to say anymore would spoil the ending the main story the one around which the book is structured takes place over five days from the moment akhmad sees his friend dokka being taken away in the middle of the night his mission is to save dokka's eight year old daughter havaa from the feds and their local informer ramzan ramazan's father khassan hasn't spoken to him for two years since he began giving up their friends and neighbors but this doesn't stop ramzan from trying to find havaa who akhmad has whisked away to a hospital or what remains of it in the city here sonja a surgeon does her best to treat a continuous stream of patients with limited supplies and help she doesn't like children but akhmad persuades her to keep havaa he returns to his village daily to take care of his wife ula who is bedridden and befuddled an illness that seems to have no name within these five days we get everything the history of chechnya its wars and fraught relationship with russia as well the history of the individual characters the book continually surprised me not only because i knew very little about the wars in chechnya but i also didn't expect to care i mean i thought i'd care but only enough to get me through the story i thought i'd be dazzled by the research the scope of the book the language the tiny details that took on more weight as the story progressed and i was i didn't expect to be so engaged however with the characters and i'm not sure at what point in the book this happened but suddenly they mattered more than anything else marra creates an entire history both personal and political unlike ondaatje he never sacrifices character emotion for the pretty sentence though there are plenty of ondaatje esque moments in the book in fact marra gives anil's ghost a shout out in his acknowledgements but i think this book is more complete and ultimately more hopeful sonja is as prickly as anil but she comes to life in a way anil doesn't sadly i have to teach the book this term so some of the magic will be lost on the bright side however i get to read it again and marvel at its wonderfulness","212":"this was a tough read because of the suffering depicted especially since a lot of it is based on real events it was an easy read because marra tells the story so deftly a couple of times i thought maybe one of his more obvious devices seemed too showy but by the end he won me back around","213":"beautiful writing but i did not care for any of the characters enough to love the story","214":"this is a unique read and a remarkable debut novel two oddball doctors each with his her own demons protect an innocent child in war torn chechnya the action takes place over only 5 days in 2006 but the back stories cover ten years the characters are well drawn but oh how the bleak and violent backdrop can wear down the reader hard to rate it as the setting is so dreadful but the story quite redeeming","215":"a constellation of vital phenomena has all the elements of a great novel realistic characters with psychological depth plenty of drama and pathos dark secrets a dose of romance humor and great dialog the setting is a war ravaged village in rural chechnya where three childhood friends live as neighbors the novel begins in 2004 with the abduction of one of the friends but we eventually catch up with the past as the narrative moves non sequential time the central focus point of the story is eight year old havaa who is hiding in the woods as her father is brutally taken and her house set on fire the feds are also looking for the child but friend and neighbor akhmed is also watching the scene and is able to rescue the girl and get her to a safe place a hospital where all employees have fled except for one tough surgeon named sonja one elderly nurse and a one armed security guard akhmed who graduated in the bottom 10 percent of his medical school class volunteers to help at the hospital if sonja will let havaa stay there i liked the even non judgmental tone i liked also that the author gives not only a past story for many of the characters but also a future story this novel covers the time span 1996 2004 the length of the child havaa's life but we get to peek into the distant futures the characters who end up having a distant future in a fictional world as dark as this one the very idea that some of the characters have futures feels like a comfort i felt like i knew these people so well it was hard to dislike even the ones i knew i should hate especially because each of the characters has to deal with trauma outside the normal range of human experience some characters are able to maintain their human dignity and integrity and some are not some are able to find ways to cope others lose their grip on sanity my favorite is akhmed the pride of the village a smart kid who went to medical school but then cut a some of his med school units to audit art classes and prefers drawing portraits to amputating limbs i also love sonja's younger sister natasha who finds herself abandoned in a bombed out city when the first war breaks out and then ends up in forced prostitution later while trying to regain her sanity and recover from heroin addiction she reads a medical dictionary that describes life as a constellation of vital phenomena with the warning that this book is scary and violent i would highly recommend it especially if you are not aware of the chechnya situation the author has said in an interview that one of the reasons he wrote the book is because there were no english language novels about chechnya although marra's lyrical storytelling is able to wrench beauty and humor from a dark and terrifying scenario for me the literary value is overshadowed by the horrible reality of the subject matter the ugliness and senseless violence of war forced into prostitution land mine amputations state sponsored disappearances and most vividly torture my instinct is to group this novel with dystopian novels such as 1984 a brave new world and the trial except that this is not a dystopian novel about a hypothetical world that might happen instead it is about something that has happened very recently and we can be pretty sure the same sorts of things are still happening if not in chechnya then in other parts of the world it's hard to assess the pure literary value of book about history that is so chilling and so recent this book gave me nightmares because although the characters are fictional the torture is real","216":"a brilliant debut by anthony marra the war torn area of chechnya is the setting for this historic and heart breaking story of people caught in the fighting between chechnyan rebels and russian soldiers the book requires a concentrated reading to absorb the skillful writing and appreciate how the author delineates and traces the turmoils of its characters","217":"the february 2014 selection for the mostly new york book club wow it is not just that this is such a wonderful

a single question p 267 i came to say good by he thought i came to say hello he said p 289 and it was for the truth rather than the lies that khassan hated him p 290 his pride for what he had done and his disgrace for the consequence were so entwined that he couldn't even tell his father that he had been castrated for refusing to inform on his neighbors p 291 i'm just like you you said you never

which fed into a system of irrigation channels that in earlier times had been used to water the pear trees perhaps as much as half of the oil seeped in to the soil in to the groundwater below but the oil spouted from the pipe in such abundance that no one ever thought to seal the barns with concrete or plastic p 235 no fundamentalist undercurrent ran through the national culture before the first war arab states would gladly fund a war of religion but not one of nationalism p 257 it was well understood among the men that the feds had as much sense as two bricks smashed together it was also

birthmark he remembered so vividly was still there a purple ink spill across her kidney the only part of her that hadn't aged the affair lasted another eleven months until she became pregnant p 294 akhmed had always remember this how khassan had shared his mourning as if he were family p 295 what do i do i know what honor requires but that to my own son with my own hands p 296 but this insistence that she spent her days with his ten years deceased father dispelled hope for recovery p 297 how she knew that and still loved him he ran his fingers through her hair days since he had last washed it and still so clean p 305 working odd jobs and sacrificing the comforts of wife and family he would spend his life caring for the descendants of his mother's cats eight hundred and eighty two all names for his mother though he would never know the exact figure in sixty six years on his deathbed he remember that distant afternoon when the fingers of a beautiful nurse had mine metal from his legs he would remember it as the moment of greatest intimacy he ever had with a woman then he would remember his cats p 317 life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation p 322 owe we're beyond obligation ramzan said we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are and you're right but that doesn't make me wrong p 324 the idea being that your are less likely to go into the woods with the rebels if you know that your house will burn and your family will disappear p 347 to live with dignity meant a premature death p 351 when they moved to moscow they prized their rescued mattress as a happy memory of what life had been like before a band of angry men overly found of facial hair had deigned to liberate them p 365 366 killing his son had seemed less reprehensible than abandoning these dogs p 367 but no life is a line and hers was an uneven orbit around a dark star a moth circling a dad bulb searching for the light it once held","218":"god i loved this book everything from how marra describes the environment to the minute details of something as simple as washing a body is so rich the story tests the limits of what a family is what binds us breaks us makes us i would read this again absolutely","219":"a first novel for this author covering life through 2 wars in chechnya from 1992 2004 very good story very very sad tightly intertwined lives telling the story of how fundamentally good people have to withstand the horror u0026amp brutality of torture brought on by war","220":"this is definitely a book that will stay with me great story touching but very heavy","221":"some great writing u0026amp imagery but too dark ' really some torture scenes were just gratuitous","222":"aughhhh devastating the way the ending was done was absolutely perfect just beautiful","223":"dark haunting and tender this book was everything i wanted it to be marra's writing is both very good and quite unique recommended","224":"this book bounces around a lot in the timeline which when listening to the audiobook makes it particularly hard to follow the author uses some beautiful language and imagery but the various stories of the characters were a little challenging to keep track of","225":"first it blows my mind that anthony marra was 28 when he wrote this book last year his first novel the research that must have been required for this historical novel as well as the exquisite way he used words to describe the characters and the events in this book were just amazing it takes place in chechnya between 1994 2004 and focuses around the conflicts between the ethnic russians and the muslim chechen rebels it is a heart breaking yet beautiful story of conflict betrayal sadness and loss but also of incredible love friendships loyalty and commitment because the timeline for the book goes back and forth over those 10 years i did find it a little difficult at times to focus on what i was reading but the author does help by informing us at the start of each chapter which year he is referring to my daughter once told me that the criteria she uses to give a book a five star rating is if she would read it again i definitely want to re read this book but am also looking forward to future novels by this author lastly if anyone would like to know the meaning of the title my friend paulette explains it in her very awesome review","226":"this just didn't grab my interest fast enough after 100 pages i decided to call it quits for me there was nothing compelling about any of the characters to keep me reading sort of interesting things sure but nothing that made me care enough to keep on reading","227":"a really interesting story about chechnya and the devastation of war marra writes eloquently about people filled with courage hope and desperation","228":"note perfect great chronicle of the history and politics of a place a i previously knew nothing about wonderfully constructed characters beautiful description of the capability of humanity in impossibly difficult situations all loose ends tied up in the end the ending had me crying not because of how sad the book was and it was sad but of the hope it made you feel for the future of the characters","229":"a story about war struggle and relationships but most about survival all the twists and interconnections between the characters were not strictly needed to glue the book together and to me seemed overdone i learnt a lot about chechnya and want to learn more","230":"after reading all the positive reviews i thought this would be a can't miss read the book started with a nice mix of history tragedy humor and human compassion coupled with indifference in my opinion and the opinion of several friends the book starts to jump around and the story seems to go off into multiple directions towards the end i became disengaged and lost interest in the characters that i had originally been very interested in in one word i would describe the book as scattered it is written well and i loved the dark humor during tragedy that is found throughout the book however i felt the book defined average by the time i was done if you are considering reading this book i highly recommend having a character outline and summary minus spoilers handy","231":"it's funny how life plays us in unexpected ways recommend","232":"the themes in this book were lovely but as a personal preference i didn't like the structure or the story that much it was too depressing","233":"i really wanted to like this book especially with all of the high ratings i must've missed something i couldn't wait to put it down","234":"it's hard to describe how good this book really is heartbreaking tough hopeful his storytelling is incredible and his writting is amazing a tremendous debut","235":"good book beautifully written its subject matter though is raw this is a long read that requires the reader to pay close attention to details and to the intertwining of its characters' stories at times i found myself lost in the text and needed to go back several times i listened to it therefore i believe that some of the details of this very intricate story were lost to me i would definitely revisit this book because it deserves to be re read and reflected upon i recommend it","236":"this book kept my attention throughout i could not put this down the characters are beautifully drawn even when that character is flawed even evil i found myself very emotional at the last page because don't we all no matter how cynical we might act secretly want our happy endings","237":"i knew chechnya was part of the former soviet union but didn't know there were two wars and one as recent as well into mid 2000s although most of the book is depressing i mean what can you expect it's a story about people in the war but it is beautifully written and some parts like the conversation between the characters can be quite funny and you forget that they're living through this awful time i think the title really sums up the book this is the type of book that i enjoy reading every sentence on every page","238":"this is the saddest book i have ever read i finished it about three weeks ago and i keep thinking was that the saddest book of all time surely another book has made me sob as much the only one that might compare is bridge to terabithia but i was 10 when i read it and there is no torture also it is pretend a story that is small in scope while a constellation of vital phenomena is fiction the chechen wars were real brutal ended recently and their ramifications are still being felt the national tragedy never overwhelms the personal tragedies of the main characters but you can't escape the feeling that it is a very truthful story even if it is a novel the characters are wonderful realistic and surprisingly hilarious the structure is brilliant halfway through it forces you to empathize with characters you felt happy to dislike hate during the first half i learned a lot about chechnya partly because i kept having to look up places and events on wikipedia the book is life affirming in numerous subtle ways but it is most definitely the saddest book i've ever read","239":"i was told this book is dark bleak having now finished the book i can say this turns out to be true however while the world these characters live in is unrelentingly horrible the characters themselves are full of so much light compassion and even humor this book was a real education on chechnya and it's wars as well highly recommended if you have the stomach for it","240":"i have been waiting for a book like this for at least a year the writing was so beautiful and the characters had me thinking of them when i wasn't reading at the beginning i didn't enjoy the book as much because i was so worried i was missing something given i don't have strong knowledge of the unrest political situation in chechnya once i realized that some basic knowledge was all i needed and the author explained what was critical at a good pace and interspersed with the story i enjoyed it much more i highly recommend","241":"it took me 1 3 of the book to even understand what i was reading and then i finished with my mouth agape it felt like the sun would never shine again like you are hearing the words of the horrors and desolation and you are trying to wrap your brain around it and then it just keeps getting more real this was very well done","242":"wow this is not an easy book to read and it is not for everyone i was not well read on the history of chechnya and the atrocities of the wars it took awhile to work through the reading because i often found myself looking up historical facts on recent conflicts and keeping the characters and timelines straight as it goes back and forth quite a bit through the entire novel this book is sad graphic disturbing and very difficult at times to read however having finished it i can see how why it is getting such good reviews and high ratings at first i couldn't understand why so many details were being given about characters nothing in this book is trivial if you liked kite runner and a thousand splendid suns you will probably like this book it is gruesome depressing and sad yet there remains a sense of hope this is one of those books you won't easily forget","243":"marra has written a compassionate story of war torn chechnya the setting is bleak even the beautifulprose can't mask the darkness but the characters are treated with tenderness and a spirit of hope a stunning assemblage of characters and traits makes this dark story very compelling","244":" i'd give this 10 stars if i could a devastating and brutal story of the chechen war with heart breakingly beautiful characters one character is described by her sister as being complex but really they all are their motivations regrets and humanity are so well developed i can't believe this is a debut novel there's nowhere to go from here also so difficult to accept that this war took place just a few years ago i hadn't considered the chechens worthy of sympathy in fact i hadn't considered them much at all there are always two sides through","245":"this was wonderful i'm not sure i have adequate words to describe all the feels just read it","246":"to quote brett absolutely breathtaking","247":"while i felt these characters and plot had the potential to develop into a great read by page 135 not much new had happened with so much drawn out back story the book just did not take off for me i am stopping there and moving on to something that grabs me more probably a great book but with little spare time to read i need something that i can't put down","248":"i loved avery character they were all so involved and amazing i could not wait to see how things were going to end great read great writing","249":"this is the best book i have read in a very very long time the story is so tragic but some of the phrases marra uses are just stunning i can't remember the last time if ever that a book made me cry but i was sobbing at one point while reading this one just fantastic i can't wait to read more from marra","250":"one of the best books i've read lately","251":"almost too good first timer to be true at times over or underwritten but definitely moving","252":" review of an arc courtesy of edelweiss and the publisher marra's dark debut novel of the turmoil in chechnya felt a little uneven and contrived to me despite all the current hype surrounding it i felt it lacked momentum for the first half and had trouble becoming immersed in the story of sonja havaa akhmed and others the author's tendency to overexplain the destinies of each passing character grated on my nerves making me feel like this was just a gimmick to elicit more emotional response from the reader while these grievances kept the book far from perfect a constellation of vital phenomena did hit some high notes in the blending of morality in characters like ramzan and the grittiness of life in a country amidst war marra does know how to turn a phrase and if he can hone his plot a little more i'd be interesting in reading more from him i'll definitely suggest this for people who are on the waitlist for hosseini's books as the tone and personal journeys are reminiscent of such books as the kite runner","253":" i think i would have liked this book more had it not been one on a string of books i've read lately that were heavy emotionally disturbing books with a lot of torture and mutilation this is set in chechnya and ranges across a stretch of ten or so years which includes two wars the interesting thing about the torture and mutilation in this book is that none of the characters were soldiers and none were involved in any actual fighting or battles all the torture mutilation occurred to bystanders who got sucked into the war on one side or another like the doctors at the hospital who treated the wounds of some rebels resulting in the hospital being bombed or the guy who sells guns to the rebels you don't want to know what happened to him those who stayed put got tortured those that attempted to leave got tortured ordinary townspeople just disapeared and even children were targets so well written signifigant historically fascinating an excellent depiction of modern warfare and totally disturbing","254":"anthony marra writing is so beautiful that you catch yourself smiling while reading about war's absurd atrocities he places you in chechnya and makes you part of the story absolutely wonderful writing even more impressive when you think it's his first book full stars from me for the idea the research the brilliance","255":"i can see why this draws comparison to the tiger's wife by tea obreht what a beautiful story definitely a favorite of my reads this year","256":"an excellent thought provoking read","257":"i can't even begin to describe this book and the tremendous effect it had on me it's about the terrible wars deportations and genocides that happened during the russian chechnya conflict it highlights human nature and its most basic form it shows us pain suffering but also beauty i was brought to tears multiple times while reading this book it shows such raw emotion and shares such an in look on how we survive when there's no hope left it teaches us about a widely forgotten tragedy that hurt so many it's written almost as if it is poetry bringing the stories of three flawed yet unique characters together and showing that life truly is a constellation of vital phenomena","258":"powerful story yet so painful to read","259":" i am still trying to decide how i feel about this epic tale of an area of the world i never knew a thing about until the boston marathon bombings the characters were extremely well developed however the life these people had was so unbelievably depressing it has been days since i finished the book and the characters are still with me something i always feel is a mark of a good book however the guilt and depression i feel over what could have been for these people the lives cut short and the brutality of man is gnawing at me","260":"not my normal genre i'm a huge fan of weird tales lovecraft poe king et al but this book is unbelievably well written the story telling is tight and the setting and characters seem real","261":"loved it it had a great ending all stories condensing at the end to a very satisfying conclusion","262":"not a light read but very well written and an education in what the people of chechnya have been through","263":"i don't believe i have ever read such a heart wrenching book this one will haunt me for awhile i loved the story i loved all the characters even the ones i hated the ending broke my hear but was inevitable it is a beautiful book about the tragedy of being human i will never forget it and i am thankful for it i pray it will change the hearts of many it did mine","264":"oh what a bleak beautifully written book i can't take the bittersweetness maybe i shouldn't have read this in the winter i can't say i liked this book i will say instead that i will be haunted by this book","265":"one of the best books i've read in a long time beautifully written","266":" i do not usually care much for works of the magic realist school but this novel impresses me in spite of my reservations the narrator's omniscience covers not only his characters in the past and present but extends far into the future leaps over geographical distances and wanders through the thoughts of random individuals sometimes the exaggeration in his flights of whimsy becomes a bit distracting that sweatshirt for instance that survived being handed down through six british brothers to land in chechnya a garment of magical properties indeed or even granting russia's high education rates is it likely that a large band of homeless persons in a city park would all have professional or doctoral degrees on the other hand the black eels used for torture i had really really hoped to find that their range does not include chechnya but it does in everyday scenes it is unfortunate that the author has a tendency to seek the ugliest aspect of any moment why is the strand of mucus that remains after the parting of lovers most worthy of note and yet far more importantly than all these small objections the author believably reproduces a landscape devastated by war and internecine violence and the terrible choices faced by individuals in the grip of these horrors his sympathetic portrayal of a man who has become an informant is admirable this is a book that will undoubtedly remain in my memory it is also one that could be read as a warning against advocating the use of force in dealing with conflicts","267":"i really wanted to give this book a fair chance but after slogging through 180 of the 320 pages i just didn't want to read any more it took me forever to get through each chapter i found the story hard to follow and the chapters jump back and forth between different characters and different decades too much work for too little payoff","268":" a wonderfully told and structured narrative about a dark period of eastern european history through the perspective of two doctors working together to save the life of one child whose father was disappeared it's so easy to sympathize with all of marra's character's because of the way she weaves their stories together with her sad lyric prose when everything comes together at the close of the novel there are few happy endings but the book still leaves us with a glimmer of hope at least for the next generation","269":"anthony marra said that he wrote the kind of book that he wanted to read his interest in the chechnyan region was stimulated by spending university time in st petersburg shortly after the assassination of a russian journalist who wrote extensively about the chechen wars novels about the chechnyans don't exist so he wrote one he said he didn't want to write about the policies the history the politics but about the people the civilians the novel opens with on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones havaa is eight years old her father has been 'disappeared' and the next five days of trying to save havaa from a similar fate span the book buttressed by memories and accountings from various times in the previous ten years the story is unwound from different spools and these are picked up and slowly woven together the prose is often graceful and poetic elevating the story above a mere war novel their embrace didn't break off so much as dissipate an exhalation releasing whatever tenderness was briefly held between them his father's hug was an act of precaution rather than love so that if ramzan did not return from the mountains his father would have the consolation of knowing his final gesture toward his son had been one of kindness rather than disappointment marra's often beautiful prose and insightful scenes belie his youth he tweets that despite his 28 years he has a lot of gray hairs some events are described a couple of times each from a different perspective of different characters it is a sobering reminder that one shouldn't be judgmental knowledge of the backstory may change your mind the novel shows immense compassion towards its characters there is also humour frequent and love not schmaltzy and revenge it is after all about life life is defined as a constellation of vital phenomena in the russian medical dictionary of one of the characters a 'constellation' is an apt description of the construction of these events and how they relate to each other in this book life is also very much the successful avoidance of death that is no easy task in this world of double crossing back stabbing greedy careless cruelties so retaining life becomes a phenomenal accomplishment too like this book","270":"marvelous redemption and hope in war torn chechnya read more here http cindy weallfalldown blogspot c","271":" anthony marra's \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is a book that's going to stay with me for a long time i can't explain how insanely good the writing is it's not a book that can be devoured in a night each page has a lot to take in so much so that i felt there were maybe some pacing issues but then i got to the end and understood just how essential every word was this book made me cry and smile and at times feel incredibly uncomfortable it is unapologetic in its honesty and something i'd urge everyone to read amazing","272":" i wanted to quit reading several times and am glad i persevered a beautifully written story about life in a war zone told effectively through different time periods and parenthetically describing the futures for some of the characters as the story floats along this book about war between rebels and the russian army and the terror and devastation is rougher material than i would readily pick i kind of fell into reading this not knowing how brutal it could get but the story of a devoted neighbor who saves a newly orphaned little girl is heart full and introduces such beautiful ideas about life love family and survival that i ended up loving it realizing that this is a modern day war story is horrifying not giving it 5 stars is just due to the brutal incidents in parts that might not appeal to all readers","273":"tragically achingly beautiful","274":"a beautiful story about the interconnectedness of humanity set in war torn chechnya from 1994 2004 this is a book you have to savor don't pick it up expecting a quick read it slowly builds from a disconnected mash of tales from lost souls to an pinnacle of love and loss one of the most important themes of this book is the concept of family fathers and sons sisters and brothers another prevalent theme is art in the face of horror beautiful book","275":" such a tough book to review i think it fair to say that i missed some of the symbolism i did not miss the beautiful and vivid prose the author is an amazing writer who uses words to paint a landscape so complete i could not help but see the ruins of the cities in chechnya and want to weep the story itself is not all sad and the reader is left with hope by the end of the book yet although the story is fiction the reality of life in chechnya is not read review http amusingreviews blogspot com 20","276":"i enjoyed this book and was surprised it took place less than 20 years ago the story spanned a 10 year period and jumped back and forth but the author did a good job helping you navigate through it this is one of those books that you feel smarter after you read it","277":" intended or not anthony marra reminds us americans that we are indeed exceptional--at least in one respect thanks to happy geographical accident--being surrounded by two vast oceans and two benign neighbors--and the determination of a few founders and outnumbered clerics to keep religion from becoming a state sponsored enterprise we americans have taken up arms against ourselves only once in that case the persecuted and exploited minority was the putative cause not the casual victim mr marra's soul searing first novel a constellation of vital phenomena chronicles life death and survival among neighbors in the chechen village of eldar between 1994 and 2004 the decade begun and ended by the first and second chechen wars which followed perestroika and the dissolution of the soviet union read the rest of my review here","278":"this is one of those books that i both loved and hated the topic is a difficult one the inhumanity that man commits against his fellow man and it is explored in some depth but it is also the story of how love and humanity survive even when surrounded by the madness of ethnic war marra is brilliant in the way that he shows a future for a country that seems to be working hard to destroy itself","279":"it really annoys me when i read a book that so many people have raved about and i just don't get it the story was terrible and there is one scene in the book i don't think i will ever forget although i hope i do but i just constantly found my attention wandering the whole time i was thinking i would get to a part that would deserve the high ratings from so many but i guess i missed it i still love the title though","280":"this was emotionally a difficult book for me to read but i'm so glad i finished it was beautifully written and i cared about every character even the ones who might have initially seemed hateful","281":"beautifully written a tremendously talented author","282":"a tragic story of a people chechens depicted through the lives of a few individuals from the darkness of brutality torture murder separation disappearances and betrayal shines the light of kindness sacrifice friendship love courage generosity survival and an irrepressible mordant humor that sustains the characters and the reader experience this satisfying beautiful novel for the revelations in its pages and for the pleasures of its poetry talented audio narrator gives a masterful performance","283":"not a light hearted easy read but oh my a must read one thing though you need to read this not listen to audio it jumps around too much and gets confusing","284":"i loved the way the plot of this book snuck up on me while the whole book is building to the conclusion for much of it you don't realize that and then it snaps together it was a moving portrait of the strength and inventiveness of humanity under the worst of conditions it mixed biblical and epic themes with characters that felt like real flawed individuals highly recommend it","285":"beautifully beautifully written","286":"one of the best novels i've read so unspeakably good i don't even want to say another word but want to hold on selfishly to it's secret gifts some experiences are best left unarticulated","287":"3 5 this one was really hard for me to rate it was a very sloooooow start i wasn't crazy about the first 2 3 the last 1 3 was a 4 the last chapters a 5 marra is a beautiful writer but often gets a bit too heavy handed with details for me it also took a long time for me to get emotionally invested in the characters had marra grabbed me from the get go as he did during the last third of the book i would have loved it","288":" overall it's a well written book it's a story of hope trying to emphasize how even a few committed people can make a big difference in trying to facilitate the healing process of a people and region after several wars have devastated the region it is easy to sympathize with the characters and imagine what they might have gone through marra manages to add a bit of humor to the story in that for example ahkmed didn't do well at uni when he studies medicine and always regretted not having achieved more and now gets his chance when he has to help sonia run the hospital funnily enough he gets squeamish when the first bleeding patient comes into the er and nearly faints haava the little girl that ahkmed rescued from the feds tries to understand how sonia is running the hospital when she should stay at home and be married but also thinks that this might mean that she might be able to have a profession as well she wants to become a sea anemonist she loves sea anemones or an arborist like her father marra gives a breakdown of the events and history of chechnya clarifying the real events for readers who might not be that familiar with the history","289":" this is a very heartbreaking story about helpless hopeless people not literate enough or free enough to change their circumstances they pay for foolish decisions with their lives often when they are innocent decades of war have marked russian chechen history ethnic chechens and russians indiscriminately murder each other islamists force their will upon non believers and enforce it among those who do believe the situation is so dire that betrayal is commonplace people are tortured disappear and are never seen again the cities are destroyed rubble is everywhere poverty reigns disease spreads the injured amass medical facilities are nil law enforcement is non existent and in general chaos reigns when a neighbor akhmed witnesses the kidnapping of a friend dokka who has been betrayed by their mutual friend ramzan he knows his friend is about to disappear and never return taken to the landfill he will be tortured and murdered for a real or imaginary crime there is very little difference in the cause and effect the result is the same brutality and corruption even with circumstantial or false evidence dokka has a child havaa and akhmed rescues her and brings her to a doctor in the only still operating hospital hoping she will take her in and help her the doctor sonja begrudgingly accepts havaa into her care in exchange for akhmed's promise to work at the hospital he too is a doctor albeit one that graduated at the bottom of the class while she is exceptionally gifted sonja is an ethnic russian and akhmed is an ethnic chechen the one bright light in the book is that the two from different warring worlds are able to work together and establish a relationship the connections that knit all of the characters together will become clear as the book draws to a conclusion although the link is not known to the characters themselves they are all united with a common thread through their memories and thoughts their past and their present in the end the disparate parts will become part of a complete whole and even their futures will be intimated sometimes the plot meanders and the timeline wanders back and forth in a confusing manner but the history and the details about chechnya are so thorough and so descriptive that they make up for any shortcomings or confusion that the story might possess this book is a revelation about intolerance deprivation jihad dictators foolish dreams and unrealistic goals in a land without very much free choice let alone freedom a land with little respect for human life or its value in many cases the uneducated are in charge and the illiterate are making the rules their one skill appears to be cruelty and disloyalty the barbarism on all sides in this fighting this attempt even at ethnic cleansing is horrific as torture is the main event and those administering it are gleeful almost joyful at the prospect of hurting someone treachery is the standard of behavior the series of coincidences throughout the novel though perhaps not always plausible serve to bind all of the characters stories together and illustrate the conditions that exist in that war torn part of the world they point clearly to the lack of trust morality and faith they point clearly to a path of destruction the only hope is escape who among them will be lucky enough to find their own freedom","290":"too much back and forth to be an enjoyable book to read","291":"although i am ignorant of the history of the situation in russia during the time span given in the book i did like it it was easy to picture the main characters and the trials they were living under sonja the doctor initially seemed hard and without compassion she was a no nonsense type of individual as the story moved on she was quite the opposite her sister natasha was interesting and altho gutsy at the end she lost her life the situation of the landfill was horrific akhmed and his rescue and care of havaa taking her to a safe place for protection we later found out his reason for overseeing her care the description of his medical education was interesting he was not meant to be a doctor the other neighbor klassen and his son came into the picture andall were found to be interwoven it was an interesting book i liked it","292":"ordinary life in war torn chechnya in the late 1990s and early 2000s this book did one thing i love really well set mood and ambiance it's a dark story but if you're in the mood for some serious reading highly recommend","293":"gorgeous thanks ant for reviewing i think i will go clutch my loved ones a little closer","294":"i don't know how a book can hold so much beauty and so much pain at the same time but this one manages to do it while a book about war torn chechnya didn't immediately appeal to me i am so glad i gave this a chance it may be the most beautifully written book i've ever read","295":"this is the 100th book that i've read this year and it was a good choice a very impressive first novel set in chechnya between 1996 and 2004 marra has a very sure hand for a novice writer and handles the shifts in time particularly well weaving between time periods and viewpoints as he gradually fills in the blanks that he has alluded to and the connections between the characters becomes clear i'd just recently read joe sacco's comics reportage on chechnya in his book journalism so this novel resonated strongly","296":"that was the most heartbreakingly beautiful book i've read in a long time","297":"snoozed my way through this","298":"sad but so beautifully written the story is so beautiful and probably true of all atrocities that despite the hellish war people are living through they remain human and nothing not even war can take our humanness away from us love lust friendship memories etc","299":"a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra 416 pages a constellation of vital phenomena has started to pick up pace in popularity and i can totally see why it follows the story of three major people - sonja havaa and akhmed and many secondary characters that make this story what it is it takes place during the second chechen war over a 5 day span but with the many flashbacks spans a 10 year period oh man this is a book that just sucks you in and once you're done it's a book that leaves you just sitting there trying to take it all in it is a beautifully written book by a first time author the intertwining stories how the author slowly connects all these lives together was really wonderful the last two chapters had me on the verge of tears i don't feel like i can give this book a rightful review because i'm still trying to soak in its entire splendor and probably will be for quite some time i am so glad i gave this book a try after seeing so many of friends give it such rave reviews - it deserves every wonderful rating it has gotten i look forward to what the author writes next although he has quite the tall order to fill just...wow","300":"amazing story one of the best books i have read i will not soon forget this heartbreaking story of love and hope in times of despair","301":"excellenta beautiful yet brutal book i don't really want to say too much about this book except to say that it is stark yet filled with light could not put it down","302":"the writing was heartbreakingly exquisite the story is gut wrenching i didn't know much about chechnya and the suffering there this book makes you so grateful for living in north america","303":" loved this book heard the author on a ny times book podcast amazing first novel the title the definition of life in a medical dictionary a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" it's about a small group of people during the chechen wars 1996 2005 obviously the war is awful a land and culture that is so far away i knew very little i mean very little about chechnya but the characters are so real emotionally the author weaves the story of the characters with each other one of the characters an incompetent doctor who longed to be an artist paints portraits of 41 neighbors who were killed by government forces and hangs them in the doorways and trees of his ruined village the beauty and power of art struck me in this book in a world of medical technology in this country one of the doctors in this story uses dental floss to stitch a patient there is much more to life than numbers on a chart would love to read this book in a book club","304":"this is a phenomenal book i want to give it six stars or shift most of my other ratings down one star brilliant story telling totally gripping makes me want to read more about this region of the world","305":" rural chechnya was bleak in 1996 and in 2004 and the time that marra's characters spend between those periods is soul wearying there is no point even trying to decide who is the most wounded the girl whose father was taken by the government in the night the neighbor who takes her in the surgeon he tries to pass her off to or the old man who paces the village alone in the world but for the son he will not speak to all are broken half people forced through brutal circumstances to conceal the things that are special about their lives and mourn the presumed loss of those things they hold most dear these people were so real to me their want to connect with one another their need to be of use and the fear and confusion that held them back suffused with the longing and sadness of life lived in hard times their basic decency overwhelmed the grave mistakes that they made oh how i love a book that makes me put judgment aside and opens me to new perspectives and compassion some books are so pretty they make me ache and some other books i put off writing reviews for because i just don't want for the experience of reading them to end this book was both of those kinds of books","306":"i listened to the audio version and sometimes had a hard time following the story as it moved from one time frame to another i think some of this may have been due to the narrator who has a pretty bland voice on the whole though i liked this novel of the horrors of the chechen wars told from the point of view of a few people whose lives are woven together masterfully by anthony marra it's an excellent debut novel that will lead to much discussion","307":"the driver had grown up in a mountain hamlet where more people believed in trolls than in automobiles p 109 this book was tragic and emotionally demanding yet the writing was so beautiful and the story and characters so intriguing i couldn't put it down it has the same feel as the tiger's wife by tea obreht but is more substantial and has less of a dream like quality it is not a light and entertaining novel but rather a story that will compel you to continue even when faced with its most brutal and painful moments heartbreaking yet hopeful the book may be difficult to read but ultimately it is worth the effort","308":"my old review got deleted but sometimes it still shows when i changed this to currently reading but maybe that's a good thing because this time around this got a clear five stars","309":" a constellation of vital phenomena a devastating book set in war torn chechnya unfolds with such finely detailed examples of brutality and tenderness that it'll take your breath away i came across anthony marra's work through the best american nonrequired reading 2012 which featured one of his short stories when i saw this novel was on the national book award longlist i knew i'd have to read it the book is tough to read with difficult descriptions of torture drug abuse and death but there are also moments of stunning beauty as the characters reveal the shreds of humanity that war hasn't been able to take from them","310":"unbearably sad but one of the best books i have ever read beautifully written rich honest characters horrible insight into what war does to people communities families it is a must read","311":"this was a tough read it seemed as if the author is first a philosopher because when a character or storyline is introduced he would spent a great deal of time philosophizing about the character or issue at hand by the time the author exhausted those thoughts i would have to remind myself of where he began the book goes backward and forward in time and characters long periods of time available for reading and getting a grasp would be helpful to the reader he provided a very sad and horrible picture of the ravages of war","312":"after 140 pages i quit i so badly wanted to like this book i just couldn't absorb anything even after multiple rereads felt like i was rereading and rereading every paragraph it kinda made my brain feel befuddled and disorganized","313":"cannot believe this is his first book am delighted by his writing style and poetic eye plot was magnificently revealed through constant shifts in place and time characters are unique and memorable yet their common human flaws make them relate able and real feel as though i've learned about an area of the world and the events that have shaped its people that i might not ever have read about had i not picked up this book highly recommended read poignant ending that will not disappoint am already looking forward to marra's next novel i read this in tandem while listening to hosseini's and the mountains echoed which had parallels in major and minor themes would rate this book in a similar way as hosseini's most recent book and as in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner","314":"too flowery","315":"really remarkable book which taught me history not so long ago of things i never even knew i loved how the author intertwined the lives of all of the characters in a really realistic way and also enjoyed how he told what happened even to the smallest of characters in several lines or less a great read","316":"powerful and utterly engrossing be warned this is as depressing a read as i can remember but there are points of genuine hope and even some scattered points of levity fascinating slice of time and place chechnya spanning the period 1994 2004 approx i couldn't stop reading it and i'm still thinking about it","317":" if you've never read a work of fiction about post war chechnya don't be alarmed you don't need to know much about their conflict with russia though a tiny bit of background knowledge is always a little bit helpful point is that you don't need it anthony marra weaves an incredibly powerful and engrossing story about ethnic struggle by focusing in on a universal experience regular human beings trying their best to do their best in a war torn time a constellation of vital phenomena is beautiful the writing is beautiful the flash backs and flash forwards are powerfully well done and well placed and marra gives you entire lifetimes in single sentences not only does he elegantly flesh out characters while weaving their lives together throughout time i'm a total sucker for that but he gives you glimpses into every single character that passes by a hot plate purchased by a character tells you a flashing narrative of a woman who never again found a plate that could cook an egg so well time is handled delicately and with a tension mirroring the loss the novel captures just lovely lyrical torturous at times most literally and absolutely captivating definitely recommended","318":" the is the story of a village in chechnya and the families and friendships that are erroded corrupted and abandoned by cruelties of war but it in this landscape of landmines and ruined dreams there is art relationships loyalty and a quirky little girl havaa a name which means giving of life i finished this book put it on the nightstand and cried for a little bit but it is definitely worth reading both for the information about chechnya the stellar writing and the broken characters who might haunt you for a bit","319":"beautifully written book the subject matter is dark but interesting it reminded me of the leon uris books i read 30 years ago a lot of sadness and tragedy builds to an ending with hope","320":"great story well written","321":"a brutal and phenomenal book a harrowing story that starts with the abduction of one man by faceless authorities and only gets worse i don't want to give anything away but you will find your sympathies tested in reading and where they end up might surprise you also being a dumb american i don't know much about the chechen wars but this inspired me to read up on a it a little and of course notice the scary parallels to the current situation in ukraine it's horrifying that in this day and age people are made to suffer in the name of building an empire for lack of a better term","322":" how disappointing my review didn't save let's see if i can remember it this book did not start out as a four star rating don't know if it was because i was tired when i read it but the jumping around between the multiple points of view and time frames was confusing at first however it was a fascinating slow reveal of each character's story and what made them the way they were that finally won me over everyone's story is intricately interwoven with every other character showing that even the most trivial human interaction has long lasting repercussions i originally knew very little about the chechnyan history this book made me want to go do more research it was very well done and i would recommend this book to anyone who loves complex characters","323":"a wonderful read that blends intimacy of character with a backdrop of the immediate traumatic landscape of chechnya war marra weaves a complex plot set over 5 days but also includes flashbacks over twenty years","324":"this is a modern war novel there is plenty of pain suffering betrayal and violence but wrapped around those attacks on the reader's comfort is a richness and humanity that has been superbly portrayed the complexity of the structure is impressive recommend that it be read during a time of few life distractions in order to more easily develop the big picture understanding of the story i e not during the christmas holidays with a dozen house guests a little background reading of the wars in chechnya might also serve you well but definitely this is recommended reading","325":"i vote for 6 stars just this once marra presents a complex cast of cleverly woven characters just trying to survive their situations the novel fluctuates between two plots the first over a ten year span 1994 2004 and the second plot which is the forefront of the novel spans five crucial days where decisions are made and lives are changed i was impressed with the complexity of it all the grit the human experience the suffering the humor the historical portrayal of war torn chechnyna but right now i cannot even begin to write a proper review for this book i still need to wrap my head around it","326":"a case of the wrong book at the wrong time couldn't handle the dark and depressing the story might try again at a later date","327":"i loved this book and would highly recommend it i could hardly put it down and now that i'm finished i am still going over the characters and the plot and how the different events and people were woven together","328":"it was extremely interesting learning about the russian and chechnya wars i knew nothing about them at all i loved the interconnectedness of the characters and how the story came full circle it was an enlightening and engrossing book heavy reading though but worth it","329":"at first i was a little disappointed in this book because i was expecting a book more along the lines of khaled hosseini's a thousand splendid suns something poetic that highlighted the everyday in the average chechen's life instead this book is more about violence that took place during the russian's occupation of chechnya and how it played out on the ground for some ordinary villagers as well as a russian female doctor but after i finished the book and started thinking on the story more i had have to admit it's really rather a good book really brings to life all of the main characters i e sonja the doctor havaa a villager who loses her family and akhmed the man who saves her by bringing her to sonja i am more of a political person and so have read all about the violence perpetrated on the chechen population by the russians and the various holy war battles by the chechens in response so i think i was accepting more stories along those lines instead the main character sonja is russian and prior to this book i knew very little about russians who had been resettled in chechnya so learning more about that community was fascinating in addition i had known very little about the disappearances of ordinary chechens in an effort to get them to report on their neighbors rather like the disappearances of large populations in various latin american countries so that was quite interesting too the author's rendering of sonja is brilliant i e how daily violence affects those buried under it even if the violence does not happen to them directly highly recommend the book","330":"many other people have eloquently reviewed this book and i don't feel i can add anything new all i can say is wow wow to the language and poetry of the writing and images wow to the intricately woven story and wow to the fact this is a first novel for the writer bravo if you want more information about the book read all the other 5 star reviews","331":"most books are about a who biographies character sketches or a what plot much fewer books are about a where when or why how this is a where when book about chechnya from 1994 2004 it is magnificently done because although the author's main purpose is to give you a feel for the setting he never loses either character or plot the book follows just a handful of main characters in a limited geographical setting but by using a omniscient narrator and one sentence tangents the author is able to convey much more about the impact of the wars on the chechen people beautifully written and cleverly told","332":" this is a beautiful novel and a masterful achievement i wished it had drawn a bit from paul klebnikov's work like politkovskaya klebnikov was a crusading investigative journalist though an american the editor of forbes russia murdered in moscow he wrote the godfather in the kremlin which explored yeltsin's sponsorship of the war against chechnya as a means of suppressing the chechen black marketeers in favor of yeltsin's own gang leaders and conversations with a barbarian i think available only in russian but i'm sure marra could have had it gisted in which klebnikov profiled a chechen rebel ie gangster leader politkovskaya whose work provided much of the inspiration for a constellation and klebnikov were colleagues and i'm sure their work cross fertilized i think a deeper understanding of the rebellion and its repression as being primarily about mafiya warfare would have helped this book my main reason for the 4 vs 5 stars though is that although every historical novel is written by someone who wasn't there i do think this book suffers from a lack of there ness i sometimes felt as though i were in a pocket world there were these buildings that were illuminated a house a hospital there were vehicles usually trucks and sometimes there were tunnels that opened up going from the hospital to grozny was done with care a couple of stages on natasha's journey to italy i knew there were forests with beech trees but i didn't really feel as if i were in a forest i didn't smell it i didn't feel surrounded by forest it seemed to start behind a house so the landscape didn't feel like a character to me the way it does in a russian novel or in many american novels it felt like an afterthought or like something attempted drawn in like natasha's windowscape i also felt a bit manipulated regarding the characters they were all so good even when they were flawed and even the bad guy had his reasons the only real bad guys were some of the russians on the peripheries even the gangster was a nice guy to his villagers and to his hated brother alu humans are basically good that's the message on the hammerhead so why does this shit happen cuz there are russians in the world cuz russia is full of people like ramzan who didn't get what they needed in childhood this is a plausible explanation i would have liked to have understood the role of religion in these people's lives marra makes it sound as though some of the rebels and hillfolk are more fundamentalist but the people in our immediate circle as readers are fairly secular they're about as muslim as the average american easter christmas christian is christian it seems which i don't completely buy why not have the characters discuss that there are ethnic russian and ethnic chechen characters russia is the kind of place where people are used to having heavy conversations around the kitchen table they don't avoid those topics the way we do why not have them have a religious debate while cutting off someone's leg in the hospital or something it's nice to help americans understand chechens but not if it paints a portrait that chechens wouldn't recognize i'd like to know if this picture of chechen religious life is accurate perhaps it is but again i'm left wondering is this chechnya or is it an idea of chechnya and its inhabitants that marra thinks i'll find palatable and approachable still phenomenal writing and a world worth spending some time in as long as you don't surrender to it too completely and leave room for alternative ideas of that place and its people i await some native representations","333":"excellent reviews is what drew me to this book the writing is beautiful the story haunting i just wasn't very excited by it i didn't look forward to reading it each night i can't put my finger on why","334":" i don't know much about chechnya or the wars that occurred there in the last 20 years but this book is about all wars especially the ones that are fought on one's own soil and not thousands of miles away that you watch on tv how the unspeakable small horrors and profound small kindnesses invade your village your home your mind and leave you with an essence of the vital phenomena of life the story covered the years between 1994 or so and 2004 and concerns itself with disappearances trafficking orphaning intrafamilial betrayal and loyalty exile and running a hospital meant for a staff of hundreds with only six it veers between different time frames but since its cast is only half a dozen people it is not hard to follow the author lets you discover the relationships between the people and the events that shape those relationships in an inferential way which i found engaged me in the story more plus he has some wonderful phrases two infinities bookended her thirty five years for example i was sad upon finishing this book","335":"unaware of a constellation of vital phenomena cvp until the much deserved bookbrowse and goodreads 2013 book awards were announced and certainly glad i check on these received this book from bookbrowse in order to participate in the website's book discussion my rating is not influenced by this immensely enjoyed cvp rate it 5 stars a rating i've not bestowed to a contemporary book for nearly a year one huge endorsement is that i put this novel on my goodreads \"reread shelf\" which mainly holds classics and another is that i judge it to be a great choice for book clubs for me cvp's strengths included its beautiful prose character development unique take on what could have been yet another \"political war story\" and interweaving story lines which were successfully completed by the book's conclusion my one criticism is that it took me a while to become fully engaged with the novel due to my lack of knowledge about chechnya and the considerable detail about the multiple characters a sign of cvp's success is that it motivated me to seek out additional knowledge about chechnya after finished the book have recommended cvp to everyone in my large circle of bibliophilic friends and family with the advise to read about chechnya in advance and be patient for their literary reward also this novel's story and characters were in my thoughts long after i finished so cvp became a topic of conversation with my non reading friends","336":"i loved the subtle interplay between the characters and the gentle way in which their lives intersected i learned a great deal about yet another war but this was not a book about war it was a book about the affirmation of life above all else","337":"a beautifully written book that's extremely well constructed the kind of book that makes you hate and love humanity at the same time a heart breaker","338":"this is a beautifully written story about two doctors who try to save the life of a 10 year old girl who has to go into hiding from the army in chechnya the writer has captured the feeling of daily life in this war torn country in amazing ways and created characters i really came to care about and didn't want to leave most of the story takes place in half destroyed hospital with a woman surgeon who is the only doctor left to deal with the wounded and a small village nearby where a trained doctor joins her whose talent resides in his art not his training this is one of the best books i have read in a long time and one i will read again","339":"i thought this book needed to be about 100 pages shorter i may be a plot hound but i had trouble with the back and forth on the time line and ended up skimming pages to get to some movement that being said it is wonderfully written and the character development was satisfying","340":" i wavered to give this a four star review because it was a bit slow to start even though it begins with russian soldiers taking away a father and leaving a young girl alone which should be a great start to a novel right however i had a bit of trouble in the beginning jumping with the author from year to year and remembering what i knew about each character at that point as we jumped in no order though the decade between 1990s and 2000s however this novel is compelling and keeps you moving thru the plot in order to piece together what the hell happened to these characters also how many times does one read about chechnya and it's wars for independence from russia in fiction like never after watching out his window as his friend dokka is taken away for torture during the night ahmed tkes dokkas daughter havaa to a local hospital at which he had heard of a doctor there who he hoped would save this little girl from being captured and killed many characters with many histories each character is well drawn and reveals dark sides and lovely sides of themselves thru the course of the book this story is very similar to the idea behind six degrees of separation in that each character has had contact with the other in their pasts knowing it or not once you get used to the time period jumping around this tragic story of selflessness selfishness self preservation and self discovery will blossom into a very good read","341":"when i've thought about war prior to reading this book i've focused more on the why of war than the who and how of warfare this book presented me with an entirely new angle though what happens to the average citizen when a war erupts in their very own backyard the novel follows the inter weaving lives of several people but the many comments about certain aspects of their lives that will be taking place in the future disrupted the experience of the here and now for me","342":"this book wanders back and forth through time so many times that you feel like you've been spun around blindfolded and don't know which way you've been pointed though the ending is memorable i'm not sure getting there is worth it","343":" you know those horror movies where a group of kids is picked off one by one by a serial killer i don't watch those because even though i know it is make up and movie tricks i can't stand watching what seems to be real fear on the face of the teenagers and real demented zeal on the part of the killer as victims are 'dealt with' in assorted gory ways this book is that movie except the killers are uniformed russians and the teenagers are starving war weary adults so less chase scenes ha if you found that funny you may enjoy the kind of comic relief marra provides to lighten the grim subject matter i found much of it distasteful because - try as i might - i could not overcome the fact that this is a 20 something year old american who having traveled through eastern europe and studied up decided to transform chechnya's bloody history into his ambitious work of fiction what makes an author qualified to write about another country's devastation it's a fair question that i can't answer i just know that as neat as a plot marra laid out as nice as i found some of his writing the characters did not read as fleshed out humans to me let alone chechens and the observations of culture seemed distinctly like the things an american would find interesting for example the influx of manchester united used clothing i feel that this is a talented author who stretched too far on this novel luckily for the author mine is the minority view","344":"though a novel the vivid description of life in chechnya during the two wars in the late 1990s was well researched eight main characters and how their lives intertwined during these two brutal wars people went missing and were killed the author describes the individuals thoughts and stories the story goes back and forth between the years of 1994 and 2004 and sometimes it was hard for me to follow but all in all i enjoyed the book","345":"excellent writing but seriously disturbing subject","346":"anthony marra loves words the way some people love red wine he sniffs it plays with it swishes it around in his mouth let's it sit on his tongue and then finally swallows his metaphors were so engaging my husband had to highlight them as he read the book with a blue pen the margins are full of his smiley faces and exclamations besides loving the authors use of language i was interested to reads about chechnya a region i knew so little about i started by looking at it carefully on a map to ground the story my understanding of the military conflicts was limited to the headlines we all read in the news this novel clearly explained the players the stakes and the innocent victims laid waste by decades of fighting","347":"if i could give zero stars i would","348":"nothing in this book really grabbed me the story line was interesting enough it's just hard to justify pushing myself to finish a book when i have a hundred other books i've been dying to read lying in the pile to each his own i guess","349":"this is a very moving book in a similar fashion as the kite runner so many horrifying tragedies that the characters seem able to endure by some miracle and to continue on with their ruined lives the writing is captivating the story is sad and i learned a lot about chechnya reading this book was an altogether satisfying experience","350":"only one other book in the last 10 years has brought tears to my eyes there were passages in this book that were extremely painful and tragic but also passages that were beautiful and funny","351":"phenomenal engaging and so wonderfully written there is a new treasure every few pages marra unfolds a very human story within the insanity of war creatively etching the outlines of heroism frailty and compassion among a small cast of characters this is literature","352":"perfect for a book discussion this book is up there with the kite runner or cutting for stone epic great characters moving story emotional without being manipulative and still fun to read the library book club i facilitate read this and the author was gracious enough to call in and answer our questions deserves a much wider audience","353":"this novel completely overwhelmed me it's a powerful read that evokes a wide range of emotions my heart was drawn to each of the characters and the country of chechnya","354":"beautifully written sad sad story","355":"it's probably unfair but i'm rating this book 1 star because i cannot even get through it i've been reading for 4 weeks and i'm only 65% of the way through i tried i really tried but i can't finish it thus far there wasn't enough character development for me to care about any of the characters there is really no plot i give up","356":"i appreciate a book that is out of my normal preferences otherwise the writing was not my style and i just couldn't connect with any character in the book i was looking forward to the end which isn't a good thing","357":"this was a wonderful book i did not really know that much about the chechnyan wars but this book encouraged me to do some additional reading the prose is beautiful and the story both heartbreaking and uplifting","358":"i got a little confused about who everyone was","359":"real good book it held my attention i was hoping it would have cover more of his life after the resurrection","360":" a devastating life affirming book the writing is beautiful weaving back and forth through the stark landscape and deprivations of war torn chechen in its portrayal of a tiny village after the return of the ethnic chechens from forced exile in kazakhstan through the two wars between feds and rebels the brief dips into the future lend it a surreal atmosphere and its characters are heartbreaking in the immediacy and vividness of their struggles to survive while they weigh the costs of survival","361":" this is one of the best most complex intense books i've read in a really long time the way the characters plot lines and overall story is woven together is truly masterful the subject matter the chechen wars was totally new to me and made me want to learn more about this tragic period of time i loved how the author starts with an event and then slowly peels back layers both before and after the starting point to answer questions bring the characters together and envelope the reader this is certainly not an easy read but it's written beautifully so i don't mean that as a criticism it's just not light but not overly depressing either i haven't yet figured out how to articulately describe the book's impact but if i do i'll let you know","362":"i'm really looking forward to more of his work","363":" this book has a heck of a lot of five star reviews so what do i know i liked it but definitely wasn't blown away by it i've read lots of other books about the horrors people suffer in other parts of the world during periods of political strife this one just didn't strike an emotional chord in me it should have horrible things happened i just didn't develop a strong emotional connection to these characters i also didn't come away from this book feeling as though i knew a whole lot more than i did before about the russian chechen conflict","364":"amazing beautiful yet heart breaking story i absolutely loved this book and it is now one of my favorites i didn't know much about the russian chechnyan conflict which made the book that much more interesting i like that marra did not try and educate his readers with the politics of the situation but relied on his characters to convey the direness of the situation i can't say enough good things about this book just that i highly recommend it","365":"wonderful and brilliant book prosaic and evocative never enjoyed a book more","366":"sorry to finish this book beautifully developed characters and well written story","367":"one of my most favorite books ever a heavy plot yes but an absolute delight to read breathtaking 10 stars","368":"a book with a spare painful and beautiful aesthetic it takes a while to recover from reading it","369":"a difficult book to read but well worth the effort the reader lives the horror of the chehneyan war and the destruction of lives as well as the attempt to save a life interesting characters dense rich prose this is not a book to read quickly but rather a book that causes one to think in new ways about the utter sorrow that is war highly recommended","370":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a beautiful and heart wrenching story of betrayal friendship and love set in chechnya in the years following the fall of the soviet union this is not a book that relies hallmark sentiments good people are betrayed and disappeared the powerful take advantage of the disadvantaged but there are also moments of humor and humanity and the writing sweeps the reader into this gray wintry environment as if s he had joined a tropical cruise this is an outstanding book a novel for those who would have preferred less magical realism than tea obreht brought to the tiger's wife","371":"not quite a four for me i am rounding up though the subject matter is thought provoking and the book achieves some elegance and balance in the end but it felt a little clumsy and overwritten in spots and the timeliness were sometimes herd to untangle i am still not sure how i feel about the glimpses forward into the future that arise unexpectedly sometimes they felt enchanting other times contrived","372":"good book interesting my only problem is that it is taking me so long to read a book right now that i am basically bored of the characters story etc before i finish","373":"well written heart breaking story of ordinary village people forced to live thru the brutality of exportation from their homeland a return followed by two wars and then an existence with little food a broken infrastructure and betrayal of childhood friends the humanity of these characters keeps you rooting for them until the end","374":"fantastic book full of vibrant characters beautiful language history and observations on what it means to be alive highly recommend","375":"this was a much harder read for me than what i normally read sometimes though i like the challenge to actually learn something which i did this novel was so sad and i was not even aware that wars were taking place in russia and chechyna and what people were going through back in 1999 2000 so for that alone i thank the author anthony marra for opening my eyes the characters will haunt me for a very long time what was most difficult for me was the words in russian chechyna had he had a list of those words in the back of the book and their definitions that would have been helpful also the names were very difficult to pronounce i can understand why this book got such high ratings read it learn about this time and place you will close this book and really come to see how lucky we are to live in america","376":"a heart breaking story beautifully written as painful as it was i needed to know what happened to the characters as marra led me through this fictional minefield","377":"beautiful rich writing sometimes hard to read but important","378":"wonderful novel that illuminates history through its effects on fully rounded characters","379":"this is the kind of interwoven story of eccentric characters that i often really enjoy there was just enough background on the chechnya conflict to make the tragedy of these characters inevitable and the glimpses of human goodness all the more amazing","380":"i had a difficult time with this novel probably because i expected to love it to the moon and back and i am not even sure i liked it i definitely appreciated it - i learned about a war that i am ashamed to say i knew little about i felt deeply for these characters and the atrocities they were forced to endure and i thought marra's writing was just gorgeous in its stark simplicity ultimately i found myself staying at arm's length from the novel though and i don't know if that's because it was just too difficult for me to wrap my emotional brain around the few times i'd picture myself in this situation were enough to make me a blubbering mess so i had to turn that part of my brain off while reading the book i don't know i liked it but didn't all at the same time does that make sense even a little bit","381":"this is a great first novel by a young man who has all the great credentials and has won many awards for this book about war ravaged chechnya he lives in our area and i invited him to speak to our book club in april just terrific","382":"amazing first novel...","383":" i have very little to add that others haven't already said this is a beautifully written book that rewards taking your time i agree with others who have recommended a quick read about chechnya to have some historical perspective on the events in the book anthony marra does an excellent job of weaving back stories into the present so that the characters unfold gradually layer by layer shifting your perspective of good and bad there is a lot of gray regarding people's actions and how the stress of wartime causes people to behave or do the unthinkable despite the heavy subject matter the ending provies hope","384":"i read this book in one sitting i enjoy this genre and setting even though it is usually gray in tone feeling and overall atmosphere i am a big fan of the arkady renko series from martin cruz smith and this book is written in a similar tone and style there is not much to be happy about in the story itself but the story is told in such a way that i was fully invested in the outcome the ending was perfect and did not alter the integrity of the story","385":"i don't have words i have lost the capacity to do anything this book has taken my soul","386":"this one was incredible sad tender hard and great to read blew me away","387":"beautiful and haunting","388":"this is a very good book as you can tell by the ratings however for some reason i kept felling asleep and getting a bit lost in the story it was well written but i didn't enjoy it as much as i thought i would","389":" this is a stark gripping novel about the 1990 chechnya wars when 8 year old havaa's father is dragged off by russian soldiers her mother died earlier her next door neighbor akhmed hides her in a nearby barely functioning hospital sonya the dedicated and over stressed russian doctor who spends most of her days sewing up patients is reluctant to take havaa in but recognizes that this is her only chance of survival akhmed a failed doctor and would be artist he paints portraits of 41 neighbors killed by government forces and hangs them in doorways and trees of the ruined village helps sonya obtain black market equipment and reminisces about havaa's parents another villager ramzan a lonely isolated man once brutally tortured has turned government informant to obtain the insulin needed by his diabetic father khassan a noted writer who in turn refuses to speak to him some sections are too long but overall this is a haunting heartbreaking but hopeful book","390":"this is one of those books i was glad i read the old fashioned way at some point the frequency of beautiful sentences became too great and i could no longer resist the urge to underline the author mentions in an interview at the end that he re typed drafts of the novel four times from first to finish because re typing mimics the original act of creation it taps into whatever creative well the sentences first rose from and you can tell by how easy the author makes it look that each word has been pondered and finally decided upon i am dwelling on the beauty of the writing only because i think it is through the writing's uniqueness that the author is able to convey this war time story of russia's invasion and occupation of chechnya beginning in 1984 in such a profoundly touching way by touching i mean the presentation of a thoroughly and carefully researched historical reality that is transformed by the imagination into a recounting of events and characters that affects the core part of you that which makes you human by allowing you to see and feel what it is to be human the uniqueness of this story is that it is sad in a deeply hopeful way you read it and you get a glimpse at how joy is as they say different from happiness how joy can exist in the midst of suffering while happiness cannot most of all i liked the humor the give and take of these feisty quirky characters that for some reason were never instructed by life on the benefits of self pity i leave you with a line i underlined describing one of the main characters feelings for his invalid wife the author says care taking had refined his passion once as raw and combustible as crude oil into a dimmer longer buring love a sense of what this dimmer longer burning love is like is one of the novel's gifts to the reader","391":" if you read as much as i do or even if you don't you're bound to come across a book that is hailed by literary critics and readers as one of the greatest things ever but no matter how much you try and read it and are determined to love it it just doesn't click for you i know that happens most often with the classics but it certainly happens with regular fiction and nonfiction as well anthony marra's debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena is such a book for me reviews have hailed it as everything from brilliant and haunting to a flash in the heavens that makes you look up and believe in miracles one reviewer even said this book restores my faith in the future of the novel all over again one day in a snowy village in war torn chechnya eight year old havaa hides as russian soldiers abduct her father dokka in the middle of the night their kindly neighbor akhmed fears the worst when he sees the soldiers setting fire to dokka's house as they take him away but he rescues havaa from her hiding place fearing she will be discovered akhmed takes havaa to the local hospital abandoned but for one doctor sonja who alone with the help of one cantankerous nurse has been treating all of the victims of war and illness that enter the dilapidated hospital's doors akhmed who was a medical student at the very bottom of his class promises to work as a doctor with sonja to ensure havaa is provided for sonja comes with her own set of issues most notably her sister natasha who has continuously disappeared and reappeared in sonja's life but has been missing for some time and akhmed is caring for his own bedridden wife and worrying about his neighbor and childhood friend who is an informant for the russians but sonja and akhmed forge a reluctant partnership one which opens both of their eyes to the surprising connections that tie them together for me while there's no doubt that marra is a tremendously talented writer who has created some memorable characters and some beautiful sentences this book just didn't click the way i hoped it would it's a very dense story--in order to give gravity to his narrative marra packs a great deal of chechen history and details that seemed to run on for far too long the book takes place over a 10 year period and switches perspectives frequently and abruptly and although he weaves all of his storylines together at the end before that point i wondered why he spent so much time dwelling on certain details about secondary characters i'm not usually an outlier in this fashion i usually like books more than others so if the story and people's reviews make this book sound like one you think you'd love have at it and then perhaps we can discuss what i'm missing","392":"painful and absolutely lovely","393":"so well put together evocative and compellingly structured without seeming overly neat a real accomplishment that i hope will be followed by many more","394":"excellent book learned about chechnya and the writing was very interesting thought provoking the ending very good","395":"one of the best novels i have read in a long time incredible","396":"i am ashamed to admit that i knew nothing of the war between chechnya and russia except that it had occurred i can't put down my thoughts on the story there are so many and they are jumbled i think the author did a great job with his characterizations the book was complicated and simple there were moments of horror and moments of levity i think this story will stay with me for a while i read it on an e reader and i plan on getting a hard copy for friends who ask me for a recommendation i know the title is off putting when it is explained it makes more sense","397":"well written powerful novel about family friendship and betrayal i felt drawn to each character and found the story interesting and informative i loved it","398":"i learned a lot about chechnyan history from this novel and it provoked some interesting discussion about human nature the author is particularly deft at interspersing moments of bleak hopelessness with a sparkle of wit and creating lovable characters who have terrible personality flaws","399":"i'm usually skeptical of tearjerker novels about wars in faraway places barely disguised rundown of the local politics and history from the eyes of an objective and enlightened foreign writer in the form of a novel but i'm glad this novel mostly limited itself to the human side of the story and how extreme suffering shapes emotions and morality","400":" looking at the reviews i am clearly an outlier by not loving this book and bending over backward to write a review of effusive praise so let me express a few quick thoughts 1 there is an excellent 200 page book trapped within the 400 pages here this is not a comment about the length of books as 1q84 is more than twice the length but flowed at at least twice the pace it's a comment about this book some stories are stronger than others but others get lost in the mix 2 a lot of the reviews below seem to give bonus points to the author because they are learning about chechnya there are much better places to go to read about the horrors faced by the people in this region for example non fiction i read fiction for the stories not for historical facts i read umm non fiction and history for that there are some good stories here but the non fiction i've read is stronger 3 other reviews comment about how marra is an excellent lyrical writer he falls into the genre of it's poetic if it uses 100 words to describe something that could be said in 25 a book more focused on their lives would have more punch and be more interesting there is a place for long lyrical poetic pieces this book isn't it clearly i'm in the minority but this one didn't really win me over there are some great moments in this book but all in all it's not a top 10 book","401":"certainly one of the most beautiful books i've ever read the setting and the characters leap off the page and into your heart and head overall this is a story of war a love story and a story about the human capacity for cruelty and kindness","402":" at first i thought i would really love this book i had heard so many good things about it there were aspects of it that i did admire but ultimately i think it would appeal more to fans of the book thief and or the kite runner two books that i did not appreciate as much as other readers if i could pinpoint any commonality between these three books it is a strong sense of portentousness both in subject matter and in the writing style this book was like a litmus test on how much a reader can take of heartbreak and injustice","403":"incredible","404":"brilliant writing i see a pulitzer in this author's future the story is desperately sad as many in war torn areas can be it takes place in chechnya where rebel forces are brutal and no one seems untouched but people are surprisingly resilient a hard read but definitely a good read","405":"yet again i am left baffled by the glowing reviews and the hype this book proved tedious convoluted and an insomniac's dream there was no plot at least not a discernible one for the majority of the book there are tedious long winded entries of characters that end up giving little to the overall book there is repeated foreshadowing in the variety of in seven years he will become a insert profession here and mind you these little inputs added nothing to the main characters or the story overall simply stated much of the book is superfluous t e d i o u sthere is nothing to distinguish the chechen wars from any other war don't expect to better understand chechnya or the chechen wars after reading this do expect to feel like you've wasted your reading hours the writing was annoying especially the author's love of entire paragraphs composed of a single sentence sometimes they featured a semi colon why that is almost two sentences no thank you mr verbosity i do not need lists of what the human body is composed of to pass the time reading this adds to the book really i chose a quote at random if you like this sentence you may like the book khassan was studying the sheet of paper in his hand where in the fifth sentence of the second paragraph in the gap of a missing comma he found the sorrow of his life i won't miss this book","406":"i really thought i would love this book but something was missing for me marra is certainly a talented writer but the plot was slow moving and a tedious read overall","407":"great book i enjoyed it immensely my favorite part about this historical fiction about the war s in chechnya is how all the characters fit together in ways that you don't anticipate or expect lovely story wonderful characters great great book","408":"a powerful novel of love devotion attention and grief set in the so far two wars in chechnya a truly tangled web of both russians and chechens and the missing and the absent two doctors and a young girl are at the heart of a story that is way too intricate to sum up in a single sentence other than to say that in ways we can not imagine the universe is linked together marra writes achingly beautiful prose and crams centuries of history into a 5 day period with virtuosity i loved this book","409":"3 5 stars i appreciated the brief moments of joy and healing amidst the tragedy and the connections among the characters the first 2 3's of the book were difficult to read mostly due to the harrowing descriptions of the effects of war and destruction","410":"on a scale of 1 to 5 stars this is a 6","411":" so this book is brutal through and through if you're looking for a fun beach read this ain't it i don't know anything about chechnya and to be honest i had to look the exact location up on a map and i can say for sure that it's not in my top 10 list of places i want to visit or top 100 but i feel very strongly that one of the whole points of reading is to experience a different culture and gain empathy for situations outside our comfort zone this story definitely achieves both the story takes place in 5 days but the route taken in storytelling is anything but linear at one point near the end the character natasha describes feeling as though she has spent years orbiting toward a particular event that pretty much sums up the way the story unfolds an orbit with no clear beginning and multiple rabbit trails thrown in for good measure it's dark and brooding and depressing as hell but there is hope in a child of course and for that i was grateful","412":" 3 5 i liked the ending but the story felt incomplete it was as if the author tried to convey too many pov which is a great idea and can add more texture to the story but no characters were layered enough to evoke a sentiment of attachment in the reader i remained stone cold to some of the characters that shoulve tugged some heartstrings such as havaa natasha's story arc kept me interested but i wish we could've learnt more about her i think that if i had read some background info on chechnya prior to reading the book i would've been more captivated by it","413":"this devastating novel about loss and remembrance is so brilliant it hurts set in the bleakness of wartime chechnya it tells the intersecting stories of eight year old havaa who watches her father captured by the feds and knows nothing but war her complex neighbour akhmed who comes to her rescue and the traumatised surgeon sonja who is an ethnic russian holding together the region's only hospital the plot is a masterful slow reveal which gradually makes sense of itself and had me gasping audibly in places i was utterly convinced by this world where houses burn and unexploded shells are covered by soviet toilet bowls and either physical or psychological trauma might kill you but where little girls still learn to juggle and dream of finding sea anemones it is gruesome and sad limbs are amputated bones are put in suitcases children die women disappear into sex trafficking and nameless refugees come and go yet somehow it is not without light and warmth one of the best novels of the year","414":"tragic touching uplifting and sweetly funny one of the best books i've read in a long time it reminds me very much of the book thief in the way that during very violent and difficult times while surrounded by death suffering and evil everyday people can do extraordinary things in the name of love it is about family and how that term can mean many things it is about love and loyalty whether to your parents by carrying their bones in suitcases hundreds of miles back home to bury them or by doing everything in your power to find safety for a child or comfort for a dying neighbor i cared so deeply for all of these characters for sonja the outwardly tough doctor who works to save lives under horrible conditions but who suffers quietly over the disappearance of her sister natasha for akhmed who desperately wants to find safety and protection for havaa his neighbor's 8 year old daughter and who continues to take care of his invalid wife under very difficult circumstances for kasshan who wrote a huge book about the history of the chechen region which he cannot get fully published and who still suffers from the loss of his one true love and the disappointment of a son who cannot live up to who he wants him to be i can go on and on by the end of the story we see intricate interconnections among all of these characters with both tragic and life affirming consequences","415":"book beautiful and sad libro bellissimo e tristissimo thanks to netgalley crown publishing group and random house for the preview","416":"a beautiful heartbreaking story of unlikely relationships forged during war","417":"a story of how life long relationships fare in war the lengths we'll go to for family of different kinds and what it takes to finally let go u0026amp or leave but i would have appreciated a map u0026amp more in the way of historical context even if it was in the form of an introduction or something outside the novel's narrative","418":"i can't i just can't keep going i don't care about any of the characters and the narrative is kinda confusing for people not familiar with chechnya","419":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a beautifully written and complex story with many interwoven threads now that i've finished reading it i want to go back and reread it so that i am better understand how all of the elements fit together the book takes place in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 and encompasses two wars between russia and the rebels this is a story of loss pain despair and hopelessness in the face of a cruel war despite all of this negativity there is humor which lessons the tension the feds and the rebels have destroyed life in chechnya ordinary people are unreasonably hauled away for treason there is little food most of the buildings are damaged and the only people who are doing well are the smugglers anthony marra created a small world with few major characters and a short time frame yet the narrative tells us about life in chechnya over a ten year period and the author often tells us what is going to happen to some of the people in the future how often do we find novels that take place in chechnya i wanted to understand why the marra chose to write this story and found that he spent some of his junior college year in in st petersburg and became fascinated with the situation in chechnya he traveled to chechnya when he finished his first drafts marra lists resources at the end of the book and he says that he had lengthy footnotes that his editor made him remove some of the photos he took in chechnya are at his website http anthonymarra net behind the sc a constellation of vital phenomena is too complex for casual reading but it is a rewarding book with characters and images that will stay with me for a long time i don't think i've read a book which is so interwoven with situations and coincidences","420":" war torn chechnya 4 families and their intertwined lives and the most gifted author read it that is all you need to know this book unfolds in the most amazing poetic and beautiful way from the very first pages you will know that you are in the hands of a gifted writer this novel is told in flashbacks so pay attention to the dates that on the kindle are in teeny tiny letters at the beginning of each chapter i believe this is the best book i have ever read yes ever i will reread it again to be sure it is as amazing as i think it is maybe i will have to reread it two or three time just to be absolutely sure anthony marra i want to know when is your next book coming out no pressure but i eagerly anticipate it and will be waiting with baited breath","421":" what an expert example of the understatement of churning enveloping emotions in the entanglements of multiple families most in chilling circumstances marra's writing evinces an almost uncanny expression of wrenching emotion in subtle gestures or restrained scenes and his range is remarkable the thoughts expressions behaviors of a young world weary child a burnt out but deep surgeon an incompetent but multi layered doctor a defeated betrayer an old man lost to his history but still touched and incised by his time--and those aren't even all the main characters there were many more still clearly distinct characters who worked in concert in an impossible mosaic of story credibility all contributing to the moody movement of the plot this is my candidate for the best book i've read this year--very good heady stuff and sad in the most absorbing of ways","422":"i wish i could have read this book in fewer sittings a few of the characters were hard to keep track of but that is only due to my addled brain the writing is spot on","423":" for those of you who don't know me i read a lot a lot and over the many years of reading the many books i read i can only think of two that have made me cry i am not talking about getting a little teary i am talking crying to the point where you can no longer read the words dropping tears upon the page well i can now add this book to the list i was so invested in all of the characters i actually cared about what happened to each and every one of them even the a hole informant marra did a spectacular job of not only making you see the characters but feel the characters i don't know much of anything about the wars in chechnya a lacking i will be fixing thanks to my friend and her boss but felt marra did a great job of infusing the historical information into the story possibly anticipating many of his readers would be in the same boat as me he let the reader what was happening and why it was happening this was marra's first book and i definitely can't wait to see what he comes up with next he has built some big shoes to fill","424":"this is an amazingly great book there are not enough stars to give it it is heavy set against the chechen wars of the 1990s and 2000s yes you have to do a little google research but the story is so rich and beautifully told and it is so clever the way it all comes together fantastic book","425":"before even finishing it i described this novel to several of my reading est friends as the best book i've read in a decade i'm sticking to that now everything about it is perfect and it's a tightly researched story about a region and a time that most amurrcans myself included don't know dick about and should it will take you to empathy school recommended at the top of my lungs","426":"interesting read you slowly learn the story line of multiple separate characters and then the story weaves their lives together whether the characters realize it or not","427":"i love when a book actually lives up to the hype anthony marra deserves all the positive praise in the world i'm blown away that he was able to tell this story in such a beautiful poetic manner \"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \"","428":"a truly impressive debut novel from anthony marra that takes on decades of war and atrocity in chechnya despite the horrors that marra captures in this novel there is so much beauty in the relationships of these characters","429":" quite an impressive debut novel not necessarily an easy read due to the subject matter once i realized this book was about chechnya i should have know it wouldn't be a feel good book of the year but despite that i soldiered on and was not disappointed the novel covers basically from 1994 2004 spanning two wars in chechnya the author goes back and forth in time as he tells the story but although he keeps jumping around i loved the fact that each chapter opened with a clear timeline that showed exactly in what year the chapter was set coming in with relatively little knowledge about chechnya like i did i occasionally felt a bit lost when he would say the feds did something i wasn't exactly sure if that meant the russian army or were there different factions within chechnya fighting each other i told you i was ignorant but that's not necessarily a bad thing because i love it when books spur me on to learn more about something of course i ended up spending time on wikipedia reading all about the chechen wars which made me slightly more depressed but also more knowledgeable the things people suffered through is actually unbelievable but i'm making this book sound more morose than it actually is i loved how the author wove things together so that different parts of the story and the characters intersected i loved the beautiful writing and the little bits of hope that shone through the really dark subject matter and i'm looking forward to see what this author will write next","430":"\"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones \" with that sentence anthony marra starts weaving a beautiful but also hard story staged in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 there are a few things remarkable in this work first there is the topic the chechen conflict isn't one us westerners are very familiar with but very artfully the author makes us understand at least one side of the conflict without becoming a history lesson or needing any quick wikipedia style research the second is that despite the heavy topic he manages to get some rays of lightness into the story there are conversations especially in the first part of the book that are actually kind of funny and yet most of the time it's only funny because it is too absurd and tragic to be true and once you realize that you probably will stop smiling \"it must be pay day soon \" one of the character dryly comments when they hear a lot of gun shots all of a sudden it seems the russian soldiers' pay was linked the amount of munition 'used' leading to them blindly shooting around to empty their guns just the idea that anyone would measure a soldier's performance and efficiency by a certain amount of munition used is making me a little nauseous what marra does really well is painting powerful images two in particular have stuck with me the first the image of a village covered in upside down toilet bowls we learn that the chechens used these unbreakable sovjet toilets to protect them against unexploded artillery shells the army left behind the second eight year old havaa receives a barbie doll from the doctor taking care of her this particular barbie is dressed in a ballroom gown and has a tiara and havaa wonders why the doll is smiling the explanation that perhaps she is a black widow who went to a moscow theatre to take hostages hence also the dress and the jewelry is mentioned very innocently as if it really isn't a big thing but it triggered something in my mind the moscow theatre hostage crisis where 40 armed chechens took more than 800 russians hostage for more than two days more than 150 people died during this siege most of them due to a toxic gas the russian forces used to end it overall this book is a beautiful story about survival and loyalty the chechen conflict is a heavy topic but it is written with a lot of grace and some very realistic characters there's a doctor who spends most of his time making portraits of missing people and his colleague needs to buy the essential first aid supplies from the black market there is a father who teaches his daughter to bucket things into -ists you are minimalist or empirist or socialist or communist or obstructionist or terrorist in a world like theirs it's important to bucket people and to know what people are this might just be the best book of the year i highly recommend it","431":"life changing the story line was very intense and the plotting was masterful not necessarily a feel good book but a must read if you want to know more about that part of the world","432":"the language here is beautiful clever and even sometimes poetic the audiobook's narration is lovely too though i think it might serve an injustice to the narrative there is so much jumping around in time and between characters that the story is hard to follow in places even now i have some doubts on my digestion of the events worth reading but i'd recommend picking it up in print","433":"one of the best novels i've read in a long time i finished it in tears and immediately started reading it again","434":"couldn't bring my self to give up and stop reading but didn't really enjoy the style subject matter and story was very much to my style","435":"it took me a couple days after i had finished this to realize how good it actually was the desperation and sacrifice throughout the book was a bit hard to process the writing was beautiful with fully developed characters and intricately detailed environments all in all just beautiful","436":"marra's beautiful searing language earned him a three stars on this one but the story line just didn't grab me this was so hyped up by all my reader friends out there but for some reason i just couldn't connect to it the plot wasn't compelling enough can't win em' all right ah well i leaned quite a bit about the chechnyan wars and several of the passages were breathtaking i will be interested to see what marra chooses to write about next","437":" i found myself emotionally invested by the end of the first chapter of this novel it's well written and i love how the author ties the characters together in heart breaking fashion you can't help but fall in love with these examples of true honest humanity with realistic depictions of war torn chechnya and the people who live within i found myself tearing up with sadness one moment and the next smiling at the small vestiges of humor found in the rubble the author also wound historical references into the story line in a relevant way i walk away from this novel feeling like i've learned something profound about humanity and the dogged persistence of survival","438":"a remarkable novel set in war torn chechnya that really made me feel grateful for that which fate has bestowed upon me well written and well researched to think of how drastically different my upbringing and everyday life was during this time period from the characters in this novel had a really grounding affect on me","439":"wonderful it's a dark tale of the privations and trauma of the chechen war but it's also a surprisingly sweet story of loss error and redemption all of the major characters' lives are tied together in subtle and surprising ways the writing was also excellent and the way the author handled the timeline of the story was unusual and somehow sucks you into the book's world i highly recommend it","440":"definitely one of the best books i've read this year and hard to believe this is his first novel he has a great way with metaphor","441":"depressing but lyrical book about chechnya","442":"would give it 2 1 2 stars i didn't connect with the characters as much i think the author would have liked but an interesting read nonetheless","443":" one of the finest books i have read in 2013 highly recommend anthony marra's debut novel is set during chechnya's two wars for independence from russia in the 1990s and early 2000s in an old medical dictionary life is defined as a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i kept coming back to this definition as i read this powerful and remarkable story eight lives are interwoven through this story in a way few authors can deliver the minute i read the last sentence i wanted to start the book again looking for what i surely missed on my first read as outlined by the author the novel's axis rests on two stories shared by islamists and christian tradition they will be familiar to most readers but would be a spoiler if i were to describe them further along with the shocking brutality of war comes human redemption tenderness and kindness fate familial ties loyalty sacrifice love and circumstance all play a role to move the reader on this journey i loved this book","444":"the best book i have read in a very long time the characters' lives amazed me the storytelling was sublime the atrocities of war juxtaposed with everyday life and moments of joy made me marvel at the human condition read it you won't regret it","445":"to be fair this is a wonderfully written story about the turmoil in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 it took me almost a month to read part of the problem was that i just didn't want to pick up the book and read more about the horror and loss and fear not a head in the sand thing i just didn't want to read about it on a side note with a few exceptions books that jump around in years rarely pull me in i find them most confusing i stayed up to finish the last 75 pages last night i guess i needed to find out what happened to all the characters and the author does a good job of telling the reader where each character will be years down the line","446":"well i didn't finish it but i liked it the characters stuck with me my book club discussed it before i finished it and i heard the end summarized it was good to read something from this place and time different from most settings of novels","447":"all the more impressive because this is not the kind of book i usually go for set in europe during a war in the recent past normally i would say no thanks but i might see this author at an upcoming conference so i wanted to read at least one thing by him and my library had this i'm really glad i did it was touching and well written by the end i felt like i could make a good guess at what the major characters would do in a given situation which is one of my tests for a good book","448":"this book was not what i thought it would be it is beautifully and realisticallyl written unfortunately it makes one feel so present to the brokenness of a community where no neighbor can be trusted and the awfulness that brings a man to turn in his neighbors to the authority that i'm sorry i read it just too dark the set up for the book is about this young girl who is being hidden by two doctors i enjoyed all their relationships and backstories but felt so unresolved with those stories that it wasn't enough to make it worth reading the darkest parts","449":"this is not an easy read in more ways than one it is a tale filled with the worst that human beings do to each other filled with scenes of betrayal torture mass death and sex slavery it also goes back and forth across about 10 years covering the life of about 8 different people there were times in my reading that i found tedious and declared no way this gets a 5 star rating however upon completion of the novel i saw that everything was necessary and the novel does end well or as well as it could as the lives of the disparate characters come together and their connections are revealed the novel really shines the last 100 pages or so were quite involving and towards the end almost unbearably moving and the ending ushers in a humanity and sweetness that is never schmaltzy or melodramatic but conveys profound emotion the author is very skilled as a writer almost every phrase is extremely well crafted if you are up to the task this is a powerful and emotionally satisfying novel","450":"this novel is beautifully written at the sentence level it is rich complex and a harrowing yet often beautiful story set during","451":"beautiful haunting compelling heartbreaking amazing read i will never forget this book","452":"a constellation of vital phenomena is a debut book this fact alone was enough to stun me as i read through pages and pages of elaborate text slowly weaving together a story so detailed but always missing that one little element of the plot that keeps you reading wondering about the next link as you move from articulate chapter to articulate chapter from the 2004 standpoint of a chechnyan eight year old to the 1995 perspective of a 65 year old author who wanted to tell the historic truth in his overwhelmingly large stack of papers containing the history of chechnya the most interesting part of reading this though is how all of these stories begin to make a web that draws the characters closer and closer together until it they all connect over a silver makrov pistol the story is glorious and the narration superb but if one is not informed to a degree about soviet russia as well as the rebellion and have a map of russia on hand while reading there may be some trouble understanding the vast amount of politics scattered through the book while i feel as if this was more of a fault of myself as a reader it did make parts of the books extremely hard to follow even after reading i am still uncertain as to what was politically happening during the time period covered in the book what i did not know about the politics was made up for with the disturbingly accurate descriptions of what happens to an area that has been plagiarized by war and to the people living there the truth is a sickening thing but marra had no qualms delving into the terrible to show you the horrendous norm of the side affects of war following this a topic brought up and thoroughly examined in vital phenomena is the landfill the landfill starts as the occasionally mentioned boogeyman and turns into the serial killer the way marra brings this reality into the book seems effortless which only makes the torture filled and abusive yet normalized prison more painful there is this feeling i enjoyed while reading the book which is that the author was a knowledgeable man the descriptions were real as marra had no problem including the facts and the narration takes the stance of a god like being similar to death in the book thief observing not with emotion but with simple summaries as a character you meet briefly on the way of telling the story of another gets a page to themselves as the reader can learn of the future and the past of rebel commanders whose dental floss stitches will lead to the meeting of two of the main characters all of these stories spiderweb together truly creating the definition of life a constellation of vital phenomena","453":" anthony marra is a master craftsman i'm in awe of the breadth of this story how freely and yet successfully he played with time and the emotional complexity of his characters his story is devastating but likely an accurate exploration of the ravages of repeated brutal wars on chechnya and its people i was amazed by how i came to feel compassion for characters who at first seemed inhuman i'm very glad to have read this book but i leave the novel feeling sceptical so much is bleak desperate and hopeless in this story for so long that the tiny bit of redemption at the end feels like too little too late why after so many awful losses does sonja have a softening of the heart following the novel's final deaths devastation was built effectively across this story but the sources of hope seem flimsy and untrustworthy maybe this is reality in war but i don't want that reality in my fiction i want fiction to both portray reality accurately and create of that reality something new the single beautiful life that survives this story simply isn't enough in the context of all its horrors","454":"beautiful and affecting a gem","455":"an amazing well written story that took me forever to finish because it was so painful that i could only read it in small doses and then think and feel for days","456":"beautiful book that has stayed with me after the last page","457":" wow this book was quite a task to read but not in a bad way it is an awesome novel however it was a slow read because there is a lot to digest it is an amazing accomplishment for the author so meticulously researched and eloquently written it is a hauntingly sad grittily real story of the savagery and tragedy of war in chechnya it is a novel that i will never forget and i am grateful for the experience even though it was an achingly difficult one i learned much about what the chechen people experienced and how far human beings can be forced to go in order to survive it is a portrait of ugliness and beauty all at once so agonizing to read but i couldn't put it down it is an astonishing must read and i highly recommend it","458":"i devoured this book and as a writer stand in awe of anthony marra's debut a constellation of vital phenomena is that rare novel of superb literary quality coupled with a compelling plot characters you care about and a story that sheds light on one of those corners of the world which have sown mayhem reading it you feel whole new rooms of understanding open in your mind think of the incomprehensibility of the boston marathon bombing and two brothers from chechnya who carried out that heinous atrocity and then read this book set during the ghastly war in their home country and you'll have a cold glimmer of how terror breeds terror how good people do evil how love subsists despite what sounds like grim terrain for a novel the book is hopeful elegiac surprising and gorgeously written havaa the young girl at its heart is enchanting and readers of all tastes will find this book wise and enchanting in its own right","459":"5 5 stars for exsulent food dish potentschul food does not slide off of book some stains on paperback arc cover after eating but dis will prbly not be a problum with hard cover edishun insides of bok are ok no cats in bok wtf took a nap on de book and it was 5 5 stars recomendded","460":"excellent i love how anthony marra includes irrelevant details about characters' future lives the guard thirty one years old had never received a pay check and wouldn't have known what to do with one if he had in three years when the hospital issued paychecks again beginning with a whopping nine years of back pay the guard would frame his in glass and hang it on his wall without ever depositing it also this line she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency","461":"maybe it is well written maybe there's a good story somewhere but about a third of the way through i gave it up because the f word was prevalent throughout can someone write a good story without obscenities","462":" my much more well read colleague recommended this book and i trusted her while this is a beautifully written book probably one of the best written i've read in a very long time and while i found the story haunting heartbreaking and engaging i really hated the non linear time line what is going on with modern literature why are authors avoiding linear storytelling i like flashbacks i like a story that includes a fully fleshed out character background but when the main storyline is broken up gratuitously it gets really annoying","463":" i enjoyed this fine writing of anthony maara in his debut book i knew nothing of the chechen wars and couldn't even place them properly on the map the title is a little hard to remember but in a medical dictionary it is the meaning of life i like the way anthony started each chapter with the timeline on the top so you could keep track of the two time periods some in 1996 and most if it in 2004 i really enjoyed the medical scenes with the two main character akmed the incompetent doctor who drew rather than treated the patients sonja the tired surgeon who worked so hard in the bombed out hospital and havaa the 8 year who was trying to find her father and the 5 days of her like looking for him the larger backdrop of the entire war completed the rest of the story the word pictures were wonderful and i would have given it a higher rating if i could have followed the story closer i will look forward to his next book","464":"achingly sad and so very beautifully written i felt that the characters were fragile points of light moving through the bleak lifescape that is chechnya until they all intersect in various ways to create an ember maybe this book moved me so much because of my own ties to russia but it is one of the beat i've read in many years","465":"this book was beautifully written and i really loved the way it came together at the end there was just a lot more jumbled chronology for my liking it was also very heavy with war violence etc sometimes hard to read other times so moving it hurt my heart i would definitely recommend it to people who like historical fiction","466":"there are a lot of reviews saying this book is beautiful graceful etc it's beautifully written but for some reason i didn't get from the reviews that the plot was going to be so relentlessly dark none of the characters are happy then they die several by gratuitously described torture i agree it's a good plot and well written i just don't think i would have chosen to read this right now if i had known how depressing it was going to be","467":"this was a remarkable book that is set in the backdrop of the devastating civil wars in chechnya but it is mostly about the ties that bind families during crises i have to say that this was crafted beautifully he switches characters time periods and places seamlessly while never missing the emotional vein that he is trying to hit it was gritty and beautiful and i really enjoyed reading about a place that is not well known","468":"beautifully written book","469":"absolutely brutal story told over 5 days about 6 main characters in war torn chechnya whose stories intertwine and disconnect in unexpected ways and points written in brilliant prose that haunts you for weeks and although the story conveys the brutality of war marra still manages to find beautiful and touching moments in through all of it with an overall sense of optimism definitely a classic","470":"review to come","471":" a story of akhmed a kindly villager in war torn chechnya who rescues 8 year old havaa after russian soldiers abduct her father and burn down her house they end up at the local hospital staffed by only one remaining doctor sonya a graduate of medical school although graduating at the very bottom of his class akhmed agrees to help in the hospital if havaa is allowed to stay and be cared for undoubtedly mr marra has talent to spare this book is filled with sentences that are beautiful and moving but the book just didn't get to me i found it laborious to read was i happy that i read this book yes i was the introduction to a new author is always exciting for me but in this case i was also relieved that it was over","472":"what a beautiful piece of fiction devastating but hard to put down can't stop thinking about the ending","473":"excellent story that isn't always easy to read the characters are richly developed the storyline believable the author makes good use of how he moves around in time and lets you know the outcome of the characters without giving away the story it does take place during the chechen wars so sometimes the material is hard to read about but it is overcome with the relationships among the characters","474":" i was so excited to receive a constellation from the goodreads giveaway i have been following marra's writing with some interest since first reading his short story chechnya in narrative magazine the story on which this novel expands i was intrigued by the way he handles non linear storytelling multiple povs and a wonderfully tactile sense of time slowing down and speeding up as a somewhat lackluster medical student myself i really identified with both akhmed and sonja whose scenes on the page pulse with liveliness i especially enjoy marra's economic dialogue and the dark humor that lingers beneath an example last month he told me that george bush had been reelected sonja said who's that the american president sonja said looking away i thought ronald mcdonald was president you can't be serious there it was again condescension thick enough to spread with a butter knife his mother was the other woman to have spoken to him like that and only when he was a child--and only when he wouldn't eat his cucumbers wasn't it ronald mcdonald who told gorbachev to tear down the wall you're thinking of ronald reagan english names all sound the same that was fifteen years ago so brezhnev was general secretary for eighteen it doesn't work like that over there she explained they have elections every few years if the president doesn't win someone else becomes president that's ridiculous the wind lifted the ash from his cigarette and scattered it across the empty parking lot and you can only be president for ten years she added and then what you become prime minister for a bit and then run for president again i think you just step down you mean ronald just stepped down after ten years he asked she had to be putting him on he just stepped down and george bush became president and then george bush shot ronald reagan to prevent him from seizing power no she said i think they were friends friends he asked it makes me wonder how we lost the cold war good point and so george bush had been president since ronald reagan there was another guy in there clinton the philanderer i remember him he said pleased and then george bush became president again no the george bush who is president now is the first george bush's son ah so that's why they don't shoot the previous president they're all related like the romanovs something like that she asked distractedly then who is ronald mcdonald you know akhmed she said looking to him for the first time in several minutes i'm beginning to like you the only thing that kept me from rating this higher is that i didn't feel quite satisfied at the end despite a nice literary finish i think this is just a personal thing usually i am looking for a catharsis and i did not feel it as acutely as with other books in this genre i still recommend a constellation highly anthony marra is definitely a writer to watch","475":"beautiful prose remarkable characters and a fantastic story about life in chechnya between the late 90s through 2004","476":"no happy endings here great recommendation @saradallas","477":"wonderful emotional book it left me weeping with the delicate balance the novel strikes between atrocity and kindness","478":"really really brutal and beautiful anthony marra is like the thinking man's jonathan safran foer i even teared up at the end the only reason i don't give it five stars is because sometimes the writing was too good writing y and also the title is so ridiculous it was mostly wonderful though plus i learned a lot about chechnya","479":"before a constellation of vital phenomena i knew one thing about chechnya that two brothers of chechnyan background blew up the boston marathon now i'm in a better place on chechnyan history thanks to anthony marra it's hard to read at times just because of the harsh setting conflict ridden chechnya and pervasiveness of war we get to know a generous handful of characters but war is almost a character itself wrapping itself around the everyday lives of those people there's a brief but awful torture scene nothing is gratuitous but it's still pretty harsh it's war ultimately though there is enough hope enough light let into the pages that it's uplifting despite all of that the narrative starts in 2004 as a father is disappeared and his daughter goes into hiding it loosely follows the attempt to keep her hidden but marra plays with the timeline popping in and out of different points in a ten year time span one of the things i liked the most about constellation is the way everything and everyone eventually intersects marra focuses on three people but there are so many characters inside this book and they wander in and out of each others' lives throughout those ten years creating ripples that reach into the future it's a web of a novel and it's lovely the prose is filled so many beautiful turns of phrase that it's its hard believe this is marra's debut","480":"a constellation of vital phenomena is not an easy read but you should read it if for no other reason than to experience the horrors of war and corruption so that you appreciate peace and the rule of law all the more","481":"i don't know if a baby affected my attention span or what but i just couldn't get into it it was good but i guess not for me","482":"i feel like this would be a 3 5 if i had that option i bumped it up because i did appreciate learning something about chechnya the writing was at times too much for me too arty maybe but the wide ranging narrative across decades and characters came together in a satisfying if typically novelistic conclusion","483":"a book club selection so definitely a depressing one with a theme of the wars in chechnya however i did actually enjoy the book in spite of this and its occasional graphic scenes sometimes the description of minor characters was distracting as well the writing is strong though and it sheds light on a subject and a part of the world i know knew nothing about the story made me thankful that i'm not living in constant fear of my life wondering which of my friends or family is going to disappear next with no opportunities and almost no hope","484":"rather dark but a good book","485":"this is one of those books that broadens your horizons and gets you to care about an area of the world you knew nothing about chechnya is the setting and the devastation its people are trying to survive is the theme the stories are compelling the writing excellent and the characters haunting would definitely recommend one word of caution the torture can get intense","486":"such a tragic story first book i've read about chechnya","487":"it took me a little while to get the groove of this book but once i found the rhythm i really liked this book the characters were interesting and the story was multi faceted i don't know much about chechnya and the historical references to a country conquered by different factions over time was interesting","488":"this book will rip your heart out some passages are unbearably sad and at least a half a dozen times i seriously thought about putting it down but if you keep reading it will be worth putting yourself through the emotional turmoil ultimately it is a story of hope and love i can't remember which writer said it but someone said i just want to write good sentences anthony marra writes some the best sentences i've had the pleasure to read i've never underlined so many passages in a book he can say in 30 words what many a philosopher needs a tome to say i plan to read it again once i've recovered","489":"i read this book because it was recommended by ann patchett in an interview i had no idea what it was about a small village in chechnya during the wars with russia much is dire all is well written some wonderful characters who provide the glimmers of hope that can appear during the despair of war","490":"fantastic review forthcoming","491":"wow this is definitely a book i will need to read again not because it's difficult to follow or to puzzle through but because the whole thing unfolds so intricately relationships being revealed piece by piece as the narrative unrolls beautiful moments and terrible ones humanity inhumanity fear and terror and love it's got it all","492":"a delicately and masterfully crafted book unbelievable that this is anthony marra's first novel his writing hooked me in from the beginning and immersed me in his character's lives effortlessly the attention to life's details is extraordinary and the reality he creates leaps from the page in a picture more vivid than i have read for some time he manages to convey much with very few words not a sentence is wasted and it shows throughout the entire book i felt i had been through an emotional wringer by the time i finished reading and i'm glad i took the journey the story is at once heartbreaking and uplifting and i defy you not to cry at the closing lines why it didn't win the national book award i'll never know anthony marra deserves to win prizes for his writing he has far to go and i for one will be keeping track of him to see what wonders he comes up with next","493":"one of the best books i have ever read beautiful prose that made me yearn to keep reading and rereading despite the horrific context the ravages of war on two chechen families in a village torn apart by resistance and russian repression and two ethnic russian sisters' struggle to survive and help others do so","494":" what i knew about chechnya could have fit inside of a teacup oh yea that place where there's been a lot of trouble it's in russia right i have a much better grasp of the events there after reading this book marra explains the past of this country in an accessible and moving way the story here isn't as much about politics and wars as it is about what happens to the people and their relationships because of such hardships marra focuses on the humans caught in these events how do they continue to carve out a life in a war torn country how do they survive the fear what sacrifices will they make to continue to feel like humans at all this is an incredible story about a young girl and the man who decides to take care of her when she is left alone in the world a constellation of vital phenomena is powerful emotional and incredibly compelling this novel is not to be missed you'll be thinking of it long after you've read the last page","495":"4 5 stars really enjoyed this book the mix of emotion humor change and adjustment was much more balanced that anything i've read lately and it left me feeling hopeful although very sad one of my favorite things about the book is the you get to learn about each character from various perspectives you really get to know them and i am so sad that i will miss my book club discussion because i think this is going to be a good one this book reminded me of the kite runner and the book thief if you enjoyed either of those then read it i have also heard parallels to jonathon safran foer's writing which i really do not enjoy and the things he does that annoy me were not present in large amounts but are the reason that i'd really give this 4 5 stars versus 5 npr summer reading list meg's ann's rec","496":" chechnya in the mid 1990's is a brutal war torn place sonja rabina has returned there from studying in the us and now works in a small shell of what once was a large and busy hospital in her hometown like most

sonja the lone doctor in the city tries to help them with her limited amount of supplies and medicines sonja like most people in chechnya has lost a relative and keeps hoping to find her sister who

his neighbor akhmed risks his own life and takes havaa to the hospital where sonja works hoping that she will find refuge there over the course of the next five days the two doctors discover deep reserves of strength and courage as they try to protect this young girl from the insanities of war and the inevitability of betrayal they also find links and connections that tie the three of them together in very unexpected ways and find the strength to make choices that are both sacrificial and joyful marra has a very interesting technique of introducing characters and then telling something about what happens to them later on although this takes some getting used to in the end it adds to the effect of seeing each person as a piece of a larger whole a part of the constellation of vital phenomenon that we call life a constellation of vital phenomena is a searingly honest and profound meditation on what it means to be human and what it takes to fully embrace life it delves deeply into the human soul and finds in the midst of despair and betrayal a hope that passes all understanding read more of my reviews at brendasbookshelf@wordpress com","497":" a great story where 3 persons are

phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation","498":"i loved this book wonderful prose delicate story with a brutal background","499":"very slow start hard to get into without a background in russian history also the author sometimes sacrifices clarity in order to be poetic","500":"reminded me of city of thieves with its dark humor and quirky characters living through hell i liked this so much more than all the light i appreciated that book but it never swept me away i responded much more to the ridiculousness of the horror in this book and really came to love all the flawed prickly almost unlikeable characters the author has such a light touch that i was almost surprised to find myself weeping highly recommended","501":"brilliantly done stunning one of the best books i have ever read anthony marra wove a luscious story so rich and complex in construction and character development with gorgeous prose some passages were so beautiful they took my breath away i wondered if those sentences and paragraphs flowed from his pen automatically or how much effort he needed to craft them to me they flowed like a magical brook i rarely read books twice but this book is worthy of a second read simply superb i would give it 20 stars if i could","502":"loved this book","503":"whilst the subject matter is bleak the story is cleverly told with various strands coming together smoothly at the end the author has a great grasp of humanity hence the characterisation is excellent positioning readers to change their minds about how they feel towards various character","504":"i can't decide which is more beautiful this book's language or its humanity marra writes in the tradition of nineteenth century russian novelists and shows the form to be as vital and moving now and in his hands as it was years ago in tolstoy's astonishing and moving and gorgeous","505":"wow somewhere between a 4 and 5 but closer to 5 the book wasn't an inhale suck it all in can't put down but the characters were so rich the setting so bleak i will be thinking about it for a long time the connections between people were so real and heartbreaking","506":"here is my review as published in the 4 1 13 edition of library journal marra's debut novel places readers in chechnya during its decadelong conflict with russia and offers up an authentic heartbreaking tale of intertwining relationships during wartime the narrative centers on three people eight year old havaa whose father has been \"disappeared\" by russian forces her neighbor akhmed a failed doctor who tries to hide her in the only operational hospital he knows and sonja the area's last remaining surgeon who is trying desperately to find her missing sister as he shifts in time through the years of the two chechen wars marra confidently weaves those plots together and several more besides giving each character a rich backstory that intersects often years down the line with the others though sometimes difficult to digest--episodes of casual violence and savage brutality punctuate the otherwise graceful prose--the novel's tone remains optimistic and its characters retain vast depths of humanity and even humor in spite of their bleak circumstances verdict marra's moving novel will appeal to admirers of tea obreht's similarly war torn novel the tiger's wife but his story relies less on magical realism and more on the seemingly random threads binding us together highly recommended for all readers of literary fiction copyright (c)2013 library journals llc a wholly owned subsidiary

they awkwardly patted my arm and promised to read it","508":"best book i read since the sparrow i'm looking forward to reading it a second time great story great writing great characters","509":"i think i've found the best book of 2013 it's even better than that for me how to adequately review a constellation of vital phenomena the setting is chechnya during 1993 through 2004 this is about life there through two wars with the russians life is defined as a constellation of vital phenomena a constellation of vital phenomena is so unique that i can't do it justice this story is more than i expected can anyone read this and remain unaffected i won my copy of this book through a tlc book tour on http bookchickdi blogspot com","510":" finally im done i'll begin by acknowledging that i may be the only person on planet who isn't in love with this book see every other review and it very well might have just been the timing i'm giving it three stars because it was so well written and the characters were full and perfectly developed this is normally a book i would love however the subject matter wars in chechnya sex slavery torture betrayal was just more than i could handle it was painful to read and a book that should have taken me less than a week ended up taking 3 to finish","511":" havaa is an innocent eight year old but in chechnya innocence doesn't last long the wars bring fear and danger to the villagers and when havaa's father is abducted one night she runs into the forest with a small suitcase filled with her treasures kept packed on her father's advice as the story unfolds we learn of the hardships endured by all of past struggles and of the future that is most uncertain the beauty of the novel lies in the characters and how their lives are intertwined almost without their being conscious of it how they search for loved ones for information for reasons why sometimes they are successful but more often they are not the author weaves these lives together even as their world unravels before them until one by one they reach the end of their rope a gripping tale of man's inhumanity to man but one where the kindness of friends and strangers still shines the light of hope","512":"marra beautifully tells the story of the interconnected lives of people trying to survive in the midst of war and brutality while their lives are simple the story is not definitely a year jerker","513":"this book was so sad so warm and mostly so unexpected i am really grateful for the journey","514":"wow this book was so well written touching haunting and powerful it is hard to believe that it is this author's first book i enjoyed it tremendously one of those stories that you carry around with you for a long while","515":"a story of people both finding and losing their humanity in war torn chechnya this book was at times painful to read because of graphic depictions of torture and sex slavery while it is well written i don't think i would actually recommend this book to anyone","516":"i guess it's a good book but wow what a tour of soviet style unadulterated misery","517":"an important novel beautifully written at times difficult to read because of the subject matter but worth it i already want to read it again","518":"dragged a little through the middle but the last few chapters made up for it very heavy subject matter but quite moving","519":"a beautifully haunting novel bringing light to a dark and terrifying time","520":"an amazing novel about the lives of several people in a small town in chechnya during the last two wars the subject matter is very dark but the writing is lyrical","521":"this is one of the best books i've read so it's hard to talk about it without sounding over the top from the description of the fire on the second page i was hooked by the beautiful writing the incredibly real characters and the plot i was desperate to know what happened to these people the main characters are stunningly rendered but even the secondary characters and the ones just brushed against in passing felt like real people in part due to the author's technique of giving the reader one insight about that person's life so i never forgot that every person is the center of his or her own story and is just as vibrant as the ones we come to know best this is the rare book i'd like to give to everyone i know so they get to meet these people too it is a reminder that we are all connected in the slightest and deepest of ways and that even in insane times humanity can emerge from anywhere it gets to the complexity of love and war i could keep going but i hope everyone reads this book \"carrying that lumber the forty meters from the forest had left his knuckles blistered his underarms sopping but now a few hours of flames had lifted what had taken him months to design weeks to carry days to build all but the nails and rivets all but the hinges and bolts all into the sky \"to those who've finished can we talk about how much we love alu the brother of sonja's contact and deshi \"good night to you and your ugly nose\" the insane bus driver who hits every pothole on purpose or when the meaning behind the title is revealed the flash forwards \"she was still four years and one month away from her seventy sixth birthday and the miracle of her first lime \" and how many lines are stunning and will stay with you \"no one can take what's inside your head once it's there \" and the ending oh god the ending i sat here and cried and smiled and cried some more i was terrified i couldn't possibly love the ending as much as i'd loved the book and it was perfect","522":"solid read it","523":"wow a powerful moving story that can be difficult to read but worth every minute spent wishing such tragedy did not exist sonja akhmed haava the characters are complex a wonderfully written tale of love and war","524":"don't even remember how i heard about this book but it ended up being one of the nest books i read in 2014 highly recommended never had an interest in chechnya but bought about 4 books about the region in the last 30 years from this book","525":"hard to stay with in the middle but what an amazing piece of literature and achievement genius to follow the characters into the past and future some harrowing depictions of war and cruelty recommended for those who can handle it","526":" this is a very good book from which i learned a lot i have always been interested in russia and the soviet union but i don't know much about the soviet states post disintegration of the ussr furthermore i knew nothing of chechnya this book though fiction incorporates history seamelssly i was interested in the characters by page 10 and sad to let them go by the end marra is definitely a talented writer who can portray both dark moments and humorous ones he is a master at weaving characters together without the characters knowing their connections until much later in the story or not at all my complaint the reason this book doesn't get 5 out of 5 stars is the writing techniuqe marra uses in where he moves back and forth between the past and present sometimes in one paragraph or even one sentence marra says war breaks cities buildings and families but also time and the way stories are constructed to tell this story in a straightforward linear fashion would fall short of caputuring the absurd recursive manner in which its characters assemble their frragmented lives and i wanted to embody that in the novel's structure sadly it this device is distracting at times and makes the narrative difficult to follow marra also reveals minutiae about characters who are in the book for a paragraph or sometimes less it harkens me back to mfa days when our mentors hounded on us concise concise concise i don't need these extraneous details in the story i get that he is trying to show how war and struggle touch human lives but it becomes tedious","527":"2015 has become my year to explore through the agency of novels the depths of evil humans can inflict upon one another my reading has confronted me with the cruelty of the caste system in india the exploitation of chinese immigrants to the u s the armenian genocide child abuse the war caused by the encroachment of white settlers on dakota territory the siege of sarajevo slavery in the ante bellum south the debilitating aftermath of colonialism and now the casual sadistic suppression of chechnya in the aftermath of the breakup of the soviet union the strange grouping of an 8 year old girl a dismally inept chechnyan doctor and an overworked cynical ethnic russian surgeon gives the author a cast of characters whose back stories aim a harsh spotlight on the evil that permeates their world and yet these characters also provide a way to introduce a tiny pinprick of hope this novel is worth the emotional toll it exacts","528":"this story is so beautifully written but also made my heart ache the author created very personal points of view and experiences of war and trauma characters' details were added throughout the book and i loved how connected their lives became beautiful and sad book that will stay with me","529":"maybe it was because i listened to this as an audiobook but i just could not become invested in any of the characters some beautiful use of language and the structure would have worked very nicely in the book but unfortunately the audiobook seemed to drone on for hours without emotion 2 5 5","530":"wow it's going to take me a couple days to think up my review stunning","531":"overwhelming brutal tragic filtered with kindness wonderful characters","532":"i'd like to say i was immediately captured by his novel but alas that wouldn't be true my lack of familiarity with war torn chechnya indeed with russian history distanced me at first a number of original and whimsical characters were woven into upa usb programmer with full adapter new version his rich tapestry of words and for many pages i wondered just why such and such character was being portrayed in great detail","533":"although most americans were vaguely aware of the fighting in chechnya it is a story with which few of us have any familiarity the author gives the story life through the experience of a few vivid characters an eight year old girl is hunted by russian soldiers she is helped by a doctor who has far more talent as a portrait artist he seeks shelter for the girl with a surgeon who along with a single nurse comprise the sole medical staff at a bombed out hospital a bleak story of the horrors of war and its consequences for individuals trying to survive","534":"this was such a remarkable book even though it started a bit slow for my tastes however somewhere after the first third of the book i really had a hard time putting this book down at times humorous many times sad and always truthful this is about a few select people struggling to survive as best they can during the chechnya and russian wars it explores the choices people are faced with how those choices change them forever and also how there is always a little bit of hope","535":"this was not the easiest book to read but it was so worth it i grew to love the characters despite my confusion at times with their circumstances its the type of book that will have you thinking long after you put it down","536":"like humans of new york this novel reminded me that people are extraordinary everywhere in every type of miserable situation","537":"wow definitely wow this book was haunting and beautiful it is a book that makes you forget you're reading","538":"what an incredible book this is not the type of work i would expect as a first book it draws you in and keeps you reading even when the story is troubling i had to finish this book even though parts of the book was brutal to read i won't give a spoiler but i will say the book covers 5 days and the lives of a few intertwined people it takes you on an unexpected ride through all possible human emotions thank you lyle for lending me this book","539":"this is really really rough but also so eye opening and beautifully written","540":"for some reason i just couldn't get into this book after a little while some parts were good and it was well written it just didn't do it for me","541":"this beautiful book has been summarized many times by more able writers so i will skip that each night after reading i dreamt of the characters in this book not the terrible things that happened to them but about the connectedness between them as my mind put the pieces together in chronological order it is difficult to describe any particular character succinctly because of the myriad details that knit together so perfectly and essentially even a few a ha s i tried u0026amp my son's eyes glazed over mom maybe you should read one of mine so now i have 2 more books to read his suggestion u0026amp hadji murad by tolstoy which is referenced in a constellation so tall a stack u0026amp so little time make time for this book","542":"wow a work of art hard to read in parts it's a no holds barred war story after all but what a story it is so small yet enormous the plot is flawless and grips you until the very end i'm simultaneously reeling over these fictional characters' destinies and ashamed of my own first world problems i hadn't heard of anthony marra until this book but i'm so glad i did he is unbelievably talented and even more impressive is this is his first book hopefully not his last","543":" this book caught my attention because of the enigmatic title but also because of the setting i knew pretty much nothing about chechnya and its civil strife and that made this a challenging book to read but though the rebels and the feds and all of their factions drive the story marra frames all this history for the reader through the interconnected lives of everyday people in a small chechnan village these everyday people live and die in horror unimaginable another reason this was a challenging book to read without the absolute beauty of marra's language i'm not sure i could have gotten through this horror 8 year old havaa's father is disappeared and her life is in danger her neighbor akhmed an unsuccessful doctor but an artist and man extraordinaire moves to hide her with a female surgeon in a hospital in a nearby town in the span of 4 days around this event marra moves the reader around in a 10 year period between the first and second civil wars in chechnya friendships and relationships in the village shift and break under the pressure of starvation violence and betrayal be prepared for unbearable scenes of violence but also for some of the most beautiful writing imaginable","544":"i struggled with this book i found it to be rather graphic regarding war times and i did not like switching back and forth so much between time periods and characters perhaps it is because i read most of this book as an audible book that i had such a hard time following i stuck it out though and the ending was satisfying enough","545":"an amazingly well written book but very very sad","546":"when i was a senior in high school i was friends with an exchange student a russian from uzbekistan when the school year ended she went back to uzbekistan and i went to college in the midwest in the letters we exchanged she encouraged me in my study of the russian language and at her urging i wrote back in unsteady cyrillic sure i sounded like a child in the letters she sent shortly before she moved to moscow she described what life was like for her as a russian in newly independent uzbekistan i couldn't comprehend the situation she described i couldn't imagine how it was possible that someone i knew a fellow teenager could be experiencing the things in her letters i wondered if maybe the words on the thin airmail paper had changed shape or meaning during the journey half way around the world there was a student from kazakhstan at my university and i asked him about her letters she sounds really scared i said she should be scared was all he answered reading marra's book about chechnya i thought about kate for the first time in years i only got one letter from her after she moved to moscow and i have no idea how her life unfolded after that year we were eighteen marra's book brought detail to my imaginings of what kate's life in uzbekistan might have been like in those early years after the fall of the soviet union reading marra's words i felt the crunch of the frost beneath my feet and the shadow of hunger and hopelessness in my gut and the rumble in the floor and the walls as the bombs fell or the trucks rolled through in the dark of night and wondered how much of it lives in my long ago friend's memories as reality rather than as fiction as i've experienced it this makes it very difficult to give this book a star rating liked it didn't like it it was amazing these categories don't fit in a way i loved this book i loved the language and the way it drew me into this world in another way i really didn't like it because the world into which it drew me is one that i don't want to admit existed and in other iterations still exists this book left me feeling sad and embarrassed for something i didn't do and never lived it could have left me with confidence in the human spirit but instead i just feel like my only options are to close my eyes to everything outside the narrow confines of my middle class never left the continent american life or to be swept away by the relentless wave of history which seems so full of the dark side of human nature it's difficult to see what's good in our species my spouse accused me of putting only depressing books on my to read list and after the last two books i've read i'm hard pressed to refute his claim p s in the end i ended up giving this book my standard four stars i'm not sure what i mean by those four stars but that's what i settled on","547":"pretty brutal and disturbing and at times hard to read but very well written and compelling","548":"truly heartwarming","549":"gorgeous u0026amp so endlessly infinitely quotable","550":"poetic and beautiful loved the non linear way that the story was told and the ties that bound the characters together the little reveals along the way were a lovely way to unfold an otherwise difficult story recommended","551":"ok so it is an utterly depressing book with a story you just want to be finished it weaves backward and forward in time i found it difficult to follow and certainly not one i would recommend i am not sure what people see in this book","552":"i'd give this 3 1 2 stars if i could i really liked it but parts of it were just a bit slow for me","553":"i liked the story i disliked the writing i'm confused about the reviews that say it was gorgeously written i hit the next button on my kindle four times at one part and was still on the same sentence the flashbacks in flashbacks in flashbacks in flashbacks in flashbacks wait what was i saying there were some sparks of genius the way marra wrote of future times of each character i enjoyed the parts of the interaction among the characters and reading about what they were going through but the ridiculous amount of details were painful","554":" i learned of this book after reading about the author of the orphan master's son marra is a protege' of adam johnson the title is also what drew me to this book the author looked up life in a medical dictionary and that is what he found this is a story that is going to stay with me for a very long time while fiction this is based on a true time period in chechnya history taking place over 5 days in 2004 i am always amazed that people actually survive times like those outlined in this story the strength of character the determination to survive to be honorable when times are desperate makes you think and wonder how human we could remain in the face of such extreme horrors i don't usually write reviews of the books that i have read but i am so affected by this book and the orphan master's son that i felt compelled to elaborate on just a 5 star rating","555":"wonderful i could not put this book down the plot was intriguing i liked all the characters and felt they were well rounded and real the writing itself was lyrical i found myself reading lines multiple times a sad story but one you will not want to end","556":"i actually finished this shortly after i started reading it read it in about two days but january is a busy month for teachers who write narrative reports in january a friend gave me the book to read it's not the kind of book that would have jumped off a store bookshelf at me but it did what good books do it transported me to another place in this case chechnya i didn't know much at all about this part of the world and only vaguely remembered some news about it at some point history is not my strong suit i admit but i also know i tend to learn more about history by reading a good fiction book than by trying to learn about it with nonfiction this is an amazing story of survival and love which sounds trite but that's what it is the characters were complex and interesting and you wanted to know what would happen to all of them and along the way i learned a great deal about chechnya the story jumps around in time which wasn't terribly confusing but you do have to pay attention to when the section you're reading is occurring i appreciated that this format allowed me to know early on that one of the characters was going to survive so i didn't have to spend the book worrying about everyone i really enjoyed the book if one can say that about some of the events that occur within the book and will look for future works from marra","557":"highly recommend my favorite book in a long time masterful story telling with historical setting made for a book i couldn't put down and almost didn't want to end but needed to see what happened to all the well developed characters","558":" a good read though not without flaws the story is painful to read at times covering the lives of those living in chechnya during the wars characters are tortured raped but there is a lightheartedness mixed with dark humor that counterbalances the violence the characters are mostly fascinating and their stories eventually intertwine in a satisfying sort of way and if you can ignore the coincidences even better it's only at the end in an author's note that the author reveals that he was partly echoing an islamic and a christian narrative in this contemporary story which does explain and justify the coincidences while i admittedly started skimming at times i quickly stopped myself once i realized where the chapter was going and i'd often turn back to reread the writing is strong this line stood out her mother slipped into a contentedness that usually appeared only after the red wine had fallen below the bottle label i reread this book recently and i liked it much more the 2nd time it moved faster to me and knowing the connections between the characters allowed me to enjoy the humor the pathos the story so much more","559":"haunting and disturbing beautifully written this one will stay with me","560":"thanks to a very long flight i was finally able to put this one on my read list it was a long time coming and it took awhile but in the end i'm glad i stuck with it because i liked it more the further i got into it it was far from a light read but it was unique and well written","561":" a very sad and depressing book sometimes even disturbing not surprising given the fact this is essentially a story about war and people bound together by the horrors of a bloody conflict one that i mildly remember following particularly 10 years ago when the infamous \"beslan school massacre\" occurred incredible well written remarkably poetic and full of wisdom \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is the kind of book that deserve and demand attention and persistence all to say that i did struggle sometimes especially with dates and names but in the end everything made sense and came full circle overall not one of those uplifting books despite some very funny parts and characters one of the best books of 2014 and one of the best i will read this year","562":" i resisted this book because i wasn't drawn to the title and i have no interest in chechny however i received the book as part of my warwick's first editions book club and i'm so glad i did it played with time in interesting ways and i loved the seemingly random connections the characters made through the years with one another or with objects important to other of the characters and it was heartbreaking to experience third hand the misery and violence and loss the people of chechnya have suffered for years highly recommended","563":" set in 2004 during the second chechen war a young girl is left alone when her father is disappeared for dissident activities a kindly neighbor takes her to a hospital hoping the only doctor still there will watch out for her that's the basic plot but there's so much more the connections between people are so real and yet so tenuous it's absolutely heartbreaking that said i'm not sure it's worth all the hype at least for me the writing was beautiful and lyrical but sometimes rambled and slowed down the plot i found the jumping back and forth in time confusing on occasion sometimes i was in 2004 and then in the next paragraph i was in 1996 and i found i couldn't always tell the difference or tell who was speaking given current events with russia annexing crimea and looking longingly at ukraine this book is very timely it serves as an excellent look at how real people are affected when the world plays politics it confirms my opinion that war is so very wasteful","564":"need someone else to read and tell me why it took until page 170 to care about the characters","565":"i couldn't finish maybe if i didn't have lost of things i wanted to read i would have pushed through wasn't worth it","566":"hands down the best book of 2013 for me exquisitely dark and simply lovely","567":"best fiction book i've read this year maybe in several years","568":"great good to read about a different part of the world for a change","569":"i knew almost nothing about chechnya and never thought i'd feel such a connection to the people that i have after reading this book the hardships and the necessarily dark humor the folk tale like tone from beginning to end i was hooked these characters will stay with me for a long time one of the best books i've read in a long time","570":"this novel belongs in the category of conflict fiction with michael ondaatje's anil's ghost and others like ondaatje's work marra's sheds light on an oft forgotten conflict the chechen wars and the atrocities that have shaped the landscape marra details how each character must endure their own set of circumstances from which nobody escapes unscathed while the text details the circumstance diligently the novel leaves one with the idea that the situation is just like all the others i don't say this lightly there is purpose in bringing detail to what has gone on behind the veil of war however conflict fiction needs to do more than chronicle these elements i need the characters to be more engaging or the story to truly grasp me in a way that makes it memorable i left this novel thinking about the atrocities but not really taking any part of the story or the plight of a single character with me which would make the book truly excellent","571":"i learned so much","572":"i rated this four stars because the actual story was fascinating and the humor was classic loved it the only reason it did not get five stars from me is that it was very confusing trying to figure out the timeline i think if it were written from the beginning of the story to the end without mixing it up it would have been a lot easier to follow it is very difficult jumping from past to future with each chapter great insight into what live during those years was like though","573":"i wish i could give this 10 stars it's an extraordinary work in all ways- language character development sense of historical place and of course the recent history of chechnya this book is destined to win award after award","574":"i loved it like i loved cutting for stone i couldn't put it down","575":" sadly the recent boston bombings have placed chechnya in the public conscious but this resilient little country in russia was also involved in two wars during the 1990s which didn't seem to get much press here in the west this story and it's inhabitants are caught squarely in between these bloody bookends an eight year old girl watches her father hauled away in the middle of the night by the feds a friend and neighbor also is witness to this incident and takes the girl to a nearby hospital where she'll be safe under the protection of sonja the attending physician like the rest of them sonja has a haunted past and has been searching for her missing sister sonja spends many hours at the hospital dealing with an endless onslaught of births and amputations how their stories begin to intertwine and flow into each other is the magic of this novel there is a subtle beauty to the prose mined from these horrific events a chain of pain sacrifice love and regret i can not praise this book higher the things in his life that caused him the most sorrow were the things he'd lived with the longest and now that everything was falling they became the pillars that held him \"entire years had passed when he was rich enough in time to disregard the loose change of a minute but now he obsessed over each one this minute the next minute the one following all of which were different terms for the same illusion \"","576":"excellent book extremely well written deep pathos and insight into humanity set against backdrop of the terrors of chechnya slightly slow in first 100 pages worth the effort 4 5 stars","577":"well written interesting read sad story","578":" for 85 90% of anthony marra's debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena i found myself thinking i should be liking this novel much more than i am it had a whole lot of elements that i enjoy in a novel eye opening educational historical fiction well constructed memorable imagery serendipity fate etc plus a whole bunch of my personal intangibles unusual title literary buzz that cry out this is your type of book i'd be curious to know if it was a case of right book wrong time but alas there are no do overs in reading a book for the first time while it had my respect throughout it just wasn't earning marks in the love or even like very much department given my expectation and anticipation i was pretty sure it was going to rank as a disappointing 3 star good book but as hinted above i powered through and while i clung to too little too late doubts in the finish the collective whole won out vs all those previous unsure parts the ending was satisfying and wonderful and sad and all that thanks to this strong finish where so many books seems to falter i am giving the novel the goodreads bounce to 4 stars but unofficially hedging it at personal 3 5 stars for not feeling a steady connection throughout a good chunk of it","579":"disturbing to read with compelling characters who make it impossible not to finish a real education on what occurred in chechnya during the two wars with russia","580":"i read this book on an airplane which is not the best way to read it it is beautifully written the characters felt very real to me i particularly liked how the characters and their motivations deepened as you learned more if i had to express a quibble it would be that the switching in timelines what year it was made it a little bit difficult to follow at times but i did like the technique and it did help the story resonate as you understand more about 'why' when the book ends a couple of questions how did natasha get away so much else is explained and i didn't see an explanation of thisthe 'afterword' described one of the inspirations of this book being a case where an orphan was taken in by the family that was responsible for her becoming an orphan i don't see the parallel at all overall a great book i read it in one sitting a very long flight i don't recommend that i would have preferred to read it slower myself it is a book to savor i also think the plot would be a little easier if you had more time to absorb each chapter a quote that i loved at the kitchen table she examined the glass of ice each cube was rounded by room temperature dissolving in its own remains and belatedly she understood that this was how a loved one disappeared despite the shock of walking into an empty flat the absence isn't immediate more a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an erasure but a conversion in form from presence to memory from solid to liquid and the person you once touched now runs over your skin now in sheets down your back and you may bathe may sink may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it","581":" spoilers this book was amazing and what i really liked about it was that there was no happy ending the ending was cruel and harsh but at the same time it was an ending that was happy and hopeful this book was centred around three people havaa whose house and father dokka are both ripped from her in one night and lived in eldar village akhmed a friend of dokka's who also lives in eldar he rescues havaa and brings her to hospital no 6 sonja is the surgeon in hospital no 6 who agrees to take havaa in as long as akhmed stays at the hospital and works with her and deshi a nurse who retired 3 years ago the novel is mainly centred around how the interactions of havaa akhmed and sonja all effect one another and how five days can change the lives of these people but the novel not only focuses on them it also focuses on khassan the man who may or may not be akhmed's father ramzan khassan's son who is an informer for the feds and is a pariah in the village and natasha sonja's sister who left one day and hasn't been seen since all together their stories from the past present and future combine to create a spectacular novel in which our relationships with people in our lives are examined so basic plot for you i adored this book once again a historical fiction novel has taken my breathe away and is definitely one of the best books i've ever read its not a book you should read if your looking for a happy ending or a fairytale its brutally honest about human actions and how we all effect one another it also tried to explain that our lives are shaped by those around us sonja's life was drastically changed by the appearance of havaa and akhmed who at first were bothers but she grew to love them over time khassan was a pariah in the village because of his son and took to talking to feral dogs and akhmed's wife and through the shared histories and futures these people share i got a better picture of this theme lol my english teacher would be so proud this book also took me way longer to finish a because i had exams and b because i wanted to savour ever single sentence in this book the imagery and repetition of words in this novel greatly helps to future engulf you in the setting of the book i can't find anything bad about this book minus the minuscule fact that sometimes there was too much repetition 'twas spectacular atleast to me read and enjoy","582":"update i have 100 pages to go if it holds as i think it is going to this will be my favorite book of 2014 absolutely breathtaking beautiful heartbreaking story and writing i just need a quiet place to go for a few hours as it deserves requires no interruptions i don't want it to end finished devastated","583":" the first chechen war took place over a two year period that lasted from 1994 to 1996 when russian forces attempted to regain control over chechnya which had declared independence in november 1991 the second chechen war began in october 1999 with a prolonged air campaign of retaliatory strikes and a ground offensive much better organized and planned than the first chechen war the russian military took control over most regions in february 2000 the ruling regime lost power chechen rebels continued to fight russian troops and conduct terrorist attacks in response to the increasing terrorism russia tightened its grip on chechnya as well as expanded its anti terrorist operations throughout the region this is whereconstellation of vital phenomena begins...a day in 2004 when an eight year old girl's home is burned to the ground and her father is taken away in the night by masked \"feds \" the girl's father sends her to the woods and she is saved chechnya is a country most american's know very little about and even less about the conflict affecting its inhabitants from the 90's into the early 2000's author anthony marra skillfully slices into a small village and helps us understand the struggles and difficult choices facing the residents this is a well crafted novel and although the subject matter and brutality are hard to stomach the message and the story are beautiful","584":"marra did a superb of capturing the heartache of the 1st and 2nd chechen wars as well as peeling back the layers to each of the character's vulnerable cores such a good book highly recommend looking forward to future novels from marra","585":"the author totally pulled me in to a different world and made me cry","586":" this was phenomenal a friend gave it to me and i'm glad she did because otherwise i would never have picked it up the story follows several people living in chechnya in the early 2000's bringing the second chechen war to light and to life the characters are much more connected than they first appear and discovering the connections and relationships between them is one of the most fun parts of this book the gorgeous language also made it extremely enjoyable to read i just wanted to hold it in my palms roll it around put it in my mouth and let it dissolve marra is truly a master of language in order to fully understand and enjoy this book i think i'll need to read it again so i can focus less on plot and more on the intricacies of the story and the language before you pick this up a word of warning this book is also incredibly depressing excellent but depressing","587":"a surprisingly wonderful and life affirming book amidst the horror and despair of war torn chechnya there is this flower of a story cracking through the concrete of torture and amputations and betrayals rather than coming away from this novel wanting to commit self harm you come away with an appreciation of the wonder of the ordinary","588":"beautiful and brutally honest look at a war torn country i think a second read with more attention to the characters will bump this up to a 4 star rating","589":"loved this book","590":"read 50 pages","591":"this was easily one of the best books i have read in quite some time it takes place mostly during 2004 in chechnya but the story jumps around as far back as 1996 and the years in between to inform the story that is happening in present day the author weaves the stories of the main characters together and around and through each other in such an intricate and beautiful way the ending is in no way disappointing i loved every minute of this and had to force myself to put it down at times so i could sleep and shower i would recommend this book to anyone who reads","592":"tragic yet full of heart fictional account of life in wartime chechnya","593":"chechneya and the iowa writer's workshop don't mix","594":"i loved this beautiful haunting heart wrenching life affirming it felt a little sentimental to me in places at first but soon i got caught in the rhythm of the story and the fineness of the writing and i believed every word i enjoy novels about russia but i knew nothing at all about chechnya this was a wonderful introduction","595":"i loved this book the characters stick with you and their lives haunt you though at times i was slightly confused with the changes in the timeline not so much the chapters but telling the future in the midst of the story lines i enjoyed the way it was written it was interesting to know what happened to characters that only appear in the story for a short while i heartily recommend this","596":" this book was an incredible story of survival loss love tragedy and hope the way the story unfolds is unique and beautiful and though i wish there was a little more detail of the two recent wars that rocked chechnya i loved the way anthony marra carefully peeled back the layers to expose the characters' lives and emotions giving reason to weariness distrust vulnerablity and the way they all hold onto that thin thread of hope though havaa was a secondary character i would've liked to know some more about the girl throughout most of the book i thought akhmed was going to be my favorite character but i think by the end it was sonja this is a special haunting story and has earned a place on my favorites shelf without a doubt i will reread this amazing novel i can hardly believe this was the author's debut novel it was that well written i eagerly await future works by anthony marra","597":"i enjoyed this book but it is not for the faint of heart","598":"an absolutely amazing first novel wow","599":"bleak but beautifully written","600":"books like this should have a warning on them it's amazing so beautiful and well done but will devastate you","601":"this book was beautiful unlike anything i've read before the story marra tells us is incredible a story in which time is fluid i love how we see past present and future leaving no questions unanswered it's a heartbreaking story about several chechen people all somehow connected from the mid 1990s to 2004 marra also tells us what the future of the people looks like if you don't know much about the chechen wars don't worry the story stands independent of facts and figures while still teaching the readers the valuable details the lives of the people surrounding the complex history of chechnya as a warning this book isn't for those light of heart it contains graphic and heart breaking material","602":" entering this book knowing almost nothing of chechnya i found that the structure of bouncing back and forth along the timeline interfered with my initial grasp of characters and events eventually i got my bearings and became thoroughly engaged from the beginning however the author's prose was stellar and i expect this book will be on my to reread list quotations havaa standing on a steps tool and stirring the broth found an unfamiliar gratitude for the smallness of her life everywhere beyond these four walls smelled of smoke and gasoline but here no calamity was greater than an egg falling to the floor 141 for the first time in their relationship she realized that she had more power than he and this was all she needed to let him go 175 she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency 332","603":" this was not a good choice for a summer read it was a beautifully written powerful story of 6 lives in modern day chechnya their lives intersect in many different ways some of which we don't know until the end to read such a story in august with sunshine and beaches surrounded by friends and family made me feel very lucky but i also felt helpless and outraged that these situations are going on in this time frame not historical but recently so many images will stay with me for a while not the torture scenes i had to skip those the characters were so well written and i have lots of admiration for the author a tough read but somehow worthwhile","604":"wow just wow powerful u0026amp moving exploration of human beings' responses to the evils of war","605":"absolutely beautiful book about human weakness and human strength all types of relationships forgiveness mercy and hope highly recommended","606":"i wish that i had waited until summer vacation to read this beautifully written story unfortunately the first 100 pages seemed disjointed because i only had time to read them just before bed but after that everything fell into place i was hooked and stayed up much too late each night as i was pulled into each character's life there are so many wonderful pieces to recommend this book","607":" my personal feelings about this book conflict with all of the 5 star ratings i wasn't put off by the darkness and pain that are prevalent throughout the whole book i think i just got bogged down by the time changes and slow pace the middle of the book felt like it took forever and moved at a snail's pace i'm sure this was intentional to replicate the slow movement of time to the people of chechnya the novel's setting but it lost my interest i cared about the characters learned a lot about the russian chechen conflicts and wanted to like it a lot more than i did","608":"this is a beautifully written book about a horrific subject that i could not put down in fact i had to stop reading with about 20 pages left because i couldn't bear to leave the characters and the writing","609":"difficult subject matter but a really remarkable story and so beautifully written","610":"this book is so much more than it first appears it is a story of what motivates and what defines people's actions under extreme duress specifically living in a war torn nation it's hard to believe this is the author's first book","611":"i found this book a little slow to start as i am so unfamiliar with russian history but this story is told through a few main characters and what life becomes as numerous wars envelop this land i became so drawn into the characters that i found myself getting a history lesson as well while this book is about post war russia and the chechn conflicts it is mostly the story of deep family connections of the truth laid bare which can be more horrific than lies while it is a search for truth it is also a need for the truth to not be known how each character relates and is related to the other is ingenious i read many books but this is one i will not forget","612":"if you are inclined to read this book brush up on the first and second chechen conflicts first if you are in the mood for a book about war crimes and atrocities this is it but those are background to the basic story of how human beings react to extreme stress a very hard book to read","613":" a story of the human side of the chechnya russia conflict of the 2000s and how normal everyday people survived or didn't i loved the writing style i loved the author's storytelling ability the book pulled me along and i was emotionally invested the characters were so 'real' that it was a blow when negative things happened which in a book about war happened quite a bit while the topic is heavy the book is not and it is a great read and i'm glad i read it in multiple sittings rather than one straight slog since it was on my mind when i wasn't reading it excellent","614":"this was an excellent choice for our april book club first of all no one knew much of anything about chechnya so there was a lot of talk to fill in gaps in history and geography then there were the characters to explore each one somehow connected to the next and each one uniquely gifted and flawed then there was the structure jumping back and forth in time back and forth between characters back and forth in settings it was a bit challenging at first but the timeline at the beginning of the chapters and the title to clue readers into the character focus helped a lot finally the writing was lovely and surprising and clever i definitely recommend this book to readers who like to learn a bit about the world through fiction and those who like complex characters and structure","615":" i really loved this book set in the post soviet federation of chechnya basically its a story of humanity among the rubble of war in a constellation marra weaves together the lives of several people in a small village in war torn chechnya it tells the story of akhmed dokka sonja havaa khassan and natasha all connected by history and events that shape their lives and interactions the novel takes place from 1994 2004 told in a non linear format that allows us to get to know the actors in bits and pieces i found this method to be very powerful in developing the characters revealing more and more of their histories gradually making them all the more real the novel is devastatingly beautiful showing the resiliency of human spirit that allows people to survive and connect with one another even when it seems impossible among the ruins of civilization marra uses bleak humor to great affect to portray the hopelessness of the situation the characters find themselves in at first it seemed a bit off to me but as the story progressed i began to appreciate the subtle humor the story behind the title of the novel is finally revealed about midway through the book and i found that passage to be quite moving the strength of the characters their determination to survive with honor the complexities of their relationships made for a memorable read this is probably the best book i've read this year definitely a 5 star read","616":"an astounding debut this book has been keeping me up until 2am for the past 3 nights marra very gently unveils the coincidences and deep links with devastating effect with each link the intensity of the horror multiples he uses an interesting technique you will know when a character is about to leave the plot of the novel naturally a hugely satisfying but gut wrenching novel it will be a while before i can start something else this one does not get deleted from the kindle","617":"wonderful writing that held me in its grasp until the very end such a wonderful story that i know i will reread it again and again","618":"4 5beautifully written a bit slow sometimes incredibly emotional raw believable ending read it","619":"excellent one of the reviews on the back cover compared marra's writing style to that of joseph heller catch 22 and i was highly skeptical however this book definitely lived up to that praise would definitely recommend","620":"tough read because of the brutal subject matter and sad story","621":"this is flat out a great book deftly probing humanity and all its complexities","622":"at the kitchen table she examined the glass of ice each cube was rounded by room temperature dissolving in it's own remains she understood that this was how a loved one disappeared the absence isn't immediate more of a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an erasure but a conversion in form from presence to memory from solid to liquid and the person you once touched now runs over your skin now in sheets down your back and you may bathe may sink may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it","623":"i wasn't expecting all the stories to weave together very beautifully written and a great story","624":"anthony marra delivers this powerful story to his readers in manageable increments to make it possible to finish it over a week after finishing this book i ache when i remember the choices forced on characters during this modern day war story it is brutal and elegant at the same time","625":"i didn't know much of anything about chechnya and its history before this book it's very well done left me in despair at times over what humans are capable of doing to each other but thankfully ended with hope","626":"a beautifully written book about chechnya during it's two wars with russia that said it was at times difficult to follow as it switched back and forth over 10 or so years i had trouble picturing or even caring for the characters because of his unemotional prose a difficult book to read","627":"devastating wrenching many parts of this novel especially those involving an eel were excruciating to read if i could pick nits i would say that the constant jumping through time was disorienting and i might have enjoyed this novel even more if it had unfolded in a slightly more linear fashion but the wonderful characters fully drawn and the quality of writing won me over in some ways this reminded me of another favorite of mine everything is illuminated","628":"this was a long one but fascinating i never knew much about this place or its history","629":"beautifully written and takes place somewhere i knew very little about once i got through the first 100 or so pages it was hard to put down it did require concentration as the names are foreign and the story goes between time periods i will be thinking about this story for a long time","630":"this book was a challenge for me at first it has been awhile since i have read a book that makes me really concentrate on the characters the author changes characters and time periods often and i struggled at first to understand i am so glad i stuck with it because the book was very powerful it is one that the characters will stick with you long after reading","631":"i finished reading this book today and while i feel i need a bit of time to let the story settle into my bones i will say that it has been a long time since i've read book that affected me as strongly as this one has","632":"wow this is an incredible book not an escape book the setting is chechnya and it's wars but still an capitivating thrilling and very well written","633":"easily one of the top 3 books of 2013 i loved it","634":"fantastically written heartbreaking","635":"i finally finished it at 3am perhaps that may be the most appropriate time surrounded by darkness but immersed in the world that the book lives in a truly excellent book","636":"i thought this book was well written but i don't enjoy reading the wave of literature about post ussr","637":"i stopped reading about a quarter of the way through the writing is too descriptive and it jade me feel that i am not that interested in the specific history there are a few characters that intrigued me but with a stack of other great books to read i was quickly tiring of the skimming over the over written paragraphs the stories on each page felt as though it hardly got to the point","638":" more like 3 5 stars probably it took me a few hundred pages to really get into this novel ostensibly telling the story of three people caught up in the violence in chechnya the shifting perspectives jumps back and forwards in time and occasionally over long digressions made it a bit of a struggle but things all clicked into place in the second half and the last hundred pages or so are deeply affecting it's not quite the triumph i was expecting but it's moving and powerful and develops a few really memorable characters the hints of magical realism that occasionally popped up annoyed me and left me with an urge to read a more straightforward history of a conflict and people i know almost nothing about but that's not really a bad thing is it","639":"one of the best novels i've read in recent memory haunting and beautiful poignant and tragic i had difficulty disengaging every time i had to put it down and in spare moments during my day i found myself thinking of the characters i'm very impressed with this young writer and will be eagerly awaiting future books","640":"the more i read this book the more i enjoyed it however it took me a very long time to read it may have just been my mood","641":"richly human in utterly dehumanizing contexts of war the characters' weaknesses and flaws only made their connections and redemptive capacities all the more powerful haunting in affection anguish and perseverance","642":"everybody seemed to like this book more than i did what can i say with both books u0026amp movies i like to either entertained or educated mostly i just found this depressing i'm a realist i know these things happen in the real world but i see enough of that in the nightly news","643":"when my wife finished reading this last week she told me that 5 stars wasn't enough i wish i could say that i grabbed the still warm kindle from her hands and started to read but that would be a lie what i did was stalli thinking to myself that her enthusiasm might lead to some unpleasantness if i wasn't equally enthralled she patiently waited for me to finish reading maddaddam to transfer some reviews to booklikes to rescue the plants from encroaching winter and to change the cat litter more than once before she gently urged me to get on with it kudos to her because this deserves to be the literary event of 2013 americans have never paid much attention to foreign wars even those we've started the news feeds about the chechen struggle for independence rarely penetrated our consciousness especially after 9 11 truthfully i thought this was about croatia note to self be a better listener after three spellbound days of reading i now know something about the two wars that tore through this region after the collapse of the soviet union this debut novel is set in a small village near a small city in the ruined republic of chechnya in 2004 anyone who had the chance fled long ago those who remained were keeping their sanity by measuring what they'd lost especially the luxury of taking anything or anyone for granted in the span of five days we meet ordinary people who share the misfortune of living in extraordinary times one character is actively engaged with the military as an informer yet the others his heartbroken father two reluctant doctors and a war orphan suffer the consequences of his treachery i think suzanne's review does an excellent job of capturing the magic of marra's accomplishment so without further ado suzanne's review 5 of 5 starsread from september 30 to october 04 2013this novel deserves at least 6 or 7 stars out of 5 i can't stop thinking about the horrors of chechnya a country that i probably would have a hard time finding on a map the characters all built of their country's strife are also in some way torn apart by it this new author anthony marra creates new and vivid images which help us see hear feel taste and smell love fear desperation guilt and just about every emotion his finely drawn family of characters have for example she drifted a kelp rope on the tide that washed away her country family and future the rind of buffer states diminished as republics peeled away you will survive she told herself you will turn the holes in your life into storage space for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric the circumference of the world tightened to what their arms encompassed haava the youngest character is introduced to the reader on the first page she is precocious adored and the nexus of much of this saga each of the other characters have a significant role in the next few days of her life it is amazing how marra is able to seamlessly create a collage of these characters' lives loves foibles self destructive qualities and the effects of living in a country which is ravaged by desperation and cruelty the refugees who pass through their small town the townspeople who are disappeared are not lost because they are carefully jig sawed into this masterpiece as i think about the war crimes described in detail i like to think that this happened over there in the middle of nowhere by starving peasants the problem is that it is happening in the middle east and africa some of the americans were involved in it in abu grave with the knowledge and permission of at least some senior officers and some of the american statesmen on our soil 2 very bright alienated teens in colorado set traps and picked off as many of their peers as they could before killing themselves how many times do we read about young men gang raping girls or maliciously attacking a suspected gay person merely because they can happily lynchings are now few and far between but we certainly have the same dna as the chechnian rebels and feds when we are hungry hopeless unloved drunk or drunk with power we destroy ourselves by destroying others marra also writes about love familial love fraternal love and romantic love the love that these characters feel keep their deceased siblings parents lovers and friends alive it made me think of my brother parents aunts and uncles and friends who i carry around with me death doesn't really take them away just moves them to another place two of the characters are artists their pictures also resurrect that which has been destroyed two of the characters are doctors who try preserve life too one of the most important characters is a historian again trying record for future generations what has passed the saddest character is the informer who has given up his neighbors friends and his self respect after the rebels have taken away his manhood his chance for posterity i can't think of a more important or more satisfying book don't leave this on your to read list","644":"this book was great a disturbing but fascinating story that takes place in war torn chechnya incredible character development and some of the best writing i've ever read read it","645":"this was such an awesome novel about chechnya and the chechen war great storyline and extremely well written very emotional poignant story that has you sucked into all the characters and their lives from 1995 until 2004","646":"fanstastic story i like how the backstories all weaved together i found this book took a lot of focus to follow along not an easy read","647":"absolutely amazing writer","648":"i wasn't always completely clear on the history the characters and the time shifts nonetheless the characters were intriguing the writing good and it was engaging and haunting","649":"finally really good book it's well written the setting is in chechnya from 1996 2004 there are several characters whose lives are affected by the 2 wars with russia i learned so many new things it is an excellent historical novel","650":"at every chapter i expected disaster so i kept putting this one down trying to delay sometimes disaster came sometimes not this is a novel about the war in chechnya about an excellent artist and mediocre doctor akhmed who against very long odds wants to hide and keep alive a seven year old girl havaa whom the russians would like to kill he hides her in a hospital where sonja a london trained doctor who has returned to chechnya remains in the ruined building working as best she can making bargains for supplies and wondering if her sister is still alive somewhere anywhere as bleak in parts as it sounds but also beautifully written and rendered and somehow reading i came to believe that akhmed might actually succeed that khassan's painstakingly hand written 3300 page history of chechnya that khassan himself might survive the conflict as the chechnyans survived the first chechnya war stalin and perhaps this war a terrific first novel a terrific any novel merging history and current events with compelling believable characters","651":"a perfect blend of a riveting story and history lesson marra's characters are fully realized and he gradually peels back layers so you can understand exactly how they ended up where they are the story itself is suspenseful as you read on to find out what happened to these sympathetic characters","652":" honestly i certainly am ignorant of everything that has occurred in russia and continues to go on so this book was difficult for me to read based on my level lack of knowledge the characters were hard for me to retain but in the end it all came together for me i found myself highlighting quite a few passages and sentences as the author is an amazing writer i'm glad i read this book but it took me a while to get to the end havaa sonja natasha dokka ramazan... all very intricately developed characters","653":"before this book chechnya was a place that i identified with war political corruption and people trafficking but i could not tell you why i had that perception or even identify the country on a map this book is a beautiful depiction of how my notions were right while turning these vague ideas into tangible reality through the eyes of victims from a tiny village itself a casualty of the chechen tragedy","654":"i guess i was just about the only one in the book group that did not like this book i did not think there was a good description of culture and place this could have been anywhere where atrocities and civil unrest is going on","655":"this novel gave me chills at points the suffering is poignant and profoundly human definitely a huge win for this new author i highly recommend the book for all serious literature folks it will not disappoint you","656":" i liked the beginning and the end of the book but the middle did not hold my attention and make me want to continue reading i just wanted to finish the book even though parts of book are beautifully written the going back and forth in time did not work for me and i didn't think it was necessary for the story marra does a great job foreshadowing the future in his writing and i think he should have employed the same technique with the telling of the past it was far too depressing for my taste some of the characters like havaa were well developed and others like natasha were not perhaps the novel tried to cover too much ground literally and figuratively","657":"throughout this book i was constantly amazed by the planning that had to have gone into creating these characters the stories are so finely crafted much like finely woven lace i'm afraid to go into too much detail but suffice it to say it's a book that stays with you i'm also amazed at how much i didn't know about the fall of the soviet union a story of war family loss and triumph","658":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm beginning to really like akhmed and then he asks sonja to tell him who ronald mcdonald is when she does akhmed replies i may be an idiot but i would never eat a hamburger cooked by a clown priceless i know these characters represent ordinary people but there is nothing ordinary about their daily lives khassan doesn't speak to his son ramzan though they live in the same house ramzan on his twenty third birthday happens to be out and about when the rebels rise up and the feds tak i'm beginning to really like akhmed and then he asks sonja to tell him who ronald mcdonald is when she does akhmed replies i may be an idiot but i would never eat a hamburger cooked by a clown priceless i know these characters represent ordinary people but there is nothing ordinary about their daily lives khassan doesn't speak to his son ramzan though they live in the same house ramzan on his twenty third birthday happens to be out and about when the rebels rise up and the feds take him to the landfill and he doesn't talk and they do unspeakable harm to him dokka harbors refugees ramzan turns him in dokka disappears and the feds continue to look for his eight year old daughter havaa akhmed is the self proclaimed worst doctor in chechnya who would rather be a portraitist who takes havaa to a hospital in volchansk where he knows by reputation of a russian surgeon named sonja whom he hopes will harbor havaa turns out sonja's missing sister natasha delivered havaa in the hospital years earlier khassan was there more","659":" i loved the beginning and ending of this book and i also was quite invested in the main characters i knew little about chechnya and its two civil wars and did learn some things for me the book becomes tedious in the middle with the torture scenes and also the jumping around in time even though the chapters are nicely labeled with the year this author gives many details from different time periods and also reveals information from other characters scenes which for me was a lot to keep up with","660":"checha setting","661":" this book is luminously written and masterfully crafted and it is a relentless yet hopeful look at what we will do to one another and to ourselves in wartime i knew know very little about the realities of the chechen wars and while this isn't a history of that conflict it does provide some historical information for ignorant readers like me throughout the book the title takes on greater and greater significance life itself is a constellation of vital phenomena i was reminded of the novel the sparrow and the admonition that sofia leaves on the screens of the stella maris live and remember","662":"wow while i initially found the writing style somewhat hard to follow and had difficulty keeping the various characters straight i quickly learned to love the tangents into the lives of minor characters and the glimpses into the future i also loved the way the characters all tied together and the references to biblical koranic tales this book left me in tears and will not be quickly forgotten","663":" while the narrative seemed to move back and forth in time more than necessary the story is very captivating drawing the reader into what is almost an apocalyptic setting chechnya between the mid 1990s and 2004 touching on the two russian chechen wars the time in between and the stories of a handful of people who either survived them or do not the characters attempt to eke out an existence on the blasted landscape navigate the ruined cities and live together nearly without touching because a neighbor's could betrayal could cause you to be disappeared it's a unique story about a part of the world of which i was almost totally ignorant i'll never again think of chechnya without recalling the indifferently committed human rights crimes and the struggles for everyday people to survive a wrecked world with some sense of human dignity and connection to their fellow humans","664":"powerfully moving fiction as history multi viewpoint story set in 1994 2004 in chechnya highly recommended well written caution graphic descriptions of war atrocitiesaudiobook","665":"loved this phenomena","666":"amazingly well written with passages to be reread savored and impressed on your memory for safe keeping a plumbing of the human soul in the despair of seemingly endless war as life time neighbors turn on each other under circumstances that would cause most of us to do the same but there is sacrifice and salvation for some and perhaps even those who commit the gravest sins are ultimately redeemed by their circumstances","667":"sad book is sad writing was a little overwrought but the story had just enough tragedy","668":"gripping dark cold and harrowing","669":"a little slow at first but great characters great set up and great interconnectedness really enjoyed","670":" rating 4 5 of fivethe publisher says in a small rural village in chechnya eight year old havaa watches from the woods as russian soldiers abduct her father in the middle of the night and then set fire to her

additional risk and responsibility but over the course of five extraordinary days sonja's world will shift on its axis and reveal the intricate pattern of connections that weaves together the pasts of these three unlikely companions and unexpectedly decides their fate a story of the transcendent power of love in wartime a constellation of vital phenomena is a work of sweeping breadth profound compassion and lasting significance my review the doubleday uk meme a book a day for july 2014 is the goad i'm using to get through my snit based unwritten reviews today's prompt is the twenty first discuss a book you expected to hate but ended up loving life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation yes now there is always a matter of taste when it comes to appreciating or otherwise a given writer's work do the writer's words ring you like a bell do they smack you in the chops do they slither into your ears emitting glassy slime like a hagfish that's the chief factor in determining your ultimate response to a work i think some writers are equivalent of chocolatiers making bonbon after truffle upon caramel lovely taken one at a time urpsome in bulk i think marra is a chocolatier of a writer in this book there is something miraculous in the way the years wash away your evidence first you then your friends and family then the descendants who remember your face until you aren't even a memory you're only carbon no greater than your atoms and time will divide them as well mmmmm yum sing it brother anthony sing it invader and invaded held on to their fistfuls of earth but in the end the earth outlived the hands that held it yes i concur a bit baroque permabehaps but yes for their entire lives even before they met you your mother and father held their love for you inside their hearts like an acorn holds an oak tree oh gag me a milk chocolate strawberry creme filled emetic level whitman's sampler spitback so here i was alternately uplifted and revolted and still this story made me stop what i was thinking and attend to it and that's no mean feat the horror of stories about war is for me only partially touched by the battles and the soldiers and the wounds they inflict on themselves and each other the people whose lives are utterly upended by wars fought in their name and on their land are so often simply disappeared in toponymic abstraction eg the mexican american war this novel doesn't look so much at the war as at the warred over place and its inhabitants marra's gift is in making images of the place vivid the trees they passed repeated on and on into the woods none was remarkable when compared to the next but each was individual in some small regard the number of limbs the girth of trunk the circumference of shed leaves encircling the base no more than minor peculiarities but minor particularities were what transformed two eyes a nose and a mouth into a face and the people who live in the violated wounded place as someone whose days were defined by the ten thousand ways a human can hurt she needed now and then to remember that the nervous system didn't exist exclusively to feel pain it's a very well made book it's got a helluva wallop of a message and it's fun to read i was expecting nothing more than a flashy mfa from iowa writers' workshop meretricious bauble some parts of the book are in fact that very thing one's own taste determines where the balance point lies are there more surprisingly good moments than there are expectedly shiny brite ones entire years had passed when he was rich enough in time to disregard the loose change of a minute but now he obsessed over each one this minute the next minute the one following all of which were different terms for the same illusion and there i say yes yes this is more beautiful than brummagem this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution noncommercial sharealike 3 0 unported license","671":"great book the story seems like one that would have taken place in another time the fact that these things happened in my lifetime seems unreal the senseless suffering and persecution is devastating but the perseverance and ingenuity of the characters in this book is inspirational","672":"such an awesome book it has all the qualities of a great read gorgeous writing fantastic structure epic family saga unforgettable characters who are funny flawed and complex and all that happens is based on the reality of chechnya and is terrible lovely horrible beautiful and filled with hope","673":"deserves all the acclaim it's received","674":"i don't know what to call this book love story suspense coming of age i do know i could not put the book down i still see the faces of the doctors the child the parent the nurses it is haunting and affirming at the same time chechnya will never be the same read this book","675":"looking for a quick lit read for a long plane ride i stumbled across this which i had added to my list when it first came out i couldn't remember why i'd added it but after i read it i wasn't surprised the setting and historical background of the novel are completely unknown to me but the story is beautiful the connections between the imperfect characters perfect","676":"page after page of horrific events leaving the reader to question how much hardship can a human endure thus a difficult book to finish because of the violent acts but i'm glad that i read it because it gave me background about a war that i knew very little about","677":"loved it great characters that tell the story","678":" what a sad beautiful and wonderful novel the best book i have read in at least a year like different paths through the woods that all lead to home this book takes many directions and sidetracks to reach its conclusion the writing is spectacular and in ways i never would have expected to like there is a description of a chechynian family that loses two sons to the war and their reaction to it the story is told in one sentence that is a page and a quarter long and it is as haunting and moving as anything i ever read even my usual difficulty in remembering russian names was a very minor annoyance i haven't been able to stop thinking about this book and i expect it will stay with me for a long time it is an incredible read","679":"this books was really well written and seemed to be well researched but i just could not get into it part of the problem was that it skipped around so much that it never flowed well for me","680":" your mother's were the second hands she looked at you as if she had been born to you she passed you to your father the corners of his eyes crinkled his heart had been the acorn now it was the oak tree those were the first three pairs of hands that held you how i hope you will live long enough that i will never know the final three what is her name the nurse asked as your father held you to his chest havaa he spoke your name like the rhythm of a pulse when they took him he held your name right there in his chest and you were with him even if you didn't know it when he reached the end he did not die he called your name and began to live in you","681":"really wonderful read about a part of history and the world i know so little about while the story was filled with sorrow there is hope and inspiration in the words the twisting of the relationships between all the characters made me want to read the story again i know i missed some of the connections well worth reading this book","682":"absolutely terrific probably the best book i've read this year perhaps better than anything i read last year an engaging and devastating and somehow somewhat uplifting plot deep interesting characters wonderful prose unique and brilliant and highly highly recommended","683":" this was a beautifully written book and i kept thinking the story was going for months while really the plot lasts about 5 days marra was quite talented at interweaving the different flashbacks and i loved how subtly everybody is connected in the end i did not know much about chechnya beforehand other than remembering hearing about it on the news as a kid but this book made me want to research the topic a bit more the story is very engrossing beautiful and sad at the same time one of my favorite part too was when he would include a sentence here and there about what that particular character becomes in a few years down the road i found it comforting to know these people did make it out of the wars","684":"amazing heart wrenching book i couldn't put it down and have had the characters in my mind ever since i started this work the timeline and characters are intricately woven together and beautifully developed this will be one that stays with me awhile possibly the best book i've read all year","685":"amazing book amazing writing and about a subject i would never have picked up the chechnya civil war it is a harsh story and the craftsmanship of the writing binds you to it not a light read but a worthy riveting one","686":"read this for book club and i'm looking forward to hearing others opinions it had some great moments but overall not my type of book interesting","687":"sometimes you read a book sit back u0026amp say ah this is surely one of the finest most moving most edifying books i've read in years many of these characters u0026amp the plight of chechnya will live with you forever what a debut novel","688":"spellbinding dark suspenseful an elegy sad a story of wartime in chechnya where neighbors betray neighbors people disappear hard stuff to read about a little too heavy on the brutality and violence for my liking but i have to admit it is a stunning story well told good job for a first novel","689":"i honestly had no clue what was going on for over half of this book but when i did the writing was so captivating and profound it also took me way too long to read this it's like i had to pay attention to the tiniest details and reread sentences and paragraphs and i'm def not that type of reader i give marra 4 solid stars wish i could give 5 but the depth of this book may have been beyond me","690":"it took me a long time to get into this book it just seemed so bleak and hopeless it is about the war in chechnya in the mid 2000s and the many many civilians who were killed but the last third made the whole book worthwhile all the loose ends of the tale come together to make an amazing tapestry that reminds us how we are all connected and how every act of love or goodwill changes the world forever these acts can shine a light even in the most impossibly dark circumstances in the end everyone in the story was both a hero and a coward in their own way i especially loved that the character who could so easily have been portrayed as simply evil the guy who informs on his neighbors and lifelong friends causing the government to disappear them turns out to be a complex character someone i even sympathized with and this little piece of writing in a letter written to a child whose parents are both dead almost made me cry on the elliptical machine it was amazing to see your mother love you before you even met perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written for their entire lives even before they met your mother and father held their love for you inside their hearts like an acorn holds an oak tree","691":"4 5 beautifully written and a very engaging story i also learned a lot about the two chechen wars and the chechen fight for independence","692":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i loved this book in similar ways but not as much as cutting for stone the characters were beautiful and multidimensional and the story was rich with detail but several times i got lost in the midst of the frequent changes in time and character","693":"ultimately beautiful and really quite haunting","694":" this is one of the most powerful books i have ever read as i was uneducated in the underlying conflict i was in no way prepared for the horrors that were to come i am not sure i would have read the book if i was but then i would have missed out and that would've been a shame the title is so apt as marra makes each character not only shine but connects them all in such a compelling way a true constellation even though it's fiction the author spent a lot of time researching so i have no doubt that many of the horrible events certainly did take place i do think i am going to have to take a break from books that give me secondary ptsd though the pottery barn catalogue just arrived i think i'm going to read that for a while","695":"i agree with the washington post this was the best book written in 2013","696":"one of my absolute favorites","697":"there are many things to like about anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena it is on the whole a beautifully written book with passages of exquisite prose a cast of engaging characters and an ending that despite its somewhat melodramatic content manages to be quite moving the trouble with the novel is that it is both a little too fantastical to work as a hard hitting account of life during the chechen war and a little too mundane to work as magic realism as a young novelist making his debut mr marra falls into the trap of trying to make his plot too neat an instinct that causes him to not only fill his story with coincidence upon far fetched coincidence but also compels him to tie up any and all loose ends going so far as to predict the fate of his characters far into the future all of which detracts from the emotional seriousness of the novel to the point where it's hard to take the story or the characters seriously this would have been a better book with a looser structure and more uncertainty these problems notwithstanding i enjoyed reading a constellation of vital phenomena and look forward to mr marra's future work","698":" set between 1994 and 2004 in chechnya when russia went to the war with the breakaway republic \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is a dense examination of trust in a world riddled by betrayal the novel also zigzags across time every other chapter unfolds in 1994 or 2004 and in some chapters are flashbacks war indeed ruptures time and the writer captures that essence to a perfection the story plays out in five days but also spans the decade of the chechen wars the flitting timelines circle the string of coincidences that bring sonja akhmed and havaa together akhmed watches as the secret police come and abduct his friend dokka in the middle of the night after they are gone he sneaks behind the wreckage of dokka's house to find his daughter havaa hiding in the woods knowing those who disappeared the ruthless russians will be looking for her akhmed takes her to the only safe place he can think of the hospital in a nearby city here he meets sonja a surgeon working with the ravages of war and no supplies hence the story begins achingly real and an unflinching look at the impact of war on every day people it is not a story i will soon forget readers interested in historical fiction centered on russia and their neighbors will enjoy this novel immensely it's been such a long time since i have felt this moved by a book this gem of a novel is hands down my favorite book of the year jm","699":"painfully slow and depressing some characters are more compelling than others jumps around in time over the span of eight years but that doesn't seem to matter as each character's story ends up being a miserable trip down memory lane a little too slow and indulgent for me","700":"i was left breathless after every single chapter in this book from being touched shocked enraged surprised had to take a moment periodically to absorb it all this is recent history just across the ocean from me it's hard to believe what is taking place while many of us are safe in our own homes an absolutely beautiful and important piece of work this is marra's first novel i can't wait to find out what he has in store for readers in the future","701":"chechyna war u0026amp love","702":" unless you are a student of or have great knowledge of russian history you may not like this book ostensibly it is about a child havaa and her neighbor who live in the same neighborhood in chechnya during the time of war the book takes place over a period of 10 years and traces somewhat confusedly the lives of the characters and the history of the time i bought this book with great anticipation but was sorely disappointed when it became confusing and i being ignorant of russian history could not get through it i read about 60% of the book then decided because it was more effective than my ambien to close it in favor of another easier story if anyone tries it i wish you more luck than i had as i'm sure the ending is quite interesting","703":"i know this book has received generally good reviews but i can only give it two stars i found the story to be bloated with excessive descriptions of every little thing and to be populated with superficial characters the last 50 pages or so were quite good but they didn't make up for the preceding 300 pages very disappointing","704":"a sad and deeply moving novel set in post war chechnya as seen through the eyes of local ordinary people i definitely liked this book although i did not love it marra's writing style is probably the cause i was annoyed at the flashbacks and flashforwards revealing what happens to the subject days or years before or after the current moment in the narration which often distracted me from the main story line although the author uses beautiful evocative words and similes the sentences are sharp abruptly cut i acknowledge that the writing style is the author's prerogative and signature style just not my cup of tea despite this complaint i really enjoyed the story how each character's life is intertwined with the others in unexpected ways and i appreciated the fact that each thread in the story reaches its own well described conclusion which not always happens in novels the book could have been an easy emotional tearjerker but the prose does not fall into the trap of cheap sentimentality yet each character is the protagonist of deeply moving episodes of his her own humanity is portrayed in its entire spectrum at its best and worst although many lives share a tragic ending marra allows some glimmer of hope and redemption to show there is a future after loss at least for some of the protagonists life will go on and this renders the book less tragic well worth a read","705":"i'm not sure why this book is loved so much bleak dark no spark of humanity within war almost every character either is starving raped murdered or tortured without real good rhyme or reason guess that is a correct portrayal of war but it doesn't make for a great novel","706":"a well written moving novel about five days set in chechnya during the war the author weaves together the stories of seven characters to make a singular narrative i saw anthony marra speak and i was amazed how someone who appears so youthful could have such wisdom and understanding of issues far older then him","707":"outstanding just beautiful i would give it 4 5 stars not 5 only because i had trouble keeping track and following at times that is probably my own state of mind while reading though","708":"enjoyed it and will read again","709":"i will admit that my knowledge of chechnya is very limited and at first i was worried that i might be heading into a long dragging history of the country and feel totally lost in it's complexity but the author does an outstanding job of explaining it all in small vignettes and bringing it all together to form one masterfully told story it's odd how over that last few weeks i have seen movies and read books on the various ways that peoples lives seem to leak into other people without knowing it and effecting the outcome of each one this is one of those stories as there are three different story lines moving along to finally culminate into the final chapters along the way there are the odd characters that pop up and how the author takes these little fragments and weaves yet another simple story line for each of them was truly remarkable i felt like i was in an enchanting garden seeing a small curve up ahead and not knowing what lay behind the bend but finding a extraordinary delight awaiting me","710":" as a first novel anthony marra's constellation of vital phenomena is a stunner it gives me faith that wonderful writers are emerging daily marra sets this work in chechnya and his character's lives intertwine in time and space to paint a portrait of life in this former soviet republic as it disintegrates over a period of 8 years the novel is brutal haunting and thought provoking the writing is eminently readable and loaded with remarkably fresh imagery historical accuracy and the promise of similar works to come that this work hasn't received more critical acclaim is as unfathomable as the way human beings are treated between the pages of what will surely become a major work of fiction","711":"a lyrical rich and deeply disturbing novel about the crushing impact of chechnya's civil wars on six individuals marra pushes his characters and the reader to live through random brutality without loss of humanity very memorable","712":"it was very wordy it became very boring at sometimes didn't really care that much about the characters could have have explained the war that was going on at the time for people who were unaware of it","713":"brilliant novel layered smart touching heart wrenching it is quite astounding to think that an author this young has such a clear understanding of such complex politics and complicated life stories it is perhaps even more amazing that he has the ability to write with such precision and authority the book is emotionally devastating and yet somehow still manages to leave one with hope that there are redeeming qualities in people i can't say enough great things about this novel","714":" the title comes from a medical dictionary definition of life which is structured as a constellation of 6 vital phenomena the book is structured as a constellation of 6 characters and their point of view the setting of this novel is chechnya during the decade of civil war there starting in the 1990's i liked this book a lot the author's writing was so good you felt empathy for every one of these 6 characters as different as they were they were all caught up in the madness of war there were great moments of humanity in a time when individual lives weren't worth very much it would seem on the surface to be depressing to read about the torture scenes were tough to read but the hopefulness and humanity really shone through","715":"i was amazed how a young author could weave a complicated historical story of russia and chechnya with a complicated personal story the images he has created have not left me some three months after finishing the book it is really stunning that a young man can have such reach furthermore given the events in boston i think this book may help americans understand the depth of feelings and the complexity of the geo political issues in this part of the world get it read it think about it","716":"very difficult subject matter very enjoyable book","717":"this is one of the best books i have ever read the writing is beautiful though the words describe horrors marra tells the story of a group of people in a village in chechnya a land leveled by war","718":"a bit slow and a tad confusing at times but very moving and well written highly recommended for life long learners","719":"this is a really good book but i had a tough time reading for long periods of time bc of its content i usually have a thick skin but some of the sad parts really got to me","720":" this is my second reading of this novel actually it is my first complete reading i started it exactly one year ago and could not finish it one year later determined to see it through i began again and am thankful i did so it was the author's characters that brought me back sonja in particular and i am glad that i did begin again as it ends as i suspected it would on a positive note and with hope i loved this book but i did not enjoy reading it it is the most painful heart wrenching story i have ever come across but it's characters and setting are so realistically presented and the story so tragic yet they weather on this is a story i cannot envision having the courage to research or undertake mr mara deserves enormous gratitude for doing so and doing so in a most original manner the plot line is engaging as well this is a story we need to hear and i hope more people take the time to read it end of the year reviews give me hope that this work will enjoy the wide audience it deserves","721":"4 5 stars a really beautiful novel reminiscent of ann patchett's world building and humanity it also alerted me to how little i know of that area of the world i also love a book with a suggested a reading list","722":"war in a different part of the world","723":"the writing is amazing haunting beautiful the interweaving of friends and neighbors in aftermath of the chechnya war","724":"this book had hands down one of the most gorgeous covers ever especially its hardcover copy though paperback isn't too bad either and it lived up to it","725":"marra has got the magic the poetic alchemy that makes telling a tale of incredible sadness and pain with such eloquence that hope emerges for the human spirit this gorgeous book brings us the interwoven fates of both sides of the chechen wars all victims all transcendent here love takes on all its mysterious shapes","726":"without question a constellation of vital phenomena is one of my favorite books of all time as is the case with me i was first pulled in by the cover that little blue suitcase in the snow the title is also quiet lovely it's poetic yet oddly scientific at the same time the story though the story this beautiful tragic yet hopeful tale of love and the human connections which so drive life captivated me from cover to cover rrrreeeeaaaadddd iiiittttttt","727":"i'm rounding up my star rating for this one if i could i would give it 4 1 2 or 4 3 4 i truly enjoyed the writing and the characters now time to do some research on this region and learn about the wars","728":"i knew very little about chechnya before reading this so i have no idea of the accuracy it jumps between 2004 and years within the previous decade and relates mainly to the people who live in a small village and how their lives and deaths are shaped by the war beautifully written but the jumping around the time frames stopped me being as engaged with it even though it did work well","729":"beyond horrific with phrases that are so perfect that they hurt this book is exceptional","730":"this is one of the best books i have read in a long time","731":"he weaves the story through time and characters amazingly reinforcing that we are all connected","732":"so this was one of those books that i read because it got good reviews specifically the ann patchett recommendation if i'm being honest but i really didn't like this that much i mean technically it was fine the writing was good and set up was fine it takes place in war torn chechnya where pretty much everything is shit and people are making terrible choices because there are no other choices to make it's that kind of book","733":"dark disturbing compelling made me want to learn more about chechnya","734":"a deeply disturbing hauntingly powerful book","735":"brilliant writing this is a story of longing put to literary music","736":"as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there i liked that quote enough to dog ear the page so i could re read it and there were many others in this book i felt the same about it is horribly beautiful it depicts atrocities and acts of violence that made me wince to read because it's so vivid but god the relationships were beautiful and i was tearing up on the plane as i finished it it is a heavy thought provoking novel no doubt about that","737":"this is blowing my mind already and i'm not even done","738":"i am dazzled by this debut book i want to gush on to search for superlatives to describe the depth and heft of theme plot characters and oh my the writing my devout hope is that anthony marra will prove as prolific as he is talented","739":" very powerful and carefully constructed at the beginning of the novel the reader is introduced to the characters and their story lines gradually the author draws them all together and you realize that it's not a novel with multiple subplots it's one interconnected plot that weaves all the characters together as the novel progresses the narration includes asides that give the reader a quick glimpse of the future sometimes very detailed and far into the future these flash forwards increase as the novel progresses i found them distracting and anticlimactic things about this novel that will stick with me khassan leaving the village to start life over at age 79 ackmed's portraits of the disappeared hung throughout eldar the prisoners in pit b enscribing their names in the mud and then wiping them out ackmed and dokka's embrace in pit b sonja's care of ula at the end the explanation of the title on p 176 natasha reading the medical text then helping in the hospital","740":"despite the dark and depressing reality of life in chechnya a very well written story even though this is fictional it gives a realistic look at life in that part of the world made for an excellent book club discussion","741":" \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" the title comes from a dictionary's definition of life was inspired by the chechen conflict and marra thoroughly researched his subject in order to provide a true narrative he introduces various characters whose lives are ultimately entwined and although the novel cross cuts among multiple stories and these characters there is no real tension build up and i didn't really warm to it however the novel is beautifully written and the author describes the horrors of war torture the separation of families the disappearance of people and many facts of war that we are totally oblivious to there is a sadness throughout the novel but also a beauty in the humane side of people trying to survive","742":"really well written it was both beautiful and very sad","743":"i like this book for the opportunity to read about a war and a region i knew little about the characters are well drawn and much of the descriptive writing is very good","744":"i read a lot of books about serious topics but this is one of the best books i've read about war to be clear not books with a backdrop of conflict but about it about the myriad ways conflict impacts everyday life that titular constellation of vital phenomena i don't like epic novels i'm not interested in big sweeping narratives even though i am often impressed with them i like smaller stories about families and relationships and that's what this was the story of eight people in the middle of the chechen conflict please don't let chechnya scare you away from this book as no previous knowledge is necessary that's one of the great things about this book - how the conflict is integrated into the story but without ever being burdened by heavy historical analysis the strength of this novel is the depth of character and the incredible sense of place the women marra's created here are simply incredible i'm so glad this book is finding its audience and frankly i'm happy that it's hitting its stride in the aftermath of the marathon bombing when americans may be more curious about chechnya than ever before this book will surely win awards at the end of the year and i will say i told you so","745":"i keep resisting this book even though one of my stalwart book recommenders michael kindness kept talking about it as one of the best books of the year i bought it based on his peer pressure and i'm so grateful i did it's devastating and wonderful at the same time the last 50 pages are heartbreaking and amazing absolutely beautiful writing","746":"3 5 stars there were so many parts that i loved and other portions fell flat the intertwining was wonderful but i prefer less confusing chapter flashbacks","747":"an incredibly well crafted and hard to read book","748":"i'm thoroughly impressed that this book is a debut a constellation of vital phenomena is about the 2 wars in chechneya in the 90s and 2000s it is both a tragic and redeeming tale just like many books about war zones there is a lot of terrible stuff and everyday sadness women into the story but what i enjoyed about the book was the strange interconnectedness between the characters which i thought was somewhat unique the author mentions that her inspiration was in part 2 biblical stories at least one of which is actively mentioned in the story i'd definitely recommend this book to friends i was captivated by the story and wanted to keep reading","749":"this book has been one of the best books i've read in a long time it's heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time the characters have stayed with me even now that i'm done","750":"i listened to this book and was so taken that i am reading it as well the relationship between akhmed and sonja is real very funny and bitter sweet","751":"beautiful raw tragic and real","752":"an amazingly well written book","753":" sorry but i don't understand what all the hype is about it's true there were some passages of gorgeous writing but for me they were overwhelmed by the the writing in which the author was turning somersaults to be clever flashy red author at work signs that peppered the book much of the dialogue sounded like lines from ncis those oh so witty one liners delivered during prime time tv and the flavor to me seemed completely american i never felt that i was in chechnya listening to people from chechnya it left me wondering how much the author had really attempted to understand the culture i was continually taken out of the story by lines that made me think really would someone from a rural village in chechnya know this or think this i felt throughout that the book skimmed the surface in all ways characters were superficial to the point that with all the jumping around in time it was hard to keep track of who was who setting did not give me a good sense of place and what i learned about the chechen wars was basically war is hell and lots of people lost body parts and or were disappeared by the time i neared the end i was just gritting my teeth waiting to reach the last page so i could find a good book to read i did not really care what happened to the characters because i never truly knew them to me good fiction is all about falling in love with the characters did not happen it is also about the willing suspension of disbelief that occurs when you are immersed in the fictive dream also did not happen i began this book with high expectations i kept waiting for those expectations to be fulfilled did not happen i was not impressed","754":"read my full review on my blog summer reading project at a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra","755":"this is a debut novel holy mackerel it's beautifully written exceptionally lyrical and utterly horrifying in its depiction of war torn chechnya absolutely brilliant","756":"this books makes you hang on every sentence magical writing","757":"so good great character development and clever plot lines that come together perfectly","758":"literary work of soul defining historical and cultural perspective highly recommend","759":"wow one of the best books i've read in awhile beautiful prose of war torn chechnya amazing first time novelist","760":"i really liked this book very haunting it was well written and though the timeline of the book is only five days the author is able to weave the past and the future into the narrative to create magic","761":"the story of chechnya from1994 2004 is told by a number of different characters this story of the collapse of a society the things people will accept as normal the else lengths people will go to save their life of the lives of others will leave you thinking for a long time","762":"high 3 excellent ending some odd writing tics","763":"the writing is beautiful but the story itself dragged on for me and despite their tragic circumstances i couldn't get involved with any of the characters","764":"an awesomely well written book that i speed read because i couldn't stop","765":" just devastating this remarkable novel of ordinary lives destroyed in chechnya circa 1994 2004 destroyed by war by stupidity by greed by terror by straight up pointless cruelty that author anthony marra has no personal connection with that specific time or place would make this notable as a writerly tour de force the cultural geographic and anthropological detail is astonishing for anyone much less for a young man born and raised in dc who attended college in southern california except that a constellation of vital phenomena is also a profoundly moving story filled with moments of bravery resilience and a capacity for love even in the face of the most severe sucker punches you or at least i could imagine and marra nails the war torn physical and emotional landscape the discomfort the powerlessness the deprivation the hunger the rubble the danger the tedium plus there's a surprising amount of humor not just black humor but goofy stuff too and even whimsy the plot involves four families three from a tiny chechnya village the fourth a pair of ethnic russian sisters none of whom are particularly religious or political but all of whom of course get sucked into bottomless pits of shit marra's structure is tricky in a good way as time loops around itself and we slowly see the connections that i got lost a few times i blame more on my increasingly addled brain and less on marra's storytelling this is his first novel i can't even imagine what he'll be up to next","766":"an extremely moving book about 4 families lives and struggle to survive during the chechnya war at the hands of the russian feds and rebels disturbing to read at times and disbelief at what a human being is capable of but beautifully written i was unable to put the book down","767":"an outstanding beautifully written and moving book so many fantastic descriptions that take one's breath away","768":"i really enjoyed this my kind of book great story a bit of history fantastic characters and beautiful writing a five star read for me enjoyed every page","769":"beautifully written and hauntingly tragic surprised it hasn't had more buzz","770":" i really enjoyed this book recommended to me by deena it follows a few people's stories during the chechen wars from 1996 to 2004 the book jumps around in time but each chapter begins with a timeline with the date highlighted the main characters include a little girl whose father is taken by the police her neighbor who rescues her and a doctor at the hospital he hides her in but as the book unfolds more characters who start out seeming like minor players become increasingly more relevant the writing was excellent as was the character development i also really enjoyed the unlikely connections he made between characters some of which the reader knows before the characters do i didn't know very much about this part of post ussr history and the author did a good job of including enough background so i could follow the story but not so much that i was bored by the history definitely recommend reading this and since this is his debut novel wow i look forward to future books of his","771":"a stunningly impressive debut novel about the endurance of the human spirit in the midst of the morally complex chechnyan conflict the characters are well defined and one empathises with them as they try to deal with the unenviable dilemma of their predicaments grim and intense but hauntingly compelling","772":"this story brings us the profiles of several significant and sympathetic characters whose lives psyches and morality are shaped by the desperation and instability that living in a time of civil war forces upon them the author weaves characters conflicts and choices together in a story that is interesting but emotionally unsettling one shares the overwhelming desolation that surrounds these characters as they try to move forward in their lives facing obstacles to their sense of security and well being at every turn the setting of chechnya in about a decade at the turn of the millennium is one that my generation heard mentioned routinely in the news yet i actually knew very little about it an american middle class mindset has few experiences to aid us in fathoming what marra's characters are living out through effective narrative he renders images and circumstances which allow us to see and feel the complexity and desolation of a culture that has been fraught with civil and ethnic strife for as long as can be remembered the unpredictable nature and scarcity of everything resources relationships civil rights law and order seems to lead characters into a lifestyle in which survival is the determining factor their reactions often precipitated by desperation appear to be imprudent but are the instinctual response such circumstances demand anthony marra's novel was compelling and this reader is left satisfied with the story's denouement but my satisfaction is perhaps accompanied by a quiet sense of appropriate angst how easily we neglect consideration of the uncertainty and disruption of life which so much of humanity survives while we whine about our first world problems i listened to this book on audible i believe there are better narrators that i would have preferred also the story is delivered thematically rather than chronologically in order to allow an evolving understanding of characterization and the significance of relationships at times i would find the time shift confusing especially if i was returning to the story after extended time away so one needs to pay attention to the chronology to deepen their engagement with the characters see amazon's interview w the author for a full appreciation of the title constellation of vital phenomena see the third question editorial reviews qu0026amp a with author http www amazon com constellation v #totallyworthit","773":" i was wavering between 3 and 4 stars but the ending sold me on rounding up for a lot of this book i was like ugh this is sooooo self serious even for a book about chechnya it's really self serious especially for a book about chechnya written by a white hipster looking dude from oakland wtf and it's kind of hard to follow because it jumps around so much i think it could have been streamlined a bit while still maintaining the narrative complexity and metaphorical significance that the author was going for but he brings everything together at the end in a way that's really powerful that gives a lot of emotional resonance to everything you've read such that you appreciate the whole thing more after you've finished plus there are a lot of beautiful images throughout the writing is actually really exquisite almost to the point where you hate the author for being so much more brilliant than you not that i'm speaking personally here or anything","774":"a fantastic read i was so hooked on this book i thought about it even when i wasn't reading it its a beautifully written story about the second war with russia in chechnya which i knew nothing about its a beautiful portrait of the human spirit both bad and good the characters will stay with you a long time as well as the life they led the story centers around havaa and eight year old girl whose father is taken and home burned in the middle of the night her neighbor akmad rescues her and takes her to another town to a doctor he has heard of and he also ends up working for her she is working in a hospital that should employ 500 but only 2 remain her and a nurse the story includes the other characters in havaa's life mostly her neighbors but they do play a big part the story is heartbreaking and moving and it will stay with you for a long time","775":"4 5 this book reminds me of the cellist of sarajevo both depict the struggle to retain humanity in war torn strife beautiful writing from a debut author she had but two notes in her and on the wire stretching between them her questions and answers warbled the same is just one example","776":"didn't finish this one pace was a little too slow for me","777":"i wanted to like this book so much more than i did i struggled with the occasional never ending words to describe a historical point time i enjoyed the book much more when there was dialogue it was a great story well written although a bit too much descriptive detail for me and baffling to take place over the course of five days","778":"it was difficult to get through the first half of the book you don't into the character development until the second half i will say that the ending is beautiful and poetic and fitting to the story","779":" i have read lots of russian novels and novels set in russia but none like this in so many ways it was brutal and depressing but what saves it is that we care about the characters why because they are worthy we see true glimpses of humanity in this sea of brutality even one of the bad guys has a backstory to explain why he does what he does mainly that worse guys dehumanize him but at least we understand why he does what he does i think the best word i can say about this book is haunting it will stick with me a long time and is well worth reading","780":"marrras first novel but reads like it was written by an old soul with experience of war and suffering and loss the narrative smoothly winds it's way through the wars of chechnya making the case for life not death as a constellation of vital phenomena a deeply moving book highly recommended","781":" not a light book and very reminiscent of bohjalian's work on armenia but this book is definitely worth your reading time an exploration of the chechnyan wars not from a political viewpoint but from the viewpoint of the people who endure them what emerges are wars of pointless cruelty for the sake of being cruel grasping and greedy leaders and their soldiers who care nothing for those they devastate and a poignant portrait of the very human inhabitants of one small village and the doctor who crosses their path","782":"a beautiful story i don't really even know what to say about it yet the interconnectedness of the lives of the characters and how real they are as people living in horrific circumstances is amazing the story was devastating and hopeful all at once i really loved it","783":"beautiful and tragic set in war torn chechnya the characters are introduced slowly within their own stories and are slowly meshed together into such an emotional ending this was one of my favorite books of 2013","784":"an amazing novel an astonishing first novel it reminded me at times of the english patient but it's also utterly original and entirely captivating and lyrical and haunting and moving","785":"this was a great book loved everything about it","786":"i am rarely at a loss for words but i truly do not have the vocabulary to describe the brilliance of this book two words read it","787":"extremely well written this gritty and heart wrenching tale follows a number of inter woven stories set in a war shattered chechnya in a sense the focal point of the book is havaa a young girl who becomes an orphan when her father is disappeared by the russian feds taken in by her uncle figure akhmed and later by the ethnically russian doctor sonja havaa captures the hearts of those around her and brings some lightness and hope back to lives defeated by war and loss other plot lines include sonja's search for her missing sister and khassan's struggle to deal with the knowledge that his son is an informer for the feds chapters alternate between the main storyline which takes place in 2004 and related events that happened in the decades leading up due to the shifting timeline and multiple storylines this is not a book to be read spread out over an extended period of time as i did by the time plot points were resolved i had often forgotten how they had begun and what seemingly significant details had originally meant nonetheless i found the book quite enjoyable if not uplifting and learned a lot about a part of the world and recent history that we very rarely hear talked about","788":"excellent book","789":"this story comes together like piecing a quilt the rich characters and events are interlaced beautifully going back and forth through time 1997 2004 in a time of war and horrendous turmoil the author develops a story that covers a 5 day period a simple story really but it's complexity flourishes with all the background details of each characters' life and the war it is a beautiful work of literature a story that will make you to think i highly recommend it","790":"more than just another war story this book is beautifully written with a mixture of characters that transcend the horrors of war as well as characters that succumb to the realities of living in a war torn country the best book i read in 2013","791":"it's a great book on a heavy topic i enjoyed it","792":"book of the year nominee for sure particularly poignant in the context of things in crimea","793":"beautiful tragic heartbreaking and hopeful a great portrayal of what it must be like to live in a war torn country and a first novel by a kid","794":"it took me a long time to get into it but once i was in i was completely hooked loved it haunting heartbreaking hopeful","795":"i really liked this story set in chechnya about two doctors struggling to save a child i enjoy reading about parts of the world that i don't know much about and chechnya is one of those the way the author wove the family drama with the political drama as well as the small town drama kept me very interested throughout the book","796":" gah okay this is quite possibly one of the most beautiful books i have ever read but it is so sad taking place in the chechnya in between the years 1994 and 2004 which i believe spans what they call the first and second wars not world war 2 obvi acovp follows the lives of several characters who sort of weave in and out of each others lives without even knowing it during this extremely violent and troubling time in eastern europe i liken my experience of reading this book to putting together a large puzzle every few pages you'd find a piece that fit with the rest of the puzzle and with that the larger picture and what these at first semi random characters essentially mean to each other becomes a little clearer in between that though you're wiping tears from the puzzle pieces this writer has this really cool technique whenever he names a character he will fast forward and tell you what happens in their lives in the future outside of the time span of the book which ends in 2004 for me this is an semi unknown bit of history i remember stuff going on over there but as a middle and high schooler i guess i wasn't as preoccupied with world events as i am now my one reference to chechnya and this makes me sound like a huge dip but it always makes me think of bridget jones diary when she's vacuuming in her underwear and is trying to memorize current event stuff so she can impress people at a book launch she can't say the word chechnya to save her life thank god i have this book now for a bit more of a credible reference if you don't shy away from sad books give this one a read it is good","797":"amazing book highly recommend","798":" this is the most beautiful book i've read in a long time i kept seeing the title all over the place on best of lists but had no idea what it was about so jumped in totally blind the novel is set in chechnya and jumps back and forth in time following the stories of a small group of characters and how the wars affect them havaa is a young girl her mother has died and her father has just been taken away akhmed a neighbor and good friend of her father's knows that he must protect havaa or they will come for her as well he finds sonja the head surgeon of the local hospital although only by default everyone else has fled and asks her to care for the girl sonja is dealing with her own demons specifically the loss of her sister she does not know where he sister went or if she is still alive this not knowing drives all that sonja does stunningly this is marra's first novel i can't stress how beautifully written it is and how it completely enveloped me every time i picked it up the characters are amazing portraits of a life i know nothing about yet they felt so real and so relatable all of those best of lists were right","799":"so beautiful and so very very painful","800":"absolutely a haunting 5 star novel","801":" perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written i ordered this book online from amazon simply because i had found a quote from within it on a tumblr account and i decided that i liked it so much that i wanted to buy the book to attempt and explain the genius that lies inside of it or the emotions that marra manages to make you feel would only be a waste of time we are introduced to a variety of different characters the one thing connecting them all is the devastation of war and as marra speaks of the tragedies of war and unravels the stories of these beloved characters it is hard not to attach your heart to every single aspect inside of this book this is not only a novel it is not only a story it is an understanding a comprehension of how immense love can be and how powerful it can make you breath taking heart breaking and beautiful all in one almost got my tissue box empty definitely recommended","802":"can't read this one fast too much you will miss mind wrenching story intertwining past and present and future in chechnya during the two wars","803":"i wish i could give this book ten stars it is absorbing enlightening funny profound graceful complicated glorious terrifying tender vivid heart wrenching gut wrenching truly brilliant writing the last line scene brought tears to my eyes spilling over i will simply quote a reviewer who said you simply must read this book","804":"for all the praise that followed this book's release i had a terribly hard time getting into it marra is an obviously talented writer just perhaps not one that suits me","805":" i feel like i'm the only person out there who doesn't think this is the best book in the world oh well an honest review is more important than just liking it because everyone else does first of all it started off so slow i'm talking like 200 pages of slow the names are all foreign and since i couldn't sit down for ten hours and read the book straight through every time i picked it back up i was totally lost all over again about who each character was i also had no background knowledge about chechnya but after doing a bit of wikipedia reading yes this is embarrassing as someone who teaches kids not to use wikipedia i understood a lot more about the history of chechnya and its people the characters in this novel weaved together nicely but i think i need a bit more dialogue and action in my books there are parts of the story that are lovely and i even laughed once maybe but i was definitely ready for it to be over when it concluded the girl slowly nodded and leaned into sonja listening to the gurgle of her organs these marvelous things we ignore forget and take for granted that's weird the girl said shifting the bell like an indecisive chess piece i've never seen a fat person before never never but in my souvenirs i have the autograph of a man who used to be fat","806":"for once the almost unanimous five stars given by readers to a book feels wholly justified i'd be very surprised if this brilliantly told story doesn't win a ton of awards","807":"looked forward with much anticipation to reading this novel set in chechnya the story is set during the chechen wars and the drive to save eight year old havaa amidst the war torn destruction devastation and drama as the story unfolds with the various characters - akhmed sonja dokka natasha - and subplots it lacks a certain connectedness and seems to have a rather clinical feel to it the book straddles the years 1994 to 2004 but the author's awkward style moving the reader back and forth between the years did not work very well for me so overall was rather disappointed in the book - was hoping to be thoroughly engaged given the setting and to learn and understand more about the wars and the people of chechnya finishing the book was a struggle and the only reason i finished it was i wanted to know the fate of havaa","808":"jonathon safran foer and hilary krause","809":"well i finished off the year with a beautfiully written but very depressing novel review will follow soon","810":" in this novel two doctors risk everything to save the life of a hunted child named havaa havaa is just eight years old when her neighbor akhmed finds her hiding in the woods watching her house burning down akhmed knows getting involved means risking his life but her father is an old friend and he risks it all deciding to take her to an abandoned hospital where a woman named sonja rabina runs a hospital almost single handedly sonja does not love kids...at all akhmed convinces her to keep havaa for a trial and over the course of five extraordinary days sonja's world will change in ways she never imagined the reader is taken on a journey through each of these character's past on an extraordinary journey of love loss and ultimately what it means to be human again because we are dealing with a wartime topic there is a lot of graphic violence gory medical scenes and violence in this book one torture scene in particular is difficult to read but can be skimmed over it is a necessary part of the book though to truly capture what is happening to the chechens for me it took a little bit to really get into the meat of the story mainly because of my own lack of education of what had happened in this country if you struggle in the beginning i encourage you to keep pushing on this book is one of the most accomplished books i have ever read it reads like poetry the narrative is so unique you will connect with every character in some way there are moments of unexpected humor and there is beauty in the pulling u0026amp weaving of these characters together join us in our momadvice book club discussion with anthony marra this month and enter to win a free copy of his book today enter here http momadvice com post february bo","811":"heart wrenching novel of war torn chechnya from the point of view of an ethnic russian doc and several chechnyan people love the style of writing and how the author did the ending not the ending i expected","812":"beautifully written excellent","813":"such a moving story people trying to live with horror and chaos around them","814":"one of those where the plot unfolds slowly with flashback flashforward set in chechnya during one of their wars heavy but i love that and smart and emotional and worth it","815":"a firecracker of a debut has the reader in a whirl of laughter and tears from cover to cover please please give this book to someone you love","816":"this was a well researched novel with a very lyrical prose which was admirable in some ways but what was disappointing was that i did not feel for any of the characters the storyline was richly dense and utterly boring at some point and i'm not sure if can really grasp the essence of the purpose of the plot the origin of the title i'm still looking as it was supposed to be found in a medical book and i don't know where i tried looking it up in guyton but i was not successful maybe in another physiology book i hope i get to read this book again in my spare time and really try to let ends meet and dissect the book to its core","817":" i picked up this book because the crimea conflict was in the news and i wanted to get a feel for russia's past this is a searing book about the war in chechnya and there were many sections of the book that were brilliant i particularly loved the storyline involving sonia havaa and ahmed not sure i am spelling his name right but i didn't have sufficient patience to get through some of the longer passages particularly those paragraphs that seemed to be pages long i am an impatient reader these days and so i think the beautiful writing was a bit wasted on me that being said it is a credit to the story that i didn't give up and i pushed on to the end and am very glad i did the younger version of me would have given this five stars","818":"this is the kind of book that reminds me why i love reading the story folds and unfolds so perfectly heartbreaking and funny at the same time but overall heartbreaking highly recommended","819":" a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra introduces you to the ordinary people of a small village whom are suffering from the impact of the war in chechnya the story opens with havaa an eight year old child that fled into the woods to escape the feds who took her father and burned her house down she had lived in the tiny village of eldar which had a long list of disappearances until there was barely any people left she was rescued by akhmed the village doctor who was a better artist than doctor and taken to the hospital of nearby city of volchansk akhmed chose to take her there because he thought the remaining one doctor sonya an ethnic russian could protect her the feds had a policy of killing the family of the disappeared an informer warns they will kill havaa and call it peace the story takes place in five days but it is filled with detours into the past and the future to give the reader a sense of the larger picture the title is taken from a definition of life in an old medical dictionary life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation seemingly where there is life there is hope despite the grim and desperate circumstances anthony marra is able to impart a wildly impossible sense of optimism for the future and a faith in the survivors ability to create a better life for themselves this was an excellent book and i look forward to more books from this talented author","820":"this is easily one of the very very best books i've ever read i love everyone in it even with their flaws probably because of their flaws despite the grim setting there is so much heart and wit on every page there are peripheral details crammed throughout but they enrich and support the pace of the story rather than bog things down and the dialogue the dialogue on pages 22 24 we fall in love with deshi on pages 107 110 sonja has an exchange with a black marketeer which i would like to read daily for the rest of my life it starts out with you saved alu's life the brother said setting the cigarette between his delicate lips moisturized nightly with aloe balm for that i owe you a favor a small one because of my six brothers i like alu the least on page 110 the merchant's description of the ice machine is the most fun one can have with war and grift there is a sentence on page 138 not dialogue but still that continues through to page 140 which is close to writing perfection the names and addresses sewn into seams the names carved and then covered in mud in the pit at the landfill the mural of the city at the hospital the way the threads of the story are intertwined the flashes back to the past and forward to the future to round out what we know and the final paragraph is possibly the best ending to any story ever","821":"an absolutely incredible book i finished it a few weeks back and cannot stop thinking about it incredible how the lives of the characters were woven together through the course of time i have a great respect of authors who accomplish this and this one was beautifully done it is on my list of favorite things in 2014 to share with my family for christmas this year","822":"this is a gruesome story told in a very touching way it's tough to write about war in any other way but at the end of the book you are still left with a lot of hope and contentment very well done recommend","823":"i don't understand how this book got as many excellent reviews 4 5 stars as it did it was a chore to read the story was so twisted and characters intertwined that i often wondered what the author's purpose was in doing this i also got tired of marra adding what a character would be doing in the future it got very tedious after a while i'll be very hard pressed to read his next book whenever that may be","824":"scary insight into that part of the world chechnya","825":"get through the first half of the book and then all the loose threads start to come together to weave a heart wrenching and beautiful story that is hard to put down","826":"this was really quite a well written and substantial novel set in chechnya over the last decade the depiction of chechnya is frightening but i'm sure accurate characters exist in varying degrees of hardship and hopelessness a young girl's father is kidnapped early on and the book revolves around what happens to her and a couple of unrelated adults who take it upon themselves to watch over her i thought this was quite a good book but it just didn't really resonate with me i had a hard time starting around the 2nd half of it in terms of it not maintaining my interest i think i was just out of my element and the war setting just didn't interest me","827":"i just finished this outstanding novel and have to honestly say that this was one of the better novels i've read in the past year the way the auther weaves the lives of the characters together was masterful the ending was especially difficult to get through i will admit i shed a tear or two this is not a novel with much happiness to grab onto but it truly demonstrates the various levels of human kindness and love","828":"this book was tragic but so beautiful it tells the story of several lives that are woven together in war torn chechnya yes there is swearing torture and lots of sad events but the writing is amazing and the story is haunting","829":"meg storey editor tin house books i seem to be on a genocide kick and have just read two amazing debut novels about two horrific conflicts anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena set in chechnya and ismet prcic's shards about bosnia while very different in style and tone both novels are beautifully written and heartbreaking and somehow manage to depict the atrocities of war while conveying a sense of the absurdity that pervades these situations for example in marra's book a doctor who has not had any news of the outside world in years confuses ronald mcdonald for ronald reagan when he learns who ronald mcdonald is he is horrified by the idea of people eating hamburgers cooked by a clown given the circumstances he's been living under his reaction to this information creates a moment of humor and well he does have a point but more importantly these books made me realize that despite the news stories i heard and the statistics i read and my understanding that a lot of people were dying somewhere far away i knew very little about the actual people who experienced those wars these novels reminded me that one of the biggest reasons i read fiction is to learn about the lives of others especially lives so completely different from my own that said i should probably take a break from genocide novels and read something about kittens and rainbows if anyone has any suggestions meg story editor tin house books the best novel i read this year was anthony marra's debut a constellation of vital phenomena set in chechnya which is beautifully written and heartbreaking and somehow manages to depict the atrocities of war while conveying a sense of the absurdity that pervades it for example a doctor who has not had any news of the outside world in years confuses ronald mcdonald for ronald reagan when he learns who ronald mcdonald is he is

point but more importantly the book made me realize that despite the news stories i heard and the statistics i read and my understanding that a lot of people were dying somewhere far away i knew very little about the actual people living in chechnya and how the conflict affected their daily lives marra's novel reminded me that one of the biggest reasons i read fiction is to learn about the lives of others especially lives so completely different from my own","830":" getting into this novel was tedious for me i was not fining it enjoyable or even interesting for the first 15 chapters at that point my interest level started to peak the remainder of the book kept me involved and wanting to find out what happened to several of the characters the historical aspect of this book helped me understand the political conflicts somewhat better than when i started reading i did of online to read further about the issues surrounding the wars the brutality was staggering am i gals i read it yes would i recommend it probably not","831":"was very slow and kind of whatever for me for most of the book but made up for it in the last two chapters when it actually managed to pull a tear from my usually very cynical eye","832":" i agree with kim and katie this book is at times breathtakingly beautiful and at times breathtakingly heartbreaking in its description of life in chechnya during the civil wars the writing was amazing and i loved to understand more and more throughout the course of the book how the lives of all of the characters intersected in multiple ways it felt like a real and honest depiction of the brutality of war but also the power of love and human connection to at times break through some of that brutality","833":"beautiful writing and so painful i couldn't make myself read much past the halfway mark and i don't intend to pick it up again","834":" loved this book this book is what literature can be it is the reason people read the reason books are published so we can get a glimpse of a life and see the ins and outs and in the end relate it back to the circle of humanity that defines us all i would call this book fiction for men and place it at the top of that category i believe the in depth military workings and the details of war and death and torture will be too heavy for many women although not being a woman i'm not sure the book is funny heartbreaking wonderful the world it conjures is so three dimensional as to almost be a diorama wonderful complex characters and a slice of war torn life told over five amazing days reiterate what it means to feel to love to be human in a world with no black and white we see the colour of humanity that lives in us all in this amazing enchanting book this will be at the top of the best of 2013 books pick it up early","835":"not an easy book nor a quick read but i loved it highly recommended","836":"meh it was so hard to get maybe i got it in the last 30 minuets if i hadn't had it on audio i would have never made it to the end 1 4 mark or 1st chapter","837":" i had read someone's list of life changing books and this was on it i really tried to resist being sucked into this story but i failed and am so grateful it is a compelling tragedy of survival in post soviet ruled chechnya if i didn't know it is based on truths it would be too dark grim and frightening to imagine that people are trying to live this life every day i have been humbled by these people fictional and their stoicism and bravery i highly recommend reading this brilliant novel you will not forget it and that is thee sign of a great book it does have a good ending for some just like real life i don't think we can ask more from a book or our own lives","838":" one of the most beautifully written books i've read anthony marra is an amazing writer the story was haunting and compelling mr marra takes the politics out of the conflict in chechnya and gives us a brutal yet hopeful account of the civilians the collateral damage of the carnage of war the lives and destinies if the characters intertwine in an elegant manner the way words are used to convey the incomprehensible loss two brothers in what is a long three page sentence is amazing i loved everything about this book and think it is an important tale for those of us who have been lucky enough not to have lived in war to read","839":"i don't even know how to verbalized the power of this book has had for me the beauty and honesty of humanity has never been reflected so well in any book i have read i will read this book again and again","840":" i have mixed feelings about this book on one hand i didn't know anything about the chechen russian conflict so that was interesting to learn about although the history lessons are few and far between so i feel like i still don't fully understand it on the other hand i had a very difficult time connecting to any of the characters until the last two chapters at least i ended on a good note with most of them it also had way too many f words in the book 2 3 per chapter would i recommend it not sure what to tell you","841":" anthony marra's debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena is a heart rending story of the inevitable tragedies war inflicts on civilian population it is also a uplifting tale of moral courage it succeeds as a novel because it does what the best novels do transport the reader into another place and time the place of the novel is chechnya the time is 2004 the second chechen war has sputtered to a halt with russian federal forces in control of the momentarily independent republic the novel takes place over five days but moves back in time ten years to vividly illustrate how the country came to be in its current condition the novel wraps around six characters during these particular five days but with a haunting and melancholy backdrop of the past for the majority of these characters the human spirit although dampened and weak eventually triumphs marra is no giddy eyed optimist however there are some dark and twisted people lurking in this novel if this had triumphed it would have been a much different and i venture a far less interesting book like many people i knew only vaguely of the troubles in chechnya and that was mostly due to the terrorist incidents that reached out of chechnya into the heart of russia a massacre at a russian school bombings on the moscow metro and murder at a moscow theatre i was also aware the the russian army was waging a brutal and horrific campaign in chechnya the fighting in the capital city of grozny was the equal of some of the most vicious russian german urban fighting of the second world war marra reveals the reason for the war after the fall of the soviet union the emergent russian republic gladly shed almost all of the twenty two republics that made up the former u s s r but not chechnya the reason marra adduces is oil russian could not afford to let the country gain its independence as the novel recounts the fate of that struggle the war of independence so quickly conflated with jihad because no one cared about the self determination of a small landlocked republic arab states would gladly fund a war of religion but not one of nationalism and in this way it didn't matter who won the war between the feds and fundamentalists the notion of a democratic and fully sovereign chechnya would be crushed regardless yet understanding the geo political situation is not necessary to reading the novel indeed one of the novel's strengths is that these background facts are slowly filled in as the personal stories are told it is a wonderfully human story and a worthy debut for this young author","842":"gut wrenchingly sad but so powerful i was swept into the story in such a visceral way that there were points where i had to put it down i was so overwhelmed mr marra's writing is fantastic and his tale of life in chechnya is wonderful","843":"this is a book that made me pause reflect and pause again to say this was an excellent book would be an understatement this is a story about death grief hope and joy the story takes place in worn torn chechny and flashes back over the characters lives during 5 precious days it begins with the horror of a father dokka taken violently away by the feds during the middle of the night he saves his 8 year old daughter haava by forcing her out into the black of night with her already packed suitcase she is found by akhmed the neighbouring doctor who makes it his mission to ensure her safety and leads her to the one remaining hospital where he delivers her to the doctor sonja the story traces the character's lives and the moral choices they have made in their struggle to survive this is not a light read and be prepared to be drawn in emotionally i give it 5 stars","844":" i loved this book which is a little strange because i didn't always enjoy reading this book this book is not an entertaining read though it is fascinating at times i found reading it a bit difficult since i was not familiar with the wars in chechnya in addition the action jumps back and forth through time as it fills in the blanks of the story the non linear events took some getting used to despite my difficulties i found this book completely worth the effort it aptly illustrates the devestating effects of war it effectively demonstrates how war alters the very essence of the human spirit every character is both a hero and a villain both good and evil capable of the tenderest mercies and the vilest betrayals tragedies pile up as the story unfolds this is a heavy book however the book is not without humor and hope the very best of mankind is revealed in the simple interactions of the characters i love how perfectly understated this novel is the emotional moments were powerfully poignant in their simplicity marra incorporates layer upon layer of symbolism and meaning in his story this is the type of book that i could read multiple times and each time discover something new i liked how each character's hands reflected their personality i loved the emphasis on touch and its ability to create connections i enjoyed the little snippets of the characters' futures which were interspersed through the story there is so much to ponder upon in this book i would highly recommend this book but only to a reader who is ready to dig deeply and work at a novel there is nothing light and fluffy about this book but it is well worth the effort","845":"every book podcast i listened to raved about this debut novel from anthony marra and after finishing it i can see why the detail description characters and prose was impressive and definitely transformed you into another time and place it takes place in chechnya over the course of a 5 6 year span of time and follows several characters who connect to each other in one way or another there is akhmed who is protecting the daughter of a friend who disappeared in the night never to return he meets sonja who runs a hospital nearby and uses his lackluster medical talents to add assistance to her diminished staff akhmed is also battling with ramzan who is the notorious informant in his village that makes people disappear and his father khassan who hasn't spoken to his traitor son in 1 1 2 years because he disagrees with what he is doing their lives are in constant flux during the chechen wars and are trying to protect each other from the ever looming end i didn't know if i would like this based on it taking place in a location i am unfamiliar with as well as being set during wars which usually carry no interest for me i think the reason i enjoyed it so much is because i really got involved in the characters and their hardships and wanted things to go well for them i also highly enjoyed how well the book was written and was impressed it was written by a 26 year old debut novelist i highly recommend to everyone","846":"what an amazing book upon completion i closed the book said wow and tried to keep from crying easily one of the best books i've read this year can't wait to see what else this author writes in the future i learned so much about a time and place that i was pretty clueless about","847":"this is one of the most beautifully written books i have read in a very long time thank you anthony marra for this wonderfully sad poignant and insightful book about a small group of people at their very best when things are at their very worst","848":" another over hyped book that fell short to the expectations the original idea is good and his details are obviously researched but the execution resorts to emotionalism and over sentimentality not sure if he was going for the \"russian way\" but he has a long way to go before managing to tap into the \"russian soul\" a lot of unnecessary similes floating around to emphasize intensity don't do the flow of text any favors either in the end the characters appear as generic and rather one dimensional even predictable in how they turn out hopefully he will hone down and refine his writing in the second one","849":" this is an excellent 1st novel of a young author who has researched the material u0026amp lived on site in chechnya where the action takes place between 1994 u0026amp 2004 it covers both chechnyan wars

are woven together into the story which though full of cruelty is not without hope","850":"sharing life with a little girl and her guardian in tchetchenie may not seem like a lot of fun but this story brims with life and dwells on its twists surprises and musings a book to carry in one's soul for a very long time","851":"one of the hardest books i've ever read the hopelessness of war torn chechnya will haunt me","852":"one of the best books i have ever read the author hooked me from the start with his use of words to described the characters and scenes i won't lie to you the storyline is heavy but you will find yourself weaving through it quite easily thanks to the author must read","853":" a constellation of vital phenomena is the definition of life in a russian medical dictionary anthony marra's novel encompasses the lives of villagers within chechnya the characters range from a talented doctor who regularly amputates limbs to a untalented doctor who regularly sketches people's images and posts them around the village havaa is rescued by akhmed the doctor who is more of an artist than a doctor havaa's father is abducted and akhmed take havaa to the only place that can save her the hospital sonja the talented surgeon is reluctant to help havaa but in the end doing this act of kindness completes sonja's world in so many interconnected puzzle pieces this book opened my clueless mind to the history of chechnya and the horrors of war that still linger on our earth a mind expanding book to read with anthony marra having the great ability to explain human nature","854":"this novel contains many moments of beauty and much careful imagined observation i occasionally got lost from this particular strand of roving p o v","855":"a haunting difficult beautiful story that will stay with me for a long time","856":"what a ride was this book i will share my experience reading this book without telling anything about the characters or the history first of all the whole chechnya history and the war kept me away for this book a few weeks to the point of thinking about not reading this book at all but boy i'm glad to follow this silly rule of mine always finish a book that i already started no matter what for a first time publishing a book anthony marra is a genius the narrative was the best jumping in time and telling a beatiful history about the struggle and connecting all the characters at once definitely the best fiction book i've read so far","857":"i cannot remember the last time i dragged out reading a book i actually wanted to devour just so i could extend the experience of reading it this book broke my heart and made me laugh and i had to pause a lot to savor the writing","858":" this story covering only 5 days follows a small group of people struggling to survive in chechnya though the time period is short there are flashbacks to previous years to explain the characters' motivations at times the plot seemed slow but the writing was often so beautiful i especially liked how the author told what would happen to even the minor characters for example it would be 8 years and 7 months before he would when he continues this as the book ends wrapping up the stories of the main characters it's both heartbreaking and hopeful","859":"this one was tough for me it was very interesting and i learned a lot about chechnya i had no idea of the two wars within a decade and of the horrible destruction and desperation that occurred there this book was basically depressing through and through i usually like time shifts within a book but found the back and forth here kind of confusing as it would jump from 1996 to 2004 then 2002 back to 2004 then 1996 etc sometimes i couldn't remember what was supposed to have happened in which time period it was well written and there were many things i really enjoyed but by the end i was craving something a little less heavy","860":"what a heart wrenching gruesome novel about life and loss wartime novels tend to hold a level of depth that can be difficult to read and specifically the torture and interrogation in this novel was no exception i found some of the political history to be overwhelming and that it weighed down the novel and make it longer than necessary overall the main storyline kept me engaged and i found it beautifully written","861":" amazing book about the horrors of chechnya from 1990s through 2006 but the book highlights how we are related to each other the title is around a medical term describing all that is going on physically in our bodies but it could also mean all these people and how they are related in so many way ahmed an inept doctor who really wants to be a portraiture takes hava to a hospital after her father has been taken away by the feds and their house burned eventually we see how all of the main characters are related in some manner the ending is like a spiral of constellations as the author explodes past the current day and looks at the surviving characters and their lives in a few years decades and beyond beautiful characters graphic descriptions perhaps the best book i've read this year","862":"if you want to try to understand the country called chechnya begin here and then continue","863":"okay but for reals i picked this book from the list because it was about russia russia is kind of a constellation of vital phenomena is the story of survival--but not your typical survival story it's a story about love but also not a love story i received this book for free from blogging for books for this review because of that i really had no idea what i was getting into i loved this book for the raw emotion and i hated this book for the raw emotion clearly emotion is hard for me  okay but for reals i picked this book from the list because it was about russia russia is kind of a big deal right now--first the sochi olympics earlier this year then the whole invasion of ukraine thing i thought this book might help me to have a better world view of that and in some ways it did really i learned about what people do to survive i read about loving so deeply and caring so much and using it as a coping mechanism when all is crashing down around you i learned that love leads to betrayal in the darkest of times i learned that caring about people and caring for people can be two completely separate things but in the end they're the deepest connection we have overall i liked this book i think there was a little bit too much and by that i mean a lot too much sexual content for my taste--but like i said i really didn't know what i was getting into when i picked this book i'd give it 3 stars and a pg13 rating","864":"an amazing and powerful book think a mix of michael chabon and joseph heller both laugh out loud funny and heartbreaking at the same time this is the best book i've read so far all year","865":" seriously my brain hurts from reading this book complex foreign painful and terrifying but it's also beautiful superbly written and introduced me to another foreign place this time chechnya i can't say i enjoyed it in fact i had to digest it in small samplings not just because of the harrowing subject matter but also because marra writes in very long comma filled sentences and i sometimes had to re read them a few times he's a gifted writer but it's a style that requires very close attention i also had difficulty keeping the characters storylines and chronology straight in the first half in the end all of the components came together and it's an excellent novel especially for a debut","866":"amazing book i loved the prose the flow and the entire story line the vantage of war ladden chechnya was a unique one for me the story was a sad one but with immense amounts of hope brilliantly written","867":"mesmerizing and disturbing this book will haunt me for a while superb details excellent character development the writing which varies from lyrical to flippant perfectly captures the essence of the characters marra is an author to follow","868":"a bit dark but a very engaging story","869":"too bleak beautifully written though","870":"not an easy read but well worth the effort this story will stay with me heart rending vivid characters could not help admiring the author's techniques of weaving multiple characters and years throughout the book amazing beautiful passages make you want to read outloud at times a must read tragic and moving novel","871":"3 5 starsvery very well written with memorable characters and some beautiful and heartbreaking passages but this is definitely the kind of book you only read once just because it's so unrelentingly depressing i also was not in love with the occasional random flash forwards i understood theoretically why they were there but they often seemed quite jarring","872":" i've been very picky in reading this past spring literally put down 7 out of 12 books without finishing this novel by anthony marra is an dramatic exception i first picked the book up when it began appearing on lists nominating it for various national and international book awards last year i was particularly intrigued because i knew anthony from when he participated in a writer's forum some 10 years back from this what i knew of the book in advance was that it was intelligent and stark with some risks taken in multiple narrative threads what i found was an intelligent sometimes poetic emotionally powerful insight into individual lives of civilians during the wars in chechnya there is an idiosynchratic spirit to the novel the voice is clean unhurried and lyrical with an hand that reminds me most of tolstoy with the definite ironic note i have sensed in other fiction from eastern european fiction during after war and communism as a writer myself i was taking note of marra's narrative structure at the top of each chapter is a timeline band highlighting the relevant years for that chapter some risks are taken in the ways that marra plays with voice as the narrative fluctuates in varying degrees of 3rd person the most basic structure is that each chapter begins with close 3rd on one of 4 main characters line spacing mid chapter usually then signals a shift to close 3rd from another main character's pov frequently however particularly in traumatic encounters with other players in the war such as arrival in the er of a man whose leg was blasted apart by a landmine narrative voice shifts to omniscience for 1 3 lines revealing inner secrets thoughts or future outcome of random characters the narrative also takes on the challenge of time the novel is structured to cover the 5 days after one man is disappeared but each chapter clearly takes on how the past 20 years of memories led each of the characters to the events of these 5 days the complexity of the structure is pulled off beautifully the concept of the novel itself is powerful i was continually impressed at marra's ability to deliver with nuanced subtlety how each individual progresses through the insane or horrifying events of war or warlike behavior in supposed peacetime he manages to present the factual history in a manner that is seamless with the characters' individual voices and storylines what is most powerful are the characters while it is a novel revealing truisms of war it is ultimately a novel about love and compassion and the warmly developed lives of characters in this small village each character is vivid intriguing and their stories compelling congrats to anthony marra for making the short list as his a constellation of vital phenomena makes my top reads of 2014","873":"incredible read","874":"4 5 stars i listened to the audio by audible com this was my favorite book of 2014 horrifying brutal details of war and acts of inhumanity made me want to abandon this book i stayed with it because every character was believably flawed and compelling i needed to know what would become of each of them i'm glad i stayed with it","875":" beautiful writing painful subject matter and a look back at my own country's messy history writer has done excellent research and put it in masterful writing full of feeling no happy endings here deep sadness and poignant agony permeate the book so much so that with every turning page i could feel the gloom descending and enveloping the characters before i would even read words on the page the book is almost too depressing but it reads beautifully albeit slow at times like a dark lullaby","876":"i couldn't decide on a 4 or a 5 rating the ending most definitely a 5 phew powerful achingly sad","877":" spanning a decade and two wars in chechnya a constellation of vital phenomena tells the story of several characters over a few days as they flashback in time to weave their stories together never would i have expected to enjoy this book it's about war in chechnya a place that if i'm honest i can barely find on a map i'm guessing it's near kazakhstan no wait it's in between dagestan and georgia okay then as a reader as a writer as someone who loves language and all the ways it can be put together to tell a story this is one of the most beautifully written heart breaking life affirming brutal mesmerizing haunting books i've ever read anthony marra succeeds at giving those who would otherwise be nameless if not faceless an infusion of humanity that makes them vibrant complex gorgeous and grotesque why is the book so titled the constellation of vital phenomena is the following organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptation all of these aspects are present within the story and they are so integrated that they seem natural and hence real i know this review is only going to appeal to maybe five of my friends if that but seriously trust me pick this book up and read it the experience will transform you if nothing else it will make you intensely grateful for living where and when you do which should give you empathy for those who don't","878":"one of the best novels i have read in years excellent writing pathos the insanity of war the struggle for survival sublime friendships death with dignity when dignity is in short supply this is the kind of book you read slowly because you don't want to get to the end","879":"whilst well written i didn't find myself engaged with the book and thus i lacked empathy for the characters or their fate i particularly didn't like the projections forward with the would statements i found them annoying the swapping of times via a timeline depiction at the beginning of each chapter was clever i kept waiting for more emotion found it really difficult to get into then i couldn't wait to get to the end so i could read something i'll enjoy more not surprised it is getting much better reviews by others however not a book i would read again","880":"the book is slow reading it did not flow well for me but with that said the author did inject little bits of humor into the story that are unexpected considering the darkness of the wartime and i had to know what happens to havaa","881":"in this debut novel chechnya is the subject with a castof complicated and haunted characters there is akhmed whocares for his invalid wife and walks ten miles to his jobat hospital no 6 he is an assistant to the brilliant surgeonsonja who is the only doctor there after the fall of thesoviet union chechnya endured two wars for independence the refugees the disappeared the injured and abandonedare all portrayed with touching detail and insight","882":"knew this was a chechen war story and though it was unbearably sad it was also filled with such love and even quiet humour this description of our political system on page 69 had me laughing out loud and you can only be preseident for ten years she added and then what you become prime minister for a bit and then run for president again i think you just step down you mean ronald just stepped down after ten years he asked she had to be putting him on he just stepped down and george bush became president and then george bush shot ronald reagan to prevent him seizing power no she said i think they were friends friends he asked it makes me wonder how we lost the cold war","883":"probably one of the best books i have read in a long time it is one where you become so engrossed in the characters you hate to leave them an excellent insight into the complexities of war set during the first and second chechnyan wars","884":"darkly humorous yet tender plot jumps back and forth in time with flashbacks dropped in which i found distracting rich empathizable characters","885":"a great book full of fantastic literary themes not to mention a perspective on chechnya which is much more involved than the cable news updates that crop up whenever tensions overflow in that region yet even though i enjoyed and appreciated the read i didn't have anywhere near the reaction of many reviewers here there just wasn't that emotional connection or moment where everything clicks together such is life i suppose","886":"loved this book sad and beautiful story","887":"this is not a easy book to read some really tough parts but it is worth it i would rate as 4 5 it is a bit confusing but a really fine first book","888":"this book hollowed me out in places it was so beautifully written in a stark way don't let your eyes skip ahead to the dialogue there's good stuff in the prose i just wonder why humans are capable of being so amazing and so very horrible","889":"beautifully written the author is somehow able to make you feel for and identify with every character good or bad this is an excellent example of great storytelling read it","890":"it took me a while to read this but i loved it i can't wait to see what else anthony marra can come up with","891":" i've just finished reading this incredibly powerful heartbreakingly moving novel well i actually finished it about an hour ago the time in between was spent trying to control my sobbing then wiping my soggy face then taking several breaths to calm myself i was fortunate to find a signed copy at northshire bookstore during booktopia and i'm so glad i added it to my purchases i have not been so touched by a book in a long looong time it's beautifully written which is a strange statement to make about something that details man's inhumanity to man but it also demonstrates how it is possible to rise above the horror of war and in spite of that horror how splendidly some people behave i instinctively clutched the book to my chest in the midst of my crying and i smiled when i read some of the reviews before posting this one because i had forgotten michael's clutchable remark it will be read again not right away but i have a feeling that these characters will stay with me for quite awhile and i want to revisit them even though the visit will be painful","892":"beautiful and haunting novel about russian and chechen families","893":" life a constellation of vital phenomena this novel was absolutely fantastic the only reason i rate it 3 stars is because of the complexity level of the varying plots and the inconsistent time i had to read a novel like this should probably be read in less than two weeks but because of all of my responsibilities it took closer to two months the idea of a human life is evident as the setting takes place in wartime russia in the early 21st century without ever focusing on the actual battlefield but instead in a hospital sustaining human life with the impossible search for the lost sister of the head of the hospital there were flashbacks as far as 1994 for the different characters especially evident in this novel was anthony marra's wit and genius with his word choice and sentence fluency the characters were hilarious and poignant at times that allowed you to laugh or see the their growth and humanity","894":"the title had me interested and the reviews had me certain it was to be a favorite i liked it okay but it didn't live up to the hype for me","895":" a fictional work written about several individuals in a small village in chechnya centering around the second chechen war i actually listened to this audiobook and wanted to listen to it again and again it is full of rich stories of survival love and the human condition there are not enough words to describe how beautifully this is written and how touching each person's story is the author takes the reader in only a few days through the course of several years history intricately connecting each person to the other through acts of love and compassion","896":"disturbing fascinating hard to read i knew chechnya is a place but that's it now i see it as a haunting place","897":"4 5 informative and heartbreaking thanks doreen for recommending this","898":"set over the period of 5 days in a war torn chechen hospital this book weaves flashbacks with present day experiences this book has beautiful language and and interesting insight into a lesser know area of the world","899":"this book was not a light easy read i was intimidated in the beginning due to my lack of knowledge about chechnya but marra does a beautiful job of unraveling the devastating history of this small russian republic there are so many feelings that arose in me while i read this book truly interesting and eye opening worth the read","900":"the prose is beautiful the setting and story unique and anthony marra pulled off the non linear format which usually isn't my favorite masterfully definitely save this one for when you'll have the time to truly get lost in his writing","901":"who would think a book about war in chechnya could be this good absolutely loved it","902":" i may be a little breathless here but i think this is the best first novel i've read since ... to kill a mockingbird at least since special topics in calamity physics or the evolution of bruno littlemore high praise indeed but this book earns it every sentence shimmers and the intricately plotted deeply researched and highly moving plot drives to a devastating conclusion the book concerns a complex love friendship triangle that takes place during the two chechnyan wars of the late 1990s early 2000s i don't want to review the plot but i will describe one little device marra uses repeatedly - he will occasionally summarize a character's arc with a one or two sentence peek forward into their future telling you what will happen in three months two years 16 years or the end of the life it sounds awful but it adds richness and context to an already rich portrayal of his characters the book took me a little while to really dive into it's a pretty bleak place and not familiar to westerners but worth it a very enriching read grade a","903":"beautiful engrossing heartbreaking uplifting compelling haunting brilliant amazing this is a must read mrs p","904":"phenomenal this is a perfect example of why i love good historical fiction this is one of those books that i will never forget filled with people so real that it hurts to think about what they went through i learned so much from this book much of it heartbreaking all of it rich and full of life and desperation this book asks all of the hard questions what do we do when survival itself is no longer necessarily the best choice who will we betray when we are pushed beyond our own ability to perceive pain what matters in the end is there an end marra's writing is incredible he manages to show people as multi dimensional and expertly defies the linear nature of time to show the past and the future intertwining in everything from a coat to a nation he makes the reader think laugh cry and despair","905":"this is probably a really good book i think it just made me realize how little i like historical fiction just couldn't get into it personally no judgement","906":"this filled me with a heaviness i haven't felt while reading a book in a long time so many praises for the prose i reread so many sentences and wanted to quote so many passages the characters are ingeniously intertwined and i didn't expect to love them as much as i did the way the story takes readers back and forth between the past and present is wonderfully done and the emotions this story elicits are so rich the humor and descriptors made me smile in an otherwise very heavy book readers shouldn't be daunted by the history this book presents because the story isn't a history lesson the story is about people living somehow living and surviving through war conflict and the aftermath of it all the title itself demonstrates that and you'll only know what i mean by reading the book also i love the title even though at first i thought it was obscure and a bit of a mouthful this is a unique work of fiction that is haunting and beautiful and excellently crafted ann patchett compared it to foer's everything is illuminated and i see the comparison but for people who didn't enjoy that they will surely enjoy this i found that this book is so much more clearer and not at all confusing or obscure the prose so much better and the story far more captivating","907":"so well written just read it","908":" this is one beautifully written and inspired book with fully realized characters each with intricately detailed histories and personalities you will feel compassion hope deep sadness and just as tortured as the protagonists with each page even the extraneous characters are made unforgettable by the tiniest details and shortest glimpses into their pasts why only four stars then with such high praise for the writing i had trouble keeping up... as important to the art as the details are they also left me confused as times the story jumps through time as often as the bombs fall as quickly as hope fades and resurfaces and that was difficult for me to maneuver so subtracted from the overall experience for me lots of people didn't seem to have this problem though so read the book upon finishing i'm left with the following a more perfect title would be difficult to choose i close this book haunted by the impact of one's past our choices and environment and fate and the actions of those around us weighing equally in our journeys through life humanity and respect in all its promise does little to explain or justify our connections to one another through interactions and the items we own through those we touch and the people and things we hold most sacred we can't comprehend complexity emotion regret or shame or desire or truth or sadness or joy from one point of view but only from every angle","909":"magnificent language and strong intriguing characters make this book a stand out the story is depressing and in some parts difficult to read but at the same time it casts a net of hope around the reader i loved the messages transmitted to all about family love loyalty i","910":"i thought this book was really well written i loved how you ultimately know everyone's fate even extremely minor characters i didn't know much about the wars in chechnya though i recalled hearing about it when i was younger and this was a good introduction for people who want to look into it further the back of the book contained the references to other books i would love to know what these people look like i never got a good handle on what akmhed or sonja looked like","911":"an excellent book a very unique way of story telling that comes together very nicely a great way of presenting the horror of wars very sad but unfortunately a reality","912":"this novel was pretty consistently engaging the whole way through it was beautiful and sad even sadder though is that i know so incredibly little about these conflicts in chechnya so in that regard it was definitely an eye opener definitely a solid read","913":"although rather a dark topic and time frame the novel is character driven with people from different backgrounds who come together in this book learning about chechnya was educational i found the book fascinating","914":"beautiful writing heartbreaking story read it","915":"the best book i have read so far this year will make you laugh break your heart shock you things you should and should have known about chechnya so many","916":"it is difficult to read about war about the moral quandaries that humans should not have to face about being a part of a community and yet an individual wanting to survive and wanting to do the right thing unable to de either it is even more difficult to write about them i try marra succeeds i suppose the strength and weakness in marra's story of the chechnya conflict is that it could be anyplace and anytime the specifics are also generalities often the writing is very distant and it is clear that the author is describing the experiences of 'others' and not scenes he can personally feel this distance at the same time allows the reader to observe albeit analytically the human consequences of geopolitics stick with it the end is powerful and satisfying highly recommended","917":"breathtaking heartbreaking if you want to appreciate your own life read this book marra is an astonishing talent i will be among the first in line to read his next book hard to believe this was his first","918":"this is one of the best books i have read in recent years it made me laugh out loud and also brought me to tears in the gym in public the writing is beautiful i cannot believe this is the author's first novel","919":"enjoyed the book worth the read","920":" the central theme in anthony marra's novel is one of sacrifice how far would you go to rebuild your home your country how much would you sacrifice to save a child what happens when you realize that the sacrifice may not have been worth it marra's bittersweet novel chronicles the brutal russian war on chechnya in very personal ways while boris yeltsin announced that former soviet republics should grab all the sovereignty they could swallow he later decides chechnya takes too much going back and forth in time from 1994 to 2004 marra unlocks the puzzle of each character with only the reader knowing their connected fates the story begins with the feds russians disappearance of dokka his daughter havaa barely escapes by a thin plan the next steps are what to do to continue to protect her at what lengths will akhmed go to save her the overworked sonja ends an internship in london to return to her war torn homeland she is the only doctor in the only hospital for miles around this hardened doctor might be akhmed's only hope the details of the war are quite brutal the villagers are routinely rounded up if they are suspected of collusion with the rebels almost all are innocent and are grist for the war machine between the very weak rebels and the feds some valiantly go to the pit to be horribly tortured and others turn snitch and inform mostly falsely on each other marra weaves through the stories of those killed in the war those disappeared and those who are left behind one of the most disturbing aspects is how the remaining deal with their situation all that is left sometimes is a memory and a sketch in one case a little girl takes a sketch of a young boy who made fun of her for talking to bugs he becomes his own haunting scarecrow marra relieves the tension going far into the future showing where everyone ends up without it we are just left with the pain and suffering of war the ending is truly bittersweet favorite parts as she refolded the note and dropped it into the trash can he wanted to reach out to snatch the tumbling rectangle before it landed and was lost among the last words of two dozen others who died far from their villages who were pitched by strangers into furnaces who were buried in cloud cover and wouldn't return home until the next snowfall akhmed's own address was written on a slip of folded paper and stitched into his left trouser leg where with every step it chafed against his leg awaiting the decent soul that would one day carry him should he die away from home p 61 rather than limbs she had somehow amputated expectations p 98 in havaa's experience any horror that could happen eventually did better to armour yourself with the unreal better to turn inward hids in the dark waters among the sea anenomes p 101 in the afterlife as no more than a soul he would be without body to beat skin to peel blood to flow eyes to gouge fingernails to pry lungs to drown ventricles to stop and so the retribution of god would always be gentler than the retribution of man p261 what did any one person matter when pounded against the anvil of history p 265 whether eating scavenged good or selling an old friend they had all shamed themselves to survive p 266","921":" life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation when a country has known more war than peace in recent history when the biggest collateral damage is that of human life how does anything survive set in chechnya during its recent wartimes marra's novel navigates the oft treacherous and intersecting paths a handful of characters including a village doctor an eight year old girl her arborist father a retired academic and his disgraced son and an ethnic russian female doctor and what they have to do and endure just to survive in their scarred land marra is more interested in exploring how humanity survives when it may be easier to disregard it all and be able to put food in you and your family's mouth and a roof overhead make no mistake this is a sad novel at times and more of a character study with maybe chechnya the largest character than a plot driven book which makes the tragedies that much harder to bear but also the triumphs that much more triumphant","922":" i would never have read this book had it not been a choice for the book discussion group i am in i am so glad i was forced to read it because it is a wonderful book although at times brutal and forboding the author has a way of keeping you going through pacing suspense unexpected humor and the humanity of the characters set in contemporary times and places in the news the themes and imagery are interwoven producing a cathartic tale of everlasting truths my book group friends and i continue to talk about it heart breaking and uplifting try it","923":"upon finishing this book i felt overwhelming sadness and immense joy and let myself have a good long cry over both i loved this book","924":"please read this novel the author tells an incredible story which is set during a series of conflicts in chechnya and uses intertwined relationships humor and magical descriptions i couldn't put it down","925":"this book shredded me it takes its place as my new favorite book of this year it has admittedly dark themes but the writing is so beautiful the tale so expertly woven and told that the result is a deeply moving experience of story telling at its absolute finest","926":" i've done some non fiction reading and the chechen war in fact one of the books that marra cites as reference for his book his descriptions of the people the landscape and the war are so vividly drawn that it feels at times like you're reading a memoir these characters are beautifully captured and their stories and woven so cleverly that i often found myself smiling or crying at how he tied them together his prose is lyrical this is a sad sometimes crushing story but i loved it and you should read it because it's gorgeous","927":"really loved this book and can't believe this is marra's first novel","928":" anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena is a powerful exploration of the lives of four central characters living in war torn chechnya between 1994 and 2004 following the second chechen war akhmed havaa and sonja are brought together when havaa's father is disappeared and akhmed takes havaa to a local hospital in the hope that the doctor there sonja will agree to care for havaa marra takes us into the war ravaged experience of each of these characters and into the life of sonja's sister natasha the writer does an excellent job of revealing the brokenness and scarring that war brings but it is the development of his characters that makes this novel so moving marra writes with deep sympathy and compassion for the lives that people his fictional world from the very beginning akhmed havaa and sonja are full extraordinarily sympathetic characters akhmed is a failed medical student the worst doctor in chechnya but a gifted artist who cares deeply for and trusts implicitly in others sonja is an acerbic and brilliant doctor who reluctantly takes in havaa and gives akhmed employment at the hospital she is the only doctor left to tend with meager resources in a shattered facility to people disfigured by the war a constellation is not a quick read for me i have had to absorb it slowly but i find myself thinking about its pages when i am not reading a quite remarkable phenomenon for me because my work requires me to read and or write most of the day if you want to read a really superior first novel by what is obviously a rising star in fiction writing try a constellation of vital phenomena","929":"heart wrenching beautifully written novel about the wars in chechnya and their impact on a small group of individuals a powerful portrait of how clear lines of black and white right and wrong loyalty and disloyalty are blurred during times of war","930":"unspeakable torture in this book which makes the reader a victim of terror and brutality the author rambles until you wonder if he was on the heroin he describes the only help for the scrambled chapters is the years listed at the beginning of each chapter now on my short list of worst books i've read","931":"great book interesting cast of characters and beautifully written though very tragic i really didn't know a lot about this region despite this turmoil occurring during my lifetime so i found that fascinating and i really enjoyed the medical focus from one of the main characters as well","932":" after a night listening to navy jets from oceana air base in norfolk after awakening to hear of our plans to bomb yet another country in my lifetime i finished this broadly informative excellently written emotionally involving novel it tells of the lives of civilians in a war zone it was immeasurably hard for me to read the first few chapters however this book was recommended by a dedicated reader and dear friend so i persevered the reading became effortless and so rewarding to think that this is anthony marra's first novel is to be astounded also star struck thanks peg","933":" this is a powerful beautifully written novel full of history humor pathos and heartbreak i would consider it a truly great novel with characters we care about and empathize with and a plot that is well rounded i am very impressed with this book set in chechnya from 1996 - 2004 it is the story of a variety of people whose lives intersect during the horrors of war and political disarray while some of the torture scenes are gruesome and the feeling of the cold weather and a broken country are painful this novel actually had some funny moments and gave me hope for humanity and our desire to carry on despite all challenges although it contained some rather difficult subject matter is was very readable there are many ways to describe what this novel is about which is part of why it is so brilliant here's one take it is the story of sonja a doctor at a broken down hospital and of akhmed an incompetent doctor who she agrees to hire when he brings her a little girl named havaa who is in need of a safe place to stay it is the story of dokka havaa's father who is brutalized at the hands of the current military and of ramzan their neighbor and former friend of dokka and akhmed who is an informant for the feds it is the story of sonja's missing sister natasha who was lured into the sex slave trade and came back a lost soul and it is the story of khassan ramzan's father who has written a 3 000 page history of chechnya and wishes desperately that he could fix things it is a story of human nature the bad the good and so much in between","934":" this took me awhile to get into but by about two thirds of the way through i had become much more interested in the characters and their stories and by the end felt a very satisfying sort of sad happiness or happy sadness the novel takes place in chechnya between 1994 2004 a pretty violent period in the history of the republic but this is a story not so much about the war s themselves but rather about the seemingly disparate and ordinary people who find themselves entangled somehow with the wars and by luck coincidence and even fate each other marra is a beautiful and funny writer and writes in quite a varied style throughout the novel which for me took some getting used to but ultimately i think it worked for the novel i'll definitely be looking out for more of anthony marra's stuff","935":"this one was quite good in a heart breaking sort of way a true foreign novel without a happy hollywood ending it is horrifying the terrible things that people do to each other during war interesting read about chechnya some day i will read this one again because i missed some of the clues along the way","936":"want to understand what living in the wreckage of a failed society is like the characters in a constellation of vital phenomena the definition of life set in modern chechnya bring their world to life for you the writing is wonderful the plotting intricate and the revelations of character gradual and at times surprising it is also a cautionary tale for those of us who have become complacent about the power of those we allow to be in charge of our lives","937":" if you love strong characters love a good backstory and love irony then this is the book for you don't be looking for anything seen through rose colored glasses or a happy ending because you won't find it it is a sad harsh look at life and life choices and the consequences of those choices but having said all of that the book is definitely worth the struggle you will learn about a country and all the hardships that were endured and i am sure that most of this history is not readily known to most of us i know it wasn't to me if you want a book with depth and bite to it then look no further i am going to have to find something totally different to read to try to get this book off of my mind it is that good","938":"a beautiful and haunting novel set in the horrifying conditions of the second chechen war highly recommended","939":"a bleak story tough read but compelling characters well written","940":"this novel does a good job of conveying the fatalism and resignation of a people subjected to the unexplainable atrocities that occur as a part of their subjugation it is set in chechnya between and during their conflicts with russia apart from that it was difficult to become one with any of the characters and the plot was not very gripping either just ok","941":"4 5 actually","942":"last night i went to dinner with some friends and told them about this book and how much i was enjoying reading it of course thy asked what the title was and when i said a constellation of vital phenomena they both said that it was too confusing to remember i agree with them it is odd and seemingly senseless the beauty and perfection of this hard on the tongue title revealed itself on page 184 however when natasha the beautiful but left behind sister who is holed up in her chechen communist apartment block trying to escape the cruel and lawless civil war that uprooted her entire life reads this banal statement in the medical dictionary of the union of soviet physicians the biggest and heaviest book she could find on her surgeon sister's bookshelf life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation even though i had been enjoying the story thus far because and in spite of the non linear storytelling when i reached that proclamation of purpose my brain did this zoom out thing and the pieces of the story which are a lot like some of the complicated and advanced quilts i saw on display at the county fair a few weeks ago started to take form using the author's constellation metaphor it was like all of these different patterned and various hued yellow fabrics which have no business being together except for their general yellow ness became a star a really interesting and important star a work of art really the rest of the novel went much quicker as my brain zoomed in and out when necessary the individual fabrics of motivation background family life disappointments abilities aversions and hope from dokka akhmed havaa sonja natasha khassan and ramzen pieced together to educate me a protected and blessed woman in the peaceful rocky mountains of the united states about modern civil war specifically the one in chechnya between the years of 1994 to 2004 to be fair modern is probably an exaggeration for the villages cities and hospitals built in the former soviet union but phones went from working to not working gas went from available to a black market commodity safe drinking water was for the lucky and rich employers and employees disappeared and all that was left to fill that great vacuum of energy and productivity were mobs and the military even though it is historical and not dystopian i kept acknowledging the warnings given this could happen anywhere this could happen to me and my loved ones the educated were not exempt from suffering the beautiful were not exempt from suffering the loyal the traitorous the young and the old all suffered for what sovereignty maybe a religious movement at first like all wars eventually all that was left to fight for was power the power to live and not be tortured sold or disappeared for information horrible using well known biblical stories of struggle and purpose the question of responsibility to family to other generations weaves through it all abraham and god's commandment to sacrifice his son as well as the sacrifice of parents to orphan their children in hopes of saving them moses are repeatedly asked what are we to learn from these recurring lessons on life that it is sacred that it is fleeting frequently the author would pause a story briefly to share a glimpse of a character's future it felt like a gentler handling of a technique used in action movies when the shot freezes with a certain character on screen so that important information can be given that little stretchy pause added both to the beauty and intricacy of this artful novel it had the effect of filling in the dark sky with distant stars this is what great fiction can do make the lessons from different life experience available to all who read i pray and hope that i never find myself and my family making the kinds of sacrifices or decisions that are required when at war should i be so lucky i need to remember that every day millions of people throughout the world are not the syrians and egyptians are in the midst of this very kind of conflict right now and the world watches when convenient or if an atrocity is vicious enough it is a story on constant repeat and yet in that definition given in the medical dictionary for soviet physicians there is also growth adaptation reproduction movement as part of it all too it seems there is no government mob or military that has been able to control or drive out the human acts of generosity and kindness with their brutality fathers and mothers continue to love their children friends die for each other and people give up glory and comfort to do the right thing these were the shades of yellow i liked best it gave this beautiful constellation of stars depth and comfort and tenderness i loved dokka and ahkmed and sonja and natasha and havaa and khassan and i pitied ramzen even though none were perfect and most did unforgivable things how tender were their brutal lives highly recommended it is not an easy read but it is so so worth the effort","943":"while reading this book i vacillated between rating it three or four stars at times it lost me and my mind wandered other times it was riveting i think it depended on which characters we were following i loved reading about havaa the feisty little girl sonja the only female doctor in the world and her tragic sister natasha it was a little harder to stay interested in the men's stories though it was probably because they were subject to so much more i loved the writing and applaud the author for tackling a tightly wound story within the swirling melee of two wars the story is one about how people can make an indelible mark on our lives and that the experience is not always mutual it's about how we develop fierce loyalties to one another and how those loyalties are forged overall it's a beautiful book mostly tragic somewhat hopeful though i'm not sure i liked the way the book was constructed going back and forth in time with overlapping storylines from various perspectives it was confusing and contributed to my vacillation i can't say that i actually knew who everyone really was until well past the halfway mark near the end i realized that story took place over only five days i would try the audiobook with different voices it may be less confusing otherwise read it over a shorter period of time than just a few pages before bed","944":"sad dark real a hard one to read but i loved it all the same","945":"it took me awhile to get through this one but i am really glad that i did i loved it it's so unbelievably sad yet all the characters are so beautifully written i also really liked the way their stories become intertwined it is not at all predictable highly recommended however i think i'm going to have to read a few lighter themed books after this one","946":"this is the best book i have read in quite some time i highly recommend it","947":"i don't know much about that area of the world so i found it very interesting a very good story very moving it does not highlight the best of humanity think the kite runner but not as brutal but i really liked the story","948":" 4 5 starsdid i enjoy this book yes when a book is as highly celebrated as this one i wonder why authors and publishers seek my opinion maybe they are interested in hearing a response from an everyday unbiased non expert reader who knows i'm afraid i have little to offer except to add to the chorus of praise this book has received already it's beautifully written poignant and very personal it's everything an epic story should be i'm often wary of stories that skip around in time and scene it frequently interrupts the flow of the story and throws me off topic marra brilliantly adds a timeline to the beginning of each chapter it's a perfectly relevant yet uncontrived way to remind us where we are in the story i've never seen time scenes written like that before but i liked it so much i hope future authors take note i knocked off a half star because it's a long laborious read i think most readers will find it worth the time and effort but it ran a little long for my taste would i recommend it yes as reviewed by belinda at every free chance books disclosure i received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review http everyfreechance com 2014 08 re","949":"the best book i have read in ages learned a lot and my heart was crushed by the sheer magnitude of this author's talent","950":"starting this book i wasn't sure what to think it took me a good 100 pages to really start liking it by page 140 i was obsessed this is a book that will stick with me for a very long time could it have been shorter maybe but marra's phrasing and storytelling skills made what could be an ordinary story in the hands of any other author extraordinary","951":"absolutely brilliant book marra is a rare talent i've posted a fuller review here http markhummel blogspot com 2014 0","952":"wonderful book one of the best books i have read in a long time highly recommend not always easy to read but well worth it","953":" writing a review of this book has been hard for me i think it was a good novel and i can understand the rave reviews its got however i personally feel the story dragged on at times but more importantly there are many aspects about the characters and their interactions that just didn't let me immerse in the story first of all i found akhmed and sonja to have no chemistry their relationship seemed forced like it had to happen even though there was no good reason for it to happen i also didn't like the character of khassan he seemed unrealistic and unidimensional to me and again i found his relationship with other characters forced how many kids would be mesmerized by a 3 000 page history book how many kids would break into a house to read excerpts about the geological history of a country well those are the feelings that khassan's book brings out in akhmed and on pretty much anyone else who reads his gigantic book on chechnya which seems to be the most most powerful and well researched book ever written certainly not the most concise one but the author needed a wise brave selfless character that could take the moral high ground and so khassan is forced down the throat of the reader on the other hand i did find the characters of ramzan and dokka to have a lot of depth as they deal with the normal human internal conflicts that are unknown to khassan despite these flaws i think this is a very good historical novel and a great debut for anthony marra","954":"you must you must read this book you must let the goosebumps rise and the tears fall you must learn remember honor chechnya brilliant haunting poignant","955":" life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation is an entry in the medical dictionary of the union of soviet physicians havaa lives in a small village in chechnya with her father dokka in the middle of one dark night like multitudes of others dokka is taken by russian soldiers suspected of aiding the chechen rebels he is disappeared akmed a neighbor who attended medical school and who serves as the village's only medical resource takes her to the regional hospital thinking that she will be safe there sonja is struggling to help those wounded by war in a hospital that has been closed and at which she is the only physician sonja longs for the return of natasha her sister who has vanished sonja and akmed forge an unlikely bond and work to heal the physical and psychological wounds of the patients of havaa and of each other in five days of their lives the unlikely and previously unknown relationships among the residents of the village the doctors the patients begin to unfold constellation is the debut novel of anthony marra it is an absolutely incredible work a must read for those of us for whom the name chechnya is without meaning a must read for those of us who live in freedom and peace","956":" this is a powerful book sometimes disturbing sometimes hopeful as the two doctors sonja and akhmed save havaa a young girl caught in the horrors of the chechnyan wars after her father is abducted we learn to love and hate the characters around her while also recognizing that they are all caught in their own nightmares the characters are complex and none of them is always what we expect thus making the book continually interesting to read not always to know what comes next although that's important too but also to learn what came before marra uses foreshadowing to help reassure us that some characters will actually outlive the horror thus making the unspeakable realities of the war somewhat easier to read nevertheless the descriptions of what takes place at the landfill are horrific and disturbing how can people treat each other this way can this be real how do people face such horror and live what is life but live they do and interact they eat and play and make love and survive they build on their past and build towards a future in the end there is triumph and we are reminded that life a constellation of vital pheonomena carries for all of us happiness and sadness birth and death","957":" this book annoyed me it just felt like such standard issue literary fiction designed to tug heartstrings and feel lyrical and deep and make americans who know nothing about the war in chechnya get emotional about it and think that they now understand it it's not a bad book exactly but it just feels so pat and the whole business of the author never having visited chechnya until after he wrote the book leaves a bad taste in my mouth not that writers shouldn't be free to use their imaginations and write about things outside their own experience that's what all fiction is and i know no more about chechnya than any other american but when this novel is drawing on the recentness and horrific violence of its setting to provide gravity i feel very uneasy with it","958":" a beautiful read historical fiction haunting this is war with all its sudden late night knocks on the door then people disappear forever but this is russia in the 2000s gorgeous writing wonderful dialogue a rewarding last chapter i listened to this book and although i enjoyed hearing it read with the russian dialects i would prefer to read this conventionally and savor the writing the story also jumps back and forth in time and it would be easier to follow by reading rather than listening","959":" the first book i read that dealt with chechnya was the amazing memoir by arkady babchenko one soldier's war of his experiences as a russian soldier marra cites it as one of his references and i strongly recommend it as little of babchenko's insights appear in marra's novel instead marra focuses on the civilian population whose tragic lives are offset by the author's projection into the future this narrative device leavens the novel but does not detract from the anguish one experiences while reading it beautifully written i strongly recommend it but it is not for the faint of heart","960":"this book is great if you love crying","961":"i couldn't get into it the story just never took hold of me","962":"brilliant so good it's hard to find the words to praise it i am astonished that a man of anthony's marra's age could write a novel that stands with the best of great literature think sophie's choice for whom the bell tolls the life of ivan d and most of all viktor frankl's man's search for meaning out of the anguish savagery stupidity bravery foolishness and insanity that is was chechnya he has woven a golden web that catches your heart and makes you believe in redemption every character lives and breathes every word serves a purpose every plot thread subtly interweaves with the next from tragedy comes unexpected laughter and then quick as a lightning strike the horror of what humans can do to one another jolts us again we console one another in one moment only to berate and abuse in the next what have we wrought with each action good or evil marra gives us a vision the past and the future by swooping back and forth in time and beautifully capturing the consequences of our behavior that we rarely discover this is both a holocaust story and also a love story if you read only one book this year make it this one","963":"what a lovely rewarding and amazing book","964":"hard to believe this was a first novel the author draws you right in to the war in chechnya and how it affected those living through those times","965":"i wish i would have read this one instead of listened i was confused with the weaving time change and the chapters didn't label the years to help me along other than that it was a beautifully sorrowful book i really enjoyed it","966":"it's a slow but beautifully written story when the story came full circle and i read the very last page and the last few words i started to cry anthony marra is a talented writer i look forward to what he writes next","967":"a very good and important book although one that i admired more than enjoyed","968":"this book can be a bit confusing at times so you have to really concentrate as you are reading it the history of the conflict in chechnya is complicated on its own but it is so beautifully written and you learn how the characters' lives have intersected as the story unfolds it is worth the effort to read it","969":" pros compelling book about the lives of ordinary people during the wars in chechnya even though i knew very little about the wars in the 1990s and 2000s and still don't it doesn't matter this book is more about humans their relationships and how they adapt than the nitty gritty of the war con it was a little challenging for me to keep up with it at times remembering who each character is and their relationship to each other especially because it jumps around chronologically and i couldn't keep track of what has already been revealed there were probably about 7 10 main characters with juicy backstories and even more supporting characters who pop up throughout the book during the recollections of different people again hard to keep track also con to myself i kept thinking 'chechnya' the way that bridget jones says it which is terribly insensitive of me overall for someone who has read virtually nothing set in modern day russia chechnya etc this was a startling book to read and learn about the horrors of what has been occurring in my lifetime most of this book is set during the second chechen war in 2004 when i was well into young adulthood and yet i can remember hearing almost nothing about it i'm curious about what chechnya is like now read this book if you want a good humanized story about a massive world event you'll learn a little but feel a lot","970":" a novel can be almost as useful as a piece of non fiction in describing the horrors of war and this goes a long way to proving that the story centres around a doctor working in a wartime hospital in a snowy chechen village sonja trained in london but returned to work in appalling conditions in a hospital treating waves of soldiers and refugees with a totally inadequate staff growing up amongst all of it is 8 year old havaa the other characters in the village all have incredible stories which marra blends together with a timeline that skips between the start of the 'first' was in 1994 and 2004 scenes in the 'landfill' of torture and murder are particularly horrific and the author goes a long way to make what was called 'the forgotten war' become much less so this is an important book therefore in many ways and a great read all of this and a first novel also quite outstanding","971":"this is a well written first novel that takes place in chechnya during a rebellion the first war against the russians a young girl's father is informed on by a neighbor and is taken away by the russians a neighbor and family friend rescues the girl and entrusts her to a woman doctor at the local hospital the lives of all the characters turn out to be interconnected as they struggle to survive the wartime destruction and uncertainty of their country i read the book twice and i found that i enjoyed the writing as much the second time the novel provides a great deal of rich history and detail about chechnya and its struggles against the russians soviets the book also is about the best and worst of human nature the novel stands out as a unique book that introduces many of us to chechnya and its history and people the book is an excellent first novel i am looking forward to marra's future books as good as this first novel is i expect that anthony marra will write even better works in the future","972":" i have a bit of a hard time processing how i feel about this book it was a fairly brutal bleak read it was certainly educational given that i knew nothing about chechnya and i did think the characters were well drawn the end was incredibly sad and i think that morrow's move to add in one significantly redemptive detail with regards to a couple characters' futures was the only thing that made it bearable overall glad i read it but am perhaps not quite as impressed as the hype around the book would suggest i should be look forward to seeing what else anthony morrow writes","973":"a great first novel well worth reading more details to follow here are some more details marra's book deals with the two chechyan civil wars the book is a tour de force involving 8 major characters who ricochet across over a decade of senseless bloodshed mixed with heroism and compassion if what happened in chechnya is only half as bad as what is presented here it was a chamber of horrors the story remains most compelling brutal violence black humor and magic realism if marra never writes again he will have had a successful career however i believe he has a lot more stories to tell i will be waiting for them","974":"i'm sure this is a worthy book but i read it with so many interruptions that i was glad to just finish it","975":"a really beautiful book about a horrendous time in recent chenchnyian history","976":" finally a novel that breaks away form all the average books you've read in the last year and this is definitely the one haven't been impressed by a book since i read cutting for stone it was uncanny how i found myself judging these characters as the author anticipates we will without knowing the background behind the choices they make forming likes and dislikes in the midst of horrors going on in this awful climate of war then as reality unfolds you can't help but feel humbled by the knowledge the author gradually reveals and how misguided those opinions turned out to be such a wonderful well crafted novel","977":"such a beautifully written book i knew from the first few pages that the rest of the novel would be poetically woven into the events of the story i knew nothing of the chechnya or its revolution from the mid 1990s to mid 2000s the story jumps around a lot and it was a little bit of a struggle for me to keep track of all the characters but overall this was an amazing book i can't believe it didn't rank higher than 2013's the goldfinch which i had just finished prior to this book for best books of 2013 a book about which i am highly opinionated this book was much more to the point and not a single sentence was included unless it was an absolutely necessary addition to the story or understanding of the characters there were so many quotes from this book that i wanted to highlight and had i not restrained myself this book would be all dressed up for a blacklight rave i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a novel that is modern but lacks the superficiality of many modern books that are published today only one entry supplied an adequate definition and she circled it with red ink and referred to it nightly life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation page 231","978":"a hauntingly beautifully written historical fiction it is full of pain but also hope and most importantly it gives us a glimpse into the human side of war strife and how it shapes individuals","979":"gorgeous powerful and tragic marra takes a commonly ignored chunk of history and well commonly ignored entire country and makes it real and vibrant even in darkness i'd like to disagree with the blurbs and reviews that label this book as hopeful as i find it the antithesis of such but without argument it is a deeply human story written with skill knowledge and feeling","980":"mr marra's detail within this fictional story where characters attempt to survive russian war is absolutely phenomenal i would re read a chapter to absorb his descriptions his emotional layers and his extraordinary ability to grow each character throughout the book a must read which will doubtfully never leave your heart a part of me wishes wants hopes that existing war torn countries will never live his characters journeys something tells me my wish has not or will not come true","981":"wow knowing so little about life in chechnya and i do mean nothing there were several chapters that lost me in the details of history and war however the lives and struggles of the characters were incredible once i could begin to see how they all were interwoven it took my breath away and i couldn't put it down","982":"wanted to like it it's set in the chechen war which in the us and uk seems to have been mostly forgotten but i didn't think it was very interestingly written","983":"i learned so much history from this book and loved the writing","984":"i confess i've marked this as read but i didn't finish it isn't that it wasn't good it was i mean the writing was good very good the author did his research look at the author's note to see but it was about the atrocities and sadness and desolation of war when i read a book like this it works on destroying my faith in goodness and hope and humanity even though there were some courageous very courageous people in the book people who inspire i was weighed down by the atrocity when this happens i begin to wonder if goodness and meaning in life are just illusions if my sense of having choices and some control over my life are also illusions i have encountered all this before and i tire of being reminded my apologies to the author i just couldn't finish it even if it ended with a victory it must have seemed pyrrhic","985":"incredible","986":"if you liked the goldfinch city of thieves the kite runner and cutting for stone you'll like this book outstanding writing haunting story 4 5 stars would've given 5 if it had hooked me in the beginning it took a little over 100 pages of reading before i couldn't put it down","987":"so much beauty in these pages paced by just as much tragedy this book is a rare treasure that left me in tears of devastation and gratitude it tackles the humanity and inhumanity of wartime in some of the best writing i've ever come across it's artful and heartbreaking and i am now as glad to step out of this world as i was grateful to have stepped into it through the pages of this wonderful book","988":"i loved this book i think i felt every emotion possible while reading it it's a roller coaster that pulls at your heart strings and it's great","989":"beautifully written but it just didn't pull me in until the last quarter of the book","990":"brilliant and horrifying and beautiful","991":"a remarkable story well written interesting structure to deal with flashbacks","992":"great book everyone in my book group loved this one","993":" every book you read is a different experience you fall in and out of love with them in different ways and on different trajectories a constellation of vital phenomena swept me off my feet on its second page really it was a simple section of dialogue that's my house her voice broke their silence and he heard it as he would the only sound in an empty corridor don't think of it like that he said like what like it's still yours congratulations anthony marra this book is a tour de force a constellation is the story of seven characters with a few secondary individuals in the mix during a national battle for identity and independence in chechnya the book really travels only five days but marra's story actually encompasses a decade and a pair of chechen wars most of the characters reside in the small village of eldar as akhmed dokka and his daughter havaa and khassan and his son ramzan have intertwined and complex histories when the book begins feds the russians occupying the rebublic come to eldar and seize dokka while havaa is able to remain hidden akhmed takes havaa to a nearby hospital for safekeeping while offering himself to work at the hospital which is where we meet sonja who's running the facility and find out about her sister natasha as marra takes us back and forth through history from 1994 and the first war to 2004 we learn the back story of all of these characters and how they are connected the story is about the duality of many things war love and family the book's title comes from one of sonja's old books life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation we see how these characters are changed by these factors and how they change others we see love survive through the harshest of human circumstances and how that can take a toll sometimes marra reflects on family a good deal saying you are mine i recognize you we twist our souls around each other's miseries it is that which makes us family later marra again writes about what family means how it develops and the control or lack thereof we have over it as sonja finds out 'your family isn't your choice ' her father had said to quell a tantrum many years earlier and without wanting to she kept discovering what he had meant the characters in a constellation are brilliant they are distinctive and fully drawn every character has at least one flaw and we still love them and care about all of them because they are conceived of in an entirely human way every choice that is made seems to come from a marra's deep understanding of what motivates these individuals marra tells so much without ever bludgeoning his prose just seems to float across the page and reveal the story every word fills its purpose and even when a sentence shoots off into its own world marra does like to occasionally build a sentence that lasts an entire page the reader doesn't get caught up in the length because each piece is doing its job so well it is writing that suits the story beautifully i found myself constantly re reading and underlining and soaking in what the writing was doing even though it never goes anywhere near flamboyant or flashy the story ranges from heartbreaking to joyful to gut wrenching to horrific to somber to funny but you never feel marra working to elicit any of these emotions the story just takes you there there are actually some very funny moments in a book that would never be described as a comedy and i loved them because we were never laughing at the characters every moment of humor came out of something incredibly human and the laughs were entirely earned not reached for there is just seamless movement from cringing to jaw dropping to tearful to joyful i picked up a constellation because it had received some positive words but did not know much about the plot or have much knowledge or particular interest of chechnya i didn't go in with soaring expectations yet the book did from the start it's not often that i know within a page or two that i'm reading something special but the whole book just shimmered with energy flatly put it's the best thing i've read in a while","994":"this was long and i'll admit i often had to flip back to try to remember things about the characters but by the second half i was totally hooked it's heartbreaking and well worth the effort","995":"loved it tied with wave for my favorite book in 2014 i grew afraid as i neared the end that i would need to bid the characters goodbye it was harrowing sad beautiful uplifting educational and just a great read really loved it it seems hardly possible that this was a first novel as it's plotted so expertly","996":"super good and very informative i learned a lot about a part of the world i've never heard much about it was incredibly depressing but sometimes the truth is depressing makes me think i liked it","997":"wow i'm not even sure what to say this book is shockingly sad in 2004 when this book took place i was in high school a clean brand new high school and a family at home i can imagine the destitution of chenya and its residents about as much as i can imagine holding all the stars in the universe how do you relate i'm typing this review on a $1 200 laptop and in my brand new bomb free home read this book it's the least you can do","998":"well this was gorgeous i actually started it in october read about 50 pages and thought eh i am not digging this every time i finished a chapter i really didn't want to go to the next one so i put it down and read some other stuff but then i could not stop thinking about it like what is going to happen to hava so i picked it back up and realized my problem i loved each chapter so much that when i got to the next one i was not ready eventually i realized this would happen with every chapter and thus could keep reading anyway this book is just perfect weird and russian and mystical and sad and scary and so so beautiful also you will find yourself reading a lot about chechnya if you read this and between shades of grey in close succession as i did you will also come to see russia as the great enemy of the 20th century my favorite way to learn history really","999":" a constellation of vital phenomena was a cleverly written story following a group of seemingly disconnected people from chechnya and the way in which their stories and lives become entangled i listened to this book instead of reading it and feel that was a mistake the author cleverly writes each chapter from a different character's perspective from different years listening to the stories without the ability to go back into the book was a challenge and at times made for a confusing read overall i would definitely recommend this book","1000":"i'm hovering between four and five stars while this novel will likely become a part of my consciousness as required to get that fifth star i'm not entirely certain i liked it enough also i am highly unlikely to ever read this again which i usually consider important for a top rating it was certainly well written with vivid characters and an unusual construction that fit the themes of the book perfectly sometimes though that construction was annoying and the characters too vivid there was no one to attach myself to as my stand in i remained firmly outside the story even when caught up in a beautiful description that let me see every rock tea cup and shard of glass even when annoyed at some of those descriptions as digressions though i never grew quite irritated enough to give up thankfully my persistance paid off and all the little wanders and jumps came together perfectly in the end in that lies the brilliance of this novel it actually became more than itself once i read the last paragraph still though i waver on that fifth star","1001":" i wasn't sure i was going to like this book when i began the writing is beautiful but at times at least for me in the beginning of the book i could sense the writer working hard to pull all of the possible words and metaphors to bear on describing his characters and their plight in war torn chechnya between 1994 and 2004 i didn't want to feel the author and his craft hovering so close so i had a little bit of a hard time getting in to the novel in particular i had a difficult time with early scenes with sonja and havaa the two female characters but at some point i mostly forgot that there was an author to the book and i was swept up in the deep feeling of humans living remaining \"vital phenomena\" in the terrible circumstances of first one war then another then its ugly aftermath the second to the last chapter ruined me for the rest of the day i sort of wish it ended on there in the end i am very glad to have read this sad and beautiful book and spent some time in a part of the world about which i would like to know more","1002":" i kept trying to read this book and dozing off with each attempt always a bad sign i felt like i should read it again a bad sign so i finally just gave up i don't fault the book i could see why so many other people commented on the quality of writing and language there are some lovely phrases and carefully crated sentences i think the setting was too remote and unfamiliar for me i couldn't find anything to latch onto and relate i would encourage others to try this book as it may speak to you","1003":"review coming soon","1004":" on a cold snowy night in chechnya a young girl hides in the woods while she watches her home burn to the ground throughout the course of the following four days the young girl becomes the connection between the neighbor that takes responsibility for her the doctor who is running a hospital nearby and everyone else involved in the tragic events this young girl is exposed to as the tangled story unwinds enduring love brings out both the best and worst in people a constellation of vital phenomena is marra's story of the tragedy of war and the human spirit that endures he brings to light a piece of recent history and politics to the reader while telling a story that everyone can relate to one of love and community \"love she learned could reduce its recipient to an essential thing as important as food or shelter whose presence is not only longed for but needed \"common reads programs that choose a constellation of vital phenomena can develop events around themes of war family socialism and the power of community ties marra's visits to chechnya his in depth research and powerful stories on how he developed his novel entice audiences and enhance his author visits","1005":"intensely powerful and moving this is a difficult and necessary novel i will never think of chechnya or of any war ravaged place on earth again without remembering the characters in this novel and how bound together they were in life and death gripped by such stark and startling evil and yet released by the thinnest ribbons of mercy and joy there was no unnecessary character in this novel and no unnecessary event the whole is a masterpiece","1006":"fairly long rambling story about war in chechnya jumped backward and forward in time and was sometimes confusing some of the story lines were interesting and some i skimmed i definitely learned a lot about chechnya and of course war is hell no matter where it is","1007":"beautifully written despite my struggles to follow the ethnic conflict i kept coming back to the writing the last line had me choked up that's rare for me","1008":"a wonderful debut novel from marra it keeps you constantly wondering what will happen next and even when all your questions are finally answered you only yearn to know more","1009":"a truly fantastic book loved this","1010":"beautifully written the first two thirds lacked momentum for me i'd describe it as ponderous but the ending was wonderful and very moving the ending saved this one for me","1011":"one of the best novels i've read in a long long time a heartbreaking but often funny read","1012":"beautifully written a modern story set in the current conflicts in chechnya a sad and difficult read in places the agony random violence and deprivation of the two wars were portrayed in a heart wrenching way","1013":"a difficult book to read but very beautifully written","1014":"don't wait read it so good beautiful story wonderful authorial touch of being able to weave in in a sentence bit characters' life stories captures the absurdity that is war and life the definition of which from a medical journal is the source for the title i can't remember a more holistic expose of the characters you leave the book knowing each one's flaws each one's virtues while still having a definite sense of the protagonists might have to read it again it was so rich","1015":" this is the most recent in a delightful run of four and five star books i have had the good fortune to read each enjoys its own distinct personality and rewards here we wander in a war torn country it does not really matter where but in light of recent events this book detracts from russian honor even as today's headlines do with themes borrowed from very old religious tracts marra uses his debut novel to explore the sacrifice of child by parent the adoption of orphan by stranger and by orphan maker the making of an informer the redemption of doomed men and the revenge of brutalized women we are charmed by the twinkle of a small child dazzled by the devotion of a physician whose hands are callused by the bone saw and escorted into the realm of the damned and the graced highly recommended","1016":"a fantastic book reminding me of khaled hosseini's writing a little slow going at times but extremely well written and moving i thought it very neat how the author gives little tidbits about the characters futures throughout the book a reminder of how screwed up and amazing life can be","1017":"i understand why this book is rated so highly the writing and point of view are unique and the subject is something we don't see very often unfortunately i could not get engaged and slogged through it","1018":"for whatever reason i can't get i to this book i know others have loved it and praised it i have enjoyed parts of it and appreciate the writing i have tried listening to the audio while reading the ebook but still get lost in the timelines and characters so i'm giving up maybe i'll try it again in the future but with so many books that i know i'll enjoy reading i doubt that i'll get back to it i'm glad that we as readers have the choices we do","1019":"not exactly uplifting or feel good but eye opening and a very well crafted depiction of chechnya","1020":"simply exceptional moving creative dramatic life affirming","1021":"exquisite prose wonderful characters khassan the old author is my favorite then deshi who works in the hospital the backdrop is chechnya during the upheavals from the mid 1990s through 2004 would not have missed reading this for the world i recommend it highly","1022":"beautifully written some chapters difficult to read due to all the cruelty","1023":" this book the characters are so nuanced so complex the author really must have known these characters in his own mind to create them so beautifully in writing the story was heartbreaking and complicated and somehow uplifting i struggled at times to keep straight all the different story lines this is purely a reflection of my own deficiencies and my lack of knowledge about the wars in chechnya as i read i felt astounded that all of this was happening during my own lifetime and i knew so little about it i had not realized the brutality of these wars which the author really brought to life note to my mother i don't think you'd like this one there are a lot of characters and the time frame changes from chapter to chapter it is very hard to keep it all straight and i know that drives you crazy","1024":" i feel like i read this with a lot of stops and starts not because it was bad but just because it was heavy despite that disjointed feeling reading experience i actually wound up really liking the book it was beautifully written really very beautiful i liked how marra worked the timeline with the flashes back and forth and to different characters and i was very connected to the characters and felt along with them as the story unfolded i feel like i know absolutely nothing about the history of chechnya but marra did a great job of working in information about the wars and government and history without being too heavy handed about it it is a fine line to walk but i felt like he did it very well again this is not a happy book but it is a beautiful book i recommend it","1025":"marra writes graphically and visually you can see what he is writing about i wish he did so in sequence as the back and forth timeline is tough to follow not sure who is dead","1026":"i don't want to review this book i'm a great reader but not a great book reviewer and this is such a beautiful book i know i cannot do it justice this is easily now in my top 10 perhaps top 5 of my most loved books here's a quote from the washington post may 7 2013 here in fresh graceful prose is a profound story that dares to be as tender as it is ghastly a story about desperate lives in a remote land that will quickly seem impossibly close and important i could not say it better the novel covers five days of the lives of people who have no idea how entwined their lives are or will become and still the novel covers the years of 1994 through 2004 of the chechnyan wars both the first war and the second war and even further back than that it's a love story it's a history book how ironic i started to read this novel as the troubles in ukraine developed but this is so much more than a book about war it's a book about cruelness and survival about hope and love this book shows the depths of horror the human race can sink to and yet there's hope and humor here too some great humor i've read several books recently where i could feel no empathy for the characters where the main characters showed no backbone or courage in their routine and privileged lives oh but the characters in marra's novel were people i admired wanted to learn more about wanted to love and help and even in one case hate and certainly i admired them all i started out listening to this book via audible com i wasn't half way through when i realized this is a book i want to read and re read so i ordered the kindle edition now i'm ordering a hard copy because there are some books that are just worth it and this is one","1027":"a constellation of vital phenomena joins the list of books that have moved me profoundly the last few pages had me in tears to me there is no more tangible proof that the author has done something right i was utterly invested in the characters their lives by the end of the novel the novel examines the lives of ethnic chechens and russians while jumping back and forth through a tumultuous decade in a town outside of grovny it starts dramatically with young havaa left homeless after her father has been disappeared by the feds with only the charred remnants of her childhood home left poor havaa has no where to go neighbor and friend of her father akhmed leads her to a hospital run by sonja an ethnic russian i'll end the plot summary there suffice to say this is a novel of unbearable sadness but also a novel of incredible hope and beauty it isn't a story that deals a whole lot with the politics of the chechen conflict it merely explores the trauma that such conflicts inevitably create in ordinary people well done anthony marra this list of books seems is an odd assortment for sure here is an incomplete list of books that have had the power to move me to tears a constellation of vital phenomenathe kite runnera thousand splendid sunshobomokcontending forcesthe book thiefthe last of the mohicans","1028":" the prose in this book is gorgeous seriously the prose is the reason i gave this book four stars instead of three it's so so lovely and unique i had some issues following the story because of its sort of unconventional timeline a lot of the story and characterization is told in flashbacks it was interesting but very heavy on narration with large chunks completely devoid of dialogue i also had a hard time with the story because of the complexity of the historical context and my unfamiliarity with everything that went on in chechnya during that time i would definitely recommend this book for anyone wanting to soak in some very well crafted storytelling and is willing to invest some time and attention in following the somewhat complex timeline","1029":"a marvelous book in the true sense of the word deserving of every praise it received i'm shocked it didn't win any of the major literary awards of the year as i'd be hard pressed to think of a book published in 2013 that i read that surpassed the depth emotional scope and beautiful language this book possesses it's a book about war that manages to have nothing to do with combat a book about dystopia that has almost no mention of the state and finally a book about family love and loss that manages to avoid the subject cliches and deliver something wholly original moving and gorgeous marra deftly manages a third person omniscient narrator that catapults the reader forward and backward in time often in a single sentence making even the minor characters resonate with the true experience of life the protagonists and antagonists are complex good and bad brave and pitiful all at the same time a book i know i'll be reading over and over again and one that fans of 'let the great world spin' 'all the light we cannot see' 'the brief wondrous life of oscar wao' and 'the orphan master's son' will all find joy in reading it's an impressive debut a perfect novel in almost every way i can think of","1030":"it took me some time to warm up to this novel marra's writing style is very dense and verbose and this book probably has the most commas in the history of the world i found a 514 word sentence seriously the format is a complicated one it takes place over five days in real time but within those five days are 10 years of flashbacks going back and forth over the years and narrated by multiple people it was a little confusing and i sometimes forgot who some of the characters were however it's an intelligent vivid and uncompromising look at war torn chechnya and the suffering of that area much of which i am embarassed to admit i was unaware of the story revolves around dokka a man who is disappeared in the middle of the night by russian soldiers his young daughter havaa is found hiding in the woods by dokka's friend akhmed akhmed realizes havaa is in danger and escorts her to a bombed out hospital in a nearby city where he leaves her in the care of a grudging doctor sonja over the next 4 days other characters are introduced and their stories are layered and interwoven until the whole picture is revealed the ending is perfect many reviewers are calling this book brilliant and it is pretty impressive i am glad i read it but for me the writing style got in the way of the plot a bit","1031":"well conceived well researched and well pretty good the novel certainly doesn't break significant new philosophical ground but it draws on its explicitly cited fiction and nonfiction sources in such a way that creates a cohesive compelling narrative an eye opening reminder of the second round of brutality chechnya experienced only 10 years ago","1032":"serious book","1033":"this is a truly wonderful and transcendent book and i'm just so so very glad to finally read a book worthy of its glowing reviews and various awards i feel like every literary fiction book i pick up these days gets me so excited with brilliant reviews from reputable papers and journals and myriad awards and then i give it a read and come away horribly disappointed sometimes even angry because instead of being brilliant and poignant the books are overwritten and pretentious and ultimately empty it's so frustrating and it's started to make me wonder if maybe i just don't get it or if maybe i'm just too critical but ahhhhhh then i read this mr marra's constellation of vital phenomena and it really is brilliant and poignant and heartbreaking and powerful and haunting and all those other words reviewers like to throw around and i was nervous before starting it too because i knew it was about chechnya a young orphan girl and a jaded female doctor and all of those elements could easily veer into precisely that awful type of pretentious overwritten self indulgent book that i hate instead the characters were well rounded and believable the writing was lovely and simple and the various stories intertwined masterfully to create a truly remarkable and cohesive tale it's the type of story that chechnya deserves brutal but also nuanced and deeply empathetic it's a terrifying tragic book it kind of has to be given the setting but it is also filled with strange quiet moments of grace which is not to say it's perfect there were a few bits that were overwritten including one page and a half long sentence and i thought the quick romance between akhmed and sonja was a bit unnecessary because of those bits i did consider giving it four stars instead remember what i said about me being too critical in the end though i really loved this book i'm so glad i gave it a shot you should too it's a good'un","1034":"well drawn characters kept me reading this tough book about chechnya","1035":"a very nice debut novel i enjoyed both the style it was delivered in flashback in a series of connected years as well as the pace chechnya is the place and the brutality of both time and persons involved is vividly captured while the story weaves between past and present with subtle references to a very distant future love loss betrayal and the constant reminder that to preserve the past one must protect the future nicely done","1036":"beautifully written and heartbreaking the novel deals with the effects of the chechnyan wars on two russian sisters and a small village of chechnyans the stories are intertwined and marra does a good job of weaving them together in a poignant manner i really enjoyed the book though i did sometimes have trouble following who the characters were i did enjoy the biblical references and the way marra describes the effects of trauma on its victims definitely recommend this novel","1037":"a very interesting story of a time period and geographical area i know very little about i loved how the characters and stories of each character intertwined with one another my favourite part of the book was how you learn about the fate of every character whether throughout the story or immediately after they are mentioned such a unique approach to story telling i walked away from this book feeling very satisfied knowing the result of lives after the story","1038":"this was a difficult story to read on many levels names and settings at times were difficult to keep track of depressing situations abound funny enough this author kept my interest throughout the book kudos to him not a book to read unless you are in a really good mood","1039":"i was unsure about this novel but it drew me in right from the beginning it takes place in chechnya after the fall of the soviet union and the action takes place over five days but with many flashbacks to tell and interweave the stories of the protagonists the author does a spectacular job of telling the story and making you care for the characters one of the vehicles he uses is telling you what happens in the future to many of the minor characters that pepper the story it is done with such adeptness that you believe that he has mapped out the lives of everyone in the story and knows exactly what each one will do after the novel ends the writing is wonderful with such expressive phrases but not using an overabundance of words i knew pretty much nothing about chechnya and what happened during the wars and how little the residents had and how they lived in terror of unexplained disappearances the caprice of killings whenever it suited the person and the torture that was endured in the landfill sonja is the brilliant surgeon who returns from london to her native country in hopes of finding her sister natasha dokka who is betrayed by his childhood friend ramzan and taken to the landfill ramzan the betrayer of many and his father khassan who refuses to talk to him akhmed the incompetent doctor friend of dokka and savior of dokka's daughter havaa much of the story takes place in hospital 6 which sonja heads but where they do little more than amputate limbs that have met land mines or deliver babies akhmed brings havaa to her and volunteers to help in the hospital to keep havaa safe marra manages to connect all of these lives but you don't know exactly how until almost the end of the book i cannot praise marra's prose enough and i highly recommend this book","1040":" this book is intense but worth the time and effort the writing is breathtaking and even in the most painful moments there's beauty to be found much like in a war torn country you're left to assume after reading the interconnectedness of the characters adds a layer of depth i wasn't expecting the omniscient narrator lets you see everything all at once but it never overwhelms you instead you feel connected to every single character you encounter i can honestly say i've never quite experience anything like reading this book it's going to stay with me for a very long time","1041":"excellent i laughed and cried a modern ish russian love story","1042":"the best book i've read in years i will no longer be able to use five stars as freely as i have because this book was so awesome the plot the time the super long sentence that started on page 138 and ended on page 140 the ending it is a brilliant brilliant book i finished it with tears streaming down my face unbelievable","1043":"when i read this book i finally felt that i was reading something that i loved and could be totally immersed in the last time that i remember feeling this way was when i read cutting for stone what struck me most was the language it was almost lyrical i am sick of reading books with three sentence paragraphs and clipped cadences this completely deserves the national book award nomination and i am rooting for it","1044":" a powerful book that pulls you into a world of war torture and the near collapse of society the author has a great voice and i really liked the audiobook's female narrator and in the process of unfolding the story of a young girl and two doctors over the span of essentially five days in 2004 it dips back into the personal histories of its characters eventually tying them all together in unexpected and heartbreaking ways in the process it gives humanity to some seemingly unredeemable characters i had tears at the end","1045":"a constellation of vital phenomena was a beautifully written story where all people are eventually connected it comes full circle with a plot in the past and present moving towards one another the story was a bit slow at times and really fascinating at others i loved the book but when i finished i felt like i didn't get as much of a story as i wanted","1046":"i listened to the audio version of this book while exercising because of a hectic schedule my regular exercise routine has been disrupted over the last three months so my sessions with this book happened in fits and starts but even so i enjoyed the book immensely and i plan to read it again in print form the title comes from a description of life in a medical textbook life is a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation the story revolves around three main characters as well as several others over the years 1994 2006 in war torn chechnya sonja is a weary physician working in a bombed out hospital havaa an eight year old girl who has lost her family to war and akhmed an incompetent doctor and neighbor of havaa who bargains with sonja to take the girl in in exchange for working at the hospital the writing is exceptional and it sparkles with humor and pathos as human connections are made and broken and life is lived in the middle of extraordinary circumstances a really wonderful story","1047":"in a spin on what my mom always says it doesn't have to be an easy read to be a good read she says it doesn't have to be an easy life to be a good life this is a very sad and horrific book that keeps unfolding and opening up new surprises and connections reduced to the minimalism of war why do people still care need and reach out to eachother glad i slogged through the beginning it picked up and was worthwhile","1048":"interesting yet depressing but war is depressing","1049":"that was quite simply one of the funniest saddest and most beautifully written books i have ever read","1050":"an extraordinary debut novel about love loss betrayal and hope set in chechnya from 1994 to 2004 this is the story of a small handful of people who are interconnected in ways invisible even to them the skill of author anthony marra is stunning may this young man have a very long writing career i predict that this book will win awards","1051":"bits are hard to take other bits okay not exactly a page turner","1052":"a customer recently contacted our store to formally request that we not carry the august issue of rolling stone due to the controversial image on its cover i appreciate her concerns and agree that it's poor taste for the magazine to portray the young man accused of planting bombs at the boston marathon as though he were a celebrity personally i object to the portrayal but as a university store we have decided not to join the boycott of the issue we want to add to the discussion not take away from it the issue will be available on request but not displayed in its place i will be promoting a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra it is a devastating story told with immaculate care by a decorated debut author marra didn't take an easy route for his first novel although i wouldn't term it overly ambitious to crib from the title it is a vital story one that required refined skill to write and needed to be published and i commend hogarth for doing so it is a necessary read for anyone trying to understand the violent forces that shape the people of chechnya there is nothing glamorous in the portrayal of violence for the sake of any cause not even in the amputation of a leg mutilated by a mine as in the attacks in boston only eight year old havaa isn't compromised in this constant struggle to survive but she is without recourse when her father is taken by russian forces she hides in the woods as her house is burned to the ground the russians will leave no trace of her family without exceptions her father's friend akhmed finds her first and takes her from their remote village of eldar to the city of volchansk where there is a shelled out hospital a single surgeon named sonja still operates the hospital but she too has been shelled out by ten years of fighting akhmed the village's unlicensed doctor trades his rudimentary assistance for havaa's boarding in the hospital akhmed a chechnyan and sonja a russian continue to function in their grim circumstances and between them they manage to spare havaa from a terrible fate a constellation of vital phenomena is a tragic tale of friends family and neighbors who alternately wrong and ultimately redeem one another it should resonate with anyone who experienced the 'b strong' resolve that swept through boston in the wake of the deplorable attack i recommend keeping the focus on the survivors who carried one another to safety which is why i strongly recommend this book","1053":"easily one of the best books i've read in a long time","1054":"soul wrenching and soul uplifting this is a book that will linger with you long after you close the back cover marra's writing is a wonder","1055":" this is one of the best books i have read this year havaa eight watches as her father is abducted by federal soldiers in chechnya her neighbor akhmed finds her and takes to her a nearby hospital for refuge sonja the lone doctor left working at the war damaged hospital is searching for her sister who disappeared a year ago all of the characters lives are intertwined in this powerful and moving book the book has a fair amount of casual brutality so some portions are very difficult to stomach regardless all of the characters no matter how minor and many tiny items strewn about the story have intricate detailed stories and epilogues the author constantly plays with the tense of the story this beautiful and heart wrenching story of a war torn society reminded me of other novels i have enjoyed such as the tiger's wife and everything if illuminated my daughter was sick recently and as she laid on my chest in a semi conscious state she asked me to read my book aloud to her as i read the last two bittersweet pages i was holding back tears and could barely manage to get the words out this book is sure to be on my top 10 list at the end of the year amazon's best books of may 2013","1056":"i really wanted to like this book more than i did it was an interesting story but it didn't call out to me to pick it up and keep reading","1057":"i found it so difficult to keep the characters straight that i kept a crib sheet of all their names once i did i loved the book","1058":" very occasionally do i fall in love more with the prose than the story marra's unique voice along with his beautiful metaphors shapes a constellation of vital phenomena to the great mold that is a classical literary novel the way he jumps in time allows us to learn in full flushed details the motives the dreams and the struggles of each and every character i would definitely recommend the story to others and to think this was marra's first novel i can't wait to read his future works","1059":"spectacular interwoven lives the threads unseen by those who are connected only we the readers can perceive the constellations","1060":"heavy almost too heavy for me to lift but not quite one of those books that changes your life or at least the lens through which you view the world the darkness is countered by poetic beauty and amazing imagery the author's ability to create real and complex human emotion response and motivation is impressive this is a difficult but rewarding read","1061":"an amazing book in so many ways first i couldn't imagine having written it i couldn't imagine creating such a world i couldn't possibly imagine what such a world would be like i could imagine creating say darkness at noon creating a world inside a totalitarian prison being interrogated i could imagine creating an invented dystopian world such as that of 1984 but what life would be like in a war torn country cut loose from morality convention basically cut loose from the 20th and 21st centuries how did anthony marra do it how did he know so much about chechnya and what it was like to be there and to find out that he did essentially what i do in writing a novel he did it all through research and then made that researched world come alive amazing also for the imagery astonishing without being flashy amazing for the intricate handling of time and characters within time a young man his first novel i would have loved to have been at iowa with him to have had a hand in workshopping this manuscript which would mostly have been a matter of saying wow keep going","1062":" i don't like reading war novels stories that are painful for the characters hopeless and hard to take but i seem to read lots of them and they're usually really good the ones i read anyway this one is a well told tale covering just a few days but with flashbacks to other years throughout the compelling story of several interesting and diverse characters a female doctor her heroine addicted sister an 8 year old girl etc i learned about the history and politics of this area that i knew next to nothing about less gruesome detail about how terrible people are to each other would suit me better but it was totally relevant to the story","1063":"this story encompasses the lives of six characters and their struggles in chechnya during russian occupation ultimately this story occurs over the course of five days but the author gives glimpses both into the past and into the future of their lives at times this story was difficult to read due to the violent nature of the times but the humanity of the characters kept you hoping for the best and turning the pages a very very interesting read","1064":"this book is set during the chechen conflict of the 1990s and as a historical novel it sheds light on a topic not known by many americans there is beauty in its narrative but it does not shy from the brutality that existed during that time note i read this book as part of a book club and probably would not have read it otherwise i try to shy away books that deal with genocide and war because it can be depressing","1065":"heart breakingly beautiful book challenging read but worth it can be hard to follow so don't stretch it out too much","1066":"i would give it ten stars if i could one of the best books i've read this year","1067":" in the back drop of war torn chechnya this work of fiction is a story of great sacrifice love and the strength and triumph of human spirit havaa an eight year old watches from the bushes when her father is taken away by rebels akhmed her father's friend and neighbor is watching too with horror then when he finds the child with a suitcase hiding in the bushes he takes matter in his own hands and takes her to the only broken down hospital where a talented and gritty doctor sonja is helping as many wounded as possible he takes havaa there and asks sonja to protect her from the rebels sonja is not ready at first but slowly takes on the rolethe characters are so well described where does morality end or begin three neighbors surviving the war torn village in chechnya they are refugees by no fault of theirs their struggles their survival the decisons they take that changes lives around them where does the blame stop or begin sonja who had a good life in london gives everything up and is back home to search for her lost sister treating people when she can does her sacrifice mean anything when war strikes wonderfully woven stories that touches the human heart","1068":"if i could give six stars i would this is a beautifully crafted novel with prose so beautiful that i would cry the story is revolves around several people living in chechnya in the 2000s at the time of the fighting between the russians and the people fighting for independence struggle intrigue betrayal and torture are the norm and yet small pieces of hope are found","1069":"i cried when i read this one too startlingly good for a first novel","1070":"this is a contemporary version of any classic piece of russian literature full of awful things hardship misery and no happiness although this book does offer a small glimmer of hope it reads like a tolstoy i could have quit this novel at any time yet i felt compelled to finish it and continue to hope that something anything could make this finish with a positive spin i was at least happy to finally finish it and go back to my happy life and be thankful that i was spared the nightmare of living any of their lives","1071":"a great book and i do not use the word great lightly","1072":" this story meanders in surprising sad sometimes frustrating ways the stories of several people are spun out into the air and then slowly are brought back together honestly it was like nothing i've really read before only two complaints the girl havaa was the central figure mostly and i wished we had more sections with her in it instead of just being the reason why things were happening and i really wish the author had not done so many run on sentences i swear on was well over a page long","1073":"wow what an amazing story beautiful story wrapped around a scary truth loved it","1074":"in a rural village in december 2004 chechnya a failed doctor akhmed harbors the traumatized 8 year old daughter of a father abducted by russian forces and treats a series of wounded rebels and refugees while exploring the shared past that binds him to the child this is a very depressing read and none of the characters are really very likable i did however learn a lot about the wars in chechnya in the 1990s","1075":"this book was beautifully written but it was dense i couldn't read for too long without taking a break between the somewhat heavy material missing sisters disappeared fathers torture u0026amp betrayal during war time chechnya and the dense writing sorry but that's the only way i can think to describe it this book is like a rich dessert a rich dark sad perfectly composed dessert you might have a smile on your lips by the end of it but it's going to be a while before you're ready to go back for more definitely a five star contender but i'm not sure that i would want to re read this so objectively probably five stars but for me personally four stars","1076":"i wanted to like this book more than i did i was confused during most of the first half after which it picked up and i got more into it","1077":"a tapestry of individual stories of love loss courage stupidity and all the other characteristics that make us human set in chechnya and moving back and forth in time and between characters holds the readers interest and makes the unfolding stories somehow more poignant there's humor set right next to tragedy and hope next to despair a touching set of characters i feel like i've come to know and love and miss now that it's all over","1078":"a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra came highly recommended from a fellow bibliophile it was on the long list for the national book award five stars but this book has more back and forths through time than the doctor has ever even experienced however all the excursions through time do lead to something the story is set mostly in chechnya through the 2nd war although it does cover the 1st war somewhat the story is about sonja searching for her missing sister natasha dokka who has been disappeared by the feds haava his daughter akhmed their friend beautifully written with a haunting ending","1079":"the book's title is the definition of life found in sonja's medical dictionary that's what she and others in the small village in chechnya are trying to hold onto during the war raging there few are able to beautifully written the picture of life lived during war makes one wish there could never be another one and that no more innocent people must suffer lives like these people do","1080":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a heartbreaking novel about anarchy in war torn chechnya torture is common disappearances of innocent civilians are a daily occurrence if insurgents occupy a village even against the will of the villagers russian reprisals are likely the insurgents seem equally likely to punish villagers for situations beyond their control in the middle of the night in the desperately poor village of eldar dokka's door is kicked in by soldiers he is taken away he will never return his daughter havaa watches from her hiding place in the woods the soldiers search for her too - guilt by association in the morning havaa stands before the burned ruin of her home with a kind neighbor akhmed who has a plan to hide her from the \"feds\" so begins the weaving of a tapestry that ties together the lives of disparate characters i thank anthony marra for revealing the impossible plight of the people of chechnya i appreciate the life we have in the united states despite the foolish infighting of our leaders in washington","1081":"without a doubt the best book i have read this year anthony marra has created a world where heartbreak is commonplace and filled it with characters who feel real vital terrible and forgivable read this soon but do it on a day with nothing else to do you won't stop also kudos to the audiobook production it was expertly handled","1082":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a constellation of vital phenomena reads like a apocalyptic novel but it is actually a vivid reimagining of the chechen conflict and the people caught between not one but two brutal wars it is a multilayered novel that explores the intersecting lives of the characters as they navigate and adapt to a landscape that has been transformed by war it is a story of love sacrifice kindness brutality and survival i look forward to reading more from this very talented author","1083":" one of my favorite parts about this book was that the author included brief descriptions of most character's lives he jumped ahead by months years and decades to tell you what happened to characters beyond the years of the story what they did in the future how they lived where they ended up what they did for a living how they died it was a nice way to really round out each character this was done with even very minor characters and it gave a great sense of everyone's role in the story when i read i always wonder what happened to certain characters and i love that with this story i got to find out","1084":"this is a fantastic book i read it in less than 24 hours couldn't put it down once i started it i look forward to more books from this amazing author","1085":"an extraordinary book and heartbreaking","1086":"great book though a work of fiction it gives you a look at what it's like to live in a war torn country through the eyes of it's civilian citizens the author did a great job of weaving the stories of the characters together terrific","1087":"gorgeous writing and an incredible story i will never forget these characters lots of sad difficult subjects like war and human trafficking but a beautiful study in human resilience and redemption","1088":"well developed cast of characters and engaging fictionalized tale about historical events and a part of the world i am woefully ignorant of the novel as the author's interview comments state achieves hitting the high as well as the low notes in order to be true to the emotional reality of life the language is beautiful descriptive and the author seamlessly moves between events of the past and the present the moral conflicts presented in chechnya are realistic and compelling and the author sheds light on the complexities and choices one might make the novel leaves the reader with great hope","1089":"i think this book needs to be read in as few sessions as possible to fully grasp the story my reading was too spacious and i feel like i missed didn't make all the intended connections due to this","1090":"i am sure there is a good story here but i just couldn't get into it i gave it 150 pages and gave up","1091":"wow before i read this book i knew nothing about chechnya i don't even know if i'd ever even heard the name before let alone anything about its history or current standing that doesn't matter though because anthony marra brings you right there everything comes to life on these pages and you become absolutely consumed by it every character here is fully realized and developed everyone is real complex flawed human we understand their motivations without having them shoved in our face i honestly can't heap enough praise upon this book it's impactful and important and i'm sure i will carry this story with me for a long time","1092":"very powerful novel for me the vast amount of research that went into the book seemed to show for me this did not detract from the 'story' or the language but it made the suspension of disbelief harder the language was at times very powerful particularly the language around suffering i was also impressed by the role of memory and vision in the book my qualms about the research aside it astonishes me how talented the author is","1093":"brilliant the writing is amazing the plot is creative the author manages to convey so much about chechnya and the wars with russia in such fluid language and with humor and grace","1094":"my favorite book so far this year learned about chechnya a sad story yet felt such a sense of hope when i finished","1095":"giving up at page 120 maybe i will come back to it later maybe i will appreciate it more another time by now i should care about the characters and i don't the writing seems contrived alot of words about nothing it feels heavy and grey and pointless i can barely make myself pick up the book and that is not a good way to spend my precious reading time a 4 25 rating really i don't get it","1096":"this is a hard book to review the writing was masterful so densely packed that sometimes i had to reread a paragraph once or twice filled with dozens of tiny poignant terribly brief references to the millions of people living individual unremarkable lives throughout the war s and many other reviews refer to how the writer manages to highlight our shared humanity shining through the hellish conditions but i mostly got caught up in the hellish conditions it was brutal reading about the things that happened to the main characters none are protagonists or antagonists really which is a feat in itself in writing a book about wartime conditions they are all imperfect people living in impossible situations and i certainly learned a little about a war i knew nothing about although i didn't learn that much since the book does not focus on the politics of the wars but rather on ordinary people just trying to survive the torture the unendurable losses the grim continuation of life after seemingly unimaginable horrors it was sort of terrible to read about i was never very eager to pick the book up after setting it down i didn't want to not read it and i wanted to know what happened to the characters but i sort of wanted to skip ahead to the end and just be done with it it was hard to shake off the feelings brought on by this book in the author's notes he says the book uses two common religious themes stories one a father's sacrifices of and for his children and two the idea of an orphaned child being delivered into the care of the people responsible for the death of her family so those are two pretty heavy themes right there and then wrap those around the framework of terrible senseless brutality and war and that's this book so great writing but hard and not entirely pleasant to read","1097":" this is a beautiful book but i just finished and the mountains echoed and i just can't with another distressing horror against humanity i had to put it down but not before i read the end which is gorgeous i just couldn't read about wires sewn through fingers and the monstrous acts against the chechens i had no idea there were 2 wars and the residents were forced to resettle elsewhere then when they were repatriated when another ethnic group took the hit back on their land which was ruined the disappearances started amidst this the people are shattered but salvation happens in small and large ways","1098":" where to begin this book was stunning not just marra's writing which was incredible and which i stopped to savor many times throughout but the story genius i don't think i will ever forget this book i can't believe this is a first novel it is the type of book that leaves me in awe wondering how someone just thinks this stuff up seriously his writing is breathtaking as far as the reading experience i'd liken it to the kite runner in many ways it deals with a war ravaged region chechnya that i knew know little about and does so in such a haunting and beautiful way the characters come alive i love how the point of view switches around and i absolutely love the omniscient narrator that reveals things about the past present and future a word of warning it is a very intense novel and i would not recommend it to the faint of heart or easily offended just as in the kite runner there are heavy subjects and scenes which aren't necessarily pleasant to read this book doesn't sugar coat there are a few scenes of interrogation related torture and other violence descriptions of medical procedures like amputations and some profanity none of which i found gratuitous the top rated reviews here on goodreads do a fantastic job of summing up this book so i'd also recommend reading some of those if you are interested","1099":"after friends giving rave reviews i had to read this it took me a bit to keep track of all of the characters the story is so complicated but in a good way for a novel and not a confusing way mixing time and characters you grow to have sympathy for all of them despite their flaws i never thought i would ever care to read a novel about chechnya but i loved it \"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \"","1100":"i loved this book the characters were all flawed and very human the setting in chechnya amid wars was heartbreaking i'm imagining the authors story while fiction is based on real events i plan to reread it and learn more about this region","1101":"loved this book a little difficult to read at times but so worth it","1102":"once upon a time in a faraway place called chechnya a gut wrenching account of a little girl and the people who loved her every sentence was a jewel describing horrors unknown in this country i couldn't put it down","1103":"beautiful and heartbreaking i loved it","1104":"this is one of the best novels i've read in a long time it weaves the lives of various characters together with the backdrop of the chechen wars over the course of a ten year period the book is filled with sadness and atrocities but somehow maintains an optimistic tone","1105":"what a compelling novel great pacing captivating imagery and a moving plot line this story does not wince from the uncomfortable and for that i thank the author it did not take the reader for granted it ranks up there with russel banks the darling scott simon's pretty birds and dave eggers' what is the what for shining light on little thought of war torn peoples","1106":"absolutely beautiful","1107":" every once in a long while i come across a debut novel that is exceptionally spectacular \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" by anthony marra is one of those novels it reminded me considerably of \"the almond tree\" by michelle cohen corasanti another brilliant debut set in chechnya between the years of 1994 and 2004 this novel follows the lives of the members of a small town and the family of a russian surgeon marra's writing is beautiful and flawless his character development is absolutely perfect each character is so remarkably human in both their imperfections and their virtues the reader is immersed in the lives of these people through every small joy and each horrible atrocity marra is a remarkable storyteller the numerous characters' subplots are exceptionally and beautifully interwoven each has touched another's life in a direct or indirect way this novel enlightens the readers of the struggles of their lives and relates every powerful emotion of a lifetime of uncertainty and struggle this book opened my eyes in a way few of us ever experience in the united states \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is captivating and demonstrative of the different ways humans choose to fight for survival in the face of injustice and war marra does an exemplary job allowing the reader to see from multiple viewpoints of the same conflict this novel is life altering thought provoking exceptionally detailed and absolutely unique \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is stunning it is one of the best novels i have ever read ever i received this novel through goodreads first reads this in no way influenced my review i did not receive compensation for nor was required to write a review","1108":"the best book i read in a long time i can't believe this is a debut novel i learned a lot and was impressed by the quality of the writing couldn't put it down","1109":"this is easily one of my favorite books and i want to tell everyone i know to read it not only is his writing amazing and so beautiful but the way the story is unfolded and revealed is done so lovely equal parts heart breaking and heart warming i loved the characters and these glimpses in to their lives so so good go read this book","1110":"a great moving story the author does an interesting job of weaving different time periods and characters' stories together but sometimes gets a little too carried away with his own cleverness","1111":" this was a tough read and i mean a really tough read bleak horrific devastating to the point of unbearable and beyond the recent wars in chechnya are described from the point of view of small town people and the devastation is massive the atrocities unthinkable you just can't believe that this kind of stuff was taking place while we were all having ice cream sundaes and watching movies or whatever with our kids the first half of the book was extremely hard to get through for me it very much felt like your typical war story black and white good guys and bad guys but everything changes halfway through things get turned on their head and the good guys are no longer that good the bad guys no longer that bad because as you get more information about these people and the impossible situations they are put in you begin to understand that sometimes good folks find themselves in circumstances where there is no right way to act there is no perfect outcome maybe even no good or reasonably good outcome and you are confronted with the reality of how far you are willing to go to save yourself your own and avoid pain and torture as it turns out most people will go pretty far and i honestly think we all will when confronted with this kind of nightmare while being isolated and cut off from any real information the novel is well written and more than succeeds in the point it is trying to make in a lot of ways i feel that it deserves 5 stars certainly the second half of it does but i just didn't like it enough it was simply too hopeless and horrible for me to love it and even though i did eventually connect with the characters it took a long time to get there","1112":" a constellation of vital phenomena is unlike any other book i have ever read and i mean that in the best possible sense of the word anthony marra has managed to craft a masterpiece of fiction while simultaneously giving us a glimpse at a people and a history that very few under the age of 40 know much about although the story takes place during wartime in chechnya the real standout in marra's first novel it the way he has managed to craft a story that is about the interconnectedness of everything it has taken me a while to compose my thought about this book it has stayed with me so much longer than anything else i have read in recent months for so many reasons this novel so gently and delicately crafted still manages to have the impact of nothing less than a nuclear bomb what starts with the introduction of an eight year old 'havaa' a child whose father has been disappeared in the night as so many other men and women were during the ethnically charged war quickly spins into a story of truth lies loss and love in the most difficult of circumstance when akhmed a small town physician and artist takes havaa to a noted doctor in a nearby town begging this surgeon sonja to save the girls life a series of events are set into motion as planets in a constellation we are given a glimpse into the past and find out the unbelievable ways in which seemingly unrelated events and circumstances intersect and eclipse each other in surprising ways while the story of akhmed and sonja evolves over just a few days we are taken back and forth in time where we are introduced to a precious cast of characters each with their own flaws and strengths the stories intertwine intersect and eclipse one another but more than all this they speak of the human condition human nature and the depths that only love can survive this book will change your life you will try not to be affected by it but it will leave your heart raw from the sheer horror and depravity of the acts some humans perpetrate upon each other you will be touched by the acts of strength and compassion that can change the world but mostly you will gasp with awe as the pieces of the puzzle of this masterful first novel by anthony marra begin to come together i feel so privileged to have had the honor to read this book and i know you will feel the very same way a constellation of vital phenomena is a landmark of modern fiction it raises the bar high and i hope to have the pleasure of reading more of anthony marra's work in the future highly recommended this review is based on a copy received via a goodreads first reads giveaway the honest opinions and comments expressed are my own and are in no way influenced by goodreads the publisher or the author","1113":"stunning storytelling hysterical raw historically heartbreaking incredible character development his ability to jump back and forth in time and create powerful mapping and reference points for history and character growth was just incredible amazing debut novel for marra","1114":"i liked the backdrop of chechnya and the bleakness of the war these people have to survive in","1115":" i spent more than a week picking up this book and reading a few paragraphs only to put it down after deciding it was too heavy for me finally i decided to sit down and read ten pages before deciding to give up completely before i knew it i had read 62 pages and was so involved in the story that i couldn't imagine doing anything else but reading it it was very very sad it was sad all the way through the last pages but it was so well written and so heartfelt the characters were completely believable and although at times the prose was a little much i skipped whole paragraphs when i decided i didn't care about every tiny detail that didn't seem that important to the story overall this was one of the best books i have read in a long time the author's notes at the back referred to a lot of books he had read about chechnya some of which i am eager to read also","1116":" this book is a slow burner it may not grab you within the first fifty pages but persevere and you'll be rewarded as the story progresses you'll see how the six principal characters in this story set in war torn chechnya from 1994 through 2004 interrelate and touch each other's lives the title comes from the definition of life found in a medical dictionary in the context of this novel that definition refers to not only the cells and processes within one organism but individual people relating to one another within a sea of desperate humanity i've noticed lately that some novels set in the modern day real world especially in countries at war or with repressive regimes resemble dystopian science fiction stories this is one of those funny at times but also devastatingly heartbreaking","1117":" in 20 years time as high school students pick up required reading lists for summer term as i did 20 some odd years ago amongst the digital downloads of shakespeare faulkner and salinger i know after reading this book they will also chose marra anthony marra to be exact and the book is a constellation of vital phenomena most people know i am an avid reader but this book haunted me for days i began reading on a plane to louisville kentucky and somehow got transported to chechnya in the former soviet union where marra's words and landscape kept me hungry cold and in a tangible sadness as i devoured each chapter review by patti lightread the full review here http www countylinemagazine com sep","1118":"i will be thinking about the this story and the characters in this book for many days to come beautifully written and heartbreaking at the same time","1119":"a beautifully written book about a horrifying and sad time","1120":"very interesting book and a beautiful story that is also educational","1121":"i think i would have enjoyed this book more at a different time of year on the beach in the summer though well it's a little heavy for that the last 75 pages or so finally grabbed me and now that i'm finished even if i didn't enjoy it i can appreciate what a fantastic book it actually is","1122":"this debut novel is a beautiful blend of well developed characters and a moving story of the connections between them with a palatable and fascinating dose of chechen history i highly recommend it","1123":"if i could give a book six stars or seven this would be that book","1124":"as many other reviewers mentioned this was 5 stars one of the most beautifully written books ever yes parts are difficult to read but the intersection of lives and events is skillfully done i wish marra would have provided a bit of backdrop into how this small group from the islam faith ended up in this village but it did not detract from the story at all highly recommend if you like good literature and a beautifully told story","1125":"2 5 stars i almost didn't finish this book because nothing picked up until about page 150 from there the present tense was predictable but the flashback character development was interesting","1126":"wonderful prose i often dislike books that jump time periods throughout but here it worked it wove in story and character details beautifully","1127":"the author dealt honestly with chechnya's recent history so many parts of the novel were hard to get through it was at times heartbreaking hilarious and frightening parts of the novel read like poetry to be reread and savored the characters often had to make difficult choices when doing the right thing meant examining the gray areas between what society expects and what one's conscience will accept i look forward to reading more from this author","1128":"there were so many characters and time frames going on in this story that i had to take notes to keep it all straight in my head i would have enjoyed this one much more had it been written in chronological order","1129":"i loved anthony marra's first novel it is beautifully written the writing is original and fresh and the story cannot help but capture your heart it becomes evident that marra spent an extensive amount of time in eastern europe and is imminently qualified to write this moving and heartbreaking story about chechnya a must read historical novel i will be looking forward to future works from this splendid writer","1130":"closer to 4 stars","1131":"the most powerful imaginative historical and lyrical work of fiction i have read in some time i can't stop thinking about it will definitely teach this book perhaps this fall in my literature and philosophy course","1132":"in this dark and sprawling novel the author tackles the wars in chechnya and the precipitous decline of the country within that larger story are a multitude of smaller more personal stories that clarify the impossibility of living under the arbitrary horrors of military rule in a country with a crumbled infrastructure the main characters include the only surgeon left at a hospital a little girl that is at risk of being disappeared a woman forced into drug induced sex slavery a historian and an informer the only weaknesses in the book were a habit of intertwining stories in an unlikely manner and omniscient narration of every character's life including peripheral characters however the omniscience ended up filling out the larger story of chechnya in a really interesting way so that was forgivable the relentlessly intersecting stories were corny at times but lent a sweetness to the end that leavened the darkness that is inherent throughout the book a truly superb first novel i look forward to reading more by this author","1133":" what a beautiful haunting and intense novel i didn't know a lot about chechnya history when i first started this but was compelled to look up information as i was reading to give me some background information on what i was reading about i can see why this was on many best reads of 2013 lists i loved how the author seamlessly wove the stories of so many different people together against the backdrop of this war torn nation seemingly simple in the writing style this was easy to read but also contained some sentence paragraphs that blew me away a perfect book club pick","1134":"a good read but somewhat scattered hard to follow some of the characters powerful and depressing in parts i would seek out other work by this author","1135":" this is not an 'easy' book to read but it's definitely one that is worth reading it's slow and captures some horrific and tragic circumstances it's not a fun read or a light read in any way but it's so worth taking the time to work through it it really captures chechyna during this time and place giving you a frighteningly realistic view of war and its impact on humanity the characters are fantastic and really gave life to this often bleak story i definitely see why this book keeps showing up on the best of 2013 lists it's definitely one that i highly recommend","1136":" it's a sad book but very well written about a small village in chechnya the main characters are havaa an eight year old who watches from the forest as her father dokka is being taken away by the russians for accusations of aiding chechen rebels havaa's neighbor akhmed finds her and takes her to the hospital where sonja rabina the sole remaining doctor cares for the wounded sonja remains in chechnya because she is looking for her lost sister natasha anthony has weaved a story of each of his character's lives that is sad and sweet","1137":"more than three quarters of the way through this heart breaking and compelling novel the title above is defined for us on page 1322 of a medical dictionary life a constellation of vital phenomena organisation irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation in the middle of one of the many awful wars of the past 100 years this unusual definition places humanity small kindnesses personal and intimate deeds at the heart of the story and the people in this novel chechnya breakaway republic from the iron arm of russia rich in natural resources not allowed to be in charge of its destiny by mighty moscow in our western press all we have ever really heard about this isolated far away place is the extreme actions of its terrorists but this is a region which has had more than its fair share of destruction rebuild invasion expulsion rebuild than any population should have to bear hardly surprising they should choose to resist from time to time but as with most stories of war very little is ever told of the lives of the ordinary people their inability to control or manage their fate and the fates of their families so it is in this story amazingly this is a first novel and the author is still only in his twenties following a period of study in st petersburg he first came to learn about chechnya its people and its history the quote above comes from a medical dictionary he was looking at one day the story moves somewhat erratically between 1994 and 2004 when the latest two wars took place the action in 2004 takes place over five days and is centered in a village where three men akhmed dokka ramzan all friends since childhood live another key character is ramzan's father khassan the story is also told through the eyes of dokka's eight year old daughter havaa a brilliant russian born doctor sofia and her sister natasha heart breaking things happen to each of these people and they are all faced at some stage with making some very hard decisions as they confront the terrible consequences of civil war in the very first paragraph havaa sees her father seized by the feds and her house burnt down she is rescued by akhmed who flees with her to the one and only surviving hospital which he knows is the only place havaa will be safe from the russians he entrusts her to the care of sofia and as an ex doctor himself stays to help out unfolding in the village is the ongoing search for havaa the dilemma that ramzan who is an informer faces and the position that khassan too finds himself in as the story unfolds natasha's link to this small village and the resulting betrayals unfolds nothing however is ever simple but the constant and at times annoying plot movements over the ten year period slowly begin to make sense this is a haunting story and like many other novels of its kind can't help but make us question how we in our safe comfortable worlds would behave in such extreme circumstances","1138":"excellent book definitely one to re read parts are gory but that is the reality of war","1139":" i finished reading a constellation of vital phenomenon by anthony marra yesterday it is an amazingly well written book i sobbed uncontrollably for about the last ~40 pages you learn a little about chechnya's history find out how completely insignificant and incomprehensible america is there discover exactly how marginalized women were are in that country and experience real relationships as they develop in a war torn area as americans we have had the luxury of fighting our wars on soil that is not our own for ~150 years this story demonstrates just how fortunate we and other countries like us have been i can't recommend this book highly enough","1140":" i bought this book because it was one listed as one of the 'new voices' authors at barnes and noble in the past i have enjoyed these suggested books and agreed they were well worth reading as for this particular offering the feeling was not so mutual although i thought this book was extremely well written choice of descriptive words and phrashing was imaginative and at times even 'phenomenal' g the story overall never lived up to the command of the language and was even at times a bit confusing of course with the subject matter being chechnya in the 1990's and early 2000's i was not expecting rolicking entertainment but i did expect more given the list of ultra positive reviews plastered all over the back of the book not that the choice of what books i read is dictated by reviews the author created characters that were suffering horrible experiences based on fact no doubt yet and please forgive me for saying so i never felt truly invested in them for all the beauty of the words this was not a book i wished would never end but one i made myself get through hoping to change my mind about it","1141":"what a beautifully told completely devastating story i know pretty much nothing about chechnya's war torn history but this novel reveals some of it through the heartbreaking lives of its characters there is some hope at the end at least for a few characters but even though the story was an emotional ride it was worth it","1142":"didn't feel quite as authentic and authoritative as herta muller's work but an impressive and memorable debut novel that should please fans of the history of love and the master butchers' singing club looking forward to seeing what marra writes next","1143":"story of people in a village in chechnya over the past decade showing the consequences of war and how it affects people's actions","1144":"perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so it's object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written","1145":"excellent story but harsh","1146":"i had no idea that the war in chechnya was so brutal this book could have been very depressing but it focused on people who were managing to live meaningful lives in spite of the violence around them the language was a little more flowery than i prefer but the story was engrossing","1147":"i agree that this book was not an easy read it did have some laugh out loud humorous moments but overall it was quite sobering war is a horrible thing and the result to the people involved is truly tragic","1148":"beautifully written i loved the characters and the way they were brought to life","1149":" a constellation of vital phenomena 3 7 out of 4 0 loon stars this is a big ambitious book about life and death in chechnya it's a book about life and it just happens to be set in a world that's seen two wars and collapsing empires and massive population relocations and the constant fear of inexplicable disappearances funny and warm and i already miss achmed the worst doctor in chechnya if you liked everything is illuminated or city of thieves and you like learning about corners of the world through fiction read this book you will like it too","1150":"this is a hard read for several reasons there is so much to wrap your head around the year changes the characters telling the story and the profound word choice the author intertwines the story lines and uses an unusual style of telling us what the future will be one sentence is a page long but by the second half of the book i was reading for answers it was compellingi am glad i read it but the heartache and torture are not easy parts to read","1151":"i chose a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra for my book club to read i had read some good reviews of the book when i started the book i didn't really know anything about the two wars that occurred in chechnya so i looked at the wikapedia entry and got some information the novel met my expectations about life in russia poor nasty brutish and short basically it's the story of people struggling to survive not only deprivations of food and fuel shortages but also the being tortured and or killed by the rival factions fighting over chechnya sonja is a heroic character she is not a flawless heroine she is a person so damaged by war that she closes herself off to all types of relationships she is a gifted surgeon running what remains of the hospital in a small town with very little support and a black market connection for vital supplies she keeps providing medical assistance to those in need her sister natasha is missing somewhere in all the chaos of war sonja feels responsible for her and hopes to find her akhmed is a failed doctor who really wanted to be an artist he lives outside the small town with his wife who is lost to her faded memories and physical decay akhmed is also heroic he rescues his neighbor's 8 year old daughter from the forest after russian soldiers have taken her father away her mother is already dead akhmed is also resourceful he takes havaa to sonja's hospital and offers to work there if havaa can stay soon he learns that russian soldiers are searching for havaa too what can they want with an 8 year old a well written novel that deserves its readers","1152":"audio book may have tried to listen to this at the wrong time but had difficulty following character development","1153":" thanks to tina's reading group i read this excellent first novel sooner rather than later it has a lot going for it but most of all it is excellently written with wonderfully drawn characters and is readable without being dumbed down in any way everyone in the reading group loved it which is sometimes the death knell of discussion but we talked about it for a good hour or more the story is set in chechnya after two decades of war the characters are mostly inhabitants of a small village meaning they have lived through all the horrors and know each other well an excellent device because the history of chechnya is long and vast instead of a historical novel marra gives us the effects of that history on these individuals making it come alive for readers who live far away and know little or nothing about the place according to the author that was his intention he is an american well educated so how did he do it he studied for a time in russia he spent time in chechnya he read in russian everything he could about the place and discovered there was not a single novel about it in english so he wrote one the main characters eight year old havaa orphaned by the conflict and hunted by an informer who lives right there in her village akhmed an incompetent doctor but accomplished artist who protects and ultimately saves havaa sonja a fearsomely great surgeon who is keeping the one hospital in the area open to treat the wounded and who against her will and reason helps havaa the informer the villain of the piece though the actual villain is a condition called war who became who he is due to various complicated factors all of which are revealed it is common in contemporary novels to have a plot that floats in time with much nonlinear jumping around if we are voracious readers we have gotten used to it but it is not always done well anthony marra does it throughout his novel but masterfully and only to illuminate the characters their inner lives motives and frailties no sooner does he get you wondering why a character is behaving a certain way than he takes you back and shows you why i came to the end feeling i knew chechnya its history and peoples and possible future much better than i should have after only 400 pages a bit of map study and a brief look at wikipedia i also knew more about love evil honor and sacrifice that is amazing","1154":" \"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" life itself the main character u0026amp subject of anthony marra's beautifully written novel a constellation of vital phenomena life for the characters in this book is hard painful and devastating on a daily basis set in war torn chechnya doctor sonja medical student ahkmed and orphan havaa are forever linked in life u0026amp destiny this story moves less with the plot and more with it's characters and it regularly jumps back and forth in their timelines to give critical information along the way my heart ached with these characters and i felt so much emotion for their circumstance marra's brilliant writing u0026amp excellent characterization make this a must read i really didn't know much about this segment of russia before reading this which is precisely why i have loved this around the world in 80 books reading challenge this year i'm learning so much about the world about different cultures u0026amp people groups chechnya which is a primarily muslim state in russia has been ravaged by poverty by oppression by 2 civil wars and by instability this story takes chechnya from the headlines and gives it a heart i so enjoyed reading this book","1155":"the sad ways in which these people are connected and the awful things that happen to them it's been a few days since i finished the book but i can't get dokka and natasha and akhmed out of my mind","1156":" i've never rated a book as a 1 before if it's that bad in my opinion i just won't finish it too many books too little time to waste reading books i don't care for however i kept reading b c others rated this book so highly and i was desperate to figure out what i was missing i still don't get it first of all the book was all over the place the stories jumped between multiple time periods and different people it was hard keeping up with whom was reading about and what year i was reading about i wasn't sure whether there was any key character or whether the reader was just supposed to hear how awful it was for all of the characters there just wasn't enough about any of them to really feel for any of them quite a few russian words were used but there wasn't any translation and in most cases there wasn't even enough context to discern the meaning of the word it was supposed to be about the chechen war but if you're looking to learn about the war you won't find it in this book i spent a lot of hours on this book and honestly wished i hadn't","1157":"hard but beautifulsuch beautiful words telling such a desperate story the forming of the plot actually conveyed the surreal confusion of war artful","1158":"wonderful book beautiful writing great storyline it kept me engaged throughout but more so after the first third or so i liked how the author told the story from various people's perspectives and developed believable characters who demanded that i connect with them i also liked how the author would give snapshots of character's future life events to tell us what happens to them later overall a terrific book","1159":"really enjoyed this much more than i expected really rich writing with a spectrum of characters with interwoven well developed stories that bounces around time through the hellish recent chechen history recommended","1160":"set against the background of chechen wars a brutally destructive pair of conflicts pitting the army of post soviet russia against chechen guerrillas who were sometimes supported by visiting arab jihadis marra's timeline runs from 1994 to 2004 but the larger story is much much deeper this novel is among other things a meditation on the use and abuse of history and an inquiry into the extent to which acts of memory may also constitute acts of survival the characters were as real to me as my friends and nieghbours this made the story vibrate with life under staggering conditions these people fought just to live this is a beautifully written book the prose is breath taking and the story is heart wrenching how did i not know about the war in chechnya happened i actually had to google this because i couldn't believe it a top 10 book of all time for me","1161":"a constellation of vital phenomena is what the encyclopedia of medical terms calls life that's a book that young sonja pours over as a young woman studying to be a doctor in a chechnya dominated by the soviets she does succeed in being and excellent surgeon studying in london but her returns to chechnya in the midst of a civil war back home she becomes the chief and only doctor in a bombed out hospital having to negotiate for supplies with both rebels and russian soldiers the book is a heart wrenching account of what it is like to live under conditions where not even the basic needs can be taken for granted","1162":"how do we define such things as family love or sacrifice how do war loss and fear affect the way we interpret our world and how ultimately do people find hope where at first glance there is none the stories of the characters held in these pages gradually reveal so many diverse perspectives and definitions of what we think we know of each other and how this is not even close to the truth held within any one individual this is a horrifying yet beautiful story situated in chechnya over a span of ten years during a time period where we see again that most people are pawns in a larger game of political maneuvering that distorts the truth as much as it causes consternation as to how the sides were ever drawn to begin with and that no side is without blame in its ability to victimize all people including its own","1163":"so so so good one of my favorites in a long time","1164":" the incredible strains placed on people in a tortuous terrible war are the heart of this fine book no one is all bad not even the russian torturers who grant small favors giving a full tank of gas to a released chechnean after torture and spare a few lives the chechnean informer does so in part to obtain insulin for his aged father no one is all good not even the best characters in this book the likable incompetent chechnean doctor almost always makes the right choice but he slept with his best friend's wife while the friend was imprisoned and undergoing torture each has a flaw that rises up somewhere in the narrative like bubbles that eventually ooze out of the bottom on the lake i was reminded of checkov's observation that if a gun appears in act 1 there will be a shot in act 4 the gun in this book does appear early and there is a shot late but in no way does the presaging seem heavy handed this is a hard book in many respects but not unbearable and like the best saddest tales a reed of hope is always there and has a chance to grow at the end","1165":" where to start 1 i am embarrassed to say i have little knowledge of the wars in chechnya in which this book is set after reading this i feel compelled to read some non fiction accounts of these wars to educate myself 2 the ability of human beings to adjust to the most surreally horrific circumstances never ceases to amaze me i hope my life circumstances never test my ability to do this i feel terribly ungrateful that sometimes i take for granted the peaceful prosperous and free life i live in the us the fact that i live here in those circumstances makes it very hard for me to comprehend what it must be like in places where those things are not a part of life at all in fact this quote from the book really drove that fact home for me unless you know or see personally it is hard to internalize the horrors across from akhmed's house frozen ash stretched beyond the charred foundations of a house across the field and into the woods it had been havaa's home and the realization pulled a wire of grief straight through her stomach havaa and akhmed had only become real when they were plucked from nowhere and deposited in her life she knew what had happened to havaa's father and her home but here the girl materialized in her mind as she hadn't before 3 the accounts of the feds taking those they were going to disappear to the landfill chilled me to the bone how does anyone get to a point where they treat a human being as no more than a piece of trash to be disposed of efficiently it hurts my heart man's inhumanity to man {robert burns} mystifies me and breaks my heart 4 i was distracted by and had a love hate relationship with the frequent detours the author took to tell the back stories future stories of transient characters when these detours were short i loved the uniqueness of them when they were long i sometimes ended up confused about where i was in the timeline and the story before the detour a timeline that spanned a decade with back future stories that were much earlier or later one of the back stories i absolutely loved was she zipped her puffy jacket over a sweatshirt that in manchester england had warmed the shoulders of five brothers before the sixth a staunchly philanthropic six year old had given it to his school's red cross clothing drive so his mother would have to buy him a new one 5 view spoiler natasha broke my heart but her end was fitting i think in my own personal opinion she regained her power when she shot the man who was planning to brutalize her she saw in him all of the sick violent men who had assaulted her before and that makes me think she was slaying the ghosts of all those memories as she killed him as tragic as it was it came full circle and in my own epilogue she is finally at peace and free of emotional pain and addiction of course dokka ahkmed and havaa broke my heart as well what i didn't expect was to ever feel any emotion but disdain for ramzan after reading his back story he may have broken my heart the deepest of all the account of what he suffered at the landfill and how he held strong his first horrible time there was unbearable to read tragic hide spoiler","1166":"i just didn't click with this book the first 2 3 drug on for me while the last 1 3 i really liked","1167":"amazing book so thoughtful and heartbreaking","1168":"a bittersweet novel that is more bitter than sweet the stories are well told i almost gave up on the book but i am glad i waited for the ending i think marra has a great future with many awards to come","1169":"this was a hard book to read in a lot of ways to the point where i almost gave up several times in fact if i hadn't been reading it for book group not to mention it was my 1st selection for the group i probably would have abandoned it all i can say is that i'm so glad i stuck with it because the second half is un put downable yes the book was disturbing in how it described the brutality of war as a commonplace occurrence it was not surprising to anyone for people to disappear or be taken to the landfill as someone who admittedly knew very little about chechnya the description of life there was eye opening on many levels and although there is a lot of torture it's described in a very matter of fact way with none of the graphic detail in a thriller type novel which actually serves to make it even more cold blooded and chilling as for character development there is quite an assortment of primary characters which was part of my issue in the beginning i'd get them confused and i didn't like the vast majority of them but the way the book interweaves current day and the past peels back the levels in a way that provides sudden insight into each character's behavior why they think the way they do and ultimately behave for good or ill and lo and behold i was caring very much about these characters the author also used an interesting technique by describing the ultimate future of many of the minor characters who crossed paths with the main cast for me this added a dimension of hope by showing that many would not only survive but prosper in the post war world bottom line read this book but be prepared to slog through the beginning the pay off seeing that life does indeed go on is definitely worth it","1170":"one of my new favorite books it was incredible","1171":"this book is so so beautiful definitely a favourite","1172":" an excellent debut novel that focuses on russia's war with chechnya like some of the other new modern authors that have emerged within the last few years marra tackles a difficult relatively unknown subject in a unique way the central story takes place within a week and what happens before and after is told in a series of flashbacks and flash forwards the story revolves around a small group of characters each impacted differently by the war who are struggling to make difficult decisions in an attempt to survive there are a few brutal depictions of torture in the book but overall marra does a great job of evoking the feeling of panic and uncertainty of what looms ahead instead of using in your face shock violence to make his point the book also serves as a reminder that russia just can't seem to get it right each attempt that it makes to move forward results in it ending up in the same place that it has since the russian revolution full of corruption dictatorship and terror it's unfortunate because instead of being a world leader russia appears to be headed down a similar path as north korea one of isolation which can only cause more despair for its people i highly recommend this book","1173":"very well written but a depressing sad story of how the lives of these people were affected by war there is humor and tender moments but it is a dark story","1174":"oh my goodness this is such a beautiful and heartbreaking read","1175":"how can a book be so brutal and beautiful all at the same time i think when it relates humanity in all of it's splendor both the crushing grotesqueness of torture and the bliss of love and family","1176":" your family is not your choice full disclosure this is an ugly shocking difficult to read book about war that you will be unable to put down from the moment it begins it is also a beautifully written novel of the human condition in times of war and peace that explores themes of family displacement revenge and courage there is a lot to love about a constellation of vital phenomena but my favorite thing is how the central characters ahkmed dokka havaa khassan ramzan sonja and natasha are themselves a constellation their unexpected connections are the backbone that supports the entire novel jumping around a timeline is a tricky thing that can make or a break a book but in this case it is well done and provides a great deal of momentum and aha moments of course i also love that even the most minor of characters have rich backstories such as the imam in the pit or alu and his brother a story that exemplifies marra's dark and subtle humor some passages especially are reminiscent of catch 22 in that you will laugh out loud while reading a tragic book about a brutal war it will mess with your head in a good way marra's style too with its lenghty sentences and the aforementioned rich character backgrounds also has flavors of j heller this is not to say that acovp is a chechen version of catch 22 it is wholly its own novel and a worthy addition to the bibliography of wartime fiction marra may be a new writer but it's impossible to tell for such difficult subject matter this book reads like it was written by a seasoned vet and it was refreshing to read about a war and a people that don't get written about often enough lastly a personal note the irony of the fact that i had never even thought much about chechnya until what happened here in boston on patriot's day is not lost on me i had already downloaded acovp to my kindle by then but i didn't start reading it until a few days later i think that this book is exactly what i needed to read following the bombing it didn't provide answers to deep questions or anything like that but it has been an excellent reminder to me that a people are more than the deeds of their sons and that even in the most dire of conditions goodness can survive verdict read this book i have no reservations about recommending it to one and all adults some themes may be too mature for young adults adolescents use your judgment if you're reading the ebook version you will undoubtedly find yourself highligting passages that resonate with you just so you can go back and read them again and again","1177":"loved the writing style and the rich vivid description of setting very interesting to read about such a horrific time in history of chechnya i loved how the stories of each character unfolds and weave together heartbreaking important","1178":"this was an extremely well written book which gives the reader a stark perspective of the chechen war it is a difficult book because understanding what people live through during war is never easy but worth the effort","1179":"i'm a better person for having read this but wow am i feeling down about the atrocities that happen in our world","1180":" this is one of those books that's difficult to describe with emotions that's even harder to articulate i'm always amazed when a writer is able to transform something despicable into a beautiful life affirming masterpiece it's hard to grasp that this is anthony marra's debut work the history the hardships the small miracles and the descriptive way he transports his reader to that time speaks of a veteran writer with several awards under his belt and not a - for lack of a better word - newbie it's so easy to see how much time he spent immersing himself with the history for which this book is about i as a reader can appreciate how he whet my curiosity for a war i was foolishly oblivious about after reading this book i spent some considerable time scouring the internet for anything i can find about the war one that cost over 160 000 lives and immeasurable destruction for ten years \"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father haava woke from dreams of sea anemones \"the novel begins in a way that foretells the fate of chechen nationals unlucky enough to have lived through the first and the second war haava an 8 year old clever inquisitive child had just been orphaned on the night of his abduction havaa's father had the foresight to lead her into the woods to spare her life while their neighbour akhmed watched and waited fearfully until he's able to see to haava's safety in the morning he'll take her to the lone salvation he can offer the child by asking sonja the only surgeon left in their war torn region akhmed's wife is in a permanent vegetative state he's seen through her care with very minimal resources he could afford and the paltry medical knowledge he remembers from school he is for all intents and purposes a doctor himself although an incompetent one for most of the time what he lacks he makes up with love and dazzling optimism in a world where kindness and beauty is buried deep in the rubble of a god forsaken country i wish i could paint you the stories of these characters as beautiful as anthony has done i wish i can convince you to read it even though you're probably grossing about how unnecessarily long this review had become this is the type of novel where one person holds the key in unlocking the story's brilliance you can say it's havaa for she touched the lives of each character or natasia sonja's troubled sister who came and left like the smoke from a freshly fired artillery but that's the best thing about this book anthony made every single one of his characters important enough to hold the story together natasia and sonja's relationship bears the scar of an early childhood sibling rivalry over the years they've played their roles with uneasy acceptance sonja the one with the brilliant mind moved to london to start her medical studies at the beginning of the first war while natasia stayed behind and tried to escape the best way she could sonja will lose contact with her sister and will eventually be the reason why she leaves the comfort and peace of london natasia did not have an easy life we see her suffer in the hands of an abusive lover we see her fend for herself while bombs rained down on her city we see her fall in the hands of a sex trafficker by her own choice eventually she'll succumb to drug addiction by the time sonja and natasia catches up to each other both have gone through unimaginable horrors this is a war story nothing will be easy to digest there are tales of torture amputation and heartbreak but there are also love compassion and hope to brighten an otherwise stark novel once again i find myself scouring the web searching for the whys the whens and the hows this is the kind of novel where a reader will be tempted to understand the futility of it all and would cry at the impossibility of that task","1181":" i'm very divided about this book in the end i have to say i thought it was beautiful and amazing deeply touching and really skillful but and it's a big but i had a very hard time reading it the author was trying to convey the utter disorientation that can happen with war and it worked time and again i almost quit reading and i would have if it wasn't for my book group it was hard to keep track of the characters because there were so many of them and so many similar ones and it was hard at first to care about them and it was very hard to tell what had happened the timeline of events so be forewarned that these are impediments and that i wasn't fully engaged until page 220 and then that i loved this book in the end and feel like everyone should read it it had a very strong message about how terrible war is and how terrible and wonderful people can be and i was impressed by the author's ability to tie everything together but it's definitely a book that will make a lot more sense the second time around","1182":"this is a story about civilians trying desperately to hang onto their dignity and humanity during war i was more than halfway through the book and contemplating giving up before i really started to care about the characters maybe because they're so tough they don't invite sympathy if you want to learn about chechen culture i suggest you look elsewhere","1183":"when they took him he held your name right there in his chest and you were with him even if you didn't know it when he reached the end he did not die he called your name and began to live in you only 400 pages this is a novel of epic proportion the timeline runs from 1994 to 2004 and has the chechen wars as backdrop we get to know each character intimately as they are written with such honesty and empathy this is a book about human behaviour the best and the absolute worst i don't think i will ever be able to forget some of the torture scenes i loved how the author uses an intricate plotline to show us how everything in life connects using separate phenomena to form a constellation an amazing debut and i highly recommend it although it's not an easy read the writing in this book was exquisite not flowery at all clear and to the point with the ability to break your heart or make you laugh out loud the story a resilient doctor risks everything to save the life of a hunted child in this majestic debut about love loss and the unexpected ties that bind us together","1184":"i couldn't shake the feeling while reading this novel that i should be reading a nonfiction book about chechnya instead i was hazy on the facts and the novel was confusing at parts there were a lot of characters but one thing i did like was marra's intent use of the concept of constellation almost every character gets a small tangent about how their life continued and for how long after encountering one of the main circle of the book one thing i didn't like was how interwoven everyone was this is a common trope and i don't think it does a book any favors to point out the smallness of any world and the wonder that lives intertwine at some point or another at the beginning i wasn't sold on the book because the descriptions of the war ravaged town and city were very focused on the beauty of destruction and desolation this novel didn't seem like the right venue for it and in some ways it cheapened the very real setting but as the book wore on marra seemed less focused on proving to us his deep powers of description and i appreciated that to the point that by the end it seemed like it wasn't an issue anymore","1185":"thank you thank you thank you anthony marra for writing this book i have not enjoyed a story like this in a long time the perfect combination of characters dealing with real life through war in all it's gritty selfishness developed to perfection i cared for them hoped for them hated them easily highly recommended","1186":"i really wanted to like this book but i just couldn't it took me forever to read because it was just so boring it could have been so much better i think i wasn't attached to any of the characters and there were so many long and drawn out passages that i started to just skim some parts","1187":" a somewhat convoluted story with time jumping and threads coming together in the most delightful ways i really found myself enjoying this novel despite of or maybe because of the challenges the characters though numerous were well developed and the dark story of war ravaged chechnya was relieved by touches of subtle humor i kept debating between a four and five star rating but the way the story kept surprising me all the way to the end and tempts me to reread it now knowing the connections amazed me","1188":"haunting beautifully written i soooo recommend this book","1189":"though the stark setting and initially unrelated events made this book exceedingly hard to get into the poignant ending made the journey worthwhile","1190":"i finished it but honestly couldn't get into it","1191":"fascinating characters and story","1192":"i would give this book 4 stars because it is a beautifully written and harrowing story marra's prose sometimes reminded me of rushdie but i found it so emotionally draining to read that i'm not entirely sure i can say i enjoyed it","1193":" my review is here your life's work could be scrubbing piss from a toilet bowl work isn't meaningful just because you spend your life doing it p 53 khassan was studying the sheet of paper in his hand where in the fifth sentence of the second paragraph in the gap of a missing comma he found the sorrow of his life p 123 conversation seemed possible a moment after the round faced man looking like their younger brother hoisted them into the truck bed but the air clotted with doubt too thick for any words to pass p 197 ramzan nodded yes of course he was required to wear a seat belt just as he was required to give directions to a torture camp because stupidity was the single abiding law of the universe p 251 2","1194":"a heart breaking story about chechnya it was slow and i only made it through 1 2 before abandoning it for something else the last straw was the very foreign words thrown into the reading and i couldn't figure out the context of the rest of the sentence without trying to track down what they meant","1195":" this book did not work for me it's being hailed as a great literary debut with readers rhapsodizing about it right and left and i don't take issue with the writing style but the characters and their stories failed to engage me a constellation of vital phenomena that's a mouthful is set in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 the main storyline concerns a child havaa being hunted by security forces after her father is disappeared her neighbor akhmed attempts to rescue her by handing her over to a doctor sonja in a nearby city this frame story takes place over only five days but the book also makes extensive use of flashbacks to show how all the characters got to their current situations as well as jumping ahead sometimes by decades to relay what will happen to characters in the future and there are several secondary characters with whom the book spends quite a bit of time as well as a plethora of minor characters whose life stories are told in brief asides i'm not going to say this is a bad book reading about chechnya and life during wartime was interesting and the writing is good despite the title it's not overwritten or pretentious though it is a book that leans more heavily on writing style than plot and if you're not a fan of long comma laden sentences it may not be for you to me though this came across as such a stereotypical mfa novel strong on the mechanics but leaving me cold rather too artsy and constructed the characters never came to life whether because too much is simply told or alluded to in flashback rather than shown or because of the rather flowery and contrived dialogue or because it jumps around too much in time and among the characters usually a style i enjoy in the end all the main characters seemed less than the sum of their parts akhmed is a nice guy who'd rather be an artist than a doctor and that's about all there is to him havaa is supposed to be 8 years old but reads more like a mature 13 sonja i don't even know she's the type of character i'm inclined to love the brusque uber competent female professional but marra never got me invested in this particular character i was actually more interested in her sister natasha but the book skims the surface of natasha's story even faster than it does everyone else's almost as if marra felt like he had to stick that rape and human trafficking stuff in there but wasn't really comfortable dealing with it but maybe that's unfair the book skims over everybody's story pretty fast and back to the artsiness basic questions about the plot and the characters' relationships are never satisfactorily answered for instance does sonja know what happened to natasha the first time she disappeared why do sonja and akhmed hook up aside from the fact that the male protagonist and the female protagonist in fiction always do why can't the feds find havaa simply by following akhmed or asking around in the city she seems to do a lot of hanging around public areas of the hospital and socializing with the staff finally i would have liked to see more of chechen culture there's one interesting scene dealing with a ritual in the mountains but although there's some great visual detail culturally the book could be set in any war torn place toward the end a female character isn't searched at a checkpoint because the soldiers take her for \"a traditional chechen woman \" which threw me for a loop because in the preceding 340 pages there's no evidence of restraint in the interactions between the sexes even among the villagers we know it's a muslim country because every now and then someone prays i love to travel the world through fiction but i want some reassurance that my guide actually knows the place marra studied in russia but it's unclear to me whether he's ever set foot in chechnya in the end i may have been a little harsh with this one it didn't do anything for me but so many people have loved it that there's a good chance it will work for you you could do worse than picking up this nicely written book which if nothing else will raise your awareness about a little known part of the world","1196":"whew it has been a long time since i read a book involving so much war and torture and brrutal repression this was an excellent novel though i got lost in the many threads binding the characters to each other sometimes would get a 5 but just too upsetting for me","1197":"good story but too much back and forth in time hard to see relationships with various characters and too much russian history","1198":"this novel's been mentioned on a few best of 2013 lists and i think it well deserves the honor in a constellation of vital phenomena anthony marra explores the emotional complexities of life in a war plagued place as the upheaval of conflict and death reshape the ties of family friends neighbors and tradition the setting is chechnya between 1994 and 2004 a period that included two nasty wars between russian government forces and chechen separatists because of the ties of the rebels to islamic extremism i believe the us media never took much interest in the strife much less its impact on the lives of regular people it's those lives that marra focuses on the narrative begins in 2004 with a man named akhmed watching russian soldiers abduct his neighbor who has already lost all his fingers to a previous interrogation by state security left behind is the neighbor's young daughter who has escaped into the woods with a mysterious blue suitcase akhmed takes the girl to the only safe place he knows the hospital in town there he meets sonja a cynical exhausted ethnic russian surgeon who spends her days amputating limbs shredded by landmines and is the last competent medical professional around i say competent because akhmed is himself a doctor but one who to his own shame finished in the bottom tenth of his class and excels more at his true passion painting he's unable to help even his own wife who's bedridden with a wasting disease such are the contradictions at the hearts of the characters who are gradually revealed through a non linear narrative that travels back and forth through time to unpeel the layers of their backstories connections and secrets we also come to know khassan a wwii veteran who has spent the past few decades of his life writing a history of the chechen people and rewriting it each time official guidelines change khassan's son ramzan who turned informer for the russians and hasn't been spoken to since by the father he provides for and sonya's sister natasha who remained behind to endure her own horrors after sonja went to medical school in britain there's both absurdity and fragile beauty in the story's small details akhmed is committed to painting portraits of the disappeared which he leaves around town though he adds a long nostril hair to one vain woman's face because she died still owing him money there's some confusion between a former us president and the mascot of mcdonalds leading to the great line i may be an idiot but i would never eat a hamburger cooked by a clown two people in a truck argue over which dead radio station has the most pleasing static an imam imprisoned in a landfill pit gives funerals for his fellow prisoners the moment after they ascend a long ladder heavenward disappearing from view into the hands of their executioners at the core of this book are the human entanglements that extend before and after wartime but are complicated by its chaos with people's faults and virtues both magnified the boundaries blur between what's ultimately motivated by pride guilt trauma resentment and shame and what's motivated by love even ramzan the informer becomes sympathetic when later chapters uncover a costly act of courage in his past and whose sins as an old proverb goes are tied up with the sins of the father marra occasionally interrupts the narrative to give us little vignettes about incidental characters a technique that's slightly distracting but adds to a pervading sense that nothing happens in isolation from everything else our connections often seem to be subjective constellations but that doesn't stop them from being i admired his unusual choice to project a few threads decades into the future a reminder that life will go on with its cargo of good and terrible memories a beautiful bleak affecting work of literary fiction and one that got me a little teary eyed at the end my recommendation has some caveats the scenes of brutality might be a little tough for some readers and the sometimes confusing web of links between characters and events requires careful attention i also can't comment on how true to life the novel's details are having been written by an american whose knowledge of place can only be secondary but whatever blemishes might be in the brush strokes the overall picture reaches towards a universal statement 4 5 stars i didn't find colette whitaker to be a remarkable audio reader but nothing about her performance bothered me either","1199":"i didn't really like it because it was a confusing read with all the different people talking and different dates plus the whole thing was sad and depressing i did like though how they tied all loose ends up by the last few chapters but it was still way too confusing","1200":" i was transfixed by this one marta does not spare us in showing the worst of human nature yet he is generous in his offerings of the best of it too the heartbreak of decent people struggling to make sense of senseless war while carrying on with their lives as best they can is tempered by the theme of redemption which saves this wonderful book from total bleakness the author jumps back and forth in time while peeling back the layers of his characters revealing their history and the ties that bind them he also provides glimpses of their futures which i found a great relief not a lighthearted beach read but quite honestly the best book i've read this year","1201":"such an interesting read a little violent for me i kept wanting to close my eyes like i do in bloody movie scenes but a little harder to do with a book","1202":" it took a while to win me over but eventually it did it presents the profoundly sad history of a part of the world chechnya about which i know too little although the story takes place over 5 days in 2004 the novel covers much more time than that--past and future at times the writing rises to the poetic even though the writer is relating some very grim history and brutality the characters who are seemingly unrelated to one another end up being connected by an intricate web of occurrences--hence the title it's hard to think that men can be so cruel to other men but recent history bears out the story's claims i was however glad that there are some victories in the story some moments of great courage and beauty that also remind us that man can be sublime","1203":"i found it hard to follow at times it was really good","1204":"have read it twice utterly moving and unforgettable highest recommendation","1205":"this beautiful moving novel tells a story i wasn't expecting at all--that of the modern day chechens caught in the fierce struggle between russia which is to say the military legacy of the soviet union and the freedom seeking chechen rebels which is to say a group of islamic militants but the story transcends these political themes by grounding them in the deeply human story of akhmed and havaa the young girl he's rescued from the russians together they journey to the threadbare hospital no 6 where sonia reigns as chief surgeon u0026amp not only because she's literally the only doctor left in the hospital you'd be hard pressed to find three individuals who have collectively suffered as much loss as these the scale of loss and devastation in this story feels like something that should have happened during the great wars or perhaps in iraq i don't know precisely why but it's unsettling to imagine that there are places in the world where this kind of torture and targeted killing were still commonplace as few as ten years ago but of course this is fiction--it's not a history and marra builds this intricate clockwork of a novel beautifully and delicately each piece feels perfectly balanced against the others and just as i was wondering what another character might be doing the perspective shifts in that direction each chapter contains heartbreaking tales of violence but also tenderness and it's marra's insistence that we not look away from human need and frailty that makes this a great book","1206":" life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation 6 vital phenomena 6 persons havaa akhmed and sonja and around them in orbit natasha sonja's sister khassan and his son ramzan and then there is dokka havaa's father and ula akhmed's wife on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones with that sentence the book begins two doctors risk everything to save the life of a hunted child in this majestic debut about love loss and the unexpected ties that bind us together havaa eight years old hides in the woods and watches the blaze until her neighbor akhmed discovers her sitting in the snow akhmed knows getting involved means risking his life and there is no safe place to hide a child in a village where informers will do anything for a loaf of bread but for reasons of his own he sneaks her through the forest to the one place he thinks she might be safe an abandoned hospital where the sole remaining doctor sonja rabina treats the wounded though sonja protests that her hospital is not an orphanage akhmed convinces her to keep havaa for a trial and over the course of five extraordinary days sonja's world will shift on its axis and reveal the intricate pattern of connections that weaves together the pasts of these three unlikely companions and unexpectedly decides their fate what difference can 5 days make can you be human in the middle of an inhuman war does love have any power during wartime in 5 days the protagonists of the book remember learn live die carry on we are tranfered from 1994 to 2004 living the 2 wars in chechnya we learn about the past the present and the future i weeped and i laughed with that book because even in the absurdity of war anthony marra gives as moments of humor human moments he creates not characters but humans noone is a saint nor a devil they are people with their weaknesses their heroic moments their break downs there are secret strings that connects everyone with one or another way and they are not revealed 'till the very last page and allthough it talks about chechnya it's not so much about politics it's about people what they suffered how they suffered it could be for everyone and that is why it speaks to your heart no matter where you come from anthony marra gives you the real picture even the one of the traitor when you find out why he does what he does you can't hate him you feel pitty for him and that is worse much worse sonja would definitely read this book she would read the last page like se used to do and she would definitely read this book","1207":"bookclub booki actually feel badly about my rating i see so many readers loving this book and wonder what is wrong with me i liked the book it was a hard read tough topic tough scenes etc i just had a hard time really getting into it my mind would wander and i'd re read the same paragraph over and over it's not the book the timing for me didn't work maybe i'll try again in the future","1208":"ugh this book dragged for me and although accurate portrayal of a war time a little too depressing for me maybe it is my frame of mind right now another time i may enjoy this more","1209":"couldn't put it down amazing portrayal of characters under duress and the sacrifices they make very poignant and deep you grow to love all the characters perhaps more because their flaws and errors of their ways make them human and thus we recognize parts of ourselves we wonder what we may be capable of under similar circumstances","1210":"4 1 2 stars really really good book beautifully written interesting structure that initially i had a had a hard time with but the structure was so useful necessary to the story the more i read the more i realized this highly recommend this book for many reasons not the least of which us i've never read anything about the chechen situation the author really evoked feeling he had good character development which i always care about it was hard to read at times given the subject matter war messes with people and society but so worth it for me i didn't give it 5 stars mostly because i unfairly compared it to cutting for stone looking at it as the chechen version of that book and it didn't quite reach the level of cutting for stone at least to me but it sure is a really really good book","1211":"a beautifully written story that weaves through the lives of 9 10 different characters over decades of war it demonstrates how interconnected strangers can be without ever knowing it i would have enjoyed it much more if i had any knowledge at all of russian u0026amp chechneyan history but the historical u0026amp political subtext was very hard for me to follow","1212":"i had a difficult time beginning this story i reread first few chapters several times once i got into the book though it was a harrowing account of the inhumanity of war and conflict and age old hatreds i found i didn't want to stop reading excellent sad realistic with unwavering eye for the detail of lives within war zones","1213":"most brilliant book i've read in a long time and the best part is that it keeps getting better and better all the way up to and through an ending that you're not likely to forget for a long long time","1214":"i loved this book so dark but so wonderful i learned a lot and had tears in my eyes at times","1215":" upon starting this book i had heard of chechnya i couldn't point it out on a map though or even have told you what part of the world it was in this book takes you there not just in mind but in spirit also the author states he chose to write about this area after hearing about the death of journalist anna polikovskaya from her reporting she did from chechnya he read up on the non fiction reports he could find from the area i'm glad he did it my eyes would have glazed over from the enormity of it the story begins with 8 year old haava seeing her father taken by soldiers in the middle of the night even at that young age she knows that her father isn't returning akhmed her neighbors sweeps her up and runs because she is also a target he hides her with a frustrated russian doctor named sonja sonja and akhmed are amazing characters they both come to life in the book i'll remember akhmed for a long time after finishing this his humor in the face of such tragedy he admits he is a horrible doctor with a wry sense the story takes place over 5 days 5 days that will stick with the reader long afterward the author does use flashbacks so that you become entwined in these characters lives for a first book this book is absolutely amazing i received an copy of this book from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review","1216":"i loved this book the writing is exquisite anthony marra took a difficult topic and handled it with great care the characters were believable and i cared about all of them their stories were revealed in a compelling way this book exposed me to a part of the world and circumstances unfamiliar to me but also described human emotions that are universal","1217":"started reading it the story and writing were compelling but couldn't get past the language sometimes the bad language in a book seems to fit it didn't here","1218":" anthony marra's debut novel is both stunning and heartbreaking set in chechnya from 1994 2004 marra exquisitely creates characters who try to survive in the depressing deplorable conditions that war so often brings sonja is a coldhearted brilliant surgeon who tries to save lives in an abandoned chechen hospital eight year old havaa hides in the woods while her father dokka is taken away by russian soldiers for helping the chechen rebels akhmed is a failed doctor who would rather be a portrait artist when akhmed witnesses the russian police take away his friend dokka he realizes he must rescue haava and help her hide they end up at sonja's hospital much to the doctor's dismay sonja knows that hiding the girl could cause her a great deal of trouble she reluctantly agrees to let havaa stay on the condition that akhmed work at the hospital as the story unfolds in a series of flashbacks marra reveals how akhmed sonja and havaa are unknowingly connected to each other because of their pasts marra gives us other memorable characters khassan is a pariah in his community because his son ramzan has become an informant for the russians while marra explores khassan's profound shame he also examines why ramzan decided to become an enemy among the people he grew up with we also get to know sonja's sister natasha who tries to escape war torn chechnya only to end up in her own personal hell sonja throughout the book is tormented because she doesn't know what happened to her younger sister i admit my lack of knowledge about the history of chechnya kept me looking up details on the internet to learn more about what i was reading for example i had no idea that stalin deported the entire ethnic chechen population in 1944 to kazakhstan and siberia during this time tens of thousands of chechens died the survivors were allowed by khrushchev to return to their homeland in 1956 but eventually they faced two more wars with russia over their independence this pbs web page has a lot of information about chechnya's history that i found helpful http www pbs org wnet wideangle epi books about war are never easy to read but marra's descriptive writing and character development made \"a constellation of vital phenomena'' a profound memorable book this is one of my favorite titles of 2013","1219":"i know i'm in the minority on this book but i didn't get the hype i learned this about the war in chechnya it was brutal devastating and destructive people starved people died villages were destroyed but how's that different from most war if this book is about the war in chechnya i wished it would have talked about it i still no nothing about the war in chechnya mostly the book focused on the brutality of people against people it was dark depressing and just plain sad furthermore the blurb mentioned havaa the child in the book who witnesses her father taken by the russians but guess what she's hardly mentioned after the first two chapters which for me was a let down her story which could have been the most compelling was essentially forgotten overall this book was a disappointment for me and i really wanted to like it","1220":"an intense read very well written and well told the writing captivated me the characters are all amazing people i would love to meet in real life before reading this book i had no knowledge of the wars between grozny and russia it's a heartbreaking and frustrating time for many folks and this book does a wonderful job of bringing those feelings to the reader","1221":" from the medical dictionary of the union of soviet physicianslife a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation if i had ever thought about chechnya before i thought of the terrorists with explosives strapped to their chests taking a movie theater or a primary school hostage willing to blow up themselves and scores of innocents in the names of independence and their god i thought of putin post 9 11 saying to the united states paraphrased maybe now you understand why we've had to be so hard on the extremists who have been attacking russians within our own borders i was unsurprised when the boston marathon bombers turned out to be radicalised chechens these people are all crazy right what a feat then that in a constellation of vital phenomena author anthony marra was able to penetrate my ignorance and humanise the chechen people for me and now i only wonder why did i need this lesson when did i start listening to vladimir putin before reading this book i knew nothing about the history of chechnya and through many characters' back stories including references to one character's 3300 page history of the republic that stretches back to prehistoric times i learned enough to feel great sympathy for the chechens and in a nutshell chechnya has always sat at the political and religious intersections between turkey and russia and has been resisting russian rule for nearly 500 years although they fought with the soviet union during wwii ethnic chechens were distrusted and expelled to kazakhstan in 1944 where 60% of them died and russians were encouraged to emigrate to chechnya to take their places chechens were allowed to return in 1956 but their country had been russified with top jobs going to ethnic russians when the soviet union dissolved in 1990 and boris yeltsin encouraged the republics to grab as much sovereignty as they could swallow chechnya attempted to declare independence but moscow said not you guys you're too small and besides all of our pipelines run through chechnya to bring oil from the caucasus since then there have been two chechen wars with russian troops suppressing the rebels who would force independence as ethnic chechens tend to be muslim radical middle eastern groups began to arm the rebels in the name of jihad and although russia has so far succeeded in preventing the republic's separation and the leader of chechnya is a moscow appointee there is a growing movement to declare chechnya a muslim caliphate but although the history of chechnya up to 2004 is slowly revealed in a constellation of vital phenomena this isn't the story of the rebels or the feds this is the story of the ordinary people who suffer outside of the headline news the villagers and urban dwellers and what it takes to survive in a world of landmines torture and informants through an interconnected web of characters the true constellation that signifies life marra is able to rationalise the actions that at first appear despicable and also to end tragedies with a note of hope the dead will live on through the people that they've touched we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are this is my very favourite type of book i learned something i felt something and the language and the structure were also intellectually and emotionally satisfying of course all chechens aren't terrorists and to the people who were just trying to survive it made little difference to them whether the men marching into the village or demanding medical attention at the bombed out hospital were rebels or feds and somehow in the middle of all this characters crack jokes feel both lust and love and are able to believe that normal life will return one day this is an emotionally heavy book without being depressing and i would recommend it to absolutely everyone notice how i didn't really include any of the plot i don't want to give anything away on this one read it","1222":" this may well be my book of the year so far it's a brilliant story of a city in chechneya over the two revolts against russian rule as the 'feds' russians enter a small village to take drokka to the landfill site where prisoners are tortured and killed his neighbour akhmed hides haava his young daughter who also should be abitrarily killed as alesson to rebels and takes her to the nearby city hospital where a lone doctor sonja agrres to look after her in return for akhmed a failed med student working in the hospital and their relationships develop the stories of all the characters intertwine over a 10 year period with appalling scenes of inhumanity interspersed with touching tendernesses bravery and deceits an incredibly moving book which will stay with me for a long time it is wonderfully complex with coincidences only adding to the tale rather than limiting it as a novelisation of appalling events the research is referred to as a postscript it made my awareness of the babarity of torture and lives in war more profound as the reader can empathise with the characters excellent","1223":"admired the author's ability to weave past present and future plotlines together sometimes all in the same long sentence what might not work with a less skilled writer worked well here and served well a story with a long tragic focus","1224":"i appear not to be in the majority of 5 star reviews here i genuinely struggled with this book keeping my attention and the flow of the story maybe i missed something but i was more relieved to be finished this and disappointed as i had gone in with so much expectation","1225":"i am stunned such a powerful story about a part of history i knew little about i would give it a 4 5 memorable and highly recommended","1226":"this a wonderful wonderful wonderful book it makes you both incredibly happy and incredibly sad at the same time please everyone everyone read this book","1227":"really enjoyed this author's writing tough subject matter","1228":"everyone loves this book except for me i could see that it was beautifully written but i struggled to finish it the language is lyrical and marra's craft exceptional but i just couldn't muster any enthusiasm for this novel i guess the problem was that i just didn't care about the story or the characters i am disappointed because i really wanted to love it","1229":"this book was phenomenal the way the author tells the story through time leaves much unveiling in the end characters you detest in the first half of the book finally become if not likable understandable at the very least though i knew nothing about the wars in chechnya and i still know little it wasn't a requirement for my appreciation of the book","1230":"oh boy a powerful story i can't stop thinking about","1231":"the best book i read all year harrowing and impossible to put down","1232":"this was a difficult book because i was unfamiliar with the chechen wars and it was a bit confusing as to which side the characters were on however the book is written beautifully and the author has a poeticism to his writing that makes it a pleasure to read the story itself is heartbreaking but it's war and what else could we expect i recommend it highly and it's a valuable history lesson","1233":"i thought this was a really beautiful book i grew attached to the characters and even was fascinated by those who were the 'bad guys ' it was also really powerful to read about conflicts that were just in very recent history a great read","1234":"this was a tough story without a happy ending or beginning or middle for that matter but i found it engrossing the characters were real believable people living in an impossible world i don't know much about the reality of that period of chechen history so i have no way of knowing how accurate the situations and storylines were all i know is that i was thoroughly invested in the people and their stories and i'm still thinking about them weeks later","1235":" a beautiful book about ugly things marra infuses his story of war worn chechnya with just enough light and humor to keep it from becoming bogged down or bleak sometimes i read a book and i'm so sure it's a first book that i'm floored to learn the author has a dozen books already and sometimes like with this one i'm blown away to learn this is a debut as so many others have said his writing was fantastic some of the descriptions just couldn't get off the ground but the misses were few and far between and when it soared well it was all worth it and the way it all weaved together was immensely satisfying despite the sometimes difficult subject matter this book made me so happy to be a reader his writing even propelled me through scenes in the hospital that would normally have my squeamish self flipping the page so be warned bombs fall and people get hurt sidenote the descriptions of some of atrocities and actions of both the federals and the rebels sounded so barbaric that i kept slipping thinking this was historical fiction set centuries ago so it's wrenching to realize that these based in reality events took place from 1994 to 2004","1236":" i just posted a review but figured it would be far more compelling to give a brief description and jill owens does it better than i anthony marra's debut novel is a marvel it describes in astonishingly beautiful prose five days in a rural village and bombed out hospital in chechnya during wartime as the characters including a doctor a hunted child a historian and an informant try to adapt and survive their histories connections and desires are unveiled marra has created a breathtaking work if haunting evocative fiction the girls spent the weekend at grammy and poppy's i could not have picked a more perfect time to start this book marra is insanely talented it was so captivating i didn't even want to put the book down for a few minutes to catch up on our increasingly full dvr at the risk of sounding dramatic there were actually parts that were so heartfelt i realized i had been holding my breath until the end of a paragraph goosebumps were common reminiscent of julie orringer's beautiful war torn historical fiction novel the invisible bridge i was so invested in the characters i forgot they were fictitious this has moved into my top ten for sure can't describe it in any way that would even partially do it justice just read it","1237":"this is a novel that really built on itself for me the further i got in the more and more invested i got it was a little hard at first to remember the characters trajectories but once i figured it out i loved it was happy to have met the author at the anisfield wolf book awards surprisingly this is his first novel","1238":"4 1 2 stars but for a first novel i think it merits 5 so beautiful evocative writing and richly drawn characters","1239":" to best appreciate this story you need to be willing to read it slowly and absorb all of the details which i didn't do very well through the first half especially if you're unfamiliar with the recent history in this region of the world the variety of characters and jumping around through time can get confusing if you don't take a moment at the start of each chapter to orient yourself with when and where you are in the story and while there were moments when i wasn't sure where the story was headed and had my doubts that it would be fulfilling i was glad i stuck with it","1240":" the writing in debut novels in my opinion as good as they might be usually have some room for improvement i can honestly say this is not the case in a constellation of vital phenomena this novel is as accomplished as you will ever hope to see from any author it's human nature to feel removed from the many conflicts in far flung areas of the world i read novels like this one to remind myself that the key to life for anyone regardless of their ethnicity religion economic status is home and love of family we are all alike in that respect prior to reading this novel i knew little about chechnya except that there are chechen rebels a term i hear on the news by writing this novel anthony marra brings to life the people of chechnya and their struggle to free themselves from russia this is a poor country rife with corruption fear poverty and deception the author focuses on a small village and its inhabitants to bring chechnya to life in a way that no news broadcast ever could each character is fully realized though two akhhmed and sonja's stories are in the forefront my favorite character though is ramzan a young chechen man who informs on his neighbors who then become disappeared he is a very complex person and though he may be considered an antihero i think my heart broke for him more than any character at one point ramzan thinks yes they would likely be shot if discovered by the feds or state security forces but that could happen as easily in eldar or volschansk in their homes or in the street while they slept or while they played chess a fate so likely to befall a chechen man it seemed silly to worry about it too much such a sad sad reality i will say there is very little happiness or hope in this book and the unremitting tragedies which are often set in motion by some mundane happenstance are difficult to read but this book is extremely well written and will keep you thinking about the characters you meet for some time highly recommend five stars","1241":"i gave this book four stars but i don't know how i could tell someone else they should read it knowing what is waiting for them on these pages the characters are fictional but i have no doubt there are thousands of real stories just like them and that is soul crushingly sad to me the author is extremely talented the language is beautiful the lives lived in the book are passionate and meaningful and heartbreaking a great book that i can't handle experiencing again","1242":"beautifully written character driven piece of literature set in chechnya after the fall of the soviet union brutality personal loss displacement of an entire people survival through 2 wars that bleed into each other complex family relationships drive the narrative compelling and emotionally gripping story that plays out the personal lives of a circle of friends and family caught in a nightmare beyond their control","1243":"the worst beach read ever makes for one of the best books i have read this year beautifully worded an epically crafted i'm glad i endured until the end","1244":"it was not a favorite of mine i expected to learn more about chechnya and the wars there instead it was more about the characters in the book than the wars interesting characters to be sure there is the eight year old havaa who is rescued by akhmed and taken to the hospital staffed by sonja who seeks news of her sister natasha usually i am fine with books that skip around in time for some reason this annoyed me in this particular book and made it difficult for me to keep straight the various people who was betraying whom and why and what was happening to them","1245":"can't remember ever having read a more impressive debut novel the author really makes you feel the weight of the situation even if you know nothing about the history of the chechen wars","1246":"loved it deep thought provoking story of russia war times this book was good from start to finish","1247":"great writing tough subject","1248":" i very much enjoyed this book this isn't a typical read for me but i gave it a chance and i am happy i did a very compelling and beautifully written story about the effects of the wars in chechnya on seemingly ordinary people there are six characters whose lives are interwoven more than they realize a truly devastating book but there are also events in the story that make you smile and even laugh this is one of those books that will invade your head space and leave you pondering your blessings in your own life i gave it four stars out of five because there were times where i found myself a bit confused the jumps back and forth in time took me a little while to get used to but in the end it helps you piece together background information for the five days where the actual story part takes place i highly recommend this book even if you do not typically read novels pertaining to history warfare etc","1249":"sad hilarious brilliant catch 22 in the caucasus","1250":" i read this book in my book club this month i would not otherwise have read it we had heard it received excellent reviews the story begins in a small rural village in chechnya eight year old havaa watches from the woods as russian soldiers abduct her father in the middle of the night and then set fire to her home the story continues to detail the horrors of war and the effect it has on havaa and other characters in the story positive comments i knew almost nothing about chechnya before i read this book i am not sorry i read the book since i did learn something reading it the author at times makes profound observations about the effect of war and what it takes to survive his writing at times was deeply moving critique i just did not enjoy reading this book it was at times very confusing to read the author moves back and forth through time i found i had to really concentrate at times to follow the story it's very horrific in parts and definitely not a book to read before bedtime","1251":"a slow read in the beginning but half way through this book really grabbed me beautiful heart wrenching story","1252":"powerful well written thoughtful unfortunately the brutal torture scenes described in the book while not gratuitous were overwhelming for me","1253":"i liked the way the storyline was written and interlaced throughout the book it was very interesting i have never read a book based on this particular time in this particular culture in fact i didn't really know anything of this war until i read this book usually when an author skips around and makes you wait to finish a thread of a plot line i feel frustrated but the author of this book pulled off the technic beautifully","1254":"beautiful marra has developed some of the most well drawn characters i have encountered in a long time he didn't have to resort to insane plot twists or outlandish scenarios see e g the goldfinch but relied instead on the characters to drive the story while all of the characters' lives were intertwined it never felt contrived and the prose was wonderful giving the story an almost magical feel despite the fact that the subject matter was heartbreaking","1255":" what an amazing novel as the sochi olympics crest over the horizon the news is full of stories about black widow terrorists with scars lining their dead faces and vests of dynamite hidden beneath their dresses bombers coming from the north caucasus determined to take their revenge on their murdered sons islamic militants prepared to kill and maim as many as possible to get their voices heard well chechnya is one of the countries in this area and the setting for anthony marra's fantastic debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena after spending four hundred pages with the characters in this book you begin to see why this violence is happening a history of pain of buried land mines russian torture camps lost limbs dispossessed families and heritage repeated over and over but this is not a preachy book this is not a book of impenetrable literature that your high school english teacher tells you is so great but you really just read the cliff notes this is not a history lesson this is a wonderful funny engaging and lyrical story stuffed with well rounded and incredible characters akhmed the doctor who really wants to draw portraits is one of my favorite characters within recent memory this is not a dreary bummer of a book full of death gloom and despair there is humor in this book the absurdity of life and war there is the will of the human spirit to rise again and again after getting knocked down and finally there is the grace some people display in risking everything to help each other great book loved it","1256":" a page turner that captures the details a country that has pretty much never known anything but a state of war told from the vantage points of fascinating characters a clumsy doctor who'd rather paint portraits a town's informant a young girl who can still see some wonder a woman surgeon embittered by life and her heroin addicted sold into bondage sister their lives weave in and out and survival becomes the common thread it's the mundane details of life in this book that paint a haunting picture of surviving wartime much less dramatic and much more nuanced than most war stories","1257":" i am writing this immediately after finishing this book and swallowing back tears this is not just a story it is a reminder of how precious life is and what power love has for all of us and i hate that those sound like such cliches when there is nothing cliched about this book i don't like recapping stories in my reviews because i happen to think the less you know going in the better that said this is a book set amid the chechen wars and when i first started it i had to stop reading and do a little research on chechnya and its history i still don't claim to fully grasp the entire war torn history as all the differences in ethnicities was confusing i credit my very american ness with this and the fact that what has happened in these countries in modern times is basically incomprehensible to a person who grew up in middle class america and has simply never encountered anything remotely like the horror these people live with on a regular basis if you are not well versed on events in chechnya for the last 20 years or so you might want to do a quick google search to better help you understand everything that happens in this book my next advice is to read this when you are ready for something deep meaningful and while beautifully written not always easy to read this is literature not fluff and it took work to read it it's the opposite of a beach read my final advice is to get to it as soon as you possibly can as you will find this to be one of the most profound stories you have ever read","1258":"beautiful writing i stopped myself from a three star review deciding i was penalizing the author for reading this book in not the right mood my fault not his the narrative is at times fun most times sad and pained i did not have a lot of context to understand the history here but found it readable anyway some lovely sentiments within a depressing overall story","1259":"what a depressing story well there are elements of heroism and nobility but mostly i was left feeling bewildered by the depravation and sadness this book outlines i know very little about russian history so it was enlightening but not in a happy way mainly because there doesn't seem much to celebrate i live a very sheltered life in our country of freedom and peace i am glad to have read it it is a book that makes you angry that makes you sorrow and also makes you appreciative","1260":"takes you on a plunge into the darkest corner of human existence and finds even there or perhaps especially there the glowing spark of humanity not a book you'll soon forget with its heartrending sofia choice like moments its details of quotidian violence and best of all its sudden flights of future omniscience which are like rays of heavenly sunlight breaking through stormy clouds and holy moly this is a debut novel","1261":"if you don't know a lot about chechnya which i did not i would recommend reading a little bit about the history first this made is much easier to follow the story which jumps back and forth among years a very detailed account of how life would have been during those war years","1262":"i was absolutely blown away by this novel it was so incredibly beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time","1263":"this novel is perfect i'm astonished by the writing and moved by the characters and also i won't be right in the head for some time the story is set in turn of this century chechnya and conveys all the brutality such a setting warrants some of the details will be at the forefront of my imagination for a while so if you see me with a vacant expression that's why it's not a history story it's a story about specific people who are victims of their time and place marra gave his work a masterful ending an ending that i didn't necessarily expect but that was again perfect","1264":"a bit dark with a very indian feel to it still well written","1265":"slow in the beginning the first one quarter or so but keep with it and pay attention to seemingly fleeting details beautifully written throughout","1266":"this book holy shit this book this will fall into my best books ever read and remain i'm sure this guy wrote too perfect of a first novel and now maybe he'll just have to stop this book is a heart breaker and heart mender all at the same time","1267":"beautifully written heartbreaking and joyous every character gets a full life and is completely human i love mara's use of the flash forward even the most fleeting of characters is fleshed out in a couple of lines that let you know his future with such a bleak present and such a bleak backdrop these little glimpses show that there is reason for hope","1268":"loved this book very thoughtfully constructed exposing the multi generational horrors of chechnya russia conflict via the shared and often emotionally complicated experiences of its central characters i found it very helpful to jot down a little timeline as i made my way through this one there's a lot of jumping around in time with regards to each character's story before and during both chechen wars and the crossed paths among them aren't always so obvious which of course makes the book all the more rich and rewarding","1269":"an absolutely spectacular book it takes the wars in chechnya which had always seemed remote and brings them vividly to life by tracking 5 main characters trying to survive the horror and random violence at once profoundly bleak brutally realistic and in the end reasonably hopeful this book grabs you drags you in chains you to the floor and makes you pay attention and care you'll never think of chechnya as an impersonal faceless place again","1270":"i had to look up where chechnya is located and i feel now that this book has given me a peek into a country and a war that i've been aware of but not had a real sense of a marvelous book and beautifully written","1271":"so well written i don't say that about many books but the author has a writing style that i found enthralling i saw in awe of his mastery as i read","1272":" marra's first novel is a beautiful sweeping narrative of a war that seems forgotten anthony marra's gift for narrative brought to life a war that i was too young to know or even care about the best thing about this novel is that even though the event itself is historical his style voice imagery and details made it seem surreal just slightly edging along the lines of post apocolyptic or dystopian and it's not heavy handed i'm sure that to the characters the world that they lived in probably did feel like the end so to speak excellent first effort for mr marra thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end despite the depressing but realist view of life and death toward the end","1273":"i listened to this book and look forward to reading a hard copy at some time in the future marra sets his debut novel in chechnya from 1994 to 2004 during sobering times of unrest and upheaval but combines the characters in this novel with humor and a real humanity colette whitaker does an excellent job of narrating","1274":"good debut novels are rare great debut novels are even rarer this is one of the greats read it you won't be sorry","1275":"this book is utterly brilliant everyone has said it all but i would feel remiss if i didn't simply say it was the best book i have read in years the story the writing the characters the ending the denouement everything was perfect i can't wait to read mr marra's next","1276":" how many different parts of the world do i have to read the same story of war love and loss i'm not complaining about too many stories written about the same thing i am bemoaning the fact this story based in war torn chechnya is a story told all too often in too many parts of the world it is told beautifully here focusing on the lives of two doctors who together try to care for a little girl havaa who has lost both her parents by focusing on a small village and the lives of just a few people a tortured father who knows his son has committed horrible atrocities doctors who try to care for horribly injured people with few supplies a little girl whose world is torn apart marra beautifully illustrates the impact of war on everyone everywhere","1277":"couldn't plow through more than 1 2 of it maybe i didn't read it in long enough spurts just didnt really care enough about the people and found the jumping around through time annoying","1278":"sensational the best thing i've read in years i have no context for the setting of the book but i didn't need it every part of this from diction to description to characterization leapt off the page i didn't want to go too fast because the writing was so deliciously effective but then i also just kept wanting more the ending of this book doesn't come as a surprise at all which makes how gripping and heart wrenching it is all the more impressive i can't believe this wasn't on more best of 2013 lists calling it best of any single year is underselling it in a detestable way","1279":"loved this book though not an easy read it is beautifully written complex and unusual take your time to read it the story comes together beautifully at the end would have given it 41 2 stars","1280":"highly recommend so well written with a beautiful turn of words and frequent flights into the past and future a sad tale of the devastation of war between rebels in chechnya and russia in the '90's i admit i barely paid attention with a ray of hope","1281":" i can hardly imagine a more brutal place to live than chechnya during the time of this novel the story begins in 2004 eight year old havaa watches from the safety of the woods as her father is taken by the feds and her home is burned to the ground accused of assisting the chechen rebels her father's fate is grim akhmed a neighbor and family friend rescues havaa and takes her to relative safety at nearby dilapidated hospital the hospital is run by a tough but capable woman named sonja these characters although strangers are brought together by unfortunate events all of them are flawed in some way war has held each them in its devastating grasp their lives are tragic and deprived but also tender and beautiful an unforgettable story","1282":"phenomenal i was not able to read anything else for almost 2 weeks after i finished this book it was that good filled with harsh beauty and life's truths","1283":"wow i can't believe it took me over 2 months to read this book it wasn't tedious or boring at all i have just been busy i should have been busy reading this book it was worth the 2 months it took me to read such an incredibly beautiful book from a first time author i don't think i ever cried this much at the end of a book oh my read it","1284":"fascinating historical fiction some parts were hard for me to follow because i knew nothing about this time and place also the timeline jumps around a lot but i love how you get to see the best u0026amp worst of people disturbing u0026amp heartbreaking story of living through war torture but also there is love and loyal friendship","1285":"41 2 stars the only thing holding it back from 5 is that the jumping around in time sometimes made it hard to follow it also made events that happened in the same time frame disjointed so it was hard to see how they flowed and related to each other in time compelling characters and a glimpse into life in chechnya","1286":" a beautifully written novel about a subject situation i was previously not aware of it truly demonstrates the power of the human spirit when faced with adversity each of the characters were memorable in some way as a reader you understand the extremes that a person will go through to save themselves and those that they love i enjoyed how all of the characters tied together in some way as much as i loved the story the reason i couldn't give it 5 stars is because the frequent flashbacks were often confusing in my opinion overall one of the best books i read this year","1287":"this is an amazing first novel it is a complex and often difficult subject to embrace but is so well written it is compelling reading it has replaced the book cutting for stone as my current favorite","1288":" what a spectacular book have gone into mourning since finishing it the time line in this book runs from 1999 to 2004 and is set in chechnya and the backdrop of the conflicts that have ravaged many of the ex soviet union countries each chapter cleverly has the date highlighted on the time line making it so simple to know where you are in the story that switches seamlessly between the years and stories it begins when 8 year old havaa is rescued by a neighbour the night after her father is taken by the feds her neighbour and father's friend akhmed a doctor by education and an artist by choice saves her by depositing her in the nearest big town with an ethnic russian doctor called sonja i won't go into the plot only to say that it is complex and that the delicately woven connections between the characters kept me reading to the end as another connection and crossing of paths reveals itself pitch perfectly done by the author i particularly loved the detours into the lives of characters who appear only for a few lines or pages but whose stories add another layer to this gripping story for example the imam that ramzan encounters in the landfill who lifts the spirits of men waiting to be tortured and then killed showing humanity and faith where those who wait above the pit are devoid of any humanity and display the worst of what any human is capable of in fact it is the character ramzan an informer and hated by the entire village of eldar where he helps disappear more than a dozen people over time who highlights the desolation and hopelessness of these conflicts the best he speaks to akhmed about how the feds will get akhmed to hand over havaa they won't ask you where the girl is they will make you bring her to them and you will watch yourself do it once i was like you and soon you will be like me \" the destruction of oneself under such circumstances perhaps the most harrowing in the whole novel but still the author has written a book that radiates with hope and goodness and at times humour the hilarious exchange after sonja has called akhmed an idiot because he doesn't know the difference between ronald macdonald and ronald reagan and the sharp quips by nurse deshi despite the harshness of environment and the cruelness of people i thoroughly recommend this book","1289":"this is a really good book that takes place in chechnya between the two wars with russia it's the story of 5 days in the lives of a few people who's lives are intertwined by circumstances i read this book for the sterling library book club although i missed the meeting and did not get a chance to discuss it","1290":"this novel is absolutely amazing it takes place in chechnya and the author very expertly scaffolds the reader in understanding what chechnya has been through and what it is like the novel is filled with moral conflicts that no one should ever have to experience the decisions made are hard and often harsh but the reader will be sympathetic in most cases the language is beautiful and really made me pause and savor the beauty of it i already can't wait to read it again just because of that i will admit that there were places that bogged me down but the reward to continue on was great this novel is heavy and filled with many dark moments but it is also interspersed with humor sometimes dark humor and also with hope put this book on your list","1291":"cried at the end","1292":"this is not a happy book it takes you to a place that you probably won't want to go war torn chechnya between the years 1994 and 2004 it is not a safe or a happy place but it is still worth reading i reflected on how different my life is here in suburban america and how much i take that security for granted even in my own home we shouldn't take our freedom for granted or ignore the pain and distress that others in the world are experiencing","1293":" the chechen wars are a part of history of which i had no prior knowledge this book was eye opening it is truly awful the conditions that people had to live in and the things they had to undergo novels such as this one remind me once again how lucky i was to be born in the place and the time i was born the circumstances of those who lived through the two wars and the interwar period are so hard to imagine and yet this novel makes it real the novel begins with dokka being taken from his home and his daughter havaa fleeing to the woods while their house is burned down to be found and taken in by akhmed a family friend he delivers her to hospital no 6 where sonja a doctor works with deshi a nurse as her only assistant sonja agrees to take havaa in if akhmed will stay and work even though his medical training was mediocre and he skipped his lectures to attend art classes instead akhmed's wife ula is sick senile and bed ridden while akhmed spends the days at the hospital with sonja khassan keeps ula company unbeknownst to akhmed khassan is father to ramzan an informant who is responsible for many people from eldar being taken to the landfill where they are tortured and usually killed view spoiler ramzan had been once before the the landfill where he was tortured and finally castrated for refusing to talk and so when he was taken again he quickly agreed to inform ramzan is a detestable character from the beginning who would give up his best friends but his motivations and self preservation begin to make sense and by the end of the novel i found myself sympathizing with him despite what he had done hide spoiler we learn through khassan's visits with ula that view spoiler khassan may be akhmed's father as well as he had had a love affair with mirza akhmed's mother hide spoiler sonja studied medecine in london but moved back to chechnya for the sake of her sister natasha natasha had been left alone and she sold herself into sex slavery in order to get out of the country in captivity she along with many other women all referred to as natashas were made addicted to heroin as a way of their captors maintaining control over them natasha returns to chechnya and is reunited with sonja but suffers from symptoms of ptsd she begins working with sonja at the hospital where she delivers havaa to dokka and his wife later when she flees for the second time this time because she has relapsed in her heroin addiction she passes through eldar and meets dokka again who remembers her and takes her in for a few days view spoiler he gives her the gun that he had gotten from ramzan to keep his family safe since he knew he would not use it and it would be more useful to her she uses the gun to kill one of the colonels in the kontraktniki and the reader discovers that it is because of this that dokka is taken away hide spoiler the characters were well developed fascinating and broken marra revealed just enough information as he went to keep the connections between some of the characters a mystery until just the right moment we don't learn until the very end why it is akhmed knew of sonja at the hospital the gift that sonja brought back from london for her sister a figurine of a buckingham palace guard named alu for his absolute uselessness after the brother of the smuggler who provides sonja with medical supplies and her coveted ice machine is the trinket that pulls everything together view spoiler havaa always carried with her her little suitcase full of her souvenirs gifts that travelers who stayed in her house would give to her and dokka as payment when finally sonja sees this she is able with havaa's help to piece together where her sister went she finally connects with havaa and takes this almost as a sign that she is to take care of her hide spoiler i really liked how it was the small things like that the figurine the drawings of the lost that akhmed did the gun the smuggler's brother the letters of passage in sonja's truck the origins of chechen civilization that tie everything together at no point do the connections seem strained or far fetched either the connections between the characters between the events do not seem like series of coincidences the author develops them in such a way that the reader is aware of the connections before they are fully revealed and i think that helps i'm thinking in particular about akhmed and khassan's connection and how the tiny details akhmed's mother's birthmark for example reveal the truth before it is spelled out there was a point in the novel though that i was beginning to lose interest but i think that i hadn't fully committed to it yet at first i found the characters difficult to keep track of and the jumping between multiple time periods had me confused after i left the book for a week or so though i skimmed through the first part again and once i was refreshed on the characters and the events it was smooth sailing to the point where by about half of the way through i really couldn't stop reading so it took me a little bit to get in to the book but i was very glad i stuck it out the writing was beautiful and marra captured so much truth in the ways he portrayed the characters their relationships and their struggles favourite quotes about ramzan how could he have known that he lived in reaction to his father's expectations needed them to know precisely the person he had failed to become 81 about khassan burning his manuscript and after the fire had read his pages and the dogs basked in the warmth and the ashes grayed the snow what would he write not a history of a nation that had destroyed history and nationhood something smaller a letter to havaa his recollections of dokka he would begin with his favorite memory of dokka then go back to the first time he had met him and end with havaa's birth it would be the first true thing he had ever written 93 akhmed after ula mentioned his mother's birthmark a question surfaced as he swam to meet ula in sleep by morning it would be forgotten drawn back into dreams but for a moment it sat there left by the tide 130 'we're not going anywhere until you buckle up ' the commanding officer said ramzan nodded yes of course he was required to wear a seat belt just as he was required to give directions to a torture camp because stupidity was the single abiding law of the universe 251 252 about khassan and mirza for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric 286 about sonja she was harder to pin down than the last pickle in the jar 314 what a great simile about natasha before leaving she sat at the kitchen table her father had built for them himself from ash wood it was a rickety thing with nails that kept falling out and matchbooks under two of the table legs a table the poorhouse would refuse but one she had eaten from her entire life because spilled tea and tetanus wouldn't kill anyone as fast as a pride wounded father 332","1294":"the praise heaped on anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena has been astonishing so i was surprised when i finished this book and didn't feel the same urge to sing its praises the writing is beautiful in places no doubt but it's beautiful in that deliberate way you often see in mfa styled writing i was drawn to the mosaic of stories and characters here but to me these bright slices never really cohered into anything that had shape or meaning this novel should have vibrated with gritty life and it didn't it felt forced running the old theme of man's inhumanity to man to the ground the writing style is free floating at times and the point of view bobs from one character to another the effect is disconcerting which would have been fine but then it is often coupled with dialogue that felt unnatural forced another review wrote that the banter sounded like it could be from an absurdist play and i agree overall i think marra was just trying way too hard to convey the dislocated fractured sense of being of its characters and so the story rang false","1295":"literally cried through the last 20 odd pages a fantastic fantastic work","1296":"a brilliant work of penetrating depth into a very recent history of barbarity in the human species another exposure of the dead end traps posed by religious beliefs","1297":"could not put it down once i got into the book wonderfully written and actually some humor now and then but it is not a summer happy beach read great sadness and human imperfection but also much courage in most of characters","1298":"a first novel by an iowa writers workshop graduate that is masterfully written about the personal tragedies of war and deprivation this is one of the best books i've read in a long time the main characters lives are interwoven in ways even they can not fathom unspoken love the will to survive and sacrifice are strong themes throughout","1299":"i wanted to love this book but i didn't the 3 star rating is based on 1 star for the first 300 pages and 5 stars for the last 70 what this book lacked for me was context the settings of time frames of the 2 wars in chechnya wasn't enough i felt lost frequently in the first half of the book at about the halfway point i stopped and read a number of goodreads reviews which gave me clues about what i stumbled on then i read wiki regarding the wars after that i felt prepared to finish the book close to the end i read a brief interview with the author and that also helped that is a lot of work to finish one book if the author had set out with something introducing the context of each time frame i think the book would have been more meaningful to me also the frequent description of the terror of war and the torture of captives was at times just too much to bear","1300":" oh read this it is fantastic and amazing and beautiful and heart wrenching and life redeeming i found it because it was a finalist for the dayton literary peace prize and it was the first book i finished from that list marra is a master at spinning an intricate fragile believable story he masterfully weaves together the lives of akhmed the worst doctor in the rural chechnyan village havaa the 8 year old daughter of akhmed's friend who is hiding in the woods after her father is disappeared and sonja the only remaining doctor at the abandoned hospital this is such a gorgeous story and though throughout i felt this oppressive sadness and fear i also loved the twists and turns that led me through this to me affirming novel i adore it","1301":"didn't know much about the chechen culture or wars heartbreaking","1302":"very interesting to learn about the first and second wars between chechnya and the russian federation tragic yet beautiful story of powerful relationships and acts of selflessness","1303":"this one was a book group recommendation otherwise i would never have read a depressing book about chechnya however anthony marra who is not a chechyn is a good writer and i was glad i did and while interesting it wasn't depressing the characters are real and alive and complicated and do not have much besides their relationships to each other i will not forget this one easily","1304":"this is a wonderful beautiful beautifully sad book i learned a lot about a part of the world i don't know much about and became so attached to these wonderfully three dimensional characters","1305":" think this book will stick with me for the rest of my life from the title alone and its implications after reading the book of course following this so closely after the luminaries has been eye opening the former possibly due to the setting period made me think about an individual human's place in a community seeing the affect that one can have on another's life and how this impacted those closest to them this book makes me look at an individual's place in history interesting since it is how relevant modern this feels given recent ahem events can't help but feel amazed at what humanity is capable of after reading this unfortunately on both sides of the spectrum the characters really open up and reveal themselves further into the book and it seems it seems like this was the author's intention started off slow and ended stunned","1306":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here holy crap a constellation of vital phenomena is a page turner anthony marra is an excellent

story","1311":"this book was well written and kept your interest as it involves two wars in chechnya it is very sad and disheartening in parts always surprises me the cruelty of war","1312":"this book broke my heart and made it better","1313":"beautifully written historical fiction novel by a first time author i highly recommend it we read it for book group it made for a terrific discussion and great opportunity to learn more about chechnya","1314":"i've just finished reading and feel so incredibly moved what an amazing book every word was utterly perfect i had to stop listening and go back so many times just so i could hear the beauty of the sentences again sometimes i would have to stop just to give the words time to settle before more perfect words came rushing at me but the story was gripping evocative suspenseful beautiful horrifying as soon as i'd hit play i'd be completely immersed and enthralled determined not to miss a word and my mind never wandered if only reading could always be like this but then i would just be a blubbering mess","1315":"yes it was a very dark and upsetting story but the writing was just phenomenal","1316":"blew me away 5 stars doesn't even come close","1317":"what a powerful and phenomenal book for about the first 50% it was getting 4 stars from me interesting characters fascinating yet horrifying setting with a very slow build then from the half way point it just kept getting better marra who is only 28 is a fearless storyteller it is astonishing that this is a first novel it's emotional and well researched and originally written there were so many great aspects to the writing the unexpected humor the glimpses into the future this how could a teacup shatter when padded in so many layers of memory seriously sort of blown away","1318":"my six chechnya havaa links all promises life","1319":"well written about a country and time that has not received much attention by novelist i did not care for the constant switching between time frames that made the novel at times confusing and more difficult to follow great story would have rated it a 5 except for the above","1320":"i won my copy of this from bookbrowse com and will be posting in their online book club about this book my friends' reviews here on goodreads are so much more eloquent than i could ever be and anthony marra's debut novel about chechnya deserves their eloquence it is so beautiful yet heart breaking and i read it slowly to savor both his language and the incomprehensible situation that engulfs these characters all i can add is just read it","1321":"amazing first novel and depiction of these people this is current history you can't imagine living in these conditions and with these attitudes but it is happening now depressing to be sure but the will of the people to carry on and live and hope makes you realize you don't have it so bad","1322":"tight connections and true caring are depicted in this bit of a mystery but too much

phenomenon","1324":"beautifully written an excellent book","1325":"i read this book for book club i never would have gotten past the scene in the hospital where akhmed performed his first amputation

my breath catch in my throat this one did the trick on multiple occasions beautiful tragic lyrical captivating yes yes yes and yes read it","1327":"not since east of eden have i read a book that felt like a piece of art i literally clapped while i was crying during the last sentences to be able to write like this is awe inspiring anthony marra is a rock star in my eyes","1328":"i listened to this while working the difficulties drama and tragedy the characters go through were very moving but many parts of the book moved along too slowly for me i wish i could say i liked this book more than i did","1329":"for me this moved pretty slow and it took me a long time to really start caring a whole lot about the characters i liked the way it ended","1330":"staggering portrayal of our inhuman capacity to abuse torture and kill not for the fainthearted","1331":"one of the best novels i've read ever","1332":"are you sure this is a first novel never before have i quite enjoyed the run on sentence and marta is masterful at switching time and place and summing up even the minor ist of character's back story in a single sentence simply wonderful","1333":"if i could plagiarize larry's review from the community section showing up about 10 down in my feed i would because it perfectly sums up my feelings about this book i can see why other reviewers love it just wasn't for me maybe a long winter's read instead of summer a very important episode in history so i really should have not given up on it but i just couldn't keep with it","1334":"this is possibly my favorite currently read book the prose is extraordinary it takes place in war torn chechnya so it is not a 'fun' read but there is much humor to balance the heartrending stories of astonishing characters honestly i wish i could write such a book","1335":"one of those books that doesn't necessarily grab you immediately but once it does you can't let go","1336":"beautifully written and devastating","1337":"i just couldn't get into it the characters never hooked me","1338":"my absolute favorite part of the book was how the author would randomly slip in what a character would be doing years and years after the moment in question a surprising often heartening narrative time bending move","1339":"this a painfully smart novel taking you through the chechen wars this story comes full circle over the course of a decade and several characters brilliant book all around","1340":"i found it both interesting and slightly disturbing but i kept coming back to it until i finished it which is the sign of a good book a bit haunting","1341":"very moving fictionalization of how the first and second chechnyan wars affect a few people in a small village apparently well researched the story is violent and tragic sensitive and loving it is so well constructed it's hard to believe it's a debut the quirkiness of the characters and marra's dry delivery remind me of de bernires","1342":"where to start with this enlightening read it's called fiction but i could not help but wonder how true to life it must have been for many chechnyan's who lived the terror of the russian occupation great plot too many characters to make a great story","1343":"i just finished this book and am still sort of living with these people and their heartbreaking stories that illuminate the effect war has on humanity this is a beautifully told never sappy set of interwoven stories that i could not stop reading their world is not an easy place in which to spend time but so worth it i think i grew up a bit having read it","1344":"drop everything and read this book","1345":"anthony marra is a name to remember a constellation of vital phenomena is his debut novel and it is quite simply one of the most powerful emotionally charged novels i've ever read","1346":"this is the first book i have really read since the summer and it took me quite a while to pick it up and then to get into it and then finish it it stuns me how the way life is evolving can change the way you read i am usually a very quick reader rushing through the books i like and trying to get to the end so i can find out what happens i am not always a careful reader and sometimes i read so quickly that i miss a lot and don't catch or remember what a more careful reader might this was a very different experience for me i was drawn into the book from the very beginning and i read this book very carefully over weeks i didn't intend for that to happen but life has been so busy and i have had so little time to read that i think i am cherishing the moments that i have to sit by myself and just read much more than usual and this is a book to cherish the characters were complete people i was constantly surprised by the choices that the characters made knowing that i might have done things differently but also understanding that i have no context in which to really judge them the characters were beautiful and flawed and real they made mistakes and all lived their lives attempting to right their own wrongs and the wrongs of the greater society they lived in shortlisted for the national book award i would not be disappointed if it won","1347":"dnf but did like the half i read and learned a lot about chechnya russian relations","1348":"i didn't even come close to my 50 book goal this year but was really happy with what i read this book was no exception i kept looking to see why i have never heard of this author and found out that this was his debut novel first of all it was beautifully written and not your typical wartime love story it had many layers that just flowed connected and made sense a quick read being less than 400 pages but i wanted more that is a good book","1349":"this book had some beautiful writing in it but the story itself was just not that compelling i went back and forth between 3 stars and 4 finally decided on a 3","1350":" i don't generally respond positively to stories set in wartime they're cold and dark and bad things happen to good people i don't enjoy any of that but for a book of that genre this was a cut above average the chechnyan backdrop was unusual and interesting and the mixed up morality of wartime was well portrayed if you obtain critical medicine for a family member by informing on a neighbor are you a hero or a villain something about the snow and woods and eastern european setting reminded me strongly of child 44 but i quit that book a quarter of the way through and i finished this one so this one must be better the odd thing though is that i had a hard time holding the story in my head when i was away from it if you'd asked me what if been reading lately i'd have blinked at you and wondered why i couldn't remember but once i had no trouble picking up the thread of the story again once the book was back in my hands so i'm not sure if the unmemorable nature of my reading was due to my own oddity or the book's","1351":" i have a checklist of books to read this year and one of them is a book written by someone under the age of 30 i found this book by doing a search for young novelists and this book was extremely highly reviewed unfortunately i read it at a time when i feel like i'm in a rut of reading really depressing books and this one certainly fit that description as well so i struggled through it i can see that the writing is exceptionally good but i just wasn't ready for a gruesome dark story about chechen wars i did learn a lot though torture death and a handful of people's interconnection that takes place between 1994 2004 it was a well woven together tale but in the end i was just like great what horrible thing is going to happen next supposedly the author tried to have a good balance of hope to intertwine with all the devastation but there just wasn't enough for me to grasp onto to make the book enjoyable","1352":"a highly recommended book i read it in small intervals and didn't really get into the characters or the plot lines","1353":"a very powerful novel marra does a masterful job of using the recent wars in chechnya to show that love can survive and flourish even in trying circumstances certainly worthy of all the accolades it has received","1354":"with a constellation of vital phenomena marra weaves a haunting tale that is difficult to put down and impossible to forget","1355":"one of the best books i've read in a very long time","1356":" a difficult read at times but in the end completely worth the effort i kept thinking i'd need to read this book a second time to understand the finer points of the plot but when i'd turned the last page all was clear to read it again would be to miss the point as the book progresses the reader comes to realize that the characters are as confused as he is and it is only through the retelling of each of their stories that we and they gradually come to some understanding of what has happened it is the confusion one must feel in the chaos of war where nothing makes sense on the surface for it is only through the intertwined experiences of its perpetrators and its victims that we can find meaning this is a beautifully written uniquely structured book which leaves the reader thoroughly satisfied and thinking of chechnya long past it's haunting close be sure to read the acknowledgements at the end of book as the author provides insight into his story as well as a suggested reading list on life in post soviet chechnya","1357":"ugh this book was such a downer that it was hard to get through it definitley gives a realistic view of chechnya and all that took place there but i still found it painful to read","1358":"brilliant first novel dark dense but well worth it and filled with plenty of heart and even some hope set during dismal times and horrific conditions in chechnya wow","1359":" given an advanced readers copy long after book was in stores and getting a lot of buzz i found this book interesting but difficult to take in especially as any possible slice of reality it read as if the characters in the story are the only ones left in this war torn country the story turned back and forth on it's self and in the end i felt i should start over to get a real understanding of all the connections but i didn't have enough interest to which says something in itself i have thought about it and decided that the story was just too tragic to endure reading again no matter how well put together well two years later and i did read it again took notes so i could keep all the characters straight and it was much easier to enjoy i would now give it at least 4 5 stars wish there were half stars on this site it still felt a little out of reality had a hard time accepting that that these characters were so interconnected and all the jumping around in time i should have done a time line as well as the note cards but even with moments of confusion and the continued tragic flavor i am really really glad i took the time to read it again if you haven't read it once i encourage you to do so take your time make notes if needed but it is a book story well worth the effort","1360":" the plot was at times confusing as it concerned a part of history of which i have little knowledge the wars in chechnya which pitted the giant russia against the small chechnya however the writing was so beautiful that it made up for any confusion regarding the plot nearly every page was something i just wanted to savor and read again the author has an amazing ability to convey emotions with his words i found myself crying or nearly crying numerous times you hate someone for the evil they do and then you find out what happened to that person and you begin to understand the evil actions you experience the pain and the courage of characters in such a way that it becomes exhausting to read it is hard to believe that this is the author's first novel i certainly hope he writes more of this quality","1361":"both crushed and relieved to have finished this marvelous and disturbing book it wasn't easy reading on several levels but it is a book that will stay with me i will be eager to read something else by the author difficult to believe this is his first novel","1362":"beautiful haunting rich powerful overwhelming late last night as i entered into the final chapters my grip on the book tightened and i brought it inches from my face don't you love fiction like that a constellation of vital phenomena a wonderful title for a book that becomes even more beautiful with each page takes place in chechnya over the course of five days in 2004 the land and people are broken by the wars that have plagued the region for years and the three main characters are no exception the book follows eight year old havaa who has just watched her father abducted by russian soldiers her neighbor akhmed who finds havaa in the forest with a blue suitcase and a doctor sonja who reluctantly agrees to take havaa under certain conditions from the front cover over the course of five extraordinary days sonja's world will shift on its axis and reveal the intricate pattern of connections that weaves together the pasts of these three unlikely companions and unexpectedly decides their face this book is incredible i finished it and immediately wanted to read it again it is beautifully written and deeply affecting how many paragraphs and sentences did i reread in places i laughed and i grieved i was filled with joy and sorrow i felt hope and disappointment wonder and disbelief shock and awe in other words i felt the emotions of life and i was changed","1363":" in the middle of the night 8 year old havaa hides and watches as federal forces take her father away her neighbor and family friend akhmed takes her to the only place he knows she'll be safe from this we start a journey that goes back and forth between the first chechen conflict and the second one meeting a cast of characters who find their lives entwined and in some cases without even knowing it a well written book about family friends love betrayal and what constant war does to the heart and mind of civilians it's written with the chechen conflicts in mind but i felt that the sentiments could be applied to things happening in the world today 4 5 stars","1364":"life is a constellation of vital phenomena by the time you finish reading this story set in chechnya during times of reform' yeltsin gorbachov putin you will understand the overwhelming sadness of this phrase if you are looking for a book to escape reality this is not the book for you i couldn't read it with my 4th grader sat next to me because i felt uncomfortable with my feelings i didn't want him to be able to look over my shoulder and read one blood soaked word from the page the author does not spare the reader from gory detail or the baser actions of one human upon another when would you wish to read this book why would you wish to read this book i'm not sure of the answer for either of those questions except perhaps to understand that we are so privileged to live in country and time of peace for some of the characters in this book are of course just like you or i and some of the character who are bad didn't start off that way but strove just to survive another day","1365":"this was one of those books that you cannot put down but you keep doing so because you want the story to last there are tales with in tales and it kept me captivated it drew me into the lives of the characters so much that i just wanted to know more and more but i kept putting it down because as stated above i wanted it to last when i finished it it was with a tear and a smile","1366":"a beautifully written debut novel about the redeeming power of love in a war torn country moves back and forth in time","1367":"this book reminded me of a chechnyan one hundred years of solitude every character has a history that is woven with many other characters but only slowly revealed over time in wonderfully convoluted coincidences characters are flawed and know it and they try their best to continue on with this knowledge i was so fascinated by all the overlaps that i wanted to go back and read it again once i had finished","1368":" this is a very profound story and so well written that it is worthy of the many accolades it has received i had to give it three stars only because i had very little background on chechnya going into this novel since reading this novel i have done more internet research and realize i should have done this prior to reading it the author doesn't divulge many details of why the country is at war so it is important to gain that background knowledge in order to relate more to the book and don't judge me on my lack of knowledge i was young and didn't connect with world news back in 1991","1369":" brief summary intertwined lives and stories among a village during the chechen wars very little to do with chechnya or war more about personal struggle human psyche and effects of physical and psychological torture 3 stars for me this means it's a well written book enjoyable to read but i didn't come away with any lesson learned or lasting effect feeling the language used was beautiful and makes it the kind of book you can sink into the thoughts and words some favorite quotes god had pulled her through a needle's eye so narrow that this thread in front of them was all that remained invader and invaded held on to their fistfuls of earth but in the end the earth outlived the hands that held it yes of course he was required to wear a seat belt just as he was required to give directions to a torture camp because stupidity is the single abiding law of the universe","1370":"hard going not my thing","1371":"i did not enjoy reading this book at all but i did manage to make myself finish it i am giving it 4 stars because the book is so well written and the way in which the characters' lives intertwine is amazing this book is not for a reader looking to go to a happy place","1372":"a very difficult book to read but one that transcends the experience of reading itself i can't say i enjoyed this book but i must say the author is a brilliant writer his crafting of the characters and their individual stories is well executed and his research was pain staking and extensive that said the book is bleak yet hopeful and humorous at times daily existence is little more than endurance until some random occurrence interrupts or destroys it hunger is pervasive for food moments of joy a reason to live especially for hope which has evolved into a dull resignation so why should you spend your time reading a book that i have described as such because throughout the book there is an and yet and yet there is humanity loyalty memories of happiness that sustains connection between beings that does more than sustain and yet when you finish it this book will haunt you and bring thoughtfulness and gratitude to you that a book you have enjoyed or loved will not be able to do","1373":"havaa is a young girl living in chechnya during a time of conflict with russia one day her father goes missing and she is now in danger her neighbor akhmed a failure of a doctor but an incredibly caring man takes her with him to the only hospital left standing in the mostly destroyed town in order to keep her safe there is only one doctor in the hospital sonja a sarcastic and bitter young woman who has become this way through the many hardships she has endured the only thing she seems to care about is finding her missing sister natasha she agrees to let the girl stay in the hospital if akhmed will work for her he agrees to this and has to face many horrors as the towns are rigged with landmines and there are many patients in need of amputations sonja and akhmed learn from each other he must overcome his insecurities and fears to become an effective doctor and sonja learns to become more caring and less bitter havaa is what connects these two very different doctors overall this is a story of sacrifice and suffering told through convincing and relatable characters set in a horrific place in history who might be interested in this book why someone who enjoys reading historical fiction would enjoy this book because it takes place in chechnya during the war with russia however even if a person doesn't know much about this time in history they would still enjoy this book if someone likes sad stories this is definitely for them because the novel has only a few happy moments in its many pages of tragedy if the reader wants to experience many different viewpoints this book would be a good choice since the characters are all so different and each of their views in life are shown overall satisfaction this is an incredible book that had me totally involved in the characters' world when i was reading it my mind wouldn't wander as it usually does when i read because the story is so compelling i liked how the story would jump back and forward in time by several years in each chapter and how each major character's viewpoint was shown throughout the novel this book is very different from others i've read because it tells the true story of what was happening in chechnya with fictional characters that still seemed extremely realistic","1374":"an excellent profound read set against the backdrop of the chechnyan wars with russia the story weaves the lives of seemingly separate characters the characters are vivid and so real and it broke my heart to read of their suffering give this novel a chance it will not disappoint","1375":"i'd give this 3 5 stars if i could heartbreaking story set during the two chechen wars i knew almost nothing about these wars and this country before reading this book i found the jumping back and forth in time a little confusing at first but the different timelines ended up fitting together clearly for me in the end","1376":"\"we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are \" i cannot explain why i stayed away from this book for so long it is a stunning work of storytelling i love the way marra weaves the different narratives u0026amp time periods together and the end result is just so beautiful i already want to go back and reread the final chapters they had me reaching for the tissues","1377":"this book was well written and very moving some parts dragged and started to lose my interest just a bit long winded but overall a very touching story","1378":"very well crafted","1379":"i read this books few months ago and still from time to time i think about it this novel is a beautifully written account of the horrors that went on not too long ago in chechnya but that's not all it is the characters and events are brought to life so artfully it captures horrifying moments in well structured prose this book however is not for the faint of heart i cried many times it literally slaps you in the face with the unfair circumstances that normal people are thrown into because of war and genocide so beautiful that's all that comes to mind beautiful and heartbreaking","1380":"an appropriately heartbreaking book about what seems like a heartbreaking place","1381":"i loved this story heartbreaking eyeopening and intense at times but filled with great characters whose lives intertwine in times of war the author plays with time in a way i've never read before and it was fascinating a great read","1382":"the non linear plotline just about did me in","1383":"this wonderful novel is set in 1994 2004 in war torn chechnya it tells of the ravages of war through the eyes of a few key characters the novel jumps back and forth between 1994 and 2004 yet in essence the narrative is told in five days a wonderful debut novel i received an advance copy friends let me know if you want it","1384":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here much in this historical novel was dark the violence of war and russian cruelty toward the ethnic chechen people was heartbreaking because of the depressing subject i almost gave this a 4 rating but marra's amazing writing deserves a 5 i found myself picking up the book and rereading passages just because the author's writing was so beautiful and at times funny the story begins and ends within 5 days but there are many flashbacks which explain the chechen culture russian intervention a much in this historical novel was dark the violence of war and russian cruelty toward the ethnic chechen people was heartbreaking because of the depressing subject i almost gave this a 4 rating but marra's amazing writing deserves a 5 i found myself picking up the book and rereading passages just because the author's writing was so beautiful and at times funny the story begins and ends within 5 days but there are many flashbacks which explain the chechen culture russian intervention and how the main characters became who they are and why they act the way they do there are two ethnic russian sisters one who is a doctor at a hospital treating war victims and what is left of the local population the other who is recovering from the results of lawlessness when society breaks down and three intertwining neighboring families who were friends and who attempt to save each other but the book does have some hope at the end some do make it out of the horror more","1385":"dreary","1386":"wow i am firstly amazed that this is a debut novel this story had me crying on the last page it is rare for me to find a book that ends on the last page least of all that ends with tears i love the way the author intertwined the characters in this novel very well written","1387":"maybe the best adult novel i've read in the last few years the writing is so beautifully crafted that i found myself stopping often just to savor a sentence but the story was also a rich experience the characters are well drawn flawed and complex i know i learned a lot about chechnya but it was the power of the intricate story that was ultimately the most satisfying","1388":"intense there is no sugar coating the atrocities of war","1389":" of the recent spate of great books that have come across my library desk this is a standout incredibly beautiful testimony to survival in war the wars in chechnya in the 1990's and early 2000's are the setting for all that is best and worst in human nature when her father is disappeared from their village havaa is taken to the nearby shell of a hospital and placed in the care of sonja the head surgeon and only doctor she is taken there by her father's friend who is quickly conscripted into medical service the lives of the village informer sonja ahkmed khassan natasha and havaa are indelibly etched now in my memory","1390":" this was not an easy read not just because of its disturbing subject matter but because marra makes you work for it understanding the story requires patience and savoring and a willingness to blunder around in the dark for awhile but he rewards you for your efforts the ending is one of the most beautiful i've read and he drops gems along the way to keep you going some of my favorites but nothing she now knew could be defined in exclusion and every bug pencil and grass blade was a dictionary in itself requiring the definitions of all other things to fulfill its own she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency pride surged through her raw and immense she had believed happiness to be an absence of fear of pain of grief but here it roared in her as powerful as any sadness for months they'd run their fingers around the fabric of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric","1391":"the most perfect book i have ever read","1392":"not a light or easy read it is filled with the horror and torture of war torn chechnya","1393":"this is the second library book i've borrowed and didn't want to return because i loved it so much the narrative structure challenged me at first but as the pieces began to fall into place and the full story emerged i couldn't get enough incredible original writing an evocative story that helped me to understand a little more about the world this is one i'll likely re read","1394":"a tough read in more ways than one but so worthwhile","1395":"although a bit brutal at times this book really moved me still up at 1am reading to finish it i now know more of the violent troubles in chechyna a bit of history i knew nothing about highly recommend to read","1396":"this is a beautiful book it is incredible to witness the endurance people have when confronted with such difficult circumstances relationships endured in spite of everything one of the little things i love about the book is the short asides where we would learn what happened to the people years down the road it helped me believe again that this too shall pass this undoubtedly has been my favourite book this year","1397":"i loved this book ok so the head hopping was a bit annoying not to mention the future head hopping but the author more than makes up for that it's been a long time since i've read such well crafted characters the setting was haunting the small details thrown in like removing the glass the boots made for a rich sorrowful haunting read it's a bit dark and hope didn't show up for me until literally the last few pages nevertheless i'd recommend this one to everyone","1398":" a masterful book that rises to a literary feat the structure of the book using a shifting time line lays out the very real characters for the reader his ability to shift the voice to each character when combined with details of each scene gives us an opportunity to acquire a deeper connection with the chechen part of the world this was on my pile of books which i intended to read in2013 finally in 2014 as the winter olympics in sochi approach the cleansing operations of who the writer refers to as the feds with their dreadful finality is made very real","1399":"this is an excellent book the topic is harrowing and the despair is beautifully written i found it painful to read especially considering that i was of age during the time period yet cannot remember hearing much about the wars it makes me wonder what i'm not hearing about now","1400":"the choice of an adjective to describe this novel is difficult since the subject matter is so foreboding i gave it five stars for a first novel well written and my joy of historical novels","1401":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was an enjoyable read that took me into a series of worlds i did not know it wasn't great as the twists were visible early in the book and the author's tendency to show what would happen to characters years into the future became more bewildering as the book progressed still it is the kind of book with characters that will probably stick with me","1402":"if only i enjoyed the first 320 pages as much as the last 50 i had a hard times keeping track of the characters along w the bouncing time periods chapters while characters were also flashing back in time if anyone can explain the connection with the goose mattress message me it is totally bugging me","1403":"this is a really good book but be aware it is very very bleak","1404":"a beautifully written novel about war torn chechnya layers of complexity narrated in a very elegant and captivating way author did a great job depicting facts and describing details of the culture as if he has lived there very deep and touching story can't believe this is his first novel at 29 years of age","1405":"this is an excellent novel with very interesting and well drawn characters th history of chechnya is not familiar to many and its a very sad ugly chapter of history the book is wonderful and i would readily reccomend it but it is not my normal book choice because it speaks of great suffering and sadness","1406":"a beautifully written but horribly chilling tale set in chechnya this book overall and also in its details will haunt me for a long time this is the author's debut novel wow expect to see great things in the future from young mr marra","1407":"the title of this book can be somewhat off putting it's like a mouthful if you don't understand that it comes from the medical definition of life thought the book was very fast moving very interesting and was so beautifully written i enjoyed if from the first page the hardest part was not knowing really anything about chechnya or it's history but marra fills in enough information to allow the story to flow","1408":" i knew nothing about chechnya before reading this book i learned a bit about it's history the people and the culture the book focuses on havaa the daughter of a group of friends who are changed by the wars one becomes an informant after suffering through an initial capture and giving in to save his life he ultimately turns in the other two friends the father of havaa first so ahkmed tries and succeeds in saving her by finding a doctor to take her in there are so many connected characters in the book that i had trouble following at times i enjoyed the book but it was a difficult read","1409":"the best book i have read in years makes everything that seems so important in life feel trivial while making you feel so good to be alive","1410":"a well written though disturbing story of civilians devastated by ongoing war in chechnya and what they are willing to do to survive i felt the omniscient narrator was god showing us that our actions affect many people and that we are all connected for good or evil and who but god would be able to project 99 years into the future for some of the people the characters were shown with all their flaws and weaknesses presenting the all important question what would you do in theirshoes inform or be tortured live in peace or return to a war torn homeland hard to imagine","1411":" i really know almost nothing about chechnya which is a bit strange given my long standing fascination with that while part of the world i had a hard time rating this book because though it took me forever to get into it there were these moments where it felt very nearly perfect i really loved reading the female characters particularly the lost sister but my attention wandered a little when the story turned to the male characters especially the completely unsympathetic informer dude still marra knits strands together in way that isn't necessarily surprising but feels pretty satisfying","1412":"the characters were intriguing and i wanted to know more and the writing in places was absolutely mesmerizing but the novel as a whole lacked something it was okay but city of thieves the orphan master's son the kite runner those were all so much better and more fulfilling to read","1413":" i think this book is ok it's fair it's better than a lot of junk that's published but it isn't great i look to literature to learn history and i learned nothing about the chechen wars it came across as a generic war that could have taken place anywhere cold the different ideologies between warring factions didn't really come up but the real problem with this novel is that all the characters tied in together too closely it was forced connection because war is hardly that tidy the story is told going back and forth in time perhaps a recent trend that has hopefully lost its fad status so any suspense is lost figuring out how the characters come together is too easy so there is no hold my breath to see what happens next pleasure","1414":"i didn't know much about the chechen conflict although i remember the newscasts about it this story takes you through the lives of several characters and how even without them knowing it their lives were intertwined i came away with a greater understanding of the area and a deep feeling about the awfulness of conflict's affect on lives the writers descriptions were right on target i even drew many connections with conditions in chechnya and other areas of the world trying to survive it is a good and interesting read here are a few quotes from the book folklore said god had scattered ethnicities across the earth with a saltshaker the shaker had slipped from his fingers when he reached the caucasus and a few grains of every nation had landed in its valleys thinking of his wife the walks no longer walked the summer woods the undergrowth unparted by their shins the arguments no longer argued no stakes nothing either wanted or could lose the love no longer made desired imagined or mourned enjoy","1415":"beautifully written although a little slow for my taste around the middle i loved the humour amidst the tragedy a testament to both the compassion and cruelty of human beings","1416":"this was fascinating thought provoking and depressing yes the ending has hope in it and i really liked the book but if you're in the mood for a light beach read don't choose this one the setting is chechnya during its civil wars and russian dominance so you can imagine the themes what i really liked about it was marra's ability to create real nuanced characters and show how difficult it is to make moral choices in the face of evil","1417":"beautiful prose but oh so sad took me two months to read it because i couldn't handle the brutality although it is about the two civil wars in chechnya it echoes the current state of affairs","1418":"beautifully written just superb language quite a contrast to the horrors of those who live amidst war while the story is dark there are moments that are almost laugh aloud funny they are mostly based on the absurdity of situations in a war setting marra won the anisfield wolf book award for his work well deserved","1419":"chechnian war story ery realistic with good characters","1420":"top shelf","1421":"excellent i've never read anything set in chechnya i felt like i learned a lot about the people and the devastating impact the wars had on their lives","1422":" 3 5 this is a heartbreaking novel with all the horrors of war family betrayal desperation and love so many sentences and passages struck me as beautifully written but it also irritated and confused the hell out of me with its pervasive future revealing threads woven into an already lengthy chronology ten years 1994 2004 and the switchbacks during those years between several very compelling characters that is the only thing i didn't like about this book though i actively disliked it for those who like me are often voluntarily ignorant of the multitude of conflicts and wars and genocides and atrocities occurring around the world i recommend a quick perusal of wikipedia's pages about chechnya and the two wars covered in this book and even though it is grossly insensitive i will forever link this turbulent country with bridget jones's party prepping question isn't it terrible about chechnya i had no idea what she was talking about at the time and this book has made me remorseful that i didn't bother to find out until now","1423":"complex but interesting book well worth the read","1424":"a lot of stuff going on that all weaves together at the end the back and forth through the years worked well overall a very very moving tale of war and the fallout on the survivors","1425":"it took me awhile to get into this but once i did i was entranced i realized i knew nothing about chechnya which is appalling because the wars there were so appalling excellent read although my overly ordered brain struggled with the setting jumping back and forth in time and the story being told from many different character perspectives","1426":"tough subject matter lots of layers to the book","1427":"get your hands on this book for 2015 undeniably full of hope and chaos that is delightful to read i loved it","1428":"this took me forever to read and i read quite a few books in between but it is a beautiful l written book i ended up not being able to put it down once i was 3 4 of the way through","1429":" what did any one person matter when pounded against the anvil of history \" that sentence from the novel is the theme of the book history is pounding hard against many parts of the world right now and chechnya's the setting for this particular pounding but marra's novel is not so much about the politics ideologies or even history of chechnya though you get some of that it's a book about what it's like to be a civilian trying to live your life in a family a home a village and a country that has become an endless war zone this is an incredible book it's a brutal catalog of the horrors of war in a faraway cold miserable place but each sentence is gorgeous i found myself rereading passages just to savor the beauty of marra's prose if it wasn't a library book i'd have highlighted half of it but it's also a confusing story told by an omniscient narrator who is privy not only to everyone's perspective but also to the past and future povs switch rapidly between the large cast of characters and marra employs an unusual strategy of jumping forward in time when he lands on a particular character he likes even if it's a nameless character who only exists on one page you will suddenly leap forward into that character's future getting a quick rundown on what happens the rest of her life and how she dies why does he do this it goes back to that theme what does any one person matter every character matters deeply to himself--and to his family and friends even torturers even cynical informers even heroin addicts in this book you learn to care about each character in this little forested section of chechnya though by the end i was under the impression nobody was left alive in the village of eldar which is the central location of the novel i kept wondering what is the point why slowly torture and kill the entire population of a village if it sounds like a relentless catalog of pain and brutality take heart there's actually a surprising amount of humor almost all of it comes from dialogue for example when a surgeon in a ruined hospital makes a reference to the bee gees an old woman intones you can tell by the way i walk i'm a woman's man no time to talk the surgeon expresses shock that this semi senile chechen would know the song to which the woman responds people used to recite it in the war i didn't know it was a song for the longest time i thought it was from the qur'an moments like this make the frozen blood splattered narrative bearable the ending too was incredibly moving i reached for tissues without being at all surprising since we pretty much know most of it already thanks to the flash forwards it's hard to believe the central span of the book takes place over only five days by the end we understand how each of the disparate characters is connected often in ways they themselves never understand and we learn about most of their futures that we're omniscient about them but they are kept in the dark about their own stories feels very real so much of our own lives will remain forever unknown to us especially regarding our connections to other people by showing us the limitations of the characters' knowledge we're reminded how we will never really know our own stories not fully edition note i checked out the e book from the library and alternated reading that with with listening to the audible edition narrated by colette whitaker her russian and arabic are not perfect i know just enough of each to identify some mispronunciations like hijab but it's not enough to distract from the story her narration voice is without inflection and her character voices each are quite distinct i felt like she added a lot to this book","1430":" chechnya in the years between 1994 2004 was not a place for human beings the country freed itself from long time soviet rule only to lose access to valuable supplies such as food and medicine the new government has a singular agenda recruit spies and flush out anyone with the wrong loyalties the brutality is unimaginable the book revolves around the fate of a young girl named havaa her mother is dead and now her father has been taken away and their house burned to the ground a neighbor akhmed also known as the worst doctor in chechnya is the only person who cares about havaa akhmed takes a big chance and brings havaa to hospital 6 where russian born sonja is the only doctor left from these characters and more readers are submerged in a place that has been dangerous for so long that survival is the only aspiration left the novel is terribly sad and disturbing but life affirming in a surprising way i've been interested in learning more about chechnya since the boston marathon bombing this novel is part of a string of books that i've recently read set in places so foreign they seem fictitious to read more check out http recklessreading com","1431":"there's just so many but some of my favourite passages and now in the morning as he tightened the orange scarf around her neck he found a fingerprint on the girl's cheek and because it could have been dokka's he left it after crossing herself she lay back on the divan and squirted a cool puddle of hand lotion from the bottle she'd brought from london invariably she would apply too much and her hands would be slick and shiny in the candlelight as she asked for another pair with which to share the excess at the next block she caught up with the old woman who had flagged down a lemon colored lada the old woman had grown up on a lemon orchard and for her first seventeen years she hadn't eaten a meal that wasn't made of lemon there had been lemon cucumber salad lemon vinaigrette beans lemon glazed chicken lemon stuffed trout lemon lamb kabob lemon dill rice lemon roasted chicken thighs lemon curd dressing lemon pudding lemon apricot cake lemon marmalade cookies and on it went she was still four years and one month away from her seventy sixth birthday and the miracle of her first lime for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric","1432":"i found this book very disjointed and therefore difficult to follow i did not learn more about chechnya then i had already read the graphic horror of war however was captured in the fates of akhmed sonja and havaa who were still able to demonstrate a small slice of humanity","1433":"4 5 stars beautiful and brutal","1434":" this book makes me think not only what people went through in chechnya but also about what people are going through right now in the ukraine i think this was an extremely well written book and i very much enjoyed the different characters stories i really liked sonja and havaa and natasha and dokka and akhmed really it was interesting reading about all of them it is hard to imagine people having to ensure this the landfill parts were almost unreadable being an informant on your neighbors is unpardonable i thought the relationship between the sisters was very well written very love hate which i think captures siblings a shout out again to leigh anne for her 5 stars on this book so that it hit my radar i highly recommend this book and my favorite part was the odd little stories telling the future of characters even the minor chars there we only met once like the hospital worker who they said would get a paycheck in 3 years that included 9 years of back pay and that he wouldn't cash it i loved those little snippets of info","1435":"what a book","1436":"crazy good put this one on your must read list","1437":"beautiful writing of intersecting characters in chechnya i knew little about the conflict there prior to this novel and found this to be the best kind of historical fiction that tells the story of specific people navigating war and persecution heart breaking of course but also filled with the warmth of people trying to do their best","1438":"any novel which absorbs me so much i ride two subway stops past my own deserves four stars there were some sections in the middle which felt a little self indulgent but the end was extremely moving the writing was lovely with these tiny little flash forwards for many characters both major and minor and boy i learned a lot about chechnya","1439":" wow a beautiful story of how we are all connected what might at first glance seem to be multiple random ordinary unmemorable events actually forms part of a larger vital story each story is part of many peoples lives and forms their characters and memories and changes their paths in life this book is set during the second chechen war and it reads credibly it could be any modern war where civilians are in the middle and suffer the most damage it is astounding that humanity survives in any form be warned there are no winners and the last 2 chapters were read with tears rolling","1440":"2013 379 pagesa booker man book award nominee a tough read for those of us who do not like reading about war deprivation caused by war lacks provided by war or those who die either by starvation or unsanitary hospital accommodations well written but tough","1441":"remarkable book but oh so sad the story of chechnya during the breakup of the soviet union dystopias are not just science fiction they happen in real life and this story tells that story of the people between the first and second chechnian wars the style of writing is melodic at times as we get glimpses into the future for some of the characters a fascinating style but the present for most is tearful and heartbreaking","1442":"it really impressed me how this book managed to be both a panorama of wartime and so intimate with its characters the doctor the artist the informant the historian the prisoner's daughter i think this effect happened partly because at the beginning i didn't know how everyone connected but by the end i saw all the threads binding them together that made me journey as a reader from the distant and epic to the familiar i was especially drawn to the two sisters the friction and the longing between them and how that evolved in the book","1443":" don't be put off by the puzzling title a major character finds life defined in a medical dictionary as \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" followed by six conditions that must always exist and life with all its ugliness and beauty is what marra portrays using chechnya during the war torn years from 1994 to 2004 as the setting he does a phenomenal job of telling his unsettling story in a way that drew me in with his first words in spite of the subject this is not a dark book marra finds ways to keep us reading he often uses his sense of humor to offset the grimness a beautiful book","1444":"a beautiful haunting first novel set in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 got a bit confused by tune changed in the beginning stick with it it's worth it","1445":"very well written and worthy of the awards yet only 2 stars b c so depressing one really needs to be ready for a sad hard story the worst part so much of what is described actually happened so recently in chechnya from a literary perspective 4 stars but for my experience of reading it 2 stars","1446":"i loved the book i thought the character development was excellent it also gave me information about a time i knew little about","1447":"this is a painful story beautifully told i always love reading wwii fiction and i was astounded to read something so like that but telling of history so recent this is important and memorable and hard to accept but the telling is pure genius","1448":" i had to wait until i had at least 24 hrs to process the ending of this book before writing a proper review i've read a lot of books that i have given five stars to but this is one that i would give ten if that was an option the fact that it's the author's first novel gives me so much hope for the future of fiction writing in america i want to go back and read it almost immediately because it is that good and i read it so fast that i am afraid i might have missed one beautiful sentence in it's 379 pages of perfection it is heartbreaking and hilarious all at the same time i loved each of the characters so much that i had a hard time being mad at them when they were jerks there is so much good in this book that i don't even know how to write a review for it it is a book of family friendship love hatred desire and existence in a time of war if you want to have your heart broken by a novel this is a book for you if you want to laugh and feel humanity pulse from the page within your fingertips read this book there are so many standout quotes from this book but i think this is the one that i absolutely must share how do you find them the girl asked she lifted her gaze to sonja as if teetering on the precipice i don't know havaa i'm sorry i don't maybe we try to find them in other people in kindness and generosity those things don't disappear","1449":"this book will live with me for a very long time definitely one of my favorite books to recommend the plot keeps you guessing and hoping to the very end","1450":"anthony marra is a brilliant lyrical writer and as his debut novel i am salivating at the thought of what he will write ten years from now on the surface the subject matter is difficult but marra gently guides the reader to a place we want to experience because the story is so much more than a chechnya war novel in my view this is a story about life love connections relationships values and choices marra developed characters that will stay with me this book was stunning and amazing","1451":" it seems strange to say that a book about the chechen wars political disappearances torture betrayal and ultimately the strength and goodness present in some humans despite all the wrongs of the world is wonderful but this book is truly one of the best books i have read in a while it was a quick read but that is not to say that it was an easy read the story is not an easy one but the story propels you towards finishing to find out what happens to the characters you have grown to know and in some cases like i will be looking for any future endeavors by this author i will also be searching out nonfiction books about chechnya and the conflicts with russia soviet union","1452":" first time novelists have no business being this polished or skilled and for a guy who grew up in d c marra somehow makes the setting of rural chechnya feel achingly real though it's not like i'd know if he were faking it marra's depiction of the devastation and horrors of chechnya is haunting and gripping painting a picture of rubble strewn towns and villages with populations decimated by wars mines and routine disappearances of people at the hands of soldiers it's a horrible desperate place to be but it's an excellent place to set a story as it makes every moment fraught with myriad potential dangers and makes any character seem noble and valiant for surviving and clinging to hope in the face of hopelessness these themes and dangers are amplified when an author puts an innocent child into the mix e g the road winter's bone the kite runner and true grit in this book that child is an 8 year old girl named havaa the subject of this novel's first sentence \"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones \" it's an excellent way to work in hope and whimsy into a setting that actively works to destroy both of those qualities and to allow otherwise hardened characters to soften a bit around havaa there's a lot that's great here but two things kept this from five stars first the novel jumps back and forth over a ten year period and while these times are fairly clearly established each chapter begins with a timeline indicating the year s and there are repeated references to previously covered events that happened a certain number of years earlier or later some of the events are a bit unstuck in time for example it's easy to remember a big solitary event but if a character does something mundane like make phone calls or run away multiple times i found it hard to remember which of those events had hadn't happened yet and to attach the appropriate amount of gravitas to the action second i found marra's use of an omniscient narrator to be the only thing that screamed \"this is my first novel \" and it was regularly distracting the characters and story were rich and deep enough without unnecessary character sketches of people whose only connection to the story is that they used to work in an office that a scene takes place in the most egregious instance i can remember involves a vignette about the doctor who used to have the office sonja has now taken over and how this doctor had too close a relationship with his stepsister leading to her being married off quickly to avoid scandal and this doctor then threw his inability to move on love wise into caring for the elderly from that office we get it first time novelist you have lots of ideas save a few of them for your next novel and focus on telling this story well still a few discourses over the course of hundreds of pages is readily forgivable for the powerful and memorable story here this book definitely deserved its spot on several year end best of 2013 lists and it's well worth picking up","1453":"i was often interrupted while reading this so the story felt a little disjointed but boy this author knows how to use words","1454":"this is book filled with people who will be staying with me for some time","1455":"chechnya atrocities of war powerful book fascinating well written but one i cannot recommend because of the horrific subject material very tough read","1456":" a constellation of vital phenomena probably deserves a 4 for phenomenal writing but i just didn't like it enough to rate it that high it's full of deep messages one thing i felt like marra is trying to say is that all the people we briefly bump into on our journey through life have befores and afters larger stories than our quick intersections can suggest what i can't decide though is if marra is saying that this makes everyone more important than we realize or if he's trying to say that we are all truly insignificant vital only to ourselves his storyline dealt a lot with parents and children fractured family relationships and things that ultimately hold us together anyway it was deep and dark with its chechnyan war setting and broken characters anthony marra is really talented but i don't think i'm his intended audience 3 5 stars","1457":"i wasn't at all sure i would like this book although it was recommended by a very literate friend it is not an easy read but i ultimately found it very worthwhile it focuses on chechnya a muslim country that was in the former soviet bloc i knew nothing of that country's history but it has been to hell and back the story is of the people in a small mostly destroyed village and the informer ramzen among the residents it takes a while to sort out who is who and of course the names are foreign so hard to hang onto but an overall sense of real humanity and true tragedy prevails some memorable characters including sonya an english trained surgeon who returns home to find her younger sister natasha sonya continues to be the only doctor practicing in the mostly destroyed hospital she saves lives every day ultimately she takes on havaa the young daughter of a man who has disappeared into the landfill havaa's father dokka had already been there once when they cut off his fingers but he survived the first time havaa's neighbor akhmed brings her to the hospital where he briefly works as a doctor as well but ultimately akhmed is betrayed by ramzen and he too goes to the landfill an amazing book brutality v humanity beautifully written andrew marra teaches at stanford","1458":"life a constellation of vital phenomena organisation irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation","1459":" judging from the other reviews i glanced at and the overall rating i'm in the minority here i thought this deserved more like 2 5 stars but what tilts me towards three stars is the fact that the author at least tackled the wars of chechnya to some degree when they were largely ignored in the west not that there wasn't a lot going on what with rwanda the balkans and then 9 11 plus chechnya wasn't exactly hospitable to journalists the book most readily comparable to this one is the tiger's wife another debut novel set around a recent war balkans in a seldom seen landscape and dealing with generational bonds but that's about the end of the comparison where the tiger's wife excelled constellation did not there were strong points to the book i liked the ending some of the writing was excellent and the pace was good the greatest flaw in the book is its uneven tone there was a laziness to it we were meant to grow attached to the characters who largely witness and frequently endure terrible deeds yet strewn amid the tragic marra can't resist injecting not humor but satire almost always about the russians former soviets it seems that every time a russian bureaucrat or soldier steps onto the scene suddenly we're in catch 22 territory or worse hogan's heroes mode the subtler satire had to do with one character's 4 000 page history of the chechen people and the struggles to have it published the most farcical was a three to four page talking heads phone call between a chechen informant and a russian colonel which reduced the russian to caricature but there were other serious deficiencies i rarely felt as though i got to know the chechen culture the main characters really seemed not so different from western ones e g i would have expected the men being muslims in the caucasus to act quite differently in the presence of women who were not their family instead we're treated to familiar male female dynamics including more than one extra marital affair that seem to attract no gravity beyond that we'd see in western nations this defect can be contrasted with the tiger's wife where the local culture its myths and taboos are woven tightly into both character and landscape speaking of which other than the description of bombed out ruins there was little to differentiate the landscape i never really saw the village that was central to the story marra dispensed with almost all wide angle views of that setting until sonja the doctor drives into the village near the end of the book the book also confuses with the back and forth in dates notwithstanding that the chapters situated us in the year that confusing chronology was exacerbated by the multiple points of view at least six that sometimes alternated in individual scenes finally there were some fundamental implausibilities in the plot and in character eight year old havaa shows herself to be remarkably resilient remarkably when her only surviving parent is snatched away at gunpoint the opening scene and instigating incident i mean what we get to see of her makes us think she's no more bereft than had her pet goldfish died or to take a small point yet central to the story what about akhmed's 11 km daily walk from the village to the hospital and back 22 km total in winter with snow on the ground and having to detour into the woods to avoid a checkpoint i mean what would that take very conservatively five hours more realistically without optimal footwear and being in less than prime health i'd say more like seven plus hours note that later in the story it takes natasha a full day to cover 11 km one way meaning that it wouldn't happen i could go on but i think that maybe some of this is coming off a little too strongly only because i had such high expectations from all the over the top blurbs on the book cover my review it doesn't totally suck but it should have been much better","1460":"i listened to this book through audible on my phone what an amazing tale i kept stopping the book and doing a bit of research on the history of the area i am still confused about it but what a horrific time for the chechen people a tale of courage confusion love loyalty and desperation the stars it is receiving are the kudos of an incredibly well written story","1461":"before a constellation of vital phenomena i knew one thing about chechnya how to mispronounce its name now i'm an expert on recent chechnyan history thanks to anthony marra and the google i usually love books that make me want to go off on rabbit trails of learning and this one is no exception but it's not just that i loved so many things about constellation don't get me wrong it's hard to read at times just because of the harsh setting conflict ridden chechnya and pervasiveness of war we get to know a generous handful of characters and i found myself loving almost all of them but war is almost a character itself wrapping itself around the everyday lives of those people and i had to take breaks every now and then there's a brief but awful torture scene maybe halfway through the novel that i should have skimmed nothing is gratuitous but it's still pretty harsh it's war ultimately though there is enough hope enough light let into the pages that it's uplifting despite all of that the narrative starts in 2004 as a father is disappeared and his daughter goes into hiding it loosely follows the attempt to keep her hidden but marra plays with the timeline popping in and out of different points in a ten year time span this could be a mess but there's a header at the beginning of each chapter that clearly marks the year being covered in that chapter and it works one of the things i liked the most about constellation is the way everything and everyone eventually intersects marra focuses on three people but there are so many characters inside this book and they wander in and out of each others' lives throughout those ten years creating ripples that reach into the future it's a web of a novel and it's lovely and the prose there are so many beautiful turns of phrase in constellation that i eventually gave up highlighting my favorites if i had been reading a print book and not an e galley my copy would have looked like some sort of bizarre basketweaving with text experiment yes it's safe to say i capslock loved this one way to start a career with a bang i'll definitely keep an eye out for marra's work in the future","1462":"we'll written","1463":"found the beginning a bit challenging but the story started to come together after hearing anthony marra discuss his book at a book festival it helped overcome the challenge of following the timeline reading this book brought awareness to the tragedies of war and political discourse of the begin","1464":"one of my favorite books of 2015","1465":"best book i have ever read every emotion is canvased the writing is so moving and beautifully descriptive the characters are very human and the motifs that run through the book are vivid descriptive and add so much","1466":"a very well written complex book some of the war information was a bit confusing but not enough to make it difficult to read","1467":"although this was a well written and informative book about the chechnyan conflict i was unable to finish it at this time i just kept plodding though it and realized at this moment i desired a good mystery","1468":" everything wonderful i heard about this book turned out to be true heartfelt powerful and poignant the story of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary times plays out against the blood drenched landscape of modern chechnya the year is 2004 and the on and off conflict with russia has been going on for a decade when russian soldiers abduct her father and burn her house in a rural village 8 year old haava hides in the woods where her neighbor akhmed finds her he takes her to an abandoned hospital where one doctor sonja has stayed behind to help the wounded she doesn't have the time or resources to care for two more refugees but as the week unfolds so do the unexpected connections among these three souls andrew marra writes with wisdom grace and rueful humor i'm only sorry i didn't read the book sooner received paperback copy through publisher's blogging for books program","1469":"this is one of those books that will stay with you it is a hauntingly beautiful book the characters are well developed and the connections between them are lovely the story is harrowing and sad but stunning and gives one hope even the most dire of circumstances a definite must read","1470":"this book is included on a number of best of 2013 lists and in my opinion well worth reading anthony marra weaves a complex story and in doing so writes beautifully not only about beautiful people and situations but also about horrible people and ugly situations","1471":"this is a book about people living in chechnya during the wars and unsurprisingly for a book set during a particularly brutal and horrible set of wars it is not an easy read at times i found some of the passages that involved torture quite disturbing and difficult to get through however it's extremely well written the characters are distinct and interesting and i ended up wanting to keep reading to find out what happened to all of them","1472":"i'm not sure who i'd recommend this one to it was a cross between cutting for stone and orwell's 1984 loved the irony t","1473":"i think this without any doubt is the most satisfying read for me for this year anthony marra nails it there is not a page here that reads dishonest or forced or made up or superficial i was so completely transported into a very unfamiliar place and felt every little thing in this book just have to say highly recommended you will be transformed i give 5 stars","1474":" the first 200 or so pages dragged but the second half mostly made up for it my one big complaint are all the coincidences it was hard to think of this novel as anything but total make believe as a result which was unfortunate it just felt too crafted and not nearly spontaneous enough i could almost hear marra thinking through what's next as i read which i hate in a novel i want a book to completely transport me so i forget that the story is fiction that it was manufactured by someone's imagination couple that with the very slow start and the novel mostly fell flat for me but i still enjoyed some of the historical notes about the ussr and what's happened in that region since it fell i think people largely forget how recent that was and the issues that remain unresolved in many areas as a result if nothing else this serves as a great reminder","1475":" the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones the moment after i read the opening line of a constellation of vital phenomena i sensed this was the beginning of a beautiful journey i was neither exactly right nor dead wrong for one thing a very powerful topic is a very powerful topic and it's the chechen russian conflict in this case with a timeline that runs from the early years following the dissolution of the soviet union and the chechen ingush assr split to 2004 so it would take actual effort for this book to read even somewhat boring it doesn't of course the story is fascinating moreover anthony marra easily ticks most not all and i'll explain why later on of the relevant boxes in the \"new talented kid around the writers' block\" checklist his prose is 1 powerful 2 beautiful 3 affective 4 memorable and occasionally skilfully drizzled with poetry so 1 check 2 check 3 check 4 and check no box ticking on the poetry thing it's an extra on the other hand he overuses one of those pro spoiler literary techniques that i find absolutely irritating and that i'll describe through a hypothetical example that i'll make up right now \"they looked at each other with hope for the future how could they know that in five years time one of them would suffer the loss of the other one of them would face the most painful of deaths but who would that be was impossible to foresee at that time of happiness\" thanks but no thanks anthony and that's on top of the back and forth in time core structure of the book which by the way felt a little choppy to me in the sense that even though each chapter flows smoothly the connection between the 90s and the 00s is not seamless enough most importantly what i felt was the major hitch in this book was that it doesn't provide a convincing enough insight into the geographical and historical context of the events that it describes historical fiction needs to be self contained to make sense but a constellation of vital phenomena doesn't satisfactorily orient the reader through the specific circumstances of the chechen wars i am perfectly aware that the author drew from several sources on chechnya and modern russia as well as descriptions and insights into wartime grozny and even took the time to visit chechnya himself but this is just not coming through the book a constellation of vital phenomena is a very moving story about ordinary people trying to pick up the pieces in the course and the aftermath of a war that could take place absolutely anywhere and that's exactly why he ticks most of the boxes and not all of them not because of the lack of self containment per se but because he did take context into account he did his research he got the insight and still he didn't manage to transfuse this knowledge through his writing of course this doesn't abolish my praise of anthony marra's talent above a constellation of vital phenomena is a good book on the frailty of the human spirit and one that i'll remember just not one that i couldn't have lived without in any case i'm definitely keeping an eye on what anthony marra does next something less depressing hopefully but even if it's still to be a post war story i'll take it who wins the americans or the russians \"both\" his father said glancing to the frost filled windowpane \"then who loses \"\"everyone else \"","1476":" 4 5 starspowerful often heartbreaking ultimately hopeful this non linear novel set in modern chechnya shifts back and forth between five eventful days in 2004 and scenes from the first chechen war in the mid 1990's with occasional glimpses into the future strong characterizations of ordinary people caught in the middle of a brutal war first read nov 2013 reread for arrt book discussion july 2014 heavily skimmed for another book discussion in oct 2014 read carefully for book discussion in 2015","1477":"the writing is so poetic i have never annotated a book so much a tragic story with a strong hopeful ending i can't believe the author was american as it felt eastern european causation","1478":" do yourself a huge favor read a constellation of vital phenomena you deserve this gift i am still shaking my head that this could be anthony marra's debut novel his gifts as a writer are extraordinary the continuous insights into life and human behavior on page after page are overwhelming the way he brings the characters' lives together over the course of the book kept me turning pages faster and faster now the book is often filled with man's inhumanity to man and can be very emotional and difficult to read but you gain a deep appreciation for the people who suffered for so long under atrocious conditions at the end of the novel as the protaganists' lives were more fully detailed and their life journies revealed i felt a deep physical and emotional response i can't wait to add mr marra's second novel to my bookshelf","1479":" i had a hard time figuring out exactly what this book was about or even who the main character was until close to the end and that made it a little hard to follow but i still felt myself captivated by their lives and their terrible circumstances while it was tricky at the beginning to jump around in time i feel like having the year as a heading for each chapter not only helped the story eventually but also reminded me that this wasn't the 1950's it was ten years ago that all of this could have been happening and that made it hit me even harder","1480":" i guess i am just out of touch these modern best sellers all just really seem to be pretentious gimmicky or just flat out suck it makes me wonder or become concerned as to how modern authors are even published do they all have to come at their work from an obscure angle and have little to no story development i could just never get into this story at all simply due to how it was written also damning was that i really can't answer how this was written i'm still not sure and i have read a lot in my life i know there are little to no stories one can find on the chechnya civil wars and that makes this book at least legitimately unique but despite this distinction which is not nearly good enough the book's story is lost under all the bullshit if it was ever there to begin with we need a new literary renaissance and this post modern crap is not it and we are kidding ourselves big time","1481":"beautifully written and unforgettable a constellation describes the lives of a handful of people in chechnya u0026amp their ties to a young child whose life they save depicting the hardships of people caught in a war torn country for 13 years it also explores the complexities of fathers and sons husbands and wives sisters neighbors and parents and how people sometimes make decisions right or wrong","1482":"this book was quite good the story jumped about in time so on occasion it was a little difficult to follow i know little about the history of chechnya and russia so that information was very interesting it's shocking how the people lived as recently as 2004 and very sad the interconnectedness of the character's lives was very believable","1483":"would not recommend","1484":"astounding both tragic and breathtaking i'm going to need a moment or two","1485":"it took me too long to care about the story even though every sentence was a work of art i finally did and the last third of the book was stunning","1486":"though i found the subject matter not to my taste it was so beautifully written i had to see it through it didn't get page turning hot until the last 40 pages but overall glad i read it lovely ending as well","1487":"there are no words i can say that could come close to doing justice to this amazing book other than read it and read it now have not had a book elicit a cry like the one i just had in years cannot believe this is a first novel marra is a genius","1488":"if i could give this book more stars i would","1489":"how do you write a book that covers some of the most horrific things that humans can do to each other and still give your reader hope in humanity be this author that's how this book was a complete surprise to me the language was beautiful i cried i laughed i was afraid and disgusted i was hopeful i believed in family i thought family was the root of all evil i will read this again and pass it on havaa havaa","1490":" wow this is a powerful book and i would have to say a must read this is the first book for this author and he has outdone himself the story takes place in a small village in chechnya you hear the name you see it in the news the two men involved in the boston marathon tragedy but i know so little about the politics the russians want the country as it is a major hub of the oil infrastructure for them thus you get fighting rebels and russians over years and years this story isn't about the soldiers it is about the men and women and children who are effected by this craziness this story is about eight year old havaa with her suitcase sonja the london trained surgeon akhmed haava's father akhmed's wife sonja's sister and elderly khassan all interwoven in this story that has flashbacks often telling you what happened before and even in the future when the story is done i wasn't sure about it during the first 50 pages or so as i didn't know what was going on the framework is laid and the puzzle soon fits together more and more as you come to the end of the book don't give up as this is a masterful story anthony marra has crafted a story that is unique the title life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaption","1491":"this book was a little dry and hard to get into but so well written with such wonderful sentences that i enjoyed every minute loved how everything came together and the messages within","1492":"hard book to read i really liked the last part of the book as the author brought all the characters' stories together beautifully written minus all the f bombs i'm not sure why i got to be born in america but i'm pretty sure it's because i wouldn't have been able to cope with circumstances such as the chechyan people had to","1493":"this debut novel set in chechnya is one of the best books i've read this year it takes place over 5 days but spans back 10 years to build out the story of the main characters in a small chechen village and two ethnic russians whose lives become intertwined with them the writing and sentences are beautiful and i especially liked the look into the future for many of the characters just a sentence that tells what happens to them three or seven or 10 years after the second chechen war ends the next to last chapter of this book was my favorite with its rhythm between the current day when the reader knows what's going to happen and the future i wish it had ended there although i understand why marra wanted the reader to have the closure offered by the final chapter it's important to pay attention in this book because a character in one chapter will turn up in another one and secondary characters have more importance in untangling the story than you originally think they will the timeline at the top of each chapter with each year between 1994 and 2004 listed and the year of the chapter highlighted is very helpful in placing the reader in time as the story unfolds this is a book i will definitely read again and i highly recommend it","1494":" this was the first proper adult piece of literature i've tried and so will always remember and be impressed by the depth of writing compared to my usual ya novels it is crude in its descriptions doesn't hide any of the facts of the scene as disturbing to me anyway as they are but it does so in a rather unaffected yet smooth way the story runs its course and everything ties up beautifully no potholes or anything and you're totally immersed you feel like crying in some moments the rare respite from the otherwise grim setting sometimes from happiness of the human soul a lovely book i must say and even better is its famous definition life a constellation of vital phenomena","1495":"i am reading the hard copy while listening to the audio book and am finding both to be pretty good not great sonja's description of loss of a loved one is spot on the absence isn't immediate more a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an erasure but a conversion in form from present to memory from solid to liquid you may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it p 120 i think the audiobook could have been better the reader used a thick russian accent that was sometimes hard to understand","1496":"fantastic story though pretty depressing","1497":"this book falls into the curious category of books that i enjoyed and would not recommend eventually i adapted to the writing and storytelling styles and the beautiful story drew me in but boy did that take a while and it was laborious and sometimes outright unpleasant looking at you first 75 pages getting there particularly bummed to have missed this book club discussion","1498":"complicated and sometimes brutal read took me awhile to engage with the characters but eventually very compelling story about what happens to ordinary life when it is under constant siege of war moments of extraordinarily beautiful and profound writing","1499":"well done an excellent read","1500":"i'm actually still struggling through this but i'm doubtful that i'll make it to the end this book is very self consciously literary and the result is that it's swerving dangerously close to unreadable even though their situations should be compelling i honestly don't care what happens to these characters plus one star for the interesting choice of setting and some good history thrown in","1501":"this is a very emotionally difficult book but very good","1502":"this book though very well written was not for me i almost quit several times it is dark and depressing and that's just not why i read i kept on because of the stellar reviews but truth be told i hated it very slaughter house five ish","1503":"haunting you just never know until you walk in someone else's shoes","1504":" read it it's hard to read addresses war deprivation cruelty suffering on many levels also love humor hope redemption some aspects are biblical and has much history it's a page turner as well as one to linger over and how the heck do authors weave all the story lines together in such a well crafted ribbon characters defined in the most lyrical ways i think this book and author will shine in this year and well beyond wish this was not the author's 1st book so i could read more can envision this becoming required reading","1505":"life is a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation a constellation is a group of people or things that are similar in some way this is the story of a group of people connected by the circumstances of a war torn country and the choices and sacrifices they make to survive and protect their friends and family beautifully written but not a fast read i found myself needing to reread for depth of understanding","1506":"this book destroyed me but in the way that only a great story can beautiful haunting devastating and hopeful","1507":"i hesitated to read this book because of the setting but now that i have i can only quote a few comments from other readers beautiful stunning prose that made me pause frequently to reread a sentence paragraph or page this goes on my list of top 10 books i have read in recent years i learned so many things truly beautiful and haunting thanks to my friend for her strong recommendation","1508":" in the same vein as the tiger's wife this debut novel by anthony marra is an extraordinary eloquent heart rending book a constellation of vital phenomena is as lyrical as the title implies this story gleans meaning from the senseless environment of perpetual war the characters may not always know the parts they play in each other's lives but the author brings their stories together with such grace that akhmed ramzan khassan sonja natasha dokka and havaa resonate in their world and with the reader truly beautiful","1509":"there were bits that didn't hit me and i need to learn more about this history and time period but i found a few characters and lines very enticing in sweetness","1510":"i wanted to like this book it had great reviews but i just never developed an attachment for any of the characters it jumped around and i had a very hard time following the sequence of events","1511":"this book will be on my favorite list for a long time poignant evocative and full of life a constellation of vital phenomena","1512":"this book marra's first is so beautifully written there were times when i put the book down just to relish a wonderfully crafted sentence marra's portrayal of the human condition in a time of war and unrest is so compelling it reminded of the best reasons to read as john green said reading is a kind of empathy and i empathized with the complex characters in this novel as they dealt with love loss truth and suffering this is easily one of my favorite books of all time i can't wait to see what marra writes next","1513":" beautifully written debut novel about an intricate web of characters attempting to survive in war torn chechnya between 1994 2004 including an 8 year old girl whose father has been abducted the man who makes it his mission to care for her and a female doctor desensitized to the injuries of war but haunted by the disappearance of the person she loves most i got a little verklempt as i let myself sink into the themes of family bonds the ties that connect us and the torture of not knowing what happened to someone you love","1514":"this book is tough but incredibly worthwhile not necessarily a page turner but full of characters i cared for deeply gave me great insight into modern chechnya and is powerfully smart and moving loved it","1515":"this novel is littered with unbelievably clever and original descriptions of emotions leaving me with no doubt about the depth of sorrow felt by the characters meant to portray the 'ordinary' victims of modern war but they were nothing but ordinary you could not read this novel without feeling absolute compassion for refugees or anyone forced to survive in such atrocious conditions so terribly sad but so wonderfully good","1516":"i think i liked this book while i don't consider this an easy read chunks of book would pass with surprise as it is extremely well written the story itself is good the excellent writing compensated for confusing story jumps what was never atoned was simple t m i from p230 but he felt increasingly certain that it was neither the surplus of cured meats nor the dearth of vegetables in his diet but rather the conversation with the cossack colonel that had fossilized his lower intestines he considered prayer but asking for spiritual laxative was surely sacrilege inspired by the long leaky shits he'd taken as an eighteen year old red army private he performed post fajr calisthenics he vomited from the exercise but still failed to coax even a pale watery squirt the weather at least provided solace if ever there was a season for constipation it was winter beneath the wooden toilet box the cesspool had frozen into scentless stone surely that was preferable to the fecal fever baking beneath the wooden seat in summer he sat he pushed and it goes on one reviewer who loved the book wrote that it would interest those curious about the wars in chechnya not in this much detail please so many loved the book i feel inadequate then i remember this is my review and only my review and i'm entitled to it","1517":"nauseating","1518":" it took me awhile to be fully captured by the story more than it should have really but my lack of familiarity with chechnya and shifting time frame got in the way but even then the characters and beautiful language were satisfying and when it all came together for me i was very moved a favorite quote since i can't figure out how to get to a quotes section on goodreads he was losing her incrementally it might be a few stray hairs listless on the pillow or the crescents of bitten fingernails tossed behind the headboard or a dark shape dissolving in soap as a net is no more than holes tied together they were bonded by what was no longer there arc p 63","1519":"beautiful writing in this book definitely not an easy read because the story jumped back and forth in time sometimes it was a little difficult for me to follow however the author made it easier with the timeline at the beginning of each chapter","1520":" a constellation of vital phenomena is not an easy read for several reasons it jumps back and forth between the past and present there was a level of general learning about the conflict between chechens and russians that needed to happen for me as i read and it is sad it deals with war torture and loss but what a wonderful haunting book about the human spirit i thought the author did an amazing job of setting the reader in a rural chechen village where war has changed everything everyone has suffered personal losses and friends are forced to betray each other i did not know much about the russian invasion of chechnya but i was able to feel connected to the characters' lives because they are so well developed the book is not concerned with the specific politics or combat it is about people and their grief hope friendship charity fear and bravery the characters have depth none is entirely bad or good or predictable my only struggle with the book and it may not be an issue for readers with better memories is that at times it was difficult for me to keep track what was happening or a sequence of events because much of the story is told in flashbacks but that issue really did not affect the impact a constellation of vital phenomena made on me","1521":"hard read about a subject of which i knew very little well written","1522":"well written account of a small village in war torn chechnya the chapters move forward and backward in time so at times i was not sure if an event occurred before or after another event otherwise a haunting tale","1523":" a fascinating and gripping story that you'd think was a dystopian near future story if you know about the wars in chechnya at the end of the soviet union the desolation and loss is palpable in this story that jumps from the end of 2004 back as far as 1994 to tell the story of three people who are linked intricately togehter but they don't know it eight year old havaa watches her father be abducted by chechen rebels and goes to her neighbor and family friend akhmed he is a failed physician who takes her to another town to a mostly abandoned hospital being run by sonya a surgeon and a couple nurses the story jumps back periodically to give us glimpses of their past to see how they all came to be in this devastated place at the same time an excellent but perhaps difficult in terms of subject read highly recommend some choice quotes the sharp pitch of brakes followed by the bullhorn amplified instructions of a russian border guard brought her back to sudden consciousness the soldiers were all fear and peach fuzz who's that the american president sonja said i thought ronald mcdonald was president you can't be serious wasn't it ronald mcdonald who told gorbachev to tear down the wall first ramzan feigned indifference then shouted then pleaded for his father's conversation how could ramzan have known he would miss his father's monosyllabic disapproval how could he have known that he lived in reaction to his father's expectations needed them to know precisely the person he had failed to become s 10 23 14 f 11 16 14 25 days","1524":"hauntingly beautiful simply amazing","1525":"had i known more about the history of chechnya i think i think i would have appreciated this novel more as it stands i found it confusing especially its politics and history the story centers on a girl named havaa whose father dokaa disappears a local friend and doctor akhmed takes havaa to the nearest hospital and asks the surgeon there sophia to hide havaa as the soldiers will surely be coming back for her akhmed who is a a very poor doctor offers to volunteer with sophia in the hospital the book is also about people who betray others those who fight to keep life going and the complicated issues of a war that has gone on for decades it is beautifully written but unfortunately i could not truly appreciate it as its contents were not within my frame of context i look forward to maara's future work and hope that it is on a subject i can relate to more easily","1526":" this was a challenging book for me since i was not familiar with chechnya russian history there were parts of the book i labored through to fully understand what was happening but it was well worth the effort the central story took place over just five days but in between the author managed to go back and forth during a ten year span of wars from 1995 2004 he painted a very vivid picture of how volatile and extremely dangerous chechnya was during this time and its effect on all of the characters in this intriguing book tough subject matter but the writing is superb","1527":"3 5 stars if i could give it parts of this book i loved surprisingly the parts about the 2 physicians were most touching for me i usually don't like books about medicine but some of it was hard for me to get through then again it's about the war in chechnya so i shouldn't have expected a sweet summer read","1528":"wars in chechnya ~ sadness but a book i am glad i read","1529":" this is a perfectly written devastatingly painful novel every page turn was a new heartbreak for the tortured souls of these characters who are grasping at humanity as best they can in the ethnic war zone of chechnya normally i find books with different narrators or different timelines difficult to read on kindle this book however is so perfectly written that despite both different narrators and timelines the chapters flow together seamlessly the author also seems to have an innate understanding of when the pain of one character is too much for the reader to bear any longer and moves on the next character time the way the characters lives are intertwined often without their knowledge has a shockingly genuine feel and somehow provided comfort to me as a reader in a way that i can't explain beautifully and tragically written i highly recommend this novel just make sure that you're in a good emotional state before you pick this one up and don't expect to race through it either","1530":"this was a difficult book to get through i had trouble understanding what was happening but it was reveled little by little chechnya is a god forsaken part of the world but this book made me even more sympathetic to war torn countries","1531":"this is an intense book and gave insight to post ussr time after 1996 this was an era i did not know about so it was quite the times so scary and intense","1532":"a constellation of vital phenomena is so beautifully written a story so well told i fear i would do it an injustice to write another word for my own poor memory however i will note that i so loved marra's glimpses of the future after rereading it for book club i've decided to give it 6 stars","1533":" 39th pick august 2015 ~ chosen by marilyn average rating was 3 8 stars this is the story of six people and what they do and what happens to them in wartime chechnya not an easy read but stick with it it's a book with a great range of characters and themes that generated much discussion main characters sonja akmed natasha havaa khassam ramzan from an interview with the author i was flipping through a medical dictionary and i came across this definition for life it was a 'constellation of vital phenomena ' and the sub entry was organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaption and as life is structured as a constellation of these six phenomena the novel is structured as a constellation of six point of view characters as they run from and search for and collide with and ultimately find one another meeting notes met for lunch on sunday september 6th at nino's of boca raton in attendance pam robin marilyn vicki gisela barbara","1534":"i am ruined to read anything else for a bit deep poignant lovely with the tapestry of intertwining story most deftly thread and not solely with dental floss i will read it again","1535":"for me this was a good read but not an easy read in terms of subject matter the story goes back an forth during the years 1994 through 2004 and gives a small picture of what life was like in chechnya during that time it is an interesting story with much horror and sadness and ultimately some hope","1536":" excellent book not an easy ready for many reasons subject matter and writing style are dense set in war torn chechnya over a 10 year period the author is constantly weaving back and forth so you better pay attention i liked the characters not because they were lovable that's for sure and i found the story to be interesting difficult in many spots but this part of history is something that is not read about often i laughed in several spots and was shocked by others kind of a catch 22 feel definitely book club worthy for the right group","1537":"interesting story that takes place in chechnya but forgettable","1538":"amazing skillful writing tragic story bound together by well woven characters his metaphors and imagery were so unique yet precise loved this","1539":"i was gutted by the hopelessness and the arbitrary culture of fear in chechnya so moved by the writing unusual descriptions and metaphors the history the detail the emotional motivations and backstories of each character without an ounce of melodrama layer upon layer of suffering on a biblical scale i stayed up until 2am reading the last 150 pages because they require close attention and i didn't want to miss a thing without continuity","1540":"while this was an accomplished first novel i think it could have been much better without all the flashbacks and some of the superfluous back story i prefer a linear focused story and there was plenty here to focus on but as with most pedigreed new authors the need to dazzle too often prevails over direct storytelling if told in the fashion in which julie orringer did the invisible bridge i would have given it 5 stars","1541":"superb moving and a horrific depiction of the recent wars in chechnya the heroines are 8 year old havaa dr sonja a brilliant surgeon and her sister natasha heroes are dokka havaa's father ackmed havaa's protector and the most incompetent surgeon sonja has ever met and khassan possibly the father of ackmed i would not have read this if i had realized how grime the scenes of torture and brutal treatment of women were before starting it i would have missed out on the best book i have read in years","1542":"wow powerful book sad and evocative beautifully written every couple of sentences is just a treasure the only reason it was a 4 for me is because it was kind of hard to read the timeline flips back and forth and a lot is talked about in a sort of roundabout literary way but definitely a gem","1543":"considered one of the top 12 books of the 21st century this story of life in chechnya is bleak at best","1544":"this is powerful stuff a beautifully constructed novel time shifts back and forth and with it the lives of what seem to be disparate characters intersect and twine with each other it may take a few chapters to get into this book but the effort is well worth it the writing is amazing how can anyone write so beautifully about something so brutal highly recommended","1545":"basically a perfect book which is not something i say lightly","1546":"beautiful read the stories intertwine and create a wonderful novel highly recommended","1547":"amazing novel set during the chechen wars beautifully written with characters who are now seared into my mind forever","1548":"excellent read beautifully written and a compelling story interesting characters with interestingly interwoven lives and experiences the subject matter is heavy it is set in chechnya after all but ultimately an inspiring book triumph of love and the human spirit and all of that warning that there is some rough language and there are some disturbing images as to be expected in a book set in a war torn country","1549":"i really enjoyed this book the past and the present the view of war from 'their' view i love finding something i thought so foriegn and finding more common soil than foriegn thought life is","1550":"well written and gripping but so gruesome","1551":" i nearly put this one back on the shelf because it had a readers' guide pet peeve along with author photos even as i recognize that both help sell books to people who might not otherwise find them but i'm so glad i didn't every word is perfect and even though i was determined not to cry at the end i did although weirdly enough given its subject matter this is not a depressing book its title comes from a definition of life in a medical dictionary and it engages with the expression persistence and ephemerality of human life in extremity i suppose i should warn you about the very explicit description of an amputation in a field hospital in the first third of the book that will unfortunately stay with me for a while i read a lot of med lit but this one was vivid without being gruesome and filtered through the perception of the non surgeon compelled to perform it which is perhaps why it was so breathtaking as in you feel as though your breath has been taken hostage and you are trapped in a field hospital","1552":" stunningly lyrical and heartbreakingly beautiful it's hard to believe that constellation is marra's debut novel if any subsequent works are half as good his name will be immortalized in short order the beauty of marra's writing puts me in mind of james salter though others may disagree and if this turns out to be marra's only published work a fate to be devoutly prayed against he will take his place with the likes of harper lee in creating a singular work that will be cherished for generations to come if you love the feel and resonance of language and the power of human grace and failure in equal measure you must read this book js","1553":"i really liked this i would recommend it if you liked the book thief and want something more contemporary and challenging but just as heartwrenching taking place in chechnya post war with russia the story of two doctors trying to save an eight year old girl whose father has been disappeared contains heartbreak cynicism love and despair many characters and threads come together and many individual stories are told","1554":"oh the writing in this book is the kind you just want to roll around in it's so magnificent i started out knowing virtually nothing about chechnya so hearing about the horrors of the wars was eye opening this book was terribly sad without being depressing an impressive accomplishment","1555":" this is tough subject matter but it was a fascinating entree into a mostly unfamiliar conflict and region there were more than a few times that i stopped reading to go research more about a particular historical event referenced in the book equally challenging and compelling are the psychological portraits that marra paints characters and events that you come to know from one point of view are then fully fleshed out and expanded from the opposite perspective i found this particularly effective with the character of ramzen my one stylistic quibble is that i did not particularly care for the heavy use of flashforwards so and so would go on to live twenty years before dropping dead of a heart attack i thought it stole the immediacy from some of the storylines the uncertainty that so often in life even when not living in a warzone we don't know how someone's story ends","1556":" i'm not sure i can add anything else that hasn't already been said about this amazing book haunting check breathtaking check-- both literally and figuratively tender check brutal check check and check coincidentally i started this story of how chechnya and russia played ping pong with an ancient country and its people right before flight mh17 was shot down in rebel occupied ukraine so after a slow start this book took on an immediate urgency with me and i dove right in to my embarrassment i had no idea where chechnya was on a map and had to learn quite a bit of russian history to get myself oriented marra doesn't do a good job of giving much back story about the conflicts so if you're not willing to do some extra reading this story could be frustrating confusing history aside constellation is difficult to read on many levels the choppy structure of going back and forth in time is jarring even with the timeline included at the beginning of each chapter i had to reread some passages to puzzle things out which was perfectly fine with me as i found some wonderful writing that i had missed the first time like this \"...she couldn't provide a coherent description of her pain it was like a loose marble tumbling around her insides...\" sigh then there's the torture scenes i think that marra could have exercised restraint here and at times felt he was being gratuitously gruesome naming the place where characters go to \"disappear\" the \"landfill\" was descriptive enough for me i didn't need to have a play by play of what actually went on there this delicate flower had to skip many of these parts but often the most difficult stories deliver the most profound effects this novel is a beautiful gift the characters the heart break and the promise of hope will stick with me as i watch history play games with another eastern european country","1557":" i'm almost at a loss for words i can only say you must read this more than any book in my recent memory this one deposited me into its world and like the characters i will have a hard time leaving it not because i don't want to but because i can't it's haunting to say the least i don't want to give away any plot points like most americans besides the beslan tragedy i don't know anything about the conflict in chechnya it's reasons duration or apparent resolution after reading this account i plan to find out one great thing about this novel marra's author's notes at the end detail his sources and inspiration for the novel i highly recommend reviewing these first like sonja one of the main characters these last pages could really help the reading this is one you may have to read again i plan on it just as soon as i escape long enough to recover","1558":"i loved this novel so much i can't say enough good things","1559":"i think i read it too slowly to appreciate","1560":"i said when i got to book club that i thought the novel was really good really well written but that i wasn't sure if i could say that i liked it exactly what with all the bleakness and desolation that may still be the case i'm not ready to go out and buy a copy to foist on anyone but i do think it's fantastically written and i will be talking it up to other book nerds read more","1561":"i actually listened to this on a library audible book i enjoyed listening but never recall as much the story was about russian soldiers dealing brutally with the people of chechnya during an insurgency the characters included two doctors and a little girl whose father was taken by soldiers disturbing but informative and absorbing","1562":" what a great writer i'm sick that he's so young and talented set during the chechnyan civil war but you don't really need to know anything about its history for this book to be completely captivating it's about the stories of characters we come to know and love regardless of the setting or politics of the situation marra loves his characters even the bad ones in the same way that dickens loves his characters and i think there are definite similarities between the two authors my favorite moment was the page long description of a character's constipation overall a very touching but also funny novel i'll keep an eye out for whatever marra chooses to do next","1563":"i found it a difficult book to get through marra is an excellent writer but the back and forth of time periods wars was confusing at times still he captures well what must be true about czechnya and other war torn countries who experience ethnic conflicts","1564":"a beautifully sad exquisitely written novel that being said this took me over three weeks to finish it requires great patience and an open heart to make room for all of the anguish love despair and back and forth in time can get confusing in this ultimately optimistic and hopeful novel","1565":"beautifully written following a storyline that lyrically drifts back and forth through time linking together the characters in ways you and they don't foresee","1566":"i can't remember when i have read a book so slowly it wasn't a case of not wanting the story to end but instead a deep desire to enter as fully as possible into the characters' lives their suffering their determination and their amazing generosity","1567":"this cultural historically accurate novel uses outstanding descriptive language to transport you to war torn chechnya where you learn of the struggles of a village and it's inhabitants beautifully written","1568":" a constellation of vital phenomena was a random pick for me i have no interest in reading books with doctors and am completely ignorant of the chechen rebellion against russia but i loved the title of the book when i saw it on netgalley and i admitted to myself that medical dictionaries sometimes are poetic in their own way and that fiction with doctors might sometimes be worth reading glad that i did because a constellation was not only worth reading but to me it's the best debut this year so far it also stands above most other fiction some by reputed authors it's a simple enough story set in wartime told with poignancy and realistically marra doesn't concern himself with the politics probably easier to do because he's neither chechen nor russian but concentrates instead on normal people living in the harshest of conditions among them are a doctor sonja rabina returned from london when her counterparts were fleeing the country to search for her missing younger sister natasha natasha herself in a horrifying situation involving trafficking and drug use comes back and leaves again leaving her sister wondering everyday as to what happened to her akhmed a lousy doctor and a doubtful friend still loves a friend's little girl enough to try to keep her safe from the feds who have taken her father away khassan an old man and a weak one the father of an informer who watches his son sell out friend after friend helplessly and the story moves between a time period of 1994 2004 with tantalizing snatches of the years beyond interspersed i like this style and i like that there's not much judgment on marra's part his characters do what they do and they do it because events preceding that have convinced them of their course of action some are characters that shine during crisis some suffer and some make others suffer in other words they're normal human beings it's a hard hitting novel as in it deals with friends betraying friends in a way that could be and probably was real marra's language is powerful evokes the time place and emotions beautifully what i personally loved about this novel was that i knew it was tragic yet i didn't feel manipulated i liked that marra managed to convey horrific scenes poignantly without much ceremony is it russian i'm not sure marra isn't neither does his writing try too hard to sound like a native it's still a beautifully expressed book a constellation of vital phenomena is a glorious debut and i look forward to reading more of this author 5 stars i received a copy of this book for review via netgalley","1569":"this was the best book i read this year","1570":"i cried what a powerful book","1571":"in 2004 akhmed the worst physician in chechnya comes to hospital no 6 in volchanck to volunteer with him is an eight year old girl whose father has just been disappeared by russian troops her house has been burned to the ground and he's wants to trade his services for shelter for her sofia andreyevna rabina the chief and only surgeon and doctor in hospital no 6 is unimpressed with his skills when asked how he would treat an unresponsive patient he replies \"first i would have him fill out a questionnaire \"marra tells a story of five days that goes back decades and occasionally forward almost a century it's filled with truly funny black humor and genuine pathos the constellation of vital phenomena referred to in the title is the beginning of the definition for \"life \" in a soviet medical dictionary death in the novel on the other hand is sometimes as erratic as a land mine and sometimes as regular as an informer turning in his next victim this book is a skillfully constructed and extremely moving paean to life in the midst of random and reoccurring death during the two civil wars in chechnya whitaker uses excellent russian accented english for the chechen voices english and scots accents for the brits and american accent for the narration","1572":"i know a book about the wars in chechnya might not seem like something you want to dive into but believe me this is a book that won my heart from the get go the main characters sonja an ethnic russian heroic and overworked doctor returned to her country from england ahmed the self proclaimed worst doctor in chechnya and portrait artist of the dead and disappeared and havaa an orphaned six year old with a blue suitcase filled with the souvenirs of refugees fleeing chechnya to save their lives are all still with me weeks after finishing this astounding novel the devastated chechnyan countryside and the ruined capital grozny are haunted by all those who have left or died i felt this nation's sorrow but couldn't turn away because the beauty of this astounding young author's prose and ability to touch my heart in a way few novels do anymore if you are a fan of birds without wings or just love a masterful piece of unforgettable fiction i highly recommend this book you will never forget it","1573":"not an easy read but this complex story of how a few lives are entertwined and illuminated by sacrifial love in war torn chechnya has a certain beautiful truth","1574":"great book loved the characters and the way the story unfolded","1575":"stunning disturbing brutal well written story of chechnian refugees during 1990s to 2005","1576":"teared up at the end not as much as during the eggers' book what is the what but powerful refugee war story nonetheless","1577":"i really wanted to like this book and it seemed like the kind of book i love but it kind of left me flat and wanting more","1578":"i would give this a 4 1 2 star it can be challenging to finish this book about a difficult subject but i definitely recommend a constellation of vital phenomena it was hard to read at times but i'm glad i did a constellation of vital phenomena is a beautifully written but heartbreaking book about chechnya in the 20 years between 1994 and 2004 there are several sets of main characters two sisters a child and her father's best friend that man and his sick wife an elderly man and his son that cross over into relationships with other characters the character development is good the dialog is believable the descriptions of life in chechnya and of the choices real people living there had to make can be very hard to read but this is a beautiful book if you can deal with those realities the book contains great moments of despair and hope the plot does relies on coincidence although most of the coincidences are not revealed until the book's final chapters the author jumps around in time but a helpful timeline appears at the beginning of each chapter this is not a book to be read in small pieces you need to dedicate time to it as there is a lot of information and facts to keep together a constellation of vital phenomena will make you consider many issues what it means to be family the importance of home how ordinary people survive and make decisions in terrible circumstances","1579":"the writing is particularly beautiful at times and is set in a place and history that i really never knew anything of chechnya'n wars however i haven't reached any grand conclusions of the books wonderfulness i can't say i entirely enjoyed reading it i didn't like the language in it either way to many f words amongst others i am hoping to like it more with more thought and discussion with others","1580":"a brilliant first novel set in chechnya during conflict with russia and internal wars haava is an 8 year old girl whose dad has been taken by the soldiers she hid in the woods a neighbor an incompetent doctor takes her to a ruin of a hospital where a lone doctor a russian woman looking for her sister who has disappeared is trying to provide care amidst the chaos the story of what happens to the three of them is compelling and heartbreaking","1581":" after ann patchett's raving recommendation of this book at last year's wnba award presentation i was curious although it's not a book i'd normally pick up luckily it was also a great group reads pick so my wnba book club read it and it was still not my cup of tea i found it slow going with a lot of characters to keep track of in a place i was unfamiliar with chechnya and with two time frames at times i was tempted to put the book down but i didn't particularly dislike it and i was assured that it all comes together in the end and it does there's an 8 year old girl havaa who runs to the woods when her father is abducted by russian soldiers who also burn down her house neighbor akhmed finds havaa and takes her to the one person he knows of outside their small town who might be able to keep havaa safe sonja a doctor akhmed also went to medical school although he is a terrible doctor but he starts to work alongside sonja amputating limbs in order to gain her trust so she will take havaa sonja is worried about her missing sister natasha and thinks she might have come through havaa and akhmed's town at some point as a refugee while i didn't love the book i'm glad i stuck with it and it does improve considerably when you finally see where everything was headed it turns out i really didn't have to worry about the two time lines as it's not crucial when they each are and they merge together at the end i found a couple of scenes very funny such as when akhmed and sonja discuss what they know of american politics and i wished there were more of those but it is hard to find humor in a war zone it was a great discussion book as we all had questions and there were a lot of decisions we could debate and choices that were questionable the characters were very well drawn with even minor ones being fully developed and i could visualize the setting it was described so well i am not a visual reader and rarely picture what i'm reading overall i liked it okay but i wasn't blown away by it like other readers","1582":"goodness i am so far smitten with by this book","1583":"a really impressive debut i often read these buzz y first novels by young authors because i like to keep an eye on my competition observed the competition is better than me and usually can at least salvage some sense of smug superiority by the time i finish not so here constellation of vital phenomena the definition for life found in a russian medical dictionary by one of the book's characters follows a cast of tragic memorable characters all trying desperately to survive and hold onto the remaining scraps of humanity in the terribly inhumane atmosphere of wartime chechnya over a decade their lives intersect in the most unexpected ways at certain points in this novel you can tell that marra is a young inexperienced writer but i feel he is a real talent worthy of the buzz","1584":"a stunning debut novel based on the horrors of the wars in chechnya those who survived those who didn't and the glimmer of hope for the future in a country occupied for centuries","1585":"this book i think captures the voices and atmosphere of the way of life and the fear of death in russia the voices are so true to life that i can hear them speaking in my head as i read this book i did find the story line hard to follow though the continuity seemed to jump around and i had trouble keeping track of the timing of events an incredible story about how vulnerable people are and how strong they try to be in face of adversity","1586":"breathtaking so beautifully written this novel is going to stay with me for a long time i had already called my book of 2015 but now i'm going to have to reassess this novel requires patience and patience will be rewarded if you see it through","1587":"i read this book because of a recommendation from books on the nightstand's michael kingman who described it as clutch worthy meaning that when you've finished the book it's effect on you causes you to clutch it to your chest and savor it just a bit more and in a physical sense to add to his description i found this book to be just so i cared about the characters and their fates and though the setting and details of the story were often grim the narrative continued to draw me forward at a steady and absorbing pace i finished the book glad i'd read it and maybe even looking toward reading what the author will write next","1588":"a beautifully written moving story of life in wartime chechnya","1589":"this is a searing book about life and death during the chechen wars i found it painful to read yet difficult to put down it is not a happy book but these were not happy times do not go into this looking for a light hearted read prepare to cry that being said it is an important look at a time place and people that should not be forgotten","1590":"i believe this is a first novel and what a surprise it is beautiful prose richly detailed scenes you are instantly there in the bleak unrelenting unrepenting world of chechnya wartime heartbreaking yet oddly uplifting this is one tremendous piece of work","1591":"beautifully written gripping in moving you to this period in time","1592":"this was a wonderful book the story was engrossing and moving even though it was sometimes tough to read about the incredible suffering of the people in chechnya it wasn't completely depressing though the characters find solace in humor love art and a strong sense of belonging to their homeland and their ancestors","1593":"moments of stark beauty amidst the bleakness and despair of war","1594":"sometimes it was like studying for a test in a history class that i didn't take most of the time it was harsh vulgar depressing lacking any semblance of humanity and generally not the kind of book i would ever ever read but then a passage a paragraph maybe even a page so exquisitely crafted it would leave me hungering for more","1595":"it has been a long time since i have loved a character like i love akhmed the book was not an easy read but was so beautiful it opened my eyes to a world so foreign to me and so heartbreaking that i feel hope that my soul has expanded","1596":"tough read but really really good","1597":"wow this is my first contemporary book on russian chechnya history and it was very well written it's a brutal story about humanity and the lengths we will go to protect the innocent but also a well done look at how people are connected with each other even when they do not realize the connections are there","1598":"a brutal yet beautiful book the author turns a phrase with the very best and the story was gripping","1599":" i could not wait for this book to end after hoping and wishing for over 200 pages that i would start to like it 1 the author set up the structure of this novel as a 5 day story but it was full of so many flashbacks i lost track of what was happening when i re read chapters constantly just to try to place the characters and timing to no avail 2 havaa needed to be developed what the hell was she doing for the 5 days she was in the hospital is she really a completely emotionless blob 3 the author's magic 8 ball technique was annoying he would be wearing that sweater two and a half years later and sonja couldn't imagine then that one calm morning eight and a half years away after her sister had disappeared for a second time and in eighteen years his oldest brother a geologist would bury what remained of akim's potrait and in four months when cleaning out a file cabinet she would find and another ten would pass before she acted on it three after that she would die of throat cancer but not before falling in love with her oncologist i got so tired of this fortune telling that occurred ad nauseum 4 in 4 days sonja goes from despising akhmed to having sex with him wtf","1600":"this is a book that i should put on a re read list it is beautifully written and i tried to slow down my reading in order to absorb all of the details but feel that i missed some of the story","1601":"beautifully written loved the story and the characters thanks sarah for recommending it definitely one of the best books i'll read this year","1602":"i got about halfway through this book and then decided not to finish it the writing is very good but the story just felt too depressing and i had a feeling the ending was going to be a sad one after giving up on it and reading some reviews i think that was probably right","1603":"remember the old chekhov maxim remove everything that has no relevance to the story if you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off if it's not going to be fired it shouldn't be hanging there of course this is the old perhaps outmoded way of writing literature a way that has saturated into tv and hollywood that it's become natural to us i generally feel modern lit should eschew the chekhov maxim and capture the untidiness of life itself marra masterfully combines and old school tight narrative with high literature's keen sense of character and gift for language it's quite the accomplishment this book reminds me the novel may be a better vehicle for empathizing with the victims of semi obscure modern conflicts around the world than reportage ever can fiction can get at the real better than the real itself or its direct representation can in simpler terms it's a page turner that would make you care about its characters in a largely forgotten wrinkle of the planet","1604":" this is a must read immediately i've had it on my radar for a while but if i knew what i was in for i would have pre ordered it and started it the day it arrived the story is sweeping the themes dark the characters heart wrenching the action unpredictable and the suspense perpetual there are so many mysteries within the story interwoven with each of the characters and the reveals come throughout right up to the end and so i'm going to hold off elaborating too much for fear of ruining some of the masterful threads that marra spins but the answers are all there by the end all of the balls marra is juggling throughout land firmly in our hands the story takes place in chechnya mainly over five days in 2004 as the second chechen war rages but interspersed chapters jump back to 1994 as the first chechen war begins amidst the fall of the ussr and there are countless flashbacks flashforwards of different lengths in each section making for an incredibly detailed and complete story and the revelations come perfectly timed keeping adding relieving suspense masterfully part of what i found so compelling was just the light shown a conflict and region i nor most americans i suspect know nothing about even more shocking is how familiar the conflict seemed compared with what i am familiar with - nazis north korea stalin and countless other regimes of terror - and i was left wondering why knowledge of this conflict hasn't been spread wider the first sentence begins with the night a man disappears and without giving away too many specifics most of the action revolves around the nature of disappearances in the regions the trucks that come in the middle of the night the fear and secrecy with which people live the informants who give names regardless of relations or ties the struggle for survival in a country with food shortages scare if any electricity or phone service no knowledge of the outside world one incredible gag has a main character asking who ronald mcdonald is if not the president of the us and torture and more waiting for anyone who dares go against the state i thought while reading the orphan master's son that it was like reading 1984 but about a modern and real regime - the same goes here but accompanying all the fear and terror is the mission of two doctors one struggling to keep a hospital running all by herself and the other a completely incompetent small town physician who joins on the do what they can with what they have trying to save help hide find and hold on to what is dear and what is necessary under incredible personal risk we follow characters who fight to do the right thing and discover the truth i repeatedly listened to the decemberists new cd \"what a terrible world what a beautiful world \" having just arrived in the mail while reading and what an applicable thought to accompany this other work - everything in this book portrays the hope and the horror the pain and the joy and sadness and the relief the love and the fear that is human life all set against a backdrop of war","1605":"this story is about so much more than the description definitely tough to read at points but worth the heartache","1606":"this book is phenomenal i loved loved loved it so many gorgeous turns of phrase such a powerful story please read it","1607":"a dark gorgeously written novel about life in chechnya the title comes from the definition of life and the novel explores the lives of various people from an 8 year old to the only doctor in a hospital trying to save people in war time to an elderly author marra gives great depth to the pain and history of the characters and region","1608":"i tried to read it but i'd have to say it was not the best book i've read all year i guess i am a bit young to read this that's probably why i liked haava and sonja it was really hard to follow when the dates changed but i thought that timeline on each page of the start of every chapter was clever and helpful this book made me want to reaserch the chechnya history","1609":"beautiful and tragic about a part of the world i know little chechnya quirky characters part mystery and filled with humanity and dignity not a quick read but worthwhile","1610":"wonderfully sad and touching book the author is very adept for a first time novelist at characterization but describing emotional reaction seems his real forte nice to read a well written novel where even the hated character is a fully realized human","1611":" towards the end of this amazing read khassan sits by his sleeping son ramzan in a scene reminiscent of abraham taking his son isaac to the mountain top to be killed when khassan recalls his own words to his friend akhmed you are nothing without love and pride and family the wars in chechnya had deeply challenged each of these indeed the cruelty and brutality were at times so gruesome that it was difficult to read and imagine but as r frost says in his poem othe onset winter death has never tried the earth but it has failed in the end love pride and family not only prevail but transcend this is an astounding first novel the poetic language and his story telling in a way that events initially mentioned come into focus much later in the novel make this a very rewarding although demanding read","1612":"i absolutely loved this book it's beautiful heartbreaking and yet still quite hopeful it covers so much ground skipping between the past and present effortlessly while still going deep into the lives loves and loss of a small cast of characters in one village the author skillfully weaves in a glimpse into the future of every character no matter how small a part they play in the larger narrative i've never known much about the chechen wars but this book really made me want to learn more i'm also hooked on the author amazing for a first book thanks cynbad for the inspiration","1613":"oh how i wanted to love this book instead a found it tedious and very convoluted the timeline confused me and the story did little to help me truly understand the chechen wars it took me forever to get through which added to my confusion because in taking days off from reading i was more lost i constantly found my mind wandering though there were certain beautiful sentences that made me think i was missing something the reviews are amazing i wonder if it was my mood","1614":" given that i do not possess even a tiny shred of the gift that anthony marra has for the written word i'm at a loss for the words to convey a fitting review for his debut novel i've already used all the great adjectives to review other novels i've read and those pale in comparison so i'll just skip the overused adjectives for this review this is the kind of book that makes me want to change some of my other 5 star reads simply because they can't be rated that high when compared with this masterpiece","1615":"first and foremost this is just a beautifully written book i will be looking forward to more books from anthony marra there is one main story about saving a young girl after her father's abduction by the feds and the two doctors who hide her the book also provides the back story chechnya many many years before the occurrances in the main story at the same time as he exposes the grit and heartbreak mr marra brilliantly provides glimpses of the hope of healing for the country and many of the characters it really is as michael kindness of books on the nightstand said a clutchable book i just wanted to hold this book after i finished reading it thank you anthony marra","1616":"a beautifully written story complex characters i want to write more about it but don't know where to start you will love this book a review in entertainment weekly http www ew com ew article 0 20696 while marra doesn't shy away from the very real conflict of the region whether describing the scene outside sonja's hospital--the wall less rooms the massive craters the rubble--or the paranoia that exists when your neighbor is very often your enemy this novel full of humanity and hope ultimately leaves you uplifted constellation deserves to be on the short list for every major award marra brings the wisdom of someone so much older than his 29 years to his first novel it's an absolute masterpiece and i can't wait to see what's next for this extraordinarily talented young author","1617":"an interesting story but very long winded and sometimes hard to follow i found myself skimming just to get to the end","1618":"chechnya starts to make sense after reading this","1619":"90 pages in and i am quitting i have too many books to read to continue with something that i can't get into difficult to follow","1620":" incredible and authoritative first work of fiction by american author anthony marra i did not want to like this book thinking it pretentious for an american to get inside the politics psychology and personalities of the genocide in chechnya but marra maintains tight control of the historical context and gives life to each participant of a group of connected citizens during a time of betrayals disappearances and grueling brutalities that are touchingly and effectively matched by their struggles to stay human constructed in a choreography that transcends chronological time this confluence of narratives remains gripping to the final words can't recommend this highly enough but be prepared for graphic and shocking moments of violence","1621":" gritty dark a sad glimpse into man's depravity and desperation the book could almost be read as dystopian fiction if it was not instead a fictional account of a handful of men women and children during the russia chechnya conflict in the 90s and 2000s i love that there are no wholly good or bad characters just different shades and degrees of both selflessness and selfishness reminds me of romans 3 12 all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one 4 5 stars","1622":" this is a well researched novel about the wars in chechnya there are some beautiful sentences in there and a lot of people loved this book i wasn't one of them however the plotting just dragged for me halfway through i wished i hadn't come so far so that i could justify giving up which i didn't and the ending was good but the middle i just couldn't stand it jumps between characters' points of view and across time pretty successfully but i just didn't like some of the characters and was bored by their backstory oh well 2 1 2 stars the obvious talent of the writer bumped it up plot alone would be 2 stars","1623":"amazing book this is why we read fiction chechnya has a very long history marra makes you understand the history via his characters","1624":"thought provoking","1625":"at first i thought this book would be too depressing to read i was wrong it is a well crafted story that brings to light a small town in chechnya during the 1994 2004 still under rebel attack the villagers live with limited power water and food they are just trying to survive akhmed finds himself with his close friend and neighbor's daughter whom he tries to find a way to keep alive as the fed's are looking for her","1626":"rating 4 5 of fiveit took several starts and stops to finally sit down and read this book about victims of war even though the book takes place during 5 days a ten year timeline starts each chapter there are many flashbacks and many glimpses into the future which could be a confusing at times to the reader however anthony marra explains why he chose this unique writing style war breaks cities buildings and families but also time and the way stories are constructed all the characters in the book are trying to piece back their fragmented lives and i wanted to embody that in the novel's structure he is telling what feels like a very real story set in chechnya denver post","1627":"so dreadful to think that we never learn from our mistakes and these atrocities are still happening in the world this novel is bleak and a little melodramatic at times however the final message is one of hope which i liked well written with some lovely turns of phrase and a pleasure to read i enjoyed both the characters and the clever way that their lives were woven together i am well and truly ready for something cheerful","1628":"this was a difficult and slow read for me another reviewer mentioned having similar feelings about this and the kite runner to me the similarities are being immersed in a world and culture devastatingly different from our own and which we most likely knew little about the characters in this story all are suffering from a lifetime of war and conflict the storytelling at times i found confusing but it was still a profoundly moving story","1629":"chechnya 1994 2004 i got to p 118 of the large print edition thought it was fairly interesting but stopped reading when they started doing amputations on landmine victims just not up to reading those descriptions right now","1630":"a difficult read but what a story of recent chechen history brilliant","1631":"brilliant i'm in awe of the storytelling and the writing it's an unflinching portrayal of the horrors of the two recent wars in chechnya something i admittedly knew almost nothing about and as such not for the faint of heart very tough to read at times but the characters and the amazing narrative devices brought me along every time","1632":"only got to page 136 not that i was counting it was a chore to read this book too many other books waiting on my bedside table that i can't wait to enjoy","1633":"sad but we'll written haunting","1634":"due to the setting of this book and my unfamiliarity with some of the events that took place in russia during this time period i had some difficulty reading the book and fully understanding it i found myself rereading some excerpts to give me a better sense of what was going on that is not necessarily a bad thing as i like to be challenged a bit when i read the characters were fairly well developed although i found myself getting some of them mixed up from time to time i especially enjoyed akhmed and sonja if it had not been for the ending of the book i would have given it 3 stars but i absolutely loved the ending it really brought it all together for me this book is definitely worth reading","1635":"unforgettable powerful and incredibly moving though i found that the overall plot of this masterful work does move slowly this book is less about the plot than it is about exquisitely detailed character development and a masterful depiction of how the tumultuous turns of life a constellation of vital phenomena link together inextricably the lives of so many in a complex web of compassion betrayal sacrifice shame and hope the story moves fluidly across a timeline from 1994 to 2004 and depicts the lives of characters struggling between their desires for self preservation and their desires to aspire to something greater the fateful events of the first and second chechen wars shape and scar mr marra's characters as he weaves their lives together in a heartbreakingly beautiful way i had embarrassingly little background knowledge regarding the chechen conflicts and the suffering of its people though i think a greater background knowledge and historical understanding might have given me a greater appreciation from the start of the hardships of the characters involved in the book mr marra does a fine job of exacting in minute detail no less the pain and agony that the conflicts inflicted on the people in chechnya he brings to life in a way that is often too close for comfort imagined characters representative of real people who lived suffered loved and died at the hands of and alongside their fellow men and he simultaneously paints a beautiful picture of how our lives subtly touch and indelibly mark one another for better or for worse a truly wonderful read","1636":"told in a nonlinear format but the year was circled in the chapter headings so you at least knew the basics of where you were this was a story of lives intertwined in chechnya from the 1990s into 2004 think love actually but set in the horrors of ethnic cleansing and bombings cheerful hey the non linearity made discovering the connections more interesting to the reader but they did so at the cost of general knowledge as to what was going on i spent most of the novel confused yet it was a story told in about a place that i don't understand not even a bit and that itself was an education broccoli for the mind if you will i did enjoy it but all i could think as i went through the book is my next read will be consummately fluffy","1637":"devastating and beautiful and terrible and wonderful","1638":" if you desire a glimpse at the first and second wars between chechnya and the russian federation look no further marra has done an excellent job of research in order to portray chechen culture a selection akhmed smiled sadly and trudged forward balling his fists in his coat sleeves the coat was fifty eight years old canvas military grade about the only thing the red army had ever done right it kept him as warm as it had kept his father and his father and his father's father and the idea of three generations sheltered by the same stiff unyielding fabric gave him greater comfort than the coat itself ever could this may seem to be a strange choice but i chose it for the following reasons a the obvious a taste of the author's style of writingb the reader gets a sense of history each generation faces similar problems while donning the same coat the same enemy with the same consequences c the lack of hope in fact doom encompasses akhmed that is found in books like george orwell's 1984 although i wouldn't call this book gloomy i don't think it exactly offers hope that things will end any differently for its current generation than it did for their forefathers i will leave it up to future readers to determine for themselves how they would classify the ending a couple of things disappointed me as far as i can tell the author never visited chechnya and i did find myself confused at times with the flipping back and forth during the timeline of events neither are serious offenses as the author did his research brilliantly and the year of occurrence is noted at the beginning of the chapter allowing for flipping back to refresh one's memory recommended for all around the world readers4 constellationsthank you jeanette for recommending more blog reviews","1639":"fascinating well written tale engrossing main characters are well developed i learned a great deal about chechnya's history and the efforts of chechens to survive the deprivation and the scourges of the many wars and ethnic cleansings","1640":"powerful this one will stay with me for a long time","1641":" beautiful 5 s this book is everything u0026amp more that others have said so i will just add that in one interview the author talks about striving toward a tall order of having readers laugh u0026amp cry on the same page well mr marra achieved that countless times throughout the novel i was amazed that i found the story to be both brutal u0026amp sorrowful while at the same time heartwarming u0026amp uplifting through his unforgettable writing style he achieved the affect of witnessing the characters try to put the pieces of their lives back together through the patch worked chronology and glimpses of memories and futures he wove in throughout the novel i will not forget this book u0026amp will want to reread parts again u0026amp again just to have that beautiful prose wash over me and remind me of what humanity is all about","1642":"no one deserves peace more than an innocent child and i feel there cannot be a more apt time to say this imagine being a little child born and growing up in the middle of a war when each day of your life is marked with death or disappearances of familiar faces imagine a father who has to teach his six year old daughter how to load and aim a gun for her own protection at an age when he should actually be teaching her how to fly a kite or a lone surgeon of the only standing hospital in a war torn city whose daily activity includes performing amputations or the village doctor a better artist than a doctor who makes portraits of the people who went missing during the war and leaves them for their relatives to find often the only memorials they might ever get these are a few characters of this novel which broke my heart and yet managed to put the pieces back together by the time i finished reading it havaa in hindi means air and while it is unlikely that dokka thought of the hindi meaning while he named his daughter that is how i perceived the child she is like a delicate breeze gentle but strong enough to blow away the veil of indifference that the cold surgeon sonja had built upon herself she loses her mother to death and her beloved father is taken away by the federal forces while she has to run away to avoid capture ending up in the reluctant care of the surgeon sonja despite having seen all this the child still carries an air of innocence around her that endears her to the reader greatly while the mood of the novel is predominantly sad it also shows how in the gravest of times hope can be found in the most tender of feelings like love kindness or the innocence of a child anthony marra's writing is beautiful and i am quite surprised to find out that this is his debut novel before reading this book chechnya was just a name i vaguely remembered seeing in newspaper headlines when i was still a child i did not know where exactly it was nor had any inkling of its history however this never was a problem to me to enjoy the novel at any point war after all is a universal phenomenon and the way it tears human lives apart cannot be very different anywhere in the world","1643":"so intense it was hard to put down and hard to go to sleep upon finishing","1644":"this book is beautifully and passionately written and the information about the persecution of chechnya it provides needs to be a lot more widely known and understood here in the west it is also loaded with truly mordant and bitter wit and humor i wish i could give it five stars as i do recommend it but i found it a frustrating and at times unnecessarily dramatic book too surely when the subject is mass persecution including torture and murder there isn't a need to add more to keep our interest i have the same problem with over the top literary handling of the almost unimaginable genocides of the earlier 20th century this book however piles on the soap opera including mysteriously disabled wives adultery secret parenthood sexual slavery extraordinary artistic endeavors and more i'd add that although almost nothing can be said in defense of the russian abuse of chechens i found the book's portrayal of all rebels as suffering heroes and all russians as brutish idiots more than a little cartoonish my final criticism of this book is that some of it seems needlessly obscure i wouldn't complain about this normally but mara says in an afterward that his story revolves around two stories common to christianity and islam uh no the first about a father's sacrifice of his son i e abraham isaac actually is never presented though repeatedly raised in the book rather the ongoing theme is parental neglect of children i have to say too the caring engaged parents fathers are actually far more prevalent in this book the second story which mara says is about an orphan raised by her family's executioners is also barely presented in the book except as an epilogue and i don't see how the character who does the upbringing shares anything with the destroyer of the child's original family than ethnic identity anyway what is this famous second bible story moses being raised by pharaoh's daughter that well known story is very hard to detect in this book","1645":"anyone who follows my reviews would know that i rarely ever give books 5 stars but this one deserved it it was excellent it's both sad and beautiful and marra's prose is impeccable the story weaves itself together perfectly and presents a portrait of different types of people during the chechen wars i loved sonja and ended up casting her in my mind as stana katic so then i loved her even more lol this is definitely a sad book though it has a relatively happy ending this is marra's first novel and i'll be waiting to see what else he does in the future","1646":"gorgeous and spellbinding book detailing separate lives that connect during wartime in chechnya i had a hard time getting through it because it was the start of the school year unfortunately but i finally did and loved it","1647":"beautiful and haunting the pain dislocation and devastation of war haunted the characters in this book which at times made it difficult to read but the writing was so beautiful i enjoyed how the author summed up the lives of some key characters and some minor characters letting you see beyond their current circumstances","1648":"very sad but ironically hopeful for me the book is about the idea that life ultimately goes on even amidst unrelenting cruelty and tragedy","1649":"this is an excellent book but i found it depressing to read about so much human suffering","1650":"this book was slow and discombobulated until about half way or even two thirds through and then it got awesome the characters made beautiful sense finally and the ending was so well written loved loved loved the ending but only gave 3 stars because it was so tough going for so long","1651":" beautifully written marra's debut novel about the ethnic russians and the chechen muslims is outstanding and haunting while his research is vast the character compassion suffering understanding and empathy marra adds to his story is unusual for someone his age the lives of havaa dokka khassan ramzan and akhmed are intricately twined and bound by the power of love my favorite quote from the book is you are mine i recognize you we twist our souls around each other's miseries it is that which makes us family","1652":"haunting and grim but artfully told stories that live with me still even though i just finished i want more","1653":"this book broke my heart it is one of the most beautifully written stories i've ever read i will read and reread and reread this book for years to come if this book were a play it would get thunderous standing ovations every night","1654":"i am having a tough time getting through this book despite all the great reviews","1655":"a tough book to read in the genre of horrible things human beings can do to each other but nonetheless elegantly crafted and beautifully written no one or two dimensional characters here the main characters are complex and even side players with cameo appearances have full lives and personalities described with economy there are witty turns of phrase such as then brezhnev grabbed the wheel of power and captained the country with the exploratory heart of a municipal bus driver and there are beautiful turns of phrase such as her father was the face of her morning and night he was everything so saturating havaa's world that she could no more describe him than she could the air there are extended scenes of cruelty and depravity which are hard to read but eloquently rendered and there are also rays of hope scattered throughout this book gave me a lot to think about and i expect it will stay with me for a while","1656":"a very sad beautiful book interesting pov and management of time plus a wonderful story great characters and a fascinating period of history","1657":"a stirring heartbreaking and hauntingly beautiful story of war families and hope this narrative opened my eyes to a piece of the world that i knew little to nothing about chechnya marra researched non fiction reports and first hand accounts from the area and used them to build this magnificent story at times shocking at other times striking in it's compassion and humanity this is a story that tolls heavy on your heart and makes you think about every page before you turn to the next","1658":"the book at the beginning was very confusing as its time line constantly moves back and forth the title was a puzzle until about the middle when natasha is reading her sister's old soviet medical dictionary which defines life as \"a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" all of these phenomena are witnessed in this novel's portrayal of life in war torn chechnya between 1994 and 2004 then everything begins to make sense while the topic is very heavy because of anthony marra's beautiful writing you can ultimately get a glimmer of hope for the future","1659":"loved this book beautifully written loved the complex characters and the way their stories unfolded with a touch of humor and irony reminded me a little of catch 22 timeline was a little confusing at first but came together","1660":"wow it's so worth sticking with it through some difficult historical and character background sections beautifully written","1661":" once again books on the nightstand recommended an amazing book this one is marra's debut novel and i'm just jealous it's so beautifully written so uniquely constructed that it feels like an old soul wrote this i can't wait to read more of his work we are in chechnya and while technically we focus on a few characters the lives of the characters are rich enough to pull others into their orbit and we learn about them as well eight year old havaa manages to escape to the woods while russian soldiers abduct her dad it's called disappearing and is frightfully common she teams up with family friend akhmed who is a pretty poor doctor but a wonderful artist he squirrels her away to a hospital to stay in hiding with a doctor named sonja while the present day story that encompasses the above characters takes place within a week we move back and forth between past and present for natasha sonja's missing sister for khassan and ramzan neighbors of akhmed who turn out to have a heavy hand in his fate for dokka havaa's father each chapter has a timeline at the top so you won't get lost in the past the book is beautiful and heartbreaking and inspiring i did not know the extent of the war in russia and what it did to the people who were left behind it's devastating and you want the characters to triumph marra lists many books in the back that give more info on the war and chechnya i see extra reading on the horizon","1662":"reminded me of city of thieves so sad so horrifying but with human connections that were lovely","1663":" i'm a total hogarth fangirl now having first fallen in love with i am forbidden and then the headmaster's wager set in a small town in the chechan republic the novel takes place over five days shifting from 'present' 2004 back to 1994 the time jumps are beautiful noted at the start of each chapter with this timeline the year in question bolded the five days in question the frame of the book refer to the time spent at a nearly abandoned hospital by akhmed an incompetent village doctor and havaa the 8 year old daughter of his neighbor orphaned after federal police seized her father and burned her house desperate to save her akhmed drags her to the city hospital at one point in the book he realizes it is the first life he's saved as a doctor there they meet sonja and her crazy nurse sonja paralysed with guilt and fear over her sister natasha missing again after being a victim of sex trafficking works automaton like numbness at the hospital amputating limbs with quick practice and dealing with gangsters to resupply the hospital every night akhmed returns home to care for his invalid wife living in fear of his neighbor ramzan who is a snitch for the police ramzan is the reason havaa and her father were turned in to the police while nurturing a friendship with khassan ramzan's historian father who has taken to ignoring his son as punishment for his betrayals chechnya a region in russia perhaps only vaguely familiar to americans in the last decade is now increasingly familiar due to the boston marathon bombings i will admit to some i don't know how to describe it some shaky unease reading about chechan landmines and amputations when i've been reading about bombs and amputations here marra's writing is gorgeous not quite poetry not simple statement and as a result whatever he articulates be it a broken heart or severed limb reads achingly real which isn't to say it's all lofty philosophy there are some literally stomach turning had to put the book down and walk away graphic or grotesque moments like the aforementioned amputation scene that said i couldn't stop reading or wanting to read this book and marra's inclusion of such violence emphasizes the unstable destruction of the area the unceasing horror these characters live with much like the old medical text that inspired the title the characters are all points on a constellation connected and separate i finished this book unwilling to start another still working at the story in my mind","1664":"a little confusing at first since i didn't know much about chechnya but the ending blew me away read this book","1665":" this book was hard to read emotionally not having any idea what the book was about i wasn't ready for that however i learned a lot about the wars in chechnya which i can't say i knew much about the writing was lovely i particularly liked marra's use of glimpses into the future it was satisfying to know what would become of the characters that marra gets you so emotionally invested in and striking to know what would become of the lesser characters who didn't matter quite as much through all of the sad endings i was still left with a sense of hope and rightness so that i wasn't left wishing for the main characters at the conclusion my heart aches knowing that this is not just fiction","1666":" it's likely i would have rated this book a full five stars if i hadn't read it at the end of a busy semester i'm not sure how much brain power i had left to lend it and i'd definitely say that being woefully uninformed about the chechen wars did nothing to help my focus and keeping track of the timeline was a bit of a challenge for me still there's no arguing that the characters are rich the writing superb heartbreaking one gets the feeling this is an important book about an important time and it will be part of our conversation for years to come","1667":"a complex narrative told from the perspectives of six interconnected characters during the chechen wars the historical context is integral not merely backdrop and saving the life of a young girl emerges as the central dilemma all but the most sympathetic make severe moral compromises in order to survive or resort as with the tough surgeon sonya to the basest means to reach a greater good profound and moving and yet with heart breaking poignant warm and even humorous moments that are rendered in wonderfully precise prose a first novel it reads like it is coming from the deep memory of someone who has lived many years and experienced a lot","1668":"heavy and deep beautifully written need i say more","1669":"this is the first novel i have read that is set in chechnya it isn't a \"comfortable\" novel to read because the setting is war torn chechnya the author presents informative historical information throughout his story the author tells an unforgettable story on the horrors of war and how it changes those who survive warning this book is not a bedtime story","1670":" interesting to read a story set during the wars in chechnya in the last 30 years all of this took place during my lifetime but in a completely different world i found the repetitive writing and lists of things irritating at times but not the 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th i listened to it on audio book so i couldn't just scan ahead maybe it wouldn't have been so irritating if i could just scan it still a neat little package of a book everything wrapped up nicely maybe too nicely for some but i didn't mind closure feels good","1671":"set in war torn chechnya the novel weaves together the lives of 8 year old havaa who is found abandoned in a forest after her father is siezed from their home her neighbor akhmed who finds havaa and sonja a doctor at the nearby hospital where akhmed brings havaa in the hopes she'll have a fighting chance in these desolate times i was wowed as the novel came together i initially wasn't so sure i would be able to follow the events given my unfamiliarity with russian history but the story transcends the historical details in favor of the human element it's hard to believe this is a debut novel from marra in short its just very very good","1672":"loved it","1673":" you know my favorite books examine the fine balance between hope and despair best presented in my favorite book of all time a fine balance this book does the same but instead of india it's chechnya if we are to believe this novel the balance between hope and despair in chechnya is hugely on the side of despair this novel is brutally violent there is a little hope and a little humanity but not much and it survives at great cost there is love but it rarely triumphs all i could think about after finishing the book was the chechen born boston marathon bombers it wasn't that i thought they had a reason for what they did but that if this book is accurate their environment likely removed all reason and value of human life from their thinking","1674":" i picked this up randomly while walking past my bookshelf last week i had purchased it some time ago on the basis of the many fantastic reviews i had read but hadn't gotten around to reading it i'm pleased to note that the reviews were well deserved it tells the interwoven stories of a number of people in a small town in chechnya and a doctor in a nearby city bouncing back and forth between the first and second chechnyan war events and a setting that i admittedly know little about the book starts when a man helps a little girl escape from the forest where she's hiding her house has just gone up in flames and her father has been disappeared the man helps the girl escape to the city to the doctor at the hospital a woman he only knows by name the story itself then moves back and forth in time slowly linking each of the characters together it is a brutal examination of how some people change and wither under torture how the ties that bind us together can be broken irreparably but it is also a story of how that same strain can bring out the best in people and cause them to go beyond human endurance to help their fellow neighbour friend family member a beautiful heartbreaking story written in lovely prose highly recommended","1675":"when i started reading this book i knew nothing about chechnya but at a certain point i became so involved in the story that i had to stop and do some research what i learned was mostly horrific and based on my new knowledge it led me to believe that the future lives imagined for some of the book's characters particularly the female ones were sadly optimistic the narration by colette whitaker was outstanding and the book itself eye opening sad and wonderful","1676":"i really enjoyed this book it has different timelines and threads that converge in the end takes a little bit to get into to but well worth it interested history of chechnya and topical in terms of crimea and russia","1677":"this book is beautifully written but also extremely sad as it details the human wreckage that the war in chechnya left in its wake it was so sad i decided to quit about a quarter of the way through","1678":"i like historical fiction and had such high hopes for this book especially because it had such high ratings i was disappointed and did not finish it found it to be tedious and slow maybe some other time","1679":"really 4 5 stars obviously very heavy material but the writing is so good that this book truly is about the characters so much more than it is about war torn chechnya the author's skill makes challenging material feel not exactly light but accessable and relatable","1680":"spoiler alert everyone in this book lives happily ever after and absolutely nobody dies violent brutal and completely arbitrary deaths","1681":" it is hard to believe that this is a debut novel not because i think that debut novels are automatically stereotypical but because this story is so complex and subtly developed that my gut says a much more seasoned writer is at work but what do i know about writing this is anything but a happy go lucky read confirming indeed that war torn chechyna is no picnic i loved that this novel made me re think all the short hand news that i knew about the region and made me look at a map to understand where i was being taken in the story i love that this book is full of very complex characters wrangling with their own demons and ultimately just trying to survive decisions here have very real and very difficult consequences and the way in which the characters are literally and figuratively related to one another although not always clear to them through birth affairs community makes for a structure that frames the whole story and gives added impact i also really enjoyed the strength quirkiness and depth of the women characters something i don't often say about a book","1682":"this book is beautifully written and is a beautiful story and it will wrench your heart a book that covers a time of war has to have death and despair but the love and the human heart's ability to heal itself and survive is what it's truly about","1683":"beautifully written but heartbreaking story","1684":"i loved it even though it is a doorway in to a harsh and completely alien world for me i knew nothing of chechnya other than meaningless news stories here and there i now have a profound respect for people that lived through two wars and survived such an incredibly hostile environment and yet this novel is also full of life love kindness and beauty the writing is wonderful and i was very sad to close it at the final page thank you jen campbell for suggesting it for your monthly book club","1685":"alas i've tried and tried but simply cannot connect to this book and am finally abandoning it the stark bleak story that takes place in war ravaged chechnya feels like an end of the world story and it's not what i need to be reading right now i may try this again sometime with another mind frame","1686":" i'm unsure why this is so highly rated perhaps because this book received heaps of initial praise and since then most people feel compelled to jump onto the love it bandwagon ugh certainly there are the occasional beautifully composed sentences and artfully articulated truths but and it's a big but this story is sooo difficult to get through i felt beat up after reading it you're faced with sadness upon betrayal upon despair upon anguish upon misery upon sorrow it's not until the very end when the author finally included some hopefulness almost like an afterthought too little too late then there's the choppiness of the storytelling story jumps forward and backward in time with alternating points of view now throw in the confusion of the backstory and remembering characters and their connections to each other even though these are characters that you the reader will never actually meet such as mirza and esiila in the current story i had to do a lot of flipping of pages back and forth to get all the connections straight the author's writing style is frustrating he doesn't write in a straightforward and direct manner he skirts edges dancing on the periphery he makes statements without full commitment like a dodgy politician finally the way he describes moments in time drove me a little bonkers for example it was two hours since i finished this book which is one hour less than the moment i went to the library to get another book and one hour more than when i took a giant dump and seven hours before i went to bed super annoying right and not clever imagine suffering through pointless absurd relative time connections throughout an entire book i read primarily for enjoyment plus a bit for personal edification this story didn't deliver either","1687":"a rich and rewarding novel","1688":"astounding this could be a lasting classic it is incredibly well constructed and the language is stunning","1689":"read a library copy disappointed i don't have my own copy because there are sentences and passages in this novel that need to be underlined and re read and remembered i loved the narrative voice one that gazes back into the past and peers carefully and delicately into the future","1690":"exquisite beautifully written melancholy tragic brilliant book","1691":"very excellent and disturbing story","1692":"so good yet so depressing","1693":" beautifully written with well crafted characters several dimensions of the chechnyan wars are woven together in this haunting story knowing very little about two wars that took place in my adult life it left me with a glimpse of what it was like for civilians on ground before between and after the wars and a desire to learn more reminded me a bit of cutting for stone the way it was written possibly because of the hospital setting minus the painfully detailed medical descriptions definitely recommend","1694":"loved this book at the same time devastated by it the novel chronicles several lives over a decade or so during the chechen wars it is hard to believe that such disregard for human life has existed in our lifetimes yet the novel is full of hope hope in the small things broken down to the minutes seconds of joy or love","1695":"this is one that will make you stop and think","1696":"it's been a while since i gave a book 5 stars but this book earned every one well almost all five i admit the deux ex machinas strained credibility at points especially at the end but nevertheless it did all fit with the novel's constellation motif i probably would have given this book 4 5 stars if that where an option for the aforementioned reason despite this one shortcoming i loved the book for its restraint and tender honesty the book might take place in a war zone but i would not really say that this book should be classified as war lit rather the setting simply magnifies the moral dilemmas and complications that the characters experience best of all the prose sparkles with metaphor and restraint and humor at just the right moments it is quietly poignant devastating and uplifting by turns marra says he rewrote the entire novel four times that effort shows i can't wait to see what he publishes next p s in my humble opinion this book is nothing like the tiger's wife to which it is oft compared that mediocre book pales in comparison to marra's luminous characterizations furthermore i don't see a lot of common themes the settings are similar that is about it","1697":"this is a book that does everything right i got it from the library but i'm going to buy it because it's so beautifully written that i found myself reading certain lines and paragraphs more than once this is the kind of book that gives you book hangover because you can't start another book right away parts of it are brutal but the author manages to gentle you through it somehow do yourself a favor and get it when you have all day to read","1698":"beautiful tragic horrific u0026amp grim well worth reading when you are emotionally strong a story of humanity in the face of inhumanity during the conflicts in chechnya","1699":"arguably the best book i've read yet","1700":"i wanted to learn more about the war and the reasons this story was extremely well written and i appreciated the author's style i didn't like the negative take on each character although i understand why i was very depressed reading this novel but because it was well written i had to finish it the point of views were utterly depressing and i didn't look forward to picking up the novel to finish it","1701":"i had the good fortune to attend the winter institute in kansas city the most important annual gathering of indie booksellers and was told by two different people that i needed to grab a copy of the galley for constellation before going home i did and boy oh boy am i glad thank you mark from politics and prose and steve from neiba for the recommendation there are many different themes running through this book the insanity and futility of war in this case the war between chechnya and its russian overlords the delicate relationships between parents and their children that seem so often to end with the disappointment of one or the other the capacity for some human beings to be cruel and for some human beings to endure and in a minor way at least to me it's about how cultures steeped in wealth and comfort fail to appreciate how good life can be but more than anything this is a story about hope and how even under the most brutal and absurd circumstances hope can never really be extinguished that hope is perhaps more than our opposable thumbs or our senses of humor or our ability reason what makes us definably human while i think this novel is utterly unique i found myself thinking about two other books as i read it each of which has a place on my all time great list constellation evokes a mood and a feeling not dissimilar to city of thieves and reminded me of that same feeling of hope i saw threaded through the overarching sadness of what is the what constellation publishes in a few months you'll want to be the first in line or online to buy it","1702":"this book about the lives people living in chechnya during the two chechen wars of independence is beautifully told and very moving dokka ramzan and akhmed are three friends living in a tiny village that is no more than a wide spot in the road one friend becomes an informer for the feds the russians disgracing his father and himself and putting his closest friends in danger nearby at hospital no 6 a russian doctor named sonja is struggling to understand the sudden disappearance of her sister natasha sonja had escaped to london while natasha stayed in chechnya during the first war until she was kidnapped enslaved and addicted to heroin in italy natasha eventually escaped and joined the now returned sonja at their old apartment in chechnya where sonja was now in charge of hospital no 6 although they were not close the sisters worked together for six years in the most difficult conditions until natasha suddenly disappeared again this time on purpose sonja is determined to learn why natasha left without a word as prosperous chechnya is destroyed by wars as life gets increasingly difficult everyone caught by the conflict is irrevocably changed amid all the damage and death hope survives joy survives people start anew i have heard this book compared to the tiger's wife and although both books concern the affect of generational conflict on a society this book is not a fairy tale it is more moving more human less a fable than the tiger's wife","1703":" this book reminded me strongly in a good way of orhan pamuk's snow due to the bleak setting unlike snow though anthony marra's big book is set against the background of the second chechen war and so the bleakness is mixed with urgency the characters are also striving for something bigger than themselves the writing is immersive the characters connected in subtle ways and the plot compelling though the action itself is condensed into five days flashbacks extend the narrative much farther into the past the scenes of the landfill how even good people do bad things are particularly strong","1704":"a beautiful well written book haunting but hopeful","1705":" i am in love with the way marra writes his novel has an encyclopedia worth of chechen facts all wrapped up in the pretty fluidity of poetry constellation takes place over a period of 5 days yet is spread over the span of a decade and tells the story of an overlapping handful of chechen and russian lives i'm not sure why it took me so long to read i couldn't find the time to sit and fully commit and i think this hurt my experience with the novel most of the five star reviews are penned by readers who sat and devoured it in a single sitting and i think that might be the best way to read this book there are intertwining facts and single moments repeated through the eyes of different characters and it is so easy to lose the plot or worse miss out on one of the beautiful fleeting coincidences scattered and hidden throughout the pages i have always been interested in chechnya and have strangely enough never read a single piece of fiction about the nation this was worth the wait a gorgeous first novel","1706":"beautifully constructed written and connected to the broader history of chechnya i highly recommend for every kind of reader","1707":"very difficult to wrap my brain around this i had to keep putting it down and walking away and yet i am okay with having read it as it opened my eyes in a way that i just never thought of as i listened to this the pronunciations were taken care of for me however the dates changing confused me somewhat i found it amazing how the author connected the various lives and didn't leave me wondering what happens after","1708":" i give this book 4 35 stars this is the kind of meaty book that doesn't lend itself so well to summer reading but after a slow start for me at least i found myself enthralled the non linear storytelling gives readers an opportunity to dig into the background of characters all of whom slide up and down the scale between good and bad in very human ways without pulling me too far out of the present it's a story of life during war s that i know very little about the end left me sad and hopeful caution do not read the ending while in a public place people will think you've sprung a leak","1709":"while i felt compelled to give this book the full 5 stars i will also say that i did not enjoy quite a large chunk of the journey that constituted my reading of this novel it is set between 1994 and 2004 in war torn chechneya there are three main characters ten year old havaa the incompetent doctor but very kind hearted man achmed and the brilliant but bone weary surgeon sonja as the story begins havaa sees her father dokka killed and she runs off into the forest with her already packed suitcase to hide childless achmed who is married to a severely mentally ill woman and loves havaa as if she were his own determines to find havaa and save her if possible miraculously achmed does find havaa whom the authorities are looking for and takes her to the one hospital in the area it is at that point we meet sonja a rather cold woman with no desire for children hers or anyone else's sonja left a good life and fiancee who loved her back in london to return to chechneya to try to rebuild her relationship with her sister by the time she meets achmed and havaa sonja's sister natasha is missing and sonja despite endless effort has been unable to find her this novel is written in an unusual recursive style that would probably be confusing if not for the helpful timeline atop each chapter head that style made skipping portions unwise and there was one very specific torture scene that i would have preferred to have skipped spoiler alert i really could have skipped the details there the story came together in the end logically and beautifully this book certainly made me even more grateful to be an american who has never had to endure anything remotely like what these characters experienced in the end there was something to like in almost every one of the characters except for ramzan fairly late in the novel we learn how he became what he was however the terrible things that happened to him still could not excuse him for his actions this is far from a simple beach read but i am glad that i stuck with it and do recommend it highly","1710":"one of the best books read this year","1711":"should have one the pulitzer prize beautifully written characters doing what they need to do in a war that only impacts them negatively one of my top 20 books if not top 10 one of the few i will read again","1712":"extremely confusing i wish i knew more about the history so i may have understood the story it is very depressing do not read it while you are eating it can be very gory i must admit i stopped reading before i finished the book i just couldn't take any more sorrow i may sneak back to the library and read the ending one day i don't believe i will ever read the entire book beautifully written","1713":" 3 5 stars from my review marra's writing style is beautiful and poetic a jarring conclusion to the reality of the violence of a situation brimming with land mines and abductions unfortunately it often becomes too verbose one sentence stretched over multiple pages especially at the beginning i think he could have cut down the verbage - what was meant to launch the text turned into a boring opening section with the book not really picking up until the middle if only he had cut some of the beginning and included a brief foreword on chechen history the book would've been much improved i could easily see a reader overwhelmed by the language and unexplained history putting the book down and never picking it up again read full review at http time2tome wordpress com 2014 0","1714":"beautifully written but gut wrenching an up close and personal look at human behavior and the sacrifices of common people in a war torn country if you're like me you'll question if there's a threshold for forgiveness","1715":" this is a superb book and deserves every one of the accolades it has received so far apparently it is the author's first book too which is remarkable he has an amazing way with words and a wonderful lightness of touch which makes reading it a real pleasure this is a story set in war torn chechnya which includes scenes of brutality and torture and yet it it is never weighed down by the horror of war the main characters are written so well and they all have their own ways of living through what is around them humour is one of those ways love is another and this is maybe why this book flies i loved it and really believe that everyone should read it","1716":"wonderfully woven story of the intertwined lives of several families sundered by war in chechnya bringing to mind the concept of destiny and fate i loved the beautiful anecdotes about the past and future of even the briefest players in the drama providing insight into their actions no character too small to deserve a detail or a memory","1717":"while beautifully written and entertaining i am still processing at parts i was so hooked i didn't think i could put the book down however during other stretches i found myself getting a little bored this book does display magnificently the interconnected lives we all can lead and never know it it also wonderfully conveys the idea that even the littlest act can mean the world to someone else i would love to know what others thing and discuss","1718":"life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i think most of us lead sheltered lives with no inkling as to how any person's life might change in a war most of us may have not even heard about chechnya and the ethnic religious conflict that has claimed innumerable lives we agree that wars are universally futile put in the kinds of situations that citizens experience in war torn countries would we have made better choices than the characters in this story anthony marra constructs a fantastic debut novel using the background of the chechen wars where a little girl havaa is rescued by her neighbour akhmed after the russian federal forces take away her father on the grounds that he sympathized with the rebels akhmed takes her to a hospital in volchansk where a surgeon sonja agrees to take her in over a course of 5 days the fate of these three characters is decided not only by their actions in the present but also by astonishing events in their pasts that bind them together the story has been narrated in a non linear fashion initially i found this quite confusing but later i figured out that the little time strip at the beginning of the chapter highlighted the year in which the chapter took place and it was smooth sailing after that marra's style is breathtaking especially for a first novel at many places the characters do not know things that the reader does and many times i felt like passing on the information to them to sonja to havaa and khassen this is how deeply one connects with the characters i also liked the 'epilogue' of the various characters it was very unique unlike other books which devote an entire chapter at the end this one is a must read i'm looking forward to reading it again","1719":"at first i had a tough time getting into it i told myself i would give it 100 pages the next time i looked at a page number it was 147 by then i needed to know the rest of the story","1720":"i had to finish about 1 3 of the book before i really started to like it the last 1 3 of the book i could not put down","1721":" this was a novel of a thousand stories told through a main cast of 5 or so circling around 1 little girl i had not read much on chechnya and i am thankful to this book for opening my eyes there it is a story of the horrors we can do but also little glimmers of hope i did not find it as amazing as something in a similar vein can't think of it right now and found much of it somewhat tedious and overly foreshadowy which i don't like i would have liked more with havaalots of pieces fell into place in funny obvious ways and were connected randomly which was the point i guess but much of it was somewhat heavy handed where the title comes from for example not the best book i've read but worth picking up","1722":" i don't normally like to recommend sad books but i feel this book was worth the tears set in chechnya from 1994 to 2004 it follow two sisters working in a hospital and a set of men from a tiny village as they try to make it through two nonsensical wars as best they can at first it seems pretty clear who are the bad guys and who the good guys but as the story skips back and forth through the years you learn that everyone is more complicated than they first appeared and all of the characters are connected in some way besides the thoughtful and moving story i learned a bit about a region and part of recent history i knew almost nothing about before","1723":"it will be a long time before i stop thinking about this book it was so hard to read because of the topic not the writing but so beautiful just a must read","1724":"this is a rich book full of the raw irony of a war torn country and its people's souls","1725":"well written character driven","1726":"i was surprised to scroll through so many 5 star reviews of this novel here before noticing a 2 star review from someone who listened to the audio a ha that's how i read this novel as an eaudio book maybe there's something about the narration that works against the novel i listened to the whole thing and i can't say for sure what's missing i know only that i lost interest well before the halfway point and only intermittently engaged the novel thereafter","1727":"the inclusion of random and unexpected time details like in how many months that character would do a certain act was most memorable","1728":"it's too simple to say just that i liked this book it was harrowing but anthony marra employed fiction to do the most profound thing fiction can do open a reader's eyes to realities that are inaccessible sometimes thankfully so as in the ravaged world of marra's chechens or even unimaginable from the world inhabited by that reader it is a dark dark view put forward by this novel that anyone any one of us as conrad's marlow put it at the turn of the last century can be utterly broken and morally bankrupted by sufficiently savage manipulation of our nerve endings our constellation of vital phenomena but that truth has been proven too many times to be doubted all we can do is pretend to forget it until an author like marra recalls us to truth that humankind is what we make of it or what we destroy","1729":"beautiful writing i love the layering of the description that are like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that give you full picture when put together it has both great humor and also the horror of the two wars in chechnya so while it's not for everyone it's a terrific read","1730":"i was pretty lukewarm toward this book until the final quarter of it i really enjoy books where things come together in a serendipitous way and like the title of the book the people in this novel ended up all being connected like a constellation i also enjoyed the recurring theme of talking to people who aren't there aren't responsive aren't alive","1731":"a bit of a slog at the start but everything pays off at the end of this book most war fiction i read is from the first or second world war so it was refreshing to read about something more recent these events wouldn't have been out of place in any other conflict war is sort of a timeless enterprise the author finds a lot of sadness and beauty in giving us the fate of every character but reminding us of how restricted this information is to those in the story","1732":"so not what i expected so very much better and for a book of decent heft concerning only a few characters and only taking five days so much less overblown than i'd expected 3 5 stars of pleasant surprise","1733":"this novel chonicling five days in war torn chechnya introduced me to characters i won't soon forget the timbre of the prose allowed me to move close to the characters and inhabit at least for a little while their world a world where logic and morals have been lost but humanity and hope still remain this is the best novel i've read in many years and i look forward to reading more from this author in the future highly recommend","1734":"actually 4 5 stars this book is a gift this young author writes like an old soul and i am amazed by his grasp of human complexity not only did i learn about politics and strife in chechnya but i learned about family and suffering and love and fortitude do not be put off by the focus on chechnya especially if you feel your knowledge is lacking that's exactly why you should read this book marra makes the region's history and politics accessible through his people who seem like far more than characters and their deeply engaging stories read it read it read it my only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that i just read the goldfinch and was not quite as dazzled by the language here can't wait to read more by marra","1735":"this is simply one of the best novels i have read in many months so gorgeously crafted i found myself deliberately slowing down as i read it to savor the prose the characters and their intertwined lives are as equally crafted in rich detail and emotional truth i was in tears at the end highly recommended","1736":"better than a news segment or a paragraph in a history book marra puts you in the center of the war by introducing characters and thoughtfully weaving their lives together showing you how war affects everyone in different ways","1737":"depressing story but parts very well written","1738":"very powerful","1739":"an incredible book with a huge sweep of history culture politics parallel plotlines and so much humanity mostly confined to a few square miles in chechnya the characters are heart warming facing very difficult sometimes brutal circumstances the language is accessible but very well drawn the narration techniques are skillfully implemented and time shifts work well to reveal new information in several parallel overlapping stories wow","1740":"this book really grows on you as you read it i know i'm loving a book when i start re reading pages just to make them last longer i don't know much about chechnya other than that there have been wars there lately and i still don't know very much but these characters are so beautifully written that i feel like i know them and feel their pain i would recommend this book to anyone who loves a sad beautiful haunting sad read it's a feast enjoy beautiful definition title for a book","1741":"set between 1994 and 2004 in chechnya when russia went to war with the breakaway republic it zigzags through time alternating between the first and second invasions losing some momentum but in the murkiness of the shifts the stories bounce through time and characters and brought tears to my eyes and laughter from my heart the best reason to read this novel is the reminder that even through extreme circumstances and senselessness kindness is often wrenched","1742":"interesting sad sometimes confusing book well written with compelling characters","1743":" reading this book was a very similar experience to reading the orphan master's son on many levels the non linear narrative the war torn environment and graphic torture being thrown right into the story with little explanation and having to sink or swim or flounder as i did for the first 2 300 pages the sentences are well crafted the story eventually comes together and there are some interesting moral ambiguities but it's a book you have to work at and between that and the painful experiences of the people i'm not sure the juice is worth the squeeze a constellation of vital phenomena takes place in war torn chechnya the central characters are four men and two sisters connected by a little girl daughter to one of the men we learn that the little girl's father is taken away and that she is in danger one of the men a close friend of the girl's father takes her to the hospital where she can be protected by a doctor working there one of the two sisters as i read i met individual characters and watched their interactions wondering why they were important and what the overall story was i would then slowly learn backstories in bits and pieces alternating with events in the present until toward the end i finally managed to piece together what had happened and what was happening it's a story where people undergo horrific experiences and then turn around and hurt other people in order to avoid more torture can you blame them well some of the other characters do and as the reader you can ponder this but mainly you feel confused for a while which eventually gives way to deep depression as you learn about the harsh realities of these characters' existence lots of people raved about this book and i can see why it's important to have your consciousness raised to the things people go through in war torn areas although with fiction you always have to wonder about authenticity vs poetic license and the moral ambiguity is fascinating but i'm going to have to confess my inferiority as a reader i need a more linear narrative i need more explanation earlier on i need less torture that's just how it is a constellation of vital phenomena may objectively be a four or even five star book but from me it just gets three","1744":"if i could have given this more than 5 stars i would have what an extraordinary account of the chechen wars and of the lives of the individuals affected i don't possess the talent for writing reviews so i will leave it there","1745":"i couldn't really get in to it and when i finally did i got really tired of hearing reading the f word","1746":"i liked the book a lot though i did think it had some flaws not major ones though just sort of first novel bumps extraordinary story it will be interesting to see what this author comes up with next","1747":"beautiful writing that tells a very depressing story and as usual that leaves me struggling over how many stars to give settled on 4","1748":"this is not a book for those who dislike wordy books or fast moving plots there were times when i was confused about characters the plot and the point of the many long descriptions that being said it was very compelling and i loved the ending it might be helpful for those who haven't read the book to read a basic history of the chechnya people in russia might help smooth out a bit of the historical piece to it","1749":"this book helped me shape and understand the republic of chechnya its complicated and violent past and present","1750":"heartbreaking to read this fictional account set during wartime chechnya in the early 2000s and the earlier problems before that and realize that although these events occurred in my adult lifetime i really hadn't paid attention to much of what went on other than the theater hostage situation ordinary people tortured and killed villages destroyed lives torn apart forever a lot of devastation and desolation here not a feel good book i liked how nuanced the characters were the bad guy is bad for a reason the good guy is actually not all good but none of the characters really stuck with me i wasn't particularly rooting for any one person","1751":"interesting and well written i loved that the characters were all so nuanced no one is completely good or bad marra does a fantastic job of weaving all of the characters' stories together although the jumps in time were confusion every once in a while the story is set in modern day chechnya although it's an area of the world i've heard about through the occasional news headline it's not a place i've ever thought much about as i read i kept thinking that the story was taking place during the nineteenth century and i'd have to remind myself that these are conditions that people are living in even today","1752":"i didn't have much knowledge of this book before i read it other than that it was very critically acclaimed so i was taken off guard when i discovered it was about chechnya you don't encounter a book set in that part of the world very often so that was intriguing already marra's rich collection of characters and poetically accurate writing made the read for me however i loved akhmed and havaa and khassan i even loved ramzan and sonja for the emotional range and complexity of humanity they displayed marra's work with the ordering of events as told in his book was also very unique and in my eyes successful the present day and the important backstory were cleverly woven and interchanged until it all meets itself and comes full circle in the end a very good read definitely worthy of the recognition","1753":"anthony marra's novel set in chechnya between the years 1994 and 2004 is a must read this novel captures some of the realities after the collapse of the berlin wall and the dissolution of the ussr an engaging story that helps readers understand some of the conflicts in the crimea and ukraine right now","1754":" there were moments of true profound beauty in this book i think i might have enjoyed it more if i had been in a better head space to deal with the darkness of the story lots of people not being good failing lots of death a good amount of torture etc it was just very very bleak at certain points and i found that challenging and it probably meant i didn't fully appreciate the novel i do love stories where the characters end up all being connected though so that definitely kept me from putting it aside","1755":"could not even finish this book made it about halfway through without the story grabbing me","1756":" we go along each day in our wonderfully ordinary lives never for more than a few moments imagining the lives of people who don't live in freedom we have places to rest our heads food to eat clothes to wear and the luxury of speaking our minds as often and wherever we wish we are so spoiled and we don't even realize it until we read a book like this the chechen people have lived their lives trying to survive wars and invasions for hundreds of years these pages describe the lives of the people who lived in the small villages that were destroyed by the constant upheaval of conquerors who took whatever and whoever they wanted in spite of this there was love loyalty bravery and sacrifice among them i found inspiration in this book i vow to appreciate every part of the wonderful life i am able to live as a free woman in a beautiful country read this book it's sad but eloquent and in the end uplifting","1757":" i finished a constellation of vital phenomena the title was very fitting as the author told the story through 6 characters very interesting reading about about chechnya a disputed muslim territory involved in conflicts since the 1990s the book jumps back and forth in time and the story is told through 6 main characters whose lives intersect it's hard to read at times only because of the cruelties humans inflict upon others during war i learned more about this place where the father of the boston marathon bombers lives and its struggles and the characters were very real it was easy for the reader to empathize with each one throughout the book","1758":"beautifully written entirely engrossing and moving","1759":"excellent wonderfully written very intense","1760":"wonderful marra has such a gift with words and language some dark and difficult scenes but i thoroughly enjoyed it it covers a topic and area of history that i don't know much about","1761":" what a beautiful haunting novel this will be a lifelong favorite the kind of book you return to year after year it's a story to borrow a turn of phrase from seamus heaney of hope and history rhyming set in chechnya during the second chechen war it follows havaa an eight year old girl whose father is taken disappeared in the opening pages of the novel charged with harboring chechen rebels the russian soldiers are also looking for her her neighbor akhmed helps her escape by taking her to a neighboring city and a young surgeon named sonja sonja doesn't know it upon their arrival but akhmed and havaa as well as others in havaa'a village may hold the answers to the disappearance of her sister natasha the war is it's own malevolent character in the book lurking in the shadows and forcing decisions and behaviors we all wonder if we're capable of both terrible and beautiful and the writing oh the writing it will make you ache it's so beautiful read this book you will feel your heart break in that way that gives you hope and makes you weep read this book","1762":" i enjoyed reading this book immensely it was profoundly thought provoking and worthwhile not least because i don't know a lot about chechnya and all of the strife there over the past 20 or so years and i appreciate marra's having brought that to light i have too many assorted thoughts to really draw this book into something like a coherent review but here are some of the wonderful things i noticed and appreciated the theme of pits and depressions is strong and very evocative i am lucky in that i happened to look up the meanings of the characters' names it turns out that dokka is old norse for a pit or depression these appear in the forms of cigarette burns heads pushed into the snow craters in the streets and of course the landfill among other things this is a book about refugees particularly refugees from what is basically ethnic strife and in this sense it makes perfect sense that luggage should be such a vivid image cluster there are three key pieces of luggage in the book none of them particularly suitable to their purpose sonja's roller khassan's suitcase carrying he heritage and havaa's emergency suitcase surgery and drawing are set against each other in the most wonderful ways witness the relationship between sonja and akhmed and also between sonja and natasha and what is interesting is the way that surgery is made out to be a sort of dehumanizing practice with little practical import while drawing is a vital practice that brings its subjects to life whether akhmed's 41 subjects or his drawing of natasha or natasha's mural of city life the ruminations on hands sonja's callused like a lumberjack's dokka's brutally mutilated and so on reflect this contrast the abrahamic scene at the end is wonderfully and ironically drawn what i found most particularly poignant especially for a book about refugees is that the allusion to abraham's legacy is reversed in the torah this scene is followed by the memorable chapter in which abraham is commanded to go to the land of his forefathers where he will become the father to a great nation but in this book khassan abandons the land of his forefathers with the promise of no more than a pack of feral dogs for family granted i don't know much about the koran's take on this scene and what follows it and i imagine that would be more relevant in this context the theme of blurry family lines of sons who are cheated of their rightful place and the like is similarly biblically evocative and particularly relevant for a book about muslims the story of akhmed and ramzan is not too far removed from that of esau and jacob if i recall properly i'm a little short on talmudic recall and again have basically no koranic knowledge whatsoever so i couldn't really appreciate these story lines as much as i'd have liked but i think they are exceptionally clever ramzan is perhaps my favorite character the unlikely tragic hero his name is a sort of colloquialism for ramadan and the way in which he fasts in the presence of plenty is a perfect reflection of that name his experiences in the landfill are i think meant to be a kind of spiritual purification as well although they are also attended obviously by a gruesome physical mutilation there were a handful of images which i thought were just so wonderful for example the trapezoid of sunlight that ramzan sees in his living room in the morning shaped like a prayer rug likewise the slow burning of khassan's book the disjunction of time is a little tricky at first but it works reasonably well i also enjoyed that sort of small scale fast forward that we saw into minor characters' lives here and there a bit reminiscent of run lola run i thought it placed the tragedy in its own kind of odd context and allowed us to step back from the drama from time to time on the whole this book is a wonderful read even though its subject matter is disturbing and in some places simply painful to read there are a lot of fascinating ideas to contemplate here and it's certainly the kind of book that begs for a re read","1763":" every once in awhile you come across a book so good that you are reminded of what literature is about and what it can do a constellation of vital phenomenon by anthony marra is one of those rare books marra has managed to give us something beautifully written that wrestles with the big important and enduring questions in wrestling with these questions marra understands there are no easy answers even the characters doing despicable things are rendered in shades of gray it isn't all bleak and depressing in marra's world there is much good but striving for it can be costly one of the only places where marra falters a bit is in presenting these spots of good in the bleak world he has created he will mention a peripheral character and then will spin out a little thread of what happens to that character 5 10 or even 50 years down the line these little digressions tend to feel a bit too fairy tail ish and optimistic it's not that the optimism is overly done it's just that the optimism and tidy endings feel at odds with the dark general mood of the rest of the book this will easily stand as one of the best books of recent years that fact that this is only marra's first book is exciting he is on to being one of the best and most important writers presently working","1764":" not sure what to say about this book it's very well written it's about very important subjects the chechen wars of the late 1990s early 2000s what it means to be family man's inhumanity to man etc and yet it was hard to get through and follow the narrative constantly moved back and forth through time and for me while the device worked it did make it hard to keep track of who was who and when in their life we were encountering them although this is entirely different from the brilliant all the light we cannot see they cover similar subjects light was extraordinary constellation is not but it was interesting nonetheless","1765":"i liked the beginning but the middle portion i lost interest it grabbed me again toward the end but in general i felt it was just so so","1766":"this is the sort of book that leaves you enriched at the end and yet also feeling like you left some part of yourself behind in the pages what got me was the characters all flawed all struggling and all perfectly beautifully human this book absolutely deserved the barnes and noble discover new authors award it is supremely touching and extremely elegant in the treatment of subjects that are just the opposite","1767":"i wanted to like this book but every time i put it down i had no motivation to pick it up again i had to renew it twice from the library","1768":"this is one of those rare times when i really don't want to write anything about a book it feels so whole and so perfectly complete that i really don't want to pick at it i just want to savour it it's one of those stories that is hard to leave i feel emotionally full and will need to take a little space before starting into another book","1769":" this debut novel by anthony marra is a powerful eloquently written book the novel takes place from 1994 2004 non linearly moving between the first and second wars between chechen rebels fighting for independence and the russians trying to control the region the motivations for the wars are complicated but marra successfully uses this war stricken setting as a basis to explore human life amid perpetual atrocity the book weaves together the stories of several people living in a small town in chechnya havaa a young girl who has lived her whole in war time dokka havaa's father who continues to harbor fleeing refugees despite having all ten fingers removed by the russian military akhmed an incompetent doctor who cares for his invalid wife and tries to protect havaa after her father is taken in the night ramzan the old friend of dokka and akhmed who becomes an informer to protect his father khassan ramzan's father who hates his son's actions though he continues to live with him only speaking to him when he is asleep sonja the doctor at a nearby hospital who takes in havaa and natasha sonja's sister who disappeared several years prior to the story the characters and their struggles are brought vividly to life by the compelling story telling this novel is quite beautiful and shows the resiliency of human spirit and the fight for survival and humanity even in the senseless environment of perpetual war","1770":" i spent a good part of the last two days of 2013 reading anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena although i'm not sure why this book was on my radar before it came out and i bought it in hardback within a few days of its release certain somehow that that would be the right choice right indeed the best word i can come up with to describe this book is luminous the prose the characters the plot have a glow about them that is not to suggest that constellation is a happy book rather this is a book that radiates truth so that even though much of it is sad one finds a beauty in its precision marra has taken a difficult subject life in chechenya during the decade from 1994 to 2004 and explored it in a way that does justice to its topic and characters granting them a well deserved dignity that is free of pretension the constellation at this book's heart is earthly not heavenly a constellation composed of intersecting moments in a series of lives none of the characters fully understands the way he or she is related to others but marra allows us to see what they cannot an outline of meaning that rises from their combined choices the omniscience works here because it does not judge the narrator isn't telling us a simple tale of right and wrong though of course right and wrong are the bones it's built upon rather he's broadening our field of vision in a way that lets us bear and understand what might otherwise be unbearable and incomprehensible i don't want to provide a plot summary here readers deserve the experience of moving--innocently pure heartedly virginally un forewarnedly --through the plot as it unfolds suffice it to say that people struggle to do their best often falling short and the marra's gift to readers is letting them travel beside the characters as they make their choices this is a book to pick up when you want a rich meal one that will make demands of you and will return every bit as much as it demands read it when you have time and presence to savor and to wrestle this isn't a book you'll use as escape but one in which you will find yourself arriving somewhere absolutely new and necessary","1771":"this book is in the running for favorite read of the year all i have to say is if you enjoy good fiction read this book it's not fluffy or too literary but is a heartbreaking as it should be and beautiful glimpse into exactly what the title says a constellation of vital phenomena","1772":"i did not know that chechenya existed until i read this and its heartbreaking to know that they are oppress good story about how their life is tangle from one another","1773":"such a beautifully written book made me research chechnya's history learned a lot tags village life muslim faith families displacement russia torture hospitals in war zones","1774":"i'm still breathing in the beauty of this book","1775":" this one actually qualifies as a heartbreaking work of staggering genius take that dave eggars carefully woven threads bring together these lives in absolute tatters there are no high moral heroes just deeply flawed human beings living their desperate lives in a war torn world it makes no excuses yet never strips them of their humanity it makes something clear that i think is very rare to see so clearly portrayed there is no easy way out difficult choices will be made and many of them may have terrible results and yet they cannot be classified as wrong they are simply the way human beings have always suffered and survived war it's bleak but the writing is beautiful the plot is well crafted and the characters feel real","1776":"embracing the horror of war marra also shows us real compassionate human struggles to survive with some morsels of dignity and integrity although reading about the trauma of war was difficult for me i appreciated marra's triumph of human souls in the end","1777":" this is one of those books that will stick with you and make you think question yourself and the world around you the novel takes place in chechnya which i am embarrassed to admit i knew very little about this part of the world or the horrible violence and history it has been through in the last 30 40 years each chapter has a timeline at the top and the year the chapter relates to is highlighted and the story goes from past to present back and forth the way the characters lives intertwine is beautiful and graceful and heartbreaking as each part unfolded i would catch my breath and see the connections deepen between the characters parts are very hard to read because it describes in a very unemotional tone the torture the violence of war the struggle to survive the sex trade and the repercussions of stalin's purges parts will amaze you at what people sacrificed for their loved ones and for their country there is frequent use of the f word in the book for those who may be offended by language i wouldn't let that deter you from the power of this story while it is fiction it has opened my eyes to another piece of history and human suffering and triumph","1778":" i only picked up this book because it had made the national book award long list for 2013 and i was able to get it from the library turns out it was an excellent choice and i see why it could be potentially chosen for the award i usually stay away from historical fiction that deals heavily in war and global conflict but marra stays away from dates and facts and figures and names of important key players instead he focuses on the people that are affected by the war the most the ones we most likely won't hear about when watching cnn this novel deals with the day to day struggle to survive for those that continue to live in a place that rarely seems to be at peace for any amount of time and the stories of different people are woven together to show lives that seemingly have little to do with each other can effect each other in ways both good and bad showing that every decision we make effects the world around us","1779":"4 5 stars i have wanted to read this book since i heard about it when it was long listed for the nba's it was the first book i wanted to read however i approached it with the wrong attitude i started speed reading it so i could get as many of the 10 long listed books read before the nba short list is announce two thirds of the way through the book i was relishing the exquisite writing but missing the story i abandoned my hope to read the 10 longlisted nbas at started this one over i am very glad i did more soon","1780":"fantastic book on every level beautiful poignant brutal","1781":"i loved this book the history of chechnya since the break up of the soviet union was fascinating and educational i especially was drawn to the characters and their struggles to find their place in a war torn country i thought the author did a great job of connecting the characters and creating a sense of empathy whether you agreed with their decisions or not this is one of the best reads i've had in a long time","1782":"haunting layered story about the horrors of war and the humanity of people we gradually learn how the inhabitants of a war ravaged town are intertwined in ways we would not expect at the beginning the writing is beautiful and nuanced i put reading this book off for a long time because i didn't want to read a story about brutality it is one of the best books i have read in a long time by the end the characters have become so real and their humanity it really touched me","1783":"i starting reading a couple of times last winter but the beginning was so bleak i put it down and picked it back up this aug reading under a warm sun and soft breezes it's an amazing story of resilience love and the positive in pride of heritage","1784":" it took some time to sink my teeth into this novel as it jumps around a bit but as i expected it was worth it in the end not an easy story to tell it is a bleak look at the ravages of two civil wars in chechnya i had no understanding or knowledge of what has happened in this part of the world and had to do a little googling to familiarize myself a little bit with some historical background sad really to know how ravaged this area is but how little the world has focused on what has happened there thousands and thousands of civilians have died heartbreaking and sad but beautiful and haunting literature slow going for me for at least the first half it really picked up the latter half as pieces started falling into place and i had a better idea where the story was taking me this is almost a 5 star book for me","1785":"this is a five star book that i only got 4 stars out of because i read it too distractedly and choppily i'd love to read it again start to finish with full attention beautiful prose and fascinating insights into a modern day war that i knew nothing about before reading i can see why it's getting so much praise","1786":"with all that is going on in ukraine this book opened my eyes to what it's like to live in a country torn apart by war","1787":"one of the few books i really loved because of the story that seems totally crazy to my little western mind but which is in fact plausible and horrible mystery is the only word i can find to describe this novel you never quit know what is going to happen even if in the bottom of your self you know that the only possible end is inevitable","1788":" i kind of hated this book despite all of the glowing reviews and what is admittedly beautiful writing in some places this book still grated on my nerves like nothing else i found the narrator pedantic and obnoxious at times and i found a lot of the brutality gratuitous and that's given the subject matter which is brutal by definition i just found certain scenes over the top and totally unproductive for the plot line generally the last 1 3 of the book is by far the best but it doesn't make up for the first 2 3 i wanted to like this book but unfortunately am disappointed","1789":"phenomenal the sense of place and time is overwhelming i would read and re read passages and chapters for the pleasure of enjoying them again which says a lot since the subject matter of the book is the bloody conflict in chechnya it was also interesting to learn more about an event is recent history that i knew very little about despite living through this time period this is a first book by the author and i can't wait for what he writes next","1790":"sadly i had no knowledge of the fairly recent wars between chechnya and russia nor would i have been able to point chechnya out on a map this novel so beautifully written opened my eyes to the very real devastation that occurs each and every day for people i like to imagine that everyone lives a fairly easy life how incredibly naive of me the characters in marra's novel are so real that i sometimes forgot i was reading a work of fiction obviously very closely based on factual events the choices they made based on morals and the consequences they faced because of those choices brought these characters to life for me marra connected his characters by such a slowly unfolding intricately spun web that i couldn't help wanting to flip through page after page to find out exactly how it would all come together","1791":"this book has many difficult scenes due to the time period and place in which it occurs chechnya during their two wars with russia in the 1990s and early 2000's but i found the story both compelling and moving the author anthony marra has a most lyrical style and i found a dark beauty and simple compassion in the main characters despite the bleak setting i love the way he weaves in hope for the future as he alludes to where certain characters will be and what life holds for them in years to come i knew so little about this region and the troubles they have experienced this novel taught me so much","1792":"rich haunting beautifully written covering world events that i knew little about would love to come back and read this again sometime","1793":"i can't even begin to describe how hauntingly beautiful this novel is one of my favorite reads ever","1794":"this is not an easy read but the writing is amazing for such a young author the gripping story line goes back and forth in time and assumes at least a little knowledge of russian chechen history the sad and funny events and characters seem real the harshness of the environment seems impossible to people who are warm and well fed recommended","1795":"an amazing can't put down book this tale explores the hopes small triumphs and tragedies in an occupied country","1796":"a brilliant book beautifully and seamlessly crafted great characters gut wrenching and heart breaking situations i never would have predicted that i would have so thoroughly enjoyed a book about the war in chechnya hell i barely knew there was one one war there never mind two","1797":"4 5 stars beautifully woven tale","1798":"i asked a respected bookseller for a book with beautiful language and without hesitation he led me to this book it did not disappoint for the language alone i fell in love with a story that on the surface i didn't think would hold that much appeal to me i thought the same thing when someone handed me the kite runner and fell in love with that novel too i think anthony marra's prose is about the best out there so hard to believe this is a debut it's a challenging book but it comes with countless rewards","1799":"i really loved this book some of the prose was very powerful and moving i found myself invested in the characters reading on to discover what would happen to them the history behind the action the chechen war was well researched one of the best books i've read so far this year","1800":" i often joke that the initials in my name are hea and i won't read books without one but for as many people were killed off in this book i couldn't put this book down i was very moved by it sometimes the coincidences got to be a little too much but i got that that was part of the character of the book a little bit of almost magical realism to it i think it was the complex humanity of the characters that impressed me so much one of the main characters is an incompetent doctor but a good man and there's just a lot more to it than that moral gray zones and then heroic actions and just this sort of striving for life an agonizing and beautiful struggle for it or at least in the end for the life of this little girl and there's forgiveness and redemption and all this other sh and yeah it's a really powerful book i couldn't stop thinking about it all week while i was reading it on christmas while looking at my beautiful little boy in our happy safe non war torn country then watching the hunger games and realizing the idea of government forces killing children is not just fiction i want to hug this book to my chest and hug the fictional havaa and then hug my own son and then pray and pray and pray for a more hopeful future","1801":"holy shit so i loved every syllable and every phoneme of this book it's an intense haunting read but it's also beautifully woven with relevant thought provoking statements throughout the characters are strongly written with their own flaws and their own connections with each other this one of the constructions that moved the book forward chapters were drawn together with images and themes and not by chronology it was incredibly effective the timeline above each chapter time jump was a brilliant way to show the movement of time it's definitely not an easy read emotionally but it's a poignant one an important one i think","1802":"the effects of the chechnyan conflict with russia on members of a small village","1803":"beautifully written sweeping saga of those affected by the chechen wars the author didn't hit you over the head with 'history ' but let the characters and their rich complex stories tell a far deeper tale of war and its effects","1804":"although i liked this book a lot was a slower than normal read for me much to absorb and follow loved the writing and how within the story there was insight into future outcomes for the characters","1805":" the only reason i did not give this book a 5 star rating was that to me it was so sad i had no knowledge of the history of chechnya and after reading this novel i am sorry that i now do the book was written by a very talented author even though i found this story so hard to read i could not stop reading this book it caused such mixed emotions i loved the major characters the connections discovered among them and the kindness they had for each other most of them anyway but i am also haunted by the impact of war and cruelty it is a book i will not soon forget","1806":"this novel is amazing that's all that needs to be said wow","1807":" every once in a while i come across as a book that i rate as amazing but that i don't know if i can say i enjoyed this is one of those set in chechnya it's a war story that was extremely difficult at times emotionally but still incredibly rewarding and i benefited from reading it writing was pitch perfect story was heart wrenching characters were so very very human highly recommend this subject material is tough but i think books that make you think and broaden your perspective should be on everyone's reading list","1808":"not a feel good book but still somehow beautiful and haunting in its stark depictions of a ravaged chechnya during their first and second war with the russian federation it weaves the story of about five or so characters who are tied together through blood or happenstance it bounces around quite a bit both with the characters and with the year but it's so tightly woven that it adds rather than detracts from the story","1809":" the most beautiful language i have read in recent times constellation of vital phenomena defines life in all its extenuating circumstances and shows that there is always a thin thread of hope in the worst situations there is a breathless quality to the narration as if the need to pen emotions is urgent and you end up getting caught just as the author intended every single character is finely defined pitch perfect you know them you end up feeling for them this book will stay with me for a long long time","1810":"this is the best book i've read in a very long time his characters are raw every one of them marra switches between different points of view and between differing time periods but the transitions are smooth and it adds rather than causing confusion this is a deeply moving book","1811":"amazing even more so considering it is marra's first sad to think that it likely only downhill from here","1812":"blah don't waste your time or money i am not sure where the 4 stars came from","1813":"i didn't want to read a book about chechnya i really didn't but i'm drawn to great writing like a moth to a flame and in a constellation of vital phenomena anthony marra has created one of the most lyrical most descriptive novels i have read the first two sentences of the book should be enough to rope in the writers among us on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemonies while the girl dress akhmed who hadn't slept at all paced outside the bedroom door watching the sky brighten on the other side of the window glass the rising sun had never before made him feel late marra weaves a wonderful tale through vivid characters akhmed is the 'moral chechen' of the piece and thank god for marra's characterization here because his may be the first moral chechen character i've seen in western media culture havaa is the link between the symbolic village wasteland of eldar and the future of her country sonja is the aggrieved russian doctor looking for a reason to stay after the loss of her sister marra's roster of fully developed characters goes about nine or ten deep and as the mysteries wrapped themselves up over the final 80 pages of the book i found myself alternating between amazement for his gifted storytelling and heartbreak as each character met its fate","1814":"well done well written interesting satisfying","1815":"wow 4 1 2 stars i agree with everything katie said this is one of the best written books i have read in a while there were several times where i stopped and re read a sentence or paragraph because it was just so well crafted and elicited so much emotion i wanted to figure out exactly how the author did it the characters are real and endearing and i loved the way we learned about all of them very gradually and how everything about them made more and more sense the more backstory we learned the themes of family sacrifice grief and redemption are all very strong in this book i wish i understood more about the chechen wars than what i learned from wikipedia when i started reading this book sometimes i got a little lost with the names of places and opposing sides and who was fighting whom but that is a problem with my own ignorance this book is heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time the depictions of the atrocities of war are graphic and shocking but crucial to the story parts of this book made me so emotional i felt like i could hardly breathe i recommend this one to all","1816":"this is kind of the perfect novel marra makes connections that are seamless every plug fits into every outlet and there really are no loose ends as beautiful and seemingly flawless as i feel this is it was difficult for me to reconcile the content with the presentation it's a personal preference of mine to have novels with war as a main theme presented in a messy manner and this felt too organized for me 4 5","1817":"harrowing","1818":"within pages i found myself transported to war torn chechnya less that 10 years ago in this amazing novel of loss betrayal hope and survival in a country that was bombed into the 3rd world by 2 wars within 30 years it is wonderfully written with compelling characters and vivid landscapes a must read","1819":"a beautifully written book a painful story as one would expect of a war setting so many memorable phrases to linger over","1820":" it's rare to read a book that transforms the reader physically but that is exactly what marra has done with this haunting novel there are moments so intensely tangible that i had to stop reading to allow my body a chance to recalibrate the story is painful and full of truths that most of us had never been aware of and sends us down paths that force us to examine our role in this constellation of humanity this is one of the most compelling novels i have read in many years and i'm not quite sure how to move forward with another book","1821":"very affecting beautifully constructed and written more to come","1822":"historical fiction at it's absolute finest beautifully poetic prose characters that cultivate empathy and compassion and haunting honesty about the tragic realities of war","1823":"excellent contemporary historical fiction","1824":" 3 75 stars really in the last war between chechnya and russia a man from a small chechen village is disappeared and a family friend rescues his daughter and takes her to a hospital in the nearby town there one ethnically russian surgeon attempts to keep an entire hospital running by herself with the help of a couple of nurses the family friend pleads with the doctor to let the girl stay with her the book goes back and forth between memories of the characters before the war during the first war and the present there are a lot of sad stories and a lot of hope my favorite character was the overworked doctor and the title of the book comes from a particularly good passage the surgeon tries to calm down after an amphetamine driven night and ensuing hallucinations by reading her old medical dictionary it starts to comfort her in its dullness and then she sees a definition she'd circled years before life - a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation an interesting definition overall but i found it particularly amusing that \"irritability\" was included even if the medical definition is slightly different than the way it's typically used overall pretty good book","1825":"loved this i'm pathetically ignorant of these wars that occurred during my adult life this was a really beautiful incredibly complex story","1826":"if anyone had said that a book about the victims of war in chechnya would be one of the best books i've read in a long time i would have been very skeptical but that's exactly what it is superb","1827":"devastating and beautiful","1828":" i read the first sentence of the book that i now know by heart because i have resommended this book to so many people \"on the night that russians had burned down her house and taken away her father haavaa dreamt of sea anemones i read it and it was so powerful even more so because in the french translation i read the two parts of the sentence rhyme that i thought to myself yes sure i'll read the 450 remaining pages and i wasn't disappointed a single minute the style is both incredible and surprisingly delicate for the horrors it describes the story is gripping your gut and never letting go until the end and the characters are so well depicted you have the lingering feeling once you close the book that you have left some dear friends behind this has left me in tears more than once without ever once being melodramatic a true masterpiece","1829":" this is a hard book to review while it is exceptionally well written and constructed the story can be draining it covers the two chechen wars and the decade between 1994 2004 the disappearances atrocities and man's unending cruelty toward his fellow man weigh heavily in this vivid portrayal of man's lesser attributes the characters are finely drawn and several will stay with the reader the plot successfully pieces together the relationships between time events and the characters' motivations that tragically define their future in fact this novel will haunt its audience and is an evocative testament to the horrors of war sadly realized by civilian populations","1830":" this is a book that grips from the beginning it is so disturbing yet so important the story is of a chechnya torn apart by war and the russian army that occupied it it is an unknown story for most of us and all i had ever remembered were the terrorists from chechnya who took over a theater in moscow while this is an important book to read it is also written by a first time novelist his writing is gripping and really good i would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a fantastic book you won't soon forget it","1831":"heart breaking and uplifting in equal measures constellations was a welcomed look into the lives of those touched by war the characters were the best part of an immensely talented authors vision and were a joy to be introduced to throughout the story humor was sprinkled in which heightened the depths of despair some of the characters faced moving novel with boundless treasures for the reader","1832":"quite simply one of the best books i've read in years heartbreaking and hopeful in equal measures","1833":"incredibly moving and beautiful story i took my time to read most often listening to the audiobook something i would like to read again to pick up more incredibly talented author","1834":"it has been a long time since i had read a book as good as this i could not put it down even in sunny jamaica this book has also inspired me on a war story i have been working to continue and flesh out the characters more the only issue i had was with the title and how he tried to tie it in the book it just did not seem to fit if there is one book you should read this year it is this one its haunts my dreams","1835":" i'd probably give this a 4 5 rating isn't the cover gorgeous the story takes place in war torn chechnya akhmed finds his neighbor's little girl in the woods with a blue suitcase after her father is taken by the secret police to protect her from the soldiers he takes her to the only hospital to stay with the only doctor the doctor is less than happy with the arrangement but over the course of five days they come to understand how their lives intersect the book contains trafficking of women war situations torture informants mass murder etc with moments of mercy love and tenderness beautifully written adult content","1836":"reviewing this book is difficult because my emotions are all over the place generally i believe i was less impressed by this book than others when considering the absolute rave reviews on goodreads i would not call this book a page turner it was not enjoyable in fact the book is thoroughly depressing i was hoping to develop more insight about the wars in chechnya but i did not i did however learn much about feelings and effects of war in general the characters were perfectly imperfect and therefore relatable the ending hit me like a pile of bricks the author tried too hard to make all people and events inter related even when the connections were unnecessary and extraneous to the plots and themes they were added as asides distracting some amazing quotes i hope to always remember i found in this book how often is immense sadness mistaken for courage it's stupid there are maps to show you how to get to the place where you want to be but no maps that show you how to get to the time when you want to be he was in love and thus capable of infinite hate \"if ever there was a season for constipation it was winter \" in the end glad i read it thanks jen","1837":"fantastic book about a subject not known to me chechnya the story revolved around memorable characters and you knew that in time you would find how they were connected highly recommended","1838":"brilliant marra deserves all of the praise he has received this is as fine of a first novel as you are likely to find it is layered complex compelling and wholly original","1839":" what an interesting book and worthy of the accolades character driven written in elegant prose filled with powerful imagery this densely written story chronicles lives of those involved in the chechen wars with russia in 1996 and 2004 not those who fought but those who had to live amidst the fighting and who survived or didn't the non linear style alternating between the two time periods and showing characters' lives in both intensifies the layers of characters and story and how lives intertwine and the stories of characters intersect it's a heartbreaking story but ultimately upbeat in the fashion of some 19th century narrator our narrator here spins out the lives of characters major and minor beyond the boundaries of the story in a very satisfying fashion it's a sobering story that i confess i wasn't that familiar with marra makes the personal stories of the characters universal so that they represent not just this war but how lives are affected in wartime for bad and good rich in difficult themes as well worth a read or a listen the title is from a definition of life in a russian medical dictionary everyone has a story and when these stories intertwine they create a constellation a manifestation of lives together","1840":"the best book i've read this year brilliant beautifully written heartbreaking and hopeful glad i bought a copy because i will re read this in the future","1841":"it's rare for me to be so disappointed in a novel i had fairly high hopes for this one especially considering the glowing reviews but it just didn't deliver set in chechnya in the 90s and early 2000s the novel seeps us in war i followed the conflict in chechnya closely and am familiar with its brutal modern history i have no qualms about the brutality of war but i felt like i was seeing the world through a dirty lens marra is really in love with his own writing this is writing for the sake of writing not writing to tell a story the plot here is disjointed and the characters speak in stilted archaic prose that felt styled and flat havaa especially rang false to me even for a child from a war torn country she was awfully mature for an 8 year old i live with a bright 7 year old and can tell you that no kid talks like that the book meanders every which way filling us in on the characters' backgrounds but their motivations and reasons for being feel contrived much unnecessary detail is included which serves to further bog down an already tedious story i started skimming just to get through it and that's never a good sign","1842":"i will think on this book and come back to write my review my rating may change 7 3 13 so i have had a week to think about this at first i was really not enjoying this book the writer's style was hard to follow i found myself re reading passages and going back to previous chapters but with that said i do find myself thinking about the characters and their struggles during this war i learned allot about chechnya and i love to learn about countries cities and the history while i'm reading however i do think this book may receive awards or nominations i wish i could say that i loved it","1843":"beautiful perfect it's just one of those books that i fall into and never want to end it is an actual work of literature and not just a novel and deserves serious consideration and even immediate study as the story is one of history and current events the definitions had the stately reassurance of orthodoxy reminding her of the prewar years when she had relied on the reference book to complete her weekly assignments when she had sat at her desk her ears plugged with cotton balls as that awful thudding natasha called music had pounded from the next room when she still believed the meaning of a thing was limited to a few tersely worded clauses but nothing she now knew could be defined in exclusion and every bug pencil and grass blade was a dictionary in itself requiring the definition of all other things to fulfill its own that's a run on sentence a teacher can let slide i'll write more when i can wrap my head around it better","1844":"sometimes difficult to read due to the horrific acts but am glad that i read it","1845":"at first i would've given this 4 stars but it grew grimmer and more gruesome as the story unfolded this book details the horror of war while telling a truly humanitarian tale","1846":"a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marraset in the two chechen conflicts in the 1990's a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra combines the shocking brutality of war and betrayal with the complexities of familial loyalty and love to form a narrative so compelling and moving each chapter is a story unto itself the novel follows the lives of eight characters as they desperately fight for survival the wars have left them bereft of a society an infrastructure and even a cultural history they fight to remember they struggle to forget and they all struggle to forge a life marra challenges the reader to provide their own definition of a life and defines it as a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation the characters claw their way through these phenomena linking two narratives based on islamic and christian traditions that of a parent asked to sacrifice a child and that of an orphan delivered into a family responsible for orphan hood as the characters struggle to salvage what is left of their lives amidst the years of a viscous russian onslaught you yearn for life's peace and love and redemption in the cold and stark reality of marra's imagined hell they surface only briefly but when they do appear they glow with a haunting warmth","1847":"wow there were moments while reading this book that i thought i couldn't continue reading the amount of pain and despair is often too much to stomach but by the end marra won me over what an incredibly well written mesh of characters and storylines","1848":"loved this book for me it took a while to understand and feel invested in the characters but wow anthony marras writing made me stick with it and i am so happy i did","1849":"this was a riveting story about a subject i knew little well written","1850":"a beautifully crafted tale of interwoven destinies set against the horror and madness of the chechen wars rich complicated characters difficult moral choices and a powerful sense of place and culture highly recommended","1851":"i would give the first 150 or so pages 2 stars but then after that i would give it 5 stars","1852":"love this book love the writing fantastic story","1853":"this is an incredible book heart wrenching poignant almost poetical at times the story is wonderfully written but not one that i would naturally gravitate towards--life in chechnya during its first and second wars but the people in the story were so compelling and believable and the storyline was incredibly engaging it was powerful and will stick with me for a long time","1854":"i wish i could give half scores because i would rate the book at 4 5 instead of 4 stars very well written an enjoyable read but personally not a perfect book","1855":"this is anthony marra's first novel a remerkable fact it's an elegant book beautifully crafted and structured rather than a linear chronology marra treks from one year to another between sometimes in the 1990s and 2004 the setting is chechnya and the story revolves around the disappeared and the living young havaa whose father is seized and never returns akhmed a neighbor who takes her to a hospital where surgeon sonja a native russian will care for her and a slew of others who emerge full blown the brutality of russian attempts to muzzle the muslims of chechnea provides the setting and in the process the author manages to provide intimate glimpses into the lives of all concerned the structure the weaving from one year to another takes a bit of getting used to but believe me it is worth it and the writing one example for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric and there are so many more a powerful novel","1856":"i loved it a constellation of vital phenomena is one of those novels you read and instantly want to re read i actually did that as i was a little distracted when i began reading it i loved marra's poetic prose","1857":"this is such a powerful book i haven't been able to finish a book for a good long while but this one i couldn't put it down the stories of the characters are so gripping in a time and situation that i didn't know that much about it definitely makes me want to read more about chechnya the time shifts were a little jarring at times but i absolutely love this book and highly recommend it it has definitely become one of my all time favorites","1858":"marra's writing reminds me of ann patchett's it has that same crystal clear beauty like an untouched stream deep in the woods it was a bold choice to tackle such an immense and relatively unknown issue as the chechen conflicts for one's first novel but marra nails it by focusing instead on the stories of very human very ordinary people whose lives just happen to take place under extraordinary circumstances he manages to keep us from feeling helpless succumbing to the existential darkness that might accompany such a novel by showing us the light within even these seemingly ashen lives the constellation of vital phenomena the connection of disparate forces to create life is not just within us as sonja's text might explain but it includes the connections between us as well between a father and son a man and a woman a friend to a friend the connections that give this story what you might even call a happy ending even in the face of the continuing struggles and those still to come full review to come later this week at rb http wp me pgvzj ra","1859":"an incredibly well constructed and written story but not the kind of book you can say you enjoyed reading as i started it i thought what a terrible book to read over holiday break but i've changed my mind a book like this makes you all the more appreciative of what you have especially during happy times","1860":"beautiful and well written but at the same time grim and full of atrocities of a horrible war i don't know that i would have chosen to read it had i known how tough a book it was glad it is finished","1861":"i did not know much about chechnya or the multiple wars that have happened there in recent history this novel talks about the effects of living in a war torn country but is not as bleak as one might expect not that one should confuse that with any real happiness anyway glad to get some tears out on my flight home from a new england spring break and excited to stalk anthony marra around oakland and through whatever work he produces next","1862":"amazing book so wonderfully written it was sad haunting uplifting and comical in spots i really enjoyed the mix of story and history the characters are so vivid and their stories are so raw i absolutely loved this book","1863":"this book is dark and gloomy and makes you wonder if life has a purpose and that's exactly the point anthony marra deposits his readers in post war chechnya and allows them throughout the course of this pull you in and don't let you go read to harbor the same suspicions and fears as the complex characters who are not all as they seem the moral here is that people are damaged as capable of good as of bad thanks to who we are to start with and the situations that shape us as we become","1864":"god what a book it left me reeling it's at once both devastating and uplifting a difficult feat for any writer i have a special affinity for books that show all the little serendipitous ways that people's lives are interconnected and this book set against the backdrop of the second chechen war a subject i'm ashamed to admit i knew little about is no exception the cast of characters were wonderfully realized each of them at times tragically flawed broken hopeful and triumphant i also liked how marra would give brief powerful glimpses into the future lives of several minor or side characters reminding us that every character is the hero of their own tale marra is a gifted writer when needed his prose is simple and straightforward but just as often it shifts into beautiful poetic language creating a perfect balance of literary elegance and readability at first i found the way the book jumped around both in time and in pov a little disorienting but i soon realized that this was exactly the way the story needed to be told in order to truly portray the fragmented memories and experiences of all the characters it also allowed the interconnectedness of the characters to slowly reveal itself in surprising ways ultimately this is a story about sacrifice and family and the infinite power of hope it was at times a heart wrenching book to read but i'm glad i stuck through it because it was more powerful and inspiring than i could have anticipated","1865":" the author discovered the phrase \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" while paging through a medical dictionary the definition for life was given as a 'constellation for vital phenomena ' and \"organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaption\" the author chose this for his title as he wrote this novel to describe the lives of six characters in chechnya during a ten or so year period 1994 2004 this novel is amazing feat even more so as a first novel we learn of the destruction of a people the chechens that accelerated under stalin when tens of thousands were deported and their villages sat deserted from 1944 1957 chechens lived outside their traditional territory their history was nearly destroyed as were their libraries chechnya became home to ethnic russians as well as other ethnic groups such as ukranians fleeing famine this history permeates this story the ethnic chechens in the story are sufi muslims arab jihadis from the middle east primarily wasabis the conservative saudi branch of muslim arrive as \"liberators\" the chechens in this novel are caught between the wasabi \"rebels' and the russians because of the russian wars in chechnya the reader willthe primary characters are ahmed who rescues 8 year old havaa after her father is taken away by the russian army ahmed hikes 11 kilometers through mine strewn fields and roadways to a hospital to a doctor sonja and begs her to take care of havaa ahmed an incompetent doctor stays to work at the hospital that only has one other medical staff a nurse in her 70's ahmed leaves his invalid bed ridden wife ula only in her 30's but dying to fend for herself much of the time though a friend looks in another of ahmed's neighbors is a former academic and historian who devotes his life to writing a six volume 3 330 page history of chechnya in this bleak cold and devastated landscape we follow the lives of this group as they struggle to survive the novel speaks to the devastation of ongoing and repeated wars people survive one war one imprisonment only to be lost in another this story reminds us of other genocides and although chechnya is not widely recognized as such we become aware it has been the site of a continuous genocide throughout the 20th and into the 21st century it certainly fits the definition of genocide as the ongoing murderous efforts to obliterate a people chechens long to know what has happened to their lost loved ones they sew the names of their villages into the seams of their clothing hoping their bodies will be returned there marra does give us glimpses into the futures of surviving characters here and there reminding us that one survivor can carry on this history this ethnic group and their memories in doing so and describing the valiant efforts of the characters to survive a tragic story becomes heroic i read this book in less than three days finding it hard to put down i highly recommend it","1866":"this is a wholly engaging book and i can't believe it is the author's first published novel and he lives in oakland the story draws you in and is told over a short time period with flashbacks interspersed to the prior 10 years i enjoyed reading a book about the caucusus region in russia that wasn't about religious extremism and the people weren't portrayed as zealots but ordinary people that you or i might be friends with it also provided context for the ongoing problems in the region for national and ethnic autonomy vis a vis the ethnic russians after finishing the book i was so interested in chechnya the location of the story that i spent a few hours on the internet reading and looking at photographs","1867":" this was hands down the most beautifully written u0026amp well researched novel i've read all year i'd recommend it to anyone u0026amp i don't even recommend harry potter to everyone because some people just think magic use devil worship or something crazy anthony marra's debut novel tells of a romantic tragedy during a war stricken chechnya if you knew nothing of the wars then you'll know much of it upon completion it isn't written the way dan brown goes off on tangents to tell you tidbits of facts or history it is eloquently stitched into the story u0026amp gives each u0026amp every single character in the novel a history u0026amp a personality much like akhmed draws portraits of the missing or deceased to honor them marra paints draws animates u0026amp breathes color life love pain sorrow empathy sympathy compassion regret all the colors of human emotion into nearly every sentence every sentence serves a purpose u0026amp i've never read something so eloquently thought out the way marra uses each sentence like a painter uses his favorite brushes u0026amp colors to create his masterpiece each sentence is like that of a visible brush stroke on a monet you can see the motion u0026amp density of the stroke of paint up close but when you back up further you can see the painting in its entirety but still see the brush strokes i loved that every character no matter how minuscule was presented with a backstory u0026amp future you knew what happened to everyone u0026amp it's uniquely satisfying you're not wondering what happened to the colonel with the dental floss stitches because his story is told u0026amp woven into the whole of the book so marvelously any side story isn't just fodder or fluff it is a portrait of the life of a chechen or russian living during this time period from the beginning to the end your fondness u0026amp respect for the characters marra has created grows it took me much longer to finish this book because i never wanted it to end i didn't want to see the characters have a love affair if it would be doomed i didn't want to see that haava would be orphaned hopeful that they find her dad u0026amp kick some fed booty i didn't know how it would end but i'm more than satisfied with it because happy endings for characters you love are overrated the endings that touch you are much more satisfying to read u0026amp what becomes of natasha sonja dokka haava ramzan khassan ula u0026amp akhmed were simultaneously surprising unpredictable u0026amp never contrived humanity is well preserved in all the characters no matter how cruel they may be they all have a reason i'm infatuated with this novel u0026amp i can't wait for another from marra","1868":"i had such high hopes for this book due to all the 5 star ratings unfortunately i could only make it 3 4 of the way through the book i found the detailed writing style and copious amounts of russian history to be overwhelming and cloud the plot so dissapointing","1869":"i might give this 3 5 stars but mostly because of my own deficiency in knowing anything about chechnya and its centuries of conflict an understanding of the region and its history would have helped me keep track of the story lines and characters better but overall this is very well written and moving","1870":"beautifully written almost poetic prose the story jumps around a bit in time and can be rather confusing in the beginning almost like a glossary of characters is needed it's a slow build but love loss and the unexpected drive the novel","1871":"post war chechnya serves as the backdrop to this stark tale of violence and survival marra's writing is nothing short of brilliant peeling back the layers of oppression to find the grains of humanity","1872":"what an amazing wonderful book it was so hard to read in places but i am so glad that i kept reading love and friendship does triumph in the end loved it another top book of 2013 for me","1873":" i picked up this book because of a goodreads recommendation based off life after life and the luminaries both of which were fantastic reads earlier this year and for once the goodreads algorithm churned out something good which is strange this book doesn't quite fit the same mold as those other two books it is historical fiction but instead of the time period being early 1900s the time period is just 10 to 20 years ago nor does this book have the fantastical elements nearly magical realism in a sense that the other two books have instead this book is much more grounded in reality and the grounded reality isn't a reality that many would want to explore chechnya during the two civil wars is a time period that sadly i know little about but now want to learn more for much of the west the cold war story ended with the fall of the berlin wall but for so many former and current soviet states that is when the story really began and while this story doesn't get too much into the nitty gritty political background it does present an ever present tone in the book of desired freedoms repression struggles and despair despite that heavy overtone there is a poignant optimism present throughout the book it focuses on six main characters who go through various challenges family career emotional trauma revenge etc over a nearly 20 year period all with the chechnian war surrounding them none of them were directly involved in the conflict but all suffered and were forced to find a way to live in it the book starts out with tragedy but is able to quickly move forward and present s plot that intersects and weaves through the characters lives and connect them all together the story does move backwards in time fairly often but despite this it is able to maintain a sense of looking forward hence the optimism this is primarily done via a technique that i had never seen before and for which i sincerely applaud the author for attempting and executing to near perfection the technique is rather simple what marra does is take minor background characters and give them a background story but alo a foreground story what i mean by this is that even miniscual characters who only land on the page for a paragraph get resolution they get an ending sometimes it is a quick ending sometimes it is a long ending but everyone gets an ending and for the most part most of them are happy for example a woman the character meets at a cabstand is given a short background that she grew up on a lemon farm and then given a short synopsis of the rest of her life that soon she would for the first time try a lime to do this marra had to look into the future and see a hope for chechnya and its people that allowed for the possibility of joy and happiness that more than anything else struck me hard that a book about one of the worst places to live over the last 15 years due to war poverty illness repression and 1984esque brutality on both sides that from the eyes of the author there is a potential for good to come about marra doesn't nor should he be expected to give a receipe for how this sort of good can come about but he does provide a hope and that for now is enough","1874":"sobering to the point i had to put it down and return often the characters kept calling me back and their voices needed to be heard marra's delicious writing overpowered my weak stomach but so happy i turned the last page i thought of sonja at that moment knowing it would have been her first page and sad she wouldn't have read the book incredibly researched with volumes of great dialogue in the end this exchange from ramzan to his father was my favorite for it sums up how i feel about war for a man whose life revolved around academic texts the shift to pulp fiction announced his paternal worry with the volume of a bullhorn you've read it before twice who wins the americans or the russians both his father said glancing to the frost filled windowpane then who loses everyone else","1875":"mr marra is an incredibly gifted writer the story is profoundly moving i found it deeply disturbing but ultimately hopeful i'm so overcome actually that i'm going to have to compose myself before i compose a review","1876":" this stunning debut novel from a local to me writer is unusual in having not even a suggestion of the usual thinly veiled autobiography or bildungsroman about it instead it's set in wartime chechnya a region anthony marra didn't even visit until he'd finished his last draft i understand he only had to correct one minor detail as a result of his brief tour of the place he had researched so carefully i stayed up all night reading this story so completely was i immersed in the world marra had created on the page my only quibble with it is that all the characters speak with a very similar voice full of black humor and a sense of the absurd even the eight year old girl that voice however is so good the writing so sure the imagery so vivid that i didn't mind everyone comes from the same culture with similar trauma so why shouldn't they speak with similar voices marra is a masterful writer who bears watching and this is a very humane book the characters are compelling the description fine without being overwritten the story at once tragic and joyful this is stark understated drama not melodrama though it deals with horrific events it's possibly the best work of fiction i've read this year","1877":"what a powerful book i didn't want to put it down but found myself having to stop to gather my thoughts to let all i read sink in and to breathe the plot was riveting and the characters were so vivid that they seemed to jump out from the book i found myself so accepting of their decisions emotions and actions and because they were so well developed events that normally i would find upsetting seemed real and understandable","1878":"i loved this novel it is one of my favorite books i don't think it's a light reading but definitely a must read if i could i would give it 6 stars","1879":"lovely writing and sentiment the historical context did not interest me so that backdrop made it difficult for me to get interested in this book i made myself finish it as i had read so many positive reviews just not my cup of tea dark and raw themed","1880":"history in novel form in this case chechnya between 1994 and 2004 the story is told by jumping back and forth in time i found this tedious it was only toward the end of the book when i had accumulated enough information about the individuals' histories that the story became interesting in the end the plot held together and came to a reasonable ending for which the author deserves credit but the writing itself had no spark or sparkle to it so for me only faint praise this is a very bleak portrayal of chechnya its culture and people as evil as the russians were it was hard to generate a lot of sympathy for the chechnyans","1881":"some books are page turners others are simply entertaining or good well written or even excellent a constellation of vital phenomena is an important book it is not perfect but what a reach young anthony marra enclose in his embrace a mismatched pair of doctors one russian the other chechen an orphaned eight year old a benefactor of refugees a political informer his historian father and the heroin addicted victim of sex trafficking all caught up in the strife of russian chechen warfare it is the kind of book that when i finished i felt as if i should go back to page one and start again marra never quite masters transitions between time shifts and his generally beautiful prose sometimes stumble upon unlikely metaphors and images but the horrors of brutality and depredation the nobility of loyalty and mercy have never been more glowingly transcribed moments of magical realism humor and irony lighten the desperation of the story's principals marra provides us many pieces to this jigsaw puzzle of human nature the final picture is hopeful as well as chastening","1882":"i have to be honest i read the 1st third of the book and skipped to the last 40 pages as other readers suggested the book had received such great reviews that i kept trying but i really did not like or enjoy it","1883":"this is hard to write a review but this tells the story of two wars of chechnya the people the people who went missing the book is told n divisions of days but with going back and forth a great book that was hard to put down i found this book you had to pay attention","1884":"this book provided a deeper context on the chechnya conflict told through a lovely relationship established among the central characters however the storytelling did not move me like others who have discussed it","1885":"beautifully written first book prose to linger over setting is wartime chechnya but lovely book all the same","1886":"so i loved this book but it is not for everyone it is tough depressing tense and not uplifting but the story is engrossing eloquently written best ever and the story is beautiful yet difficult five star for me definitely worth the read","1887":"i couldn't put this book down it is so moving and the writing of past present and further of lives intertwined was amazing loved this book","1888":" i couldn't fully appreciate or understand the plot of this book because of the setting and historical connections that i'm unfamiliar with also the jumping back and forth between dates was hard to keep track of the writing was a bit too flowery for me too despite all that there were parts i enjoyed i liked how all the characters had at one point been impacted by each other whether they knew it or not i liked how it told the modern history of chechnya through the use of compelling storytelling i think i would have to read it again to get all the stories straight what i liked most about the ending was that it ended on a hopeful note havaa was a source of hope for all the characters and she survives to live a long happy life","1889":" this book was amazing even though my knowledge of the chechen wars are limited to what i have heard on the news and the basics that i have been acquainted with through reading of history i was immediately drawn in to the tale of akhmed sonja and havaa three characters of very different ages and personalities who have been brought together by their acute sense of loss and loneliness there are so many lines from this book that left a lasting impact such as a quote from ramzan we're beyond obligation we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are another line that really stuck with me was and in between the creation of this body and its end lay the mystery the girl would spend her life solving in the backdrop of the chechen wars and in a world full of suffering marra manages to tell a tale that reveals much about the human psyche and the ability to hope even when it may seem like there is nothing left to hope for he tells a tale of how three unlikely souls are able to come together and forge a bond when there is nothing else going for them and to move towards a love that ends up strengthening them innumerably there is great character development in this book throughout the chapters more is revealed slowly about how the characters ended up in their present state and why they have certain personality traits this book revolves around a central message that even in the worst of times even when one's humanity is being threatened an immense spinning joy can still occur even though it describes extremely bleak circumstances it is a novel of hope and love and a testimonial to the strength of the human spirit marra's work is definitely dense he does tackle ten years and tries to squeeze in a lot of chechen history but he does a beautiful job of bringing together historical context while developing his characters and plot a constellation of vital phenomena is a brilliant read and i sincerely hope that it will become a part of the literary canon in the future","1890":"one of the most gorgeous books i've read in a long long time","1891":" marra has such a different writing style than every other author that i've read it took me about 30 pages to get used to it but once i got used to it i was totally pulled into this book i had never heard of chechnya before reading this book and i had no idea russia was still doing the same stuff they were pulling in the 1940s even though this book can't really be considered historical fiction because it takes place only 10 years ago it still read very much like historical fiction this story is so wonderfully written i love being educated and entertained at the same time there was one miner detail in the book that i didn't care for that had to do with infidelity but the rest of the book gets a perfect 5 stars","1892":"harsh heartbreaking beautifully written i learned a lot through the book and through research that the book inspired","1893":"by far my favorite new book i have read this year my heart was aching at the end with such sadness but the beauty in the writing and the hopeful smile i left with at the end make every page worth it this novel is so very good","1894":"i try to be discerning in giving five stars to a book to really distinguish between books i like and books that are of very high literary value a constellation of vital phenomena is five star quality by both accounts the most notable thing is the beauty of the prose the rhythmic flow and structure are very pleasing and i found myself reading aloud in order to fully appreciate it the story is heavy handed in its sadness and the writing style helped me get through it the book is inevitably devastating because it is about a little talked about tragedy in modern european history the chechen wars in the 1990s i think it is a subject that most americans do not know much about and neither did marra as he says in the questions section in the back of the book he was studying in st petersburg when he started to hear about it and it touched his heart he felt that fiction was the way to get at the essence of the pain and chaos that war causes i agree with this concept fiction touches on a part of our humanity that a nonfiction narrative of events just cannot fiction reveals other kinds of truth the timeline is twofold the current time in the book is a five day period in 2004 but the backstory moves back and forth over a ten year period in this way marra creates fluidity in memory and experience it is also reveals the isolation of each character for they all have their own backstory some characters stories' influence others without them ever realizing it and the effect is haunting achmed and sonja are the two protagonists both of them have been dealt serious blows because of the wars and they are trying to get through life as quietly as they can achmed is an incompetent doctor who has an artist's soul and sonja is a self created master surgeon achmed is optimistic while full of dread and sonja is exhausted cynical and yet self sacrificing their characters are complex as they rediscover their value systems in an attempt to save a neighbor girl havaa this book is too special to spoil plot points so i won't say more if one can get past the sadness and tragedy of the plot one will see that the characters are actually full of hope a desire for peace and prosperity beyond the rules of survival and have a real thirst for life there are moving passages that keep playing over in my head marra has taken a complicated war and complex characters and created a masterpiece it is his debut novel and if he can keep pace with himself i can't wait to read any further offerings","1895":"not a light read but it paints a clear picture of the devastation of war and it's destruction of the human spirit i learned so much about chechnya and loved the writers voice and the weaving together of the characters to form a heartbreaking story","1896":"outstanding beautiful writing interesting story and i wish i had taken longer to savour this book 5 days three people thrown together and lives are intertwined changed explained you don't need to know anything about chechnya to be able to enjoy this i didn't the time shifting takes a bit of getting used to and the first half of the book i was somewhat bewildered as to why i was getting all this extraneous information the patterns threads start pulling together around half way through keep going it is worth it","1897":"packs an emotional wallop","1898":" chechnya has apparently spent most of its existence in a state of war occupation or extreme instability it's not something that many americans know a lot of about myself among them i knew the term chechen rebels would pop up in newscasts once in a while but i didn't really know what that meant in the grand scheme of things a constellation of vital phenomena illuminates the lives of several people in a small chechen village during the second chechen war havaa a young girl whose father has been taken by the russians akhmed a failed doctor who would have rather been a painter and must now find a way to keep the girl safe sonja the surgeon who runs the region's hospital with a coldness harvested from her own loss ramzan the gun runner turned informant whose own father refuses to speak to him natasha the heroine addict who spends most of her life just trying to get out these characters are richly drawn their lives threaded together by coincidence blood and obligation if i am to be completely honest this was a hard book for me to read the difficulty came from two sources the gruesomeness of the subject matter and the concentric circularity of the narrative there are graphic descriptions of torture medical procedures and a young child making a scarecrow out of the decapitated head of one of her peers if you are even the slightest bit queasy you are going to have a lot of trouble with this book i occasionally had to put it down and focus on something else because of the brutality marra's story moves around spanning the decade between 1994 and 2004 i can't even say it bounces back and forth it's more like he slides around he slowly reveals the connections between the myriad characters and my unfamiliarity with chechen history and honestly the names sometimes made it hard for me to keep everything straight ultimately though the story contained within these pages was worth the effort there's many layers of meaning and ideas justifying the murder of children the persistence of hope in a hopeless land what it means to be alive even the ugliest parts are written so beautifully it's hard to believe that this is a debut novel i've always thought marx's view on religion was the one thing he got right faith is a crutch if you step on a land mine akhmed said the crutch becomes the leg take your time with this one it'll give you a lot to think about and it'll break your heart but you will be unable to stop reading","1899":"this book knocked the air right out of me all of the blurbs on the cover are absolutely right on a little hard to get into but boy oh boy can this man write grim tender powerful breathtaking in every way read this book","1900":"good story but there were too many parts that were slow moving i'm sure others would argue story and character development but i didn't think a lot of it necessary","1901":"this is such a wonderful book i was given it at a conference by chance and i'm so thankful to the person who handed it to me because i probably never would have chosen it myself the novel is set in chechnya going back and forth between the early 90s and 2004 but you can easily find out the plot so i won't describe the whole thing here what i want to say is how beautiful the novel is how lovely the writing and how marra's touch with the traumatic events is just right sometimes you need to be shown the horror but not always and he knows just when to stop talking and does so elegantly and there is so much that is beautiful in the novel too just in what people are like i loved the way marra deals with time what happens to who and when and he does it so skillfully i've never seen it done this way before he reveals the stories of each character so well too you never feel manipulated as a reader because you find out the details of everyone's situation and life just when you should definitely definitely give this a try i can't wait for his next book","1902":"overall an interesting read though at times tedious and overly ambiguous","1903":"while a tear jerker it is a story well told clear and precise and vivid of a country that most of us know little about in some ways it is a common story of horror and disregard for human being while also being a celebration of humanity","1904":"every now and then a book comes along that restores my faith in the future of the novel all over again a constellation of vital phenomena is such a book how can a debut novelist write like this lyrically and searingly anthony marra has \"the gift\" and his work is more assured than writers who have toiled for years i'd like to say i was immediately captured by his novel but alas that wouldn't be true my lack of familiarity with war torn chechnya - indeed with russian history - distanced me at first a number of original and whimsical characters were woven into his rich tapestry of words and for many pages i wondered just why such and such character was being portrayed in great detail but then it all started coming together and - wow oh wow the title comes from a description of life in a medical book life is a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation a careful reading reveals that for this community of characters the description is quite apt the novel primarily takes place throughout a decade - from 1996 to 2004 - and a line graph at the top of each chapter centers the reader in the timeline there are three key characters - akhmed an incompetent doctor with a good heart...sonja a bone weary surgeon who labors each day at a bombed out hospital that serves as the only respite for those who have been injured...and havaa an eight year old girl who has already been forced to endure and lose too much many other secondary characters populate this epic tale including a beautifully detailed portrait of a damaged man who has turned informer ramzan all of these characters will become tied in an intricate web of connections that reveal how human fate is not just in our own hands but in the hands of all humanity the result is a haunting and original look into many universal themes ramzan says \"we're beyond obligation we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are \" or is it rather than embrace ramzan's view of the world this book shines a spotlight on the true meanings of love and sacrifice and the lengths we will go to connect and endure while heartbreaking at times the book at its core is hopeful and proves that an \"immense spinning joy\" can occur even when one's very humanity is threatened i view this constellation as a potential classic it is that stellar","1905":"great storyi read this book for my first book club it was very engaging and well written would definitely recommend this book","1906":" i found this story about a few days in the lives of 5 characters in a war torn chechnya to be both wrenchingly sad and hauntingly beautiful it is bare and horrifically matter of fact when introducing a village that has lost many of it's citizens to the feds through the testimony of a local informer the destruction of nearly everything is treated as commonplace and people live in a reality that is mind boggling when compared to my own reality it is not a simple or easy book to read it is complex in that it introduces a world i had never thought much about and the resulting culture and effects of war in a modern day setting it did take me a while to finish this since i started it at a really busy time in which i have less time to read as well as it is a story that requires concentration and focus to fully absorb i wish i had waited to read this when i had larger chunks of time to devote instead of reading it piecemeal a few pages every few days overall a timely informative read","1907":" let me first write that this was an excellent book then let me write that it was one of the hardest books i've read in a while not for the writing style but rather for the subject matter the writing style had me reading this book in one day some of the scenes were very difficult to read and while the book is fiction some of the aspects are based in reality and i'll forever be appalled at what one man can do to another i can't possibly recount the well derived plot any better than the synopsis provide above just know that the main story takes place over 5 short days with backstory encompassing 8 years and in reality a conflict of thousands of years mr marra's narrative draws you in from the very first page with a horror of war and keeps you turning the pages to follow the connections between the citizens of a small village a london trained doctor and little havaa the focal point around whom all the points turn for it is saving the life of this child that sets the whole plot in motion and only as the story unfolds do we understand just how connected we all can be the story is told in the present the past with sprinklings of the future that make it a fascinating experience for the reader you don't know from section to section what you might learn to help bring the story to its conclusion and all the pieces are necessary for complete understanding this is a book that requires attention but your attention is well rewarded i am keeping it for a second read as i expect i shall appreciate it even more on the second pass","1908":"simply one of the best and most beautiful books i have ever had the pleasure of reading marra has an undeniable gift for weaving the hauntingly beautiful narratives of humanity many times i simply had to stop and reread passages to cherish the language and depth of every word he has the skill to encapsulate the entirety of a person's life in one sentence that stretches over a page and a half and to make you ache for a mother of a man who cannot even be considered a supporting character in the book so what he does with the main cast is truly breathtaking and heartbreaking i'd recommend this to anyone","1909":"the writing is beautiful the characters fascinating the subject matter horrific","1910":"amazing heart moving brilliant writing","1911":" before reading this novel i knew nothing about chechnya i didn't even have any idea of where it was i just knew it was some country somewhere in the east but after reading this i found myself learning a lot more than i thought i would did you know there were 2 wars from the 90s all the way to the early 2000s i did now know that but now i do what surprised me the most was the fact that the feds would come and take people away no proof just the word of one informer and they would disappear that's terrifying to live in a world where you could just be taken one day with no explanation of why even your family would be taken because of something that you may or may not have done what this book revealed to me that reading this out of a textbook is that there can be good times in darkness yes there is war and poverty and fear everywhere but the characters in this novel did have moments where they laughed and rejoiced in the fact that they were there that they were alive this book goes back and forth between the present past and future which i loved to be able to know what is going to happen to that character 10 years down the road without having to read an entire book on it was great even background characters got endings leaving no loose ends everyone has a story and everyone's story was told in this novel the good the bad and the ugly overall this gets a 5 5 for being absolutely perfect and for teaching me something new","1912":"an extraordinary book using the war in chechnya http en m wikipedia org wiki chechnya as a canvass on which life is beautifully painted truth is only one among many hallucinations but life is a constellation of six vital phenomena organisation irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptation the pearl of faith had dissolved and at its core was a sand grain of doubt and he held on to it knowing that doubt like longing could sustain him","1913":"chechnya 2004 and flashbacks of chechnya 1994 enter a little known world plunge yourself into a village filled with informers rebels and nationalists among interesting and desperate villagers a badly damaged and largely unmanned hospital is beset by violence and sadness it is run by an angry doctor who is joined by a villager and young child who has witnessed the kidnapping of her father","1914":" 3 5 stars i liked this i did not like the use of time the story takes place over 5 days but was not told consecutively and included a ton of flashbacks as well as whatever the opposite of flashbacks is ~and they said goodbye to the woman who in eight years would meet the love of her life and in two years after that would go to the grocery on the corner of 2nd and elm and see a star that reminded her of today ~ not a direct quote obviously the characters were well drawn though and the relationships between the characters felt genuine","1915":"it was a difficult read a painful page turner though it was more because of the feeling of loss and conscious attachment to the characters it's a beautiful nightmare that needs to be read to be known it's not exactly a pleasant journey but the result is an overwhelming sense of appreciation for a brilliant author who paints countless lives with words","1916":"anthony marra is a gifted story teller and writer his well crafted words and phrases drew me into the dark and hopeless war in chechnya and his description of the killing and destruction haunted me his ability to capture the human side of war is what kept me reading especially his handling of the child havaa i look forward to his future books","1917":"this book was so good but i sort of wish i hadn't read it that's why i'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars the whole story is so sad and there are parts about torture that i really wish i could have skipped over if i had known they were coming very disturbing but also a great book","1918":"a wonderful read set in a place i knew very little of chechnya this is a novel full of human insights and flawed characters and definitely worth a read","1919":"chechnya 1993 through 2004 more than a decade after the fall of the soviet union with remarkable poignancy and a bit of humor marra keeps the focus on the relationships struggles and tiny triumphs of an unforgettable group of characters a wonderful first novel","1920":" a constellation of vital phenomenon by anthony marra is a stunning book it's about war it's about survival it's immensely sad while at the same time uplifting sonja leaves the comfort of london where she's finished her medical training and returns to her native chechnya in order to find her troubled younger sister natasha she finds herself not only unable to get out of the country but also the only doctor left in one of the few buildings still standing in this bleak war torn area she's working frantically to the point of exhaustion trying to save the few lives she can then natasha inexplicitly disappears and soon afterwards she inherits a war orphan there's no let up mentally or physically certainly not emotionally i hesitate to say this but the plot of a constellation of vital phenomena almost doesn't matter even while it's an important topic the few outside the small country of chechnya know much about the star of constellation is the writing marra prose is lovely and his storytelling is true the tragedy never overwhelms the sense of hope for humanity the character's struggles are universal even though extreme i came away from this book feeling i had a sense of what this region has been through but mostly with a better understanding of who we are as human beings a constellation of vital phenomenon by anthony marra is one of the highlights of my reading year this review is based on an advanced readers copy supplied by the publisher disclaimer given per ftc requirement","1921":"readers are snared in an expanding web of connected lives in war pocked early 21st century chechnya the writing itself is a phenomenal knitting of pasts and present hooking our sympathy with each compelling personal history cratered by war","1922":"deep passionate book this will stay with me for a while i knew virtually nothing about chechnya i know a bit more now but i think about all the countries where powers shift and the lives of every day people are upended this is a book to read more than once","1923":" i may yet change my rating of this book to 4 stars because i think it is such an important story to tell of the war in chechen over a time period of a decade in the late 1990's i felt lost throughout the novel not having a good understanding of the history of the struggles between russia and chechen the author did not focus on those facts so much as to tell the story of the lives of mainly 3 ordinary people looking to stay alive and find meaning in the chaos violence and rubble there is akhmed an incompetent doctor with a caring heart who would much rather be an artist there is sonja a surgeon who works relentlessly patching up injuries from the war in a hospital with few supplies and no payroll there is haava a young girl who is left an orphan with the death of her mother and the abduction of her father by the russians and i must mention akhmed's neighbour and childhood friend ramzan who sold his soul to the enemy to stop the torture and became an informant for the russians all of these lives intersect in a heartbreaking and tender way okay i am ready to change my rating","1924":"phenomena is phenomenala must read for anyone wanting to understand love and survival they twisted their souls around each other's miseries","1925":"the writing was very tedious and the characters almost unbearable attempts at sarcasm esp sonja's were very annoying i read all the one and two star reviews after reading listening to the book and i wholeheartedly agree with the large majority of them hard to get through hard to relate to or care about the characters repeated and poor use of flashbacks and flash forwards","1926":"a very fine first novel about the devastating consequences of the chechnyan wars tragic and ultimately uplifting constructed in temporally displaced pieces so that plot resolutions are hidden until the end sometimes has a magical reality quality","1927":"i had a bit of a struggle with this one due to my inadequate knowledge of the chechen wars while the book didn't really focus much on the history as it did on the characters that lived it i would still suggest taking a crash course on the history of chechnya to better appreciate the characters' individual feelings and the choices they made along the way the story jumps back and forth from 1994 2004 where in between we see the connection between each character and how they changed from each encounter natasha is arguably the central one to whom everybody else gravitates whether by choice or by chance i really like how the stories are arranged in a non linear fashion even if at times i feel a little bit lost of course everything is connected and each timeline unlocks a certain connection i also think i've never seen a set of such complex characters in one novel before each one his own bundle of contradictions and how i loved every single one of them ramzan included there's much to be learned from 'a constellation of vital phenomena' what it means to live whether its for revenge or regret redemption or absolution to say goodbye for one last time or to say hello and whether our choices mattered whether we should have done things differently had we known how things would end regret love forgiveness this is a rare literary piece one shouldn't pass up for another","1928":"one of the best debuts i've read in years a book that opens the eyes to we naive 'westerners' to some of the atrocities in chechnya in recent history definitely one i'll remember and come back to at a later time","1929":"beautifully written a raw and tender window into a world and existence news reports could never begin to illuminate what so many of us take for granted this haunting new perspective causes me to look at the struggles of my own life with wiser eyes","1930":"truly amazing book","1931":"4 5 4 75 5 stars i don't know but it was damn good 1 i know next to nothing about chechnya shame on me and i'm looking to the author's resources to learn more this book was a great way to dive into the problems showing us the lives of our characters instead of focusing on dates places details etc though now i'm interested in the details 2 anthony marra is a fantastic writer this is his debut novel people i can't wait to see what else he publishes 3 i will now admit i've been reading this book for three months i don't know something absurd especially for me the novel is set over the course of a few days though there are many many flashbacks mainly focusing at the beginning on three more like two characters and i was not getting into the rhythm of things but then i read an interview between marra and powell's where it was mentioned that every single character gets a little story even just a soldier we meet briefly gets at least one line if not a little more about his past or future and i thought wow that's awesome and what a lovely idea and then i wanted to look out for those and they're really there and so well done and then we hear from natasha finally and other characters like ramzan ooph ramzan and dokka and you start to see their connections more and the book just becomes really really great it took until chapter 12 page 167 for me to get there but i did and it was worth it really wonderful","1932":"good story i enjoyed the flash back and forward structure and how the characters experiences were woven together sometimes my mind wandered and i lost track of a character and their tale knew little of the setting until this story none of the themes were overdone always a big plus for me","1933":"wow it is difficult to believe this is marra's first novel this is a compelling read poetically written with convincing characters set in chechnya an area about which i knew very little i will do some on line research to supplement what i learned about their recent wars while reading this book i know i will recommmend this to my book club and of course i will want to read it again there is so much to savor","1934":"beautiful engrossing heartbreaking uplifting compelling haunting brilliant amazing this is a must read","1935":"what i knew about chechnya before i read this book could have been summed up in one sentence i take so much for granted it was hard to read about what the people in this country have gone through but it was also compelling and a real tribute to the human spirit","1936":"i think i'd give this book a 5 stars if it didn't have such a dark theme but he does a great job dealing with it opening up my eyes to serious dysfunction in another part of the world i like his style of putting episodes of despair by bits of hope i also liked his use of the english language and the plot i was warned it was a dark book which was not exactly my preference i still give it a solid rating","1937":"simply beautiful a wonderful web of flashbacks that show the beauty and brutality of families fighting to survive during the bleakest conditions two separate wars could throw at them amazing","1938":"beautiful brutal powerful tender a finely crafted delicately balanced story looking between the present 5 days in 2004 and the past during the chechen conflict 1994 2004 the novel examines how war effects individual lives a moving memorable story","1939":"this book was amazing i would not have picked this up for myself based on what little i knew about this book i received this book because it was the pick for the first edition club from odyssey books i am thrilled that they picked this book the story is told over five days after a man is 'taken' from his home by the feds russians in the five days it follows characters that are unknowingly deeply connected to each other in the five days the main characters reflect on their lives from 1994 2004 and different events that shaped them and brought them to their current situation i found the story powerful and moving the characters are very complex which match with the backdrop of two wars being fought in close succession things are not always as simple as 'doing the right thing' in times of war it becomes a matter of do you save yourself or do you do the right thing the novel does a good job of showing this paradox that plagues humans during wartime i would highly recommend this novel to anyone it is a great piece of literature","1940":"marra's debut novel is the interwoven story of the human casualties of war what it steals from people and what it creates i like how marra told mini stories about the past and or future of many of his minor characters the major characters are fleshed out lovingly as truths are revealed but not all of the characters end up knowing all of the truths this novel is based on two historically recent chechnyan conflicts it also serves as a reminder that horrifying things continue to happen today in the name of war above all however it is an affirmation of life and the bonds of love that tie us to one another","1941":"one of the most incredible books i have ever read i am stunned","1942":"my favorite book of 2013 by far","1943":"this complex and wonderfully written novel is worth not one but at least two reads in addition the book is thoughtfully and beautifully designed","1944":"a beautifully rendered heart wrenching book i devoured it","1945":" this is a book that is both wonderful and terrible all at once i agree with the critics that it is a masterpiece of writing but taking this plunge into a fictional representation of the real life hell of war torn chechnya is far from a happy experience the story begins in 2004 the morning after the russian military \"the feds\" have \"disappeared\" a villager named dokka orphaning his 8 year old daughter havaa a neighbor and friend the less than competent village doctor named akhmed comes to find her and takes her to the local hospital to see if the only doctor there sonja will take havaa into her care he has to act surreptitiously to avoid the other neighbor ramzan whom he suspects of having informed on dokka even ramzan's father khassan avoids ramzan although they live in the same house as the story unfolds we learn more about these damaged individuals trying to survive in a land in which one wrong step can detonate a land mine or perhaps worse yet call you to the attention of hostile authorities the feds are in the business of killing not only suspected insurgents but any relatives of those under suspicion in order to deter further disobedience to the russian hegemony sonja's patients are broken in so many ways by man or machine that she is astoundingly grateful when havaa arrives with intact limbs and an unbroken spirit still sonja has no time or energy physically or emotionally to take care of havaa especially while she is still mourning the absence unexplained like so many of the absences of her sister natasha the story occasionally flashes back to 1994 to fill in how these characters came to be who and what they are some of the answers can be found in \"the landfill \" a notorious torture camp that most of them have familiarity with for one reason or another as we segue back to 2004 we learn more about the confluence of events that brought these characters together and the dangers they face in trying to survive another day and in fact some will and some won't discussion this book tackles several thorny issues torture being among them always my focus when i hear or read about torture is not as much on the recipient of this ghastly process but on the practitioners what kind of people can do this to others what does it mean that they can what exactly does it take to cause people to see other people not as human beings but as objects to be used or abused and once they have crossed this line can they ever return the author does an excellent job of illuminating the thought processes of the victims those who are forced to balance the desire to remain loyal and to be the sort of people they think they are with the reality of instruments that gouge and amputate and sear and create incredible amounts of agony you think you will hold out but you don't really know the point at which fear and pain can break down any bravery convictions and love for others that you hold there is not so much insight on what makes a person a torturer but the perpetrators and abusers in this book are not the focus of the story and maybe there is no clear answer at any rate the book is also very much about the notion of family and what actually constitutes it what are the \"rules\" of love and allegiance or are there any we also get a hard look at the central role memory plays in our lives as much as any explosive in the ground it too constitutes a minefield for these survivors its sheer intensity and resulting tyranny over people the way it changes our perceptions and informs our actions and reactions how difficult it can sometimes be especially after traumatic experiences to move past it and get on with life and perhaps most centrally there is the question of what happens to humanity in the midst of conflict at one point akhmed asks \"is common decency too much to ask \" it is in fact the overriding question of this novel and one that i think each reader may answer differently evaluation this book is very impressive it is not only well crafted balancing blood and tears with love and humor and hope but rich in its ability to make the reader think about the issues presented and allowing us to imagine lives that hopefully are very foreign to the majority of readers this story especially the poignancy of sonja's evolution and the description of the transcendent tear producing last encounter between two friends will haunt me for a long time it would make an excellent choice for book clubs rating 4 5 5","1946":"the novel has beautiful writing and is an excellent story of a dark period in history after the fall of the ussr this work is remarkable for a first effort anthony marra fully deserves the awards and the praise he has received 4","1947":"amazing easily one of the 10 best books i've ever read","1948":"memorable characters and six degrees of separation like story will definitely take a visit to chechnya off my bucket list","1949":"great writing i was surprised to discover this was the author's first novel this book is about the characters but seeing how people survive during war can be haunting i would read another of his books","1950":"i wish i liked this more just couldn't stay focused with attention wavering throughout perhaps it's just me not being in the right mind space","1951":"anthony marra personalizes the situation in chechnya in his debut novel beautifully written but heartbreaking i love a novel that brings history to life","1952":" the book traces how the lives of a handful of individuals interweave and influence one another in wartime chechnya the story is haunting and well written with an amazing capacity to convey both the harsh realities and the moments of beauty that break in on the lives of the ordinary people caught up in truly desperate situations the present action of the book happens over the course of only a few days but the author skillfully uses memories to provide historical context and deepen the character development and their relationships to each other the structure of this book is so well done and so deliberately chosen that the timeline feels intuitive and you're never caught wondering where you are in space or time i'm not sure how that would come across in the audio version but in the print copy it worked brilliantly {read my full review here}","1953":"this book received excellent reviews it was beautifully written but disturbing an informative look at cultural and religious unrest in the former soviet union i would wake up at night thinking about this book it was particularly timely with the current charged situation in the ukraine","1954":"this beautiful book is set in war ravaged chechnya and features a cast of characters all inextricably linked unbeknowst to some of them the writing is utterly outstanding and i'd recommend the book without reservation to anyone who reads for the purity and beauty of language well crafted i could barely read the last few pages through my tears","1955":"the very title of this book make you feel like you'll like this book the big academic sounding words lend the belief that you'll come out on the other end of this book a smarter person heck maybe some people do this book is about several people although i'd say akhmed is probably the main main character akhmed is an artist who has a medical degree and graduated in the bottom 10th of his class he has two good friends in his village dokka whose life akhmed has always coveted and ramzan who later becomes an informer bad guy when dokka is taken by the bad guys akhmed steps in to save his daughter havaa by taking her to a hospital where he thinks she'll be safe and he offers his services in return sonja is the head doctor at the nearly abandoned hospital and she brings the circle to a close as we learn how closely all of these character's lives have been intertwined without them knowing i really wanted to like this book i bought it based on the excellent reviews as i usually get any book i have to say i found it pretty bland it's very wordy descriptive i found myself skipping paragraphs to get to the meat of the story some parts really kept my attention other parts i had to force myself to re read some sections i thought the material itself was good and the characters are interesting if not completely detailed but the excessive analogies and descriptions really bogged this book down for me","1956":"i liked this book and wanted to love it the one problem i had was the long tangents the book took there were too many long chapters on a character's back story had those been woven in a different manner i'd easily give it 4 stars","1957":"i love this narrative after the first 100 or so pages yes it's a heavy topic but the humanity that manifests throughout particularly in the conclusion lifts the spirit in spite of the awful backdrop","1958":" this is the first good book i've read in a very long time every time i opened the book was like opening a present i devoured chapters quickly often reminding myself to slow down and enjoy it the way i would if overzealously digging into an expertly crafted meal almost every sentence was extraordinary beautiful in construction marra is truly an artist skilled at telling a story developing characters and at drawing out human nature in the same at both its best and worst i loved this book so much i can't say enough good things about it it's depressing but also uplifting in a way i loved loved loved it please read","1959":"this is an unsettling read but so well done the intertwined stories of the chechen cast of characters tells the history of a region shattered by years of war and oppression the characters are all scarred from their lives in this area they are beyond trauma beyond terror beyond hope the psychological impact of living in such a place is very palpable and probably what i will remember the most from this book there is a thin thread of hope ever so thin that kept me reading very powerful book","1960":" 1st off let me say that the only thing i knew about chechnya before i read this book was that it's a war torn republic of russia ok now let me say that this book is absolutely breathtakingly incredible one of the best books i have ever read omg anthony marra's prose will break your heart it is haunting lyrical evocative the story is set in chechnya and mainly goes back u0026amp forth between 1996 u0026amp 2004 but marra also details the characters future in a beautifully prophetic way honest to goodness this author is masterful a constellation of vital phenomena revolves around a remarkable cast of characters whose lives are weaved together brilliantly by marra there is 8 year old havaa sonja a brilliant surgeon and akhmed oh how do i describe akhmed he is a doctor a friend a husband an artist there is rhamzan a traitorous tortured soul and his father khassan and there is natasha i so wish i would have read this with a book club so i could discuss every freaking brilliant detail of it read this book","1961":"a constellation of vital phenomenahow much do you know about chechnya and the wars and the occupation and the exiles if you are like me probably not very much and sometimes not knowing very much about something leads us to shy away from it it might be too much work for our lowly brains but i want to stop using that as an excuse i don't know anything about money so how can i make a budget i can't shut down my brain so how can i learn to mediate just because things are challenging does not mean that they are not worth it and i believe this book is worth it it is challenging tough raw and full of anguish but it exists these people in some form exist all of these things exist in real life and this story is based on true conflicts and it makes me grateful everyday to be born in canada but what is anything besides a random constellation of anguish and joy this is the story of many characters intersecting and coming to find each other we start with havaa an eight year old girl who watches russian soldiers burn her house and take her father the only people left now are her neighours akhmed and khassan akhmed wants to keep her safe so he takes her to the hospital the safest place he a failed doctor can think of here we meet sonja the sole surgeon remaining and her haunted thoughts about her missing sister natasha all of the characters come together and interweave so beautifully so randomly as such is life i found at beginning of the book i was having trouble getting into it but then after about a hundred pages i fell and i fell hard you began to really love the characters and want to know how they all got to the situations they are in the book is like a beautiful mysterious heartbreaking puzzle that you just can't wait to find out how all the pieces get together this book is told in a very interesting perspective jumping from the past to the present to the very far future i liked this about it it shows what happens to the characters far down the line and that makes for an interesting telling certainty no unanswered questions it gives hope in a hopeless world even if sometimes the world you live in seems to contain no hope wondrous","1962":"i gave this book 100 pages i couldn't get into it and didn't care much about the characters","1963":"fabulous it was nice to read a book that was well written i loved how beautifully the characters lives intertwined as the story unfolded a difficult and sad time to read about but told beautifully through the voices of anthony's marra's characters well done","1964":"i lived and died a thousand lives reading this book it has changed me and i will remember it always","1965":"heartbreaking dark humour full of flawed but beautiful human beings doing their best to have lives in the middle of war and strife set during the chechen wars this novel by passes the facts and settles you in the heart of the souls of those left behind","1966":"a wonderfully written novel moving compelling story and characters about hope and healing in the midst of war i loved it read my full review http bookbybook blogspot com ... fict ...","1967":"it took a while for all the threads to connect for me but the writing is exquisite marra uses some unique devices like describing a peripheral character by what they become not what they are in the present scene there were also several insightful sentences that in retrospect i want to write down and remember","1968":"anthony marra's debut novel a historical account of chechnya a wonderful story blending history and fiction my favorite kind of novel and i can't wait to read marra's other work","1969":"giving this 3 5 stars i would re read this only to figure out events in the timeline as the story kept moving back and forth in time over a 10yr period or so","1970":" after the boston marathon bombing i wanted to learn more about the conflict between chechnya and russia so that i could better understand the chechen experience this is a historical fiction account of some of the more recent chechen wars it goes back and forth between the 1990's and the early 2000's the book helped orient me in the region and gave me a view of the on the ground suffering that the chechen people have endured since the soviet union began to break up i really liked this book and feel much more ready to begin to tackle some non fiction books in the same area to broaden my understanding of the region","1971":"wonderful writing about the experience of the chechens during the war some torture that is painful to read about but ultimately uplifting","1972":" i really wanted to like this book but it was one of the most painful books i've ever read i had to keep putting it down five or six times as william tecumseh sherman said war is hell and marra has put together 379 pages of hell sartre said hell is other people and in this case he's absolutely right marra is quite vivid in his detailed description of various physical and psychological degradations suffered by each of his characters in the chechan war with russia the man who tries to save the daughter of his neighbor by agreeing to help the sole doctor a female who is still working herself to death in the hospital she in turn is deep in survivor's guilt mourning her sister who an ethnic russian escaped to russia and became an ill used prostitute picking up a heroin addiction along the way when the sisters meet back in chechnya natasha the prostitute is a mere shell of a human being and eventually runs away her sister never stops looking in this book no good deed goes unpunished for instance the girl's father allows fleeing refugees to camp overnight selling them things for whatever they can give him this kindness takes all his fingers and then lands him in the ultimate torturous pit and saddest of all a young son with a distant father is broken in the same pit and sent back to become an informer this book is a well written chronicle of unrelenting misery","1973":" when i looked at the author's photo at the back of the book he looked to me to be about sixteen yrs old although a goodreads friend of mine assured me he was twenty eight or twenty nine even so i am jealous that someone this young could write such a fantastic first novel in the decade since the collapse of the soviet union there have been many changes one of the hardest hit areas has been chechnya and it is here that this story takes place midst the bombed out streets the rubble and empty buildings the black markets the gun runners and the informers everyone is just trying to stay alive while others are trying to get out it is a country that is up for grabs and it is not safe for anyone it is about two sisters one who goes to school in london and the other who stays and when she does get out it is not the way she planned there are horrors limbs being cut off finger legs many things difficult to read and yet there is humor to and hope that the one sister will find the other that the little girl and you will fall in love with her will live and prosper the one thing marra does is take places or peripheral characters and tell you how it will look or where they will be years from now it is about the connectedness between people about the vagaries of fate and about survival whatever it takes it is about the way he treats all his characters with compassion quite simply i love the way he writes i bet you he still gets carded though","1974":"what i liked almost everything what i didn't like the timeline was confusing at times especially for someone who knows next to nothing about chechnya like me the book was both beautiful and devastating","1975":"life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation listened via auduble i recommend reading it instead as there is a lot of back and forth across time and characters","1976":"an engrossing novel that is well researched on one hand dark and sad however there are many lighter moments funny even","1977":" i wavered between a 4 and 5 star rating this is not a book that everyone will like it's too violent too dark too graphic too much war it was very powerful however the prose is beautiful in so many places in the book it is an unusual setting not one that has been overdone in reading the author notes he intentionally set it in chechnya which i thought was very interesting so many fictional books have been set against the atrocities of wwii and the fact that this was set in the chechen wars was fresh and eye opening the themes of goodness in the midst of vast evil redemption and intertwined human fates really made this book for me having read baldacci's book the target about north korea and now this one i'm ready for some fluffier fiction","1978":"though i got confused at times trying to remember who was who this book is really sticking with me which to me is the mark of a good book its pretty heavy and gritty and i loved how all the characters tied together somehow there was quite a bit of dark humor i loved learning about the relationship between russia and chechnya and feel like i got a sense of their people a tragically beautiful ending completed the book and makes me want to read it again","1979":"this is a first novel by anthony marra and an amazing one i was warned that the story was heavy set in chechna amidst the terror and turmoil of post soviet time of 1994 to 2004 the story shifts back and forth across this 10 year span as you learn about the characters haava a young girl who has a delightful sense of learning about the world in this very bleak time her neighbor akhmed who walks her to a doctor sonja who reluctantly takes her in in a hospital that is existing as more of a symbol than a real medical resource the story is gritty often painful as the characters and their neighbors cope with the stark reality of their lives the loss of connections and the memory of past relationships marra develops the characters beautifully and ultimately links them together over the decade that we follow them his writing is both stark and beautiful the beautiful prose made all the more impressive because it is describing a time of such pain and ugliness i was struck by the sense of hope that kept people going in a time and place where it seemed there was no hope","1980":"this one one of those books that i can't say i loved but was glad i read i know very little about chechnya and the war so it was a great way to get a better understanding of the geopolitics i had a little trouble with the tone of the book it veered from brutal realism to almost absurdism at times which gave me a little whiplash still the story was interesting and the characters were wholly unique","1981":"devastating but with a light at the end of the tunnel","1982":" how in the world does this book have 4 stars before i began i fully intended to love it great reviews a high rating and a topic i want to learn about but it was awful awful it rambled there was no story the narrator changed and the reader would have no idea russian words or concepts were mentioned but never explained maybe i would have understood more if i had studied chechnya before reading but i have no background i thought the book would be about havaa's story but she is barely a character i considered giving up on finishing the book many times but kept going hoping for a breakthrough it never came","1983":"definitely not a pick me up book and is a little confusing in the beginning particularly if you don't know much about chechnya and it's wars plus it goes back and forth in time but fabulously written best book i've read in a while","1984":"knowing very little about chechnya this book could be difficult for me to understand at times i learned a lot and am grateful for that fact alone however this was a beautifully written story i especially loved the way the author would give future information on his characters and objects in the book nice touch it was challenging for me to not judge some of them interesting to think about what one needs to do to survive in some places in the world","1985":"i have been paid to write since i was 14 i realize much of what i read comes from a labor a harnessed workmanship writing is a job like any other you sit down you put in your hours and if you're good you get a paycheck what separates most of us is the number of hours we're able to put in anthony marra is not one of these writers rarely if ever in my life have i been exposed to such smooth prose marra writes with an ease that must frustrate writers twice his age the fact that this is his debut novel makes it all the more impressive constellation is a novel about wartime chechnya primarily in 2004 to quote the summary on the hardback \"two doctors risk everything to save the life of a hunted child in this majestic debut... havaa eight years old hides in the woods and watches the blaze until her neighbor akhmed discovers her sitting in the snow akhmed knows getting involved means risking his life and there is no safe place to hide a child in a village where informers will do anything for a loaf of bread but for reasons of his own he sneaks her through the forest to the one place he thinks she might be safe an abandoned hospital where the sole remaining doctor sonja rabina treats the wounded \"it is a delicate balance using bewildering composition to enlighten one's world while not losing focus on the fact this is about wartime chechnya yet marra pulls it off making his characters as endearing as their setting is startling islamic overtones in a contested soviet union country provide a fittingly disturbing wartime backdrop i couldn't stop reading from the start so many facets of chechen life will come as a shock to the western world the chechen and russian characters willingness to find traces of hope are what make this novel so fulfilling you never become nauseated by their persistence there are few idealized types to be found the roles are real and their stories charming marra plays with your emotions seemingly at will through his original storytelling i both laughed out loud earnestly and shook my head in dazed sadness while reading there were amateurish moments to be found for us grinders the wildly imprecise description of online poker in 2004 is especially jarring and takes you out of the narrative it makes one wonder what other experts could say about the novel's many other depictions it does become annoying how everyone from this impoverished nation somehow goes on to do amazing things there are slips in regard to pacing more importantly while you're certainly reading a master's work you know you're not reading marra's masterwork the ending feels as if it could have used a little more...something one feels marra could have written a perfect novel if given more time that being said it's hard to take much from this novel just as a habit from my time in the journalism world i feel negligent to not mention the flaws in some form constellation is a superb read from start to finish i cannot wait to read marra's next offering my plugs check out my vids at pocketfives training contact me for lessons at assassinatocoaching@gmail com see other stuff i write with my friends at www pokerheadrush com and follow my twitter @theassassinato and facebook at www facebook com assassinato","1986":"beautiful language survival in chechnya i had no idea","1987":" this was a real chore to read and i'm not entirely sure why i agree that it is a beautifully written intimate imagining of how bad things got in chechnya in the 1990s and 2000s and it's intriguingly resonant given our fascination with the ethnic backgrounds of the boston bombers earlier this year the reviews are good and the national book award folks had it on the shortlist many people have recommended this book to me especially as an antidote to my slog through caleb crain's \"necessary errors \"but something was off for me i can usually read 40 50 pages a night but i could only go about five or 10 pages before losing interest and drifting off to sleep for the record it's not the material i'm not allergic to novels set in terrible circumstances - war famine genocide what have you there was for me something literally and figuratively discordant about the setting and the characters it's a brutal existence and much of it is told as if it's a bad dream someone is having there is only one \"warm\" character in a world of cold people the chronological back and forth didn't help and i lost interest most when the story shifted to interstitial narrative about the doctor's missing sister natasha after awhile the vivid and lovely descriptions the \"lavender ribbons\" billowing from pieces of a corpse in a landmine crater begin to seem like they're getting in the way of momentum the book finally kicks in at about page 300 i see from other goodreads reviews that this a minority view it just goes to show you that not everyone can love a universally praised novel but i did try to","1988":"love i started this book a few times and fell asleep after reading a page or two i was going to just return it to the library but gave it one more shot i was completely enthralled with the story the detail the glimpses into the future of a person item place moment this is a fantastic book and quite thought provoking too i even spent some time re educating myself on russia ussr the cold war as a result a must read","1989":" this is an excellent book i knew next to nothing about the subject matter war ridden chechnya circa 1995 2004 while i found the book slow in parts and it took me awhile to get into it when all was said and done the story was beautifully woven and incredibly intricate the writing reminded me of rushdie not a fan but can appreciate his writing style and garcia marquez without the magical realism component the author's technique of seeing you through to the end even with the most minor of characters was very satisfying","1990":"really this is the author's first book depth and intensity all in one accomplished piece of written word i'm in awe by the creative mind that put this together","1991":"so hard to review this one it is definitely not a light story but yet i enjoyed it it opened my eyes to a decade of history that i never knew about while i was going to college dating my future husband getting married having my first child the people in chechnya were living through two horrible wars and this book brings the war to a very personal level it was very well written my only complaint was that some of the flashbacks were a little confusing but as i went along i sorted it out and i enjoyed how the characters tied together through the course of the book i also loved how the author kept adding in little one line flashforwards to the future he's describing a building that was bombed out but then he puts in a line about how in 7 years a young architect would return to his home town and build a beautiful building that was the hope i found in the bleak story that these people would survive and find a way to rebuild","1992":"a simultaneously compelling and horrific novel told in gorgeous language the story sheds light on the ethnic tensions in a fraught region through the personal relationships of the characters i found it an especially timely read in light of developments in eastern europe and the middle east","1993":"the book has a slow start developing the characters but an excellent novel the whole story came together nicely it was one of the best i have read in a while","1994":"beautiful and heartbreaking not an easy read at times it was slow and i didn't always want to pick it up to keep reading but ultimately i was invested in the characters and storyline and beyond that it's a great introduction to a portion of history that i'd like to lean more about","1995":"an incredible piece of art difficult to believe it's the work of a first time novelist it's so compelling beautifully written and immaculately constructed i kept marveling at how much research and imagination went into creating such fully formed people and places it's not for the fainthearted though i can still feel a grisly amputation scene in my shins two days after reading it","1996":"i think this book was is over hyped yes there is some beautiful language here but i found much of it difficult to read one reviewer commented that marra feels he has to educate us on the chechnyan wars granted i don't know much about what happened there but i'm not sure i needed to be schooled that thoroughly to appreciate the message this made for me a difficult slog to get to the good human interest parts of the story there is a message of hope here amid some really graphic depictions of torture it's not for the squeamish or faint of heart in many ways this book reminded me of dave eggers what is the what except i think eggers story contained more humor so in summary this was not my cup of tea but take this review for what it's worth as obviously a lot of other readers loved it a few more observations first i think this book is doing well because of what happened at the boston marathon suddenly people are interested in chechnya so the book's publication timing was fortuitous second marra is a debut author for the most part i love debut authors because i often feel that a lot of writers only have one book in them and once that story is told they can't repeat the magic in other instances debut authors have not fully come into their own they are still refining their craft i think marra falls into the latter category i would read him again because i think he's going to get better","1997":"insightful read marra's prose and the style in which he controls the english language is beautiful i enjoyed the slow reveal of layers the onion effect which made me vest more interest in the story and characters particularly natasha example of how well marra writes she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency chapter 25 pg 332","1998":"i can't make myself turn this book back in to my public library it's been a week now and i'm still thinking about sonya and havaa and mourning natasha i found marra's writing to be extraordinary this is a very moving book","1999":"despite my interest in this region's history and the interesting premise the book just didn't grab my attention","2000":"beautiful prose and a sad but memorable story highly recommend","2001":"i started this book some time ago just about the time that the whole messy business in the crimea was beginning the similarities to chechnya's history was too disturbing too raw so i put it down for a while during holy week it felt right to finish this book a sort of penitential practice i'm so glad i did despite the horrors of torture betrayal physical u0026amp emotional trials the hope and humanity prevail looking forward to hearing what the author has to say at booktopia asheville in august 2014","2002":"an amazing novel first time novelist or not a timeless and universal story about unity love and compassion surviving brutality desperation hatred and treachery anthony marra has brilliantly tied together what could have been a very messy to ing and fro ing between characters places and dates within the broad picture of the chechnya wars emotionally exhausting and captivating","2003":"i knew absolutely nothing about the chechen wars before reading this book and only knew that chechnya existed because of the 2013 boston marathon this lack of knowledge did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the book in any way i found a constellation of vital phenomena to be a truly moving work of fiction the language that marra uses for his descriptions is perfect i was able to vividly see even the smallest things in a way that i never had before i enjoyed practically everything about this book and have already recommended it to many of my friends","2004":" there is so much human suffering and war going on in our world sometimes it's hard to read one more book that focuses on just those topics but i am glad that i read this book i know some people would say that books should be an escape from life and the real world but i've always enjoyed the fact that all books are not the same you can escape when you need to and you can be confronted by real life when you are feeling mentally strong anthony marra wrote a brilliant book which centered around the chechen wars he humanized war and made the reader connect to people across the world he showed how ordinary people were affected by the wars and how they just kept on living knowing that their time could end in the blink of an eye the depth of human compassion and suffering are unbelievable it is not a happy book although every character has brief moments of happiness it is a real book a book that opened my eyes to chechnya and the human spirit it is at its core a book about enduring love amazing book i also have to add what a timely book this was with the winter olympics just a few weeks away in russia","2005":"this book was published in 2013 and i think i only saw it on one of the notable books of 2013 kind of lists totally underrated book one of the best i've read that came out in 2013 in my opinion beautiful beautiful prose amazing story amazing character development","2006":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was a really promising book but i had real issues trying to deal with the non chronological storytelling there were too many characters at times and although an ensemble cast is a good thing it did not really work for me here it was tough to feel an emotional connection to the characters when the author was disjointed and shifting from character to character and across different timelines so quickly the only consolation was the ending was great a bit cliched how everything was so tied it was a really promising book but i had real issues trying to deal with the non chronological storytelling there were too many characters at times and although an ensemble cast is a good thing it did not really work for me here it was tough to feel an emotional connection to the characters when the author was disjointed and shifting from character to character and across different timelines so quickly the only consolation was the ending was great a bit cliched how everything was so tied up together but i love the quote about life a constellation of vital phenomena more","2007":"beautifully written but very sad","2008":"i do not see why this book has so h high ratings i was completely bored and confused through over 200 pages and finally just quit reading it rarely do i not finish a book but i just couldn't take the boredom anyone would not recommend","2009":" this beautiful and haunting novel is one of my favorite books of 2013 it takes place in post war chechnya but don't be alarmed if you don't know much about the chechen conflict with russia -- the rich storytelling and the gorgeous prose will draw you in and by the end of the book you could captivate an audience with these wartime stories but first you must meet havaa a precocious little girl whose father was just taken by federal forces probably never to be seen again havaa ran into the woods to hide which is why the soldiers didn't find her the girl's mother is dead and she has no one else a neighbor akhmed helps havaa escape to a nearby town and convinces a doctor sonja to look after her soon our cast of characters will expand and we will meet akhmed's wife havaa's father sonja's sister and other residents in the village of eldar each of them with a story to tell one of my favorite characters was sonja a tough doctor who left chechnya to attend medical school in london but she returned to her war torn country to try and help her sister natasha who later disappeared though she was the elder sonja was always thought of as natasha's sister the object rather than the subject of any sentence the two shared she walked alone down the school corridors head sternly bent toward the stack of books in her arms sonja had more academic journal subscriptions than friends she could explain advanced calculus to her fifth form algebra teacher but couldn't tell a joke to a boy at lunch even in the summer months she had the complexion of someone who spent too much time in a cellar everyone knew sonja was destined for great things but no one knew what to do with her until then another character i loved was akhmed a man who studied to be a doctor but who would rather have been an artist he jokes that he is the worst doctor in chechnya but he still manages to help his patients and their families sometimes by drawing portraits of those who have been killed or taken by the feds anthony marra's writing is beautiful with stunning sentences that made me pause and reread them if i hadn't been reading a library book i would have underlined innumerable paragraphs the page long sentence on p 139 was so emotional and breathtaking that i actually gasped each chapter opens with a timeline pinpointing a year between 1994 and 2004 and the flashbacks illuminate what happened to our characters during the war while the chapter focuses on one character's perspective the stories ebb and flow together like overlapping melodies this is a novel whose plotting and gracefulness i admired so much that as soon as i had finished it i immediately wanted to start over and read it again what details what connections this is the kind of novel i love to read one that is complex and meaningful and full of humanity and life and i wish i could give a copy to every bookish friend i know ann patchett who is one of my favorite writers told the new york times that this was her favorite book she's read this year agreed note if you're wondering what the title means it is taken from a definition in a medical dictionary life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation","2010":"anthony marra's writing style feels extreamly pretentious at first it wasn't until around page 100 that i found myself liking the character sketches that make up the side stories in this novel about life in war torn chechnia the further you get in though the more you want to know about the people in this small corner of the world and how their lives are all intertwined whether they know it or not this ended up being a beautiful debut novel that lingers long after the pages have ended this will definately be one that i recomend to anyone who loves character driven honest writing","2011":"this book is really beautiful and emotionally difficult to read as brutal as orphan master's son but somehow more bleak not sure why very glad i learned more about chechnya i liked the way he gave us glimpses into what happened to some of the characters after the time period of the book","2012":"what a jarring affecting novel beautifully written gorgeous language clever use of time flashbacks the story of several characters in the mid 90's through 2004 over the course of two chechen wars i didn't know much about these wars or the rebels or the whole area this was an eye opener","2013":"a wonderful book at first i thought it would be awful as it opens with violence but soon the story captured my heart with character development and the story war is always difficult to read about and i am always amazed at the differences between cultures country's","2014":"meh overrated my rating is low because this book got rave reviews but i only thought it was so so","2015":"a wonderful combination of darkness and light","2016":"powerful story about the impact of the two chechen wars on five characters some russian some chechen whose lives intersect and collide in a disappearing village and it's adjacent hospital beautifully written this is a novel about the brutality that survival sometimes seems to require it is also a powerful testimony to the power of love service and hope brilliant first novel","2017":"i debated about giving this 4 stars because the author rambled on just a bit too long in a handful of paragraphs but ultimately this book deserves the 5 stars over 5 days in harsh and stark winter in war torn chechnya relationships are developed tested lost and sacrificed this story is a testament to the beauty and complexity of love hate grief and everything in between the prose is beautiful and i found myself marking more quotes than i can ever remember marking in another this is one those books where the transition from last page to real world is painful","2018":" this book is about the wars in chechnya which i knew nothing about it's also about people who love each other very much it's sweet and sad it's one of those books that author obviously intended as his humble effort to make the world a better place one reader at a time i sometimes resist this type of effort as in the case of the immensely talented but maybe just a little too saintly colum mccann but anthony marra obliterated my snarkiness this book melted my heart opened my eyes and taught me how much left i have left to learn about this world","2019":"at the kitchen table she examined the glass of ice each cube was rounded by room temperature dissolving in its own remains and belatedly she understood that this was how a loved one disappeared despite the shock of walking into an empty flat the absence isnt immediate more a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an erasure but a conversion in form from presence to memory from solid to liquid and the person you once touched now runs over your skin now in sheets down your back and you may bathe may sink may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it a story of three dissimilar people coping to survive in a war infested land a story not only about war but a story intersecting three characters together through various connections the trials facing each is the foundation for this poignant story marra crafted an irresistible and sensitive debut novel a multitude of different perspectives given by the differing three protagonists with the varying voices and viewpoints this allows the reader multiple points to consider long after the novel's cover has been gently closed sonja competent physician professional she is overworked and exhausted her hard exterior is taking a beating akhmed a physician but rather be painting facing any situation thrown his way with strength and poise with his artistic ability akhmed reworks the faces of the 'disappeared' to be recovered by family haava an eight year girl suffering the loss of her mother witnessing her father be taken away forcefully by soldiers and now she is residing in a hospital seeing the carnage of war daily other secondary characters are involved in the narrative introducing multiple facets of war affecting people kidnapping smuggling and more marra does a wonderful job covering a quantity of issues without the narrative being overdone or scattered marra has left quite an impression unbelievable this was a debut effort his elegant and lyrically rhythmic prose immediately captured my attention wonderfully executed from beginning to end a memorable novel in numerous ways a novel unmistakably worth reading","2020":"really a wonderful book one of the best i've read in the last couple years i'm so glad i didn't skip it because i thought it would be depressing while it is sad and upsetting it is also full of compassion and hope an amazing debut","2021":" 3 5 stars i wasn't sure i would like this at first a good gr friend of mine recommended it and i had that sinking feeling that happens most often to me when i realize i hate someone's favorite book luckily this book really picked up steam about half way through at first i found the rhythm stressful who are these characters which of these five men from eldar are which why am i getting a peripheral character's future when i just met them which day of what year is it exactly my other major problem at the start was the history piece i love history majored in history but i have such a piecemeal understanding of it i can explain in some detail the first 14 years of the 20th century of western europe but my russian and chechnya knowledge is lacking i stressed about not understanding the historical background for the first 150 pages i kept wikipedia ing and googling and kept coming back a little more frustrated the best thing i did was just give up i embraced the not knowing i read the book and enjoyed it and now that i've closed the cover and am updating my gr i can go back to learn more my friend recommended this for the character development and marra delivers characters with backgrounds and futures in spades this is a great book for anyone who must know how every character meets their end the only character we don't end up with a true ending for is khassan but at 79 the vagueness marra grants is more fitting i also loved the end i actually thought the end was one chapter earlier i don't know how you a reader approach the end of a very satisfying book but i turn a page see out of the corner of my eye that half page on the right proclaiming the end my eyes want to skip right to the last sentence but i force myself to stay on point to get the full satisfying conclusion i liked the ending i thought i was reading but to turn the page and to have a few more paragraphs to read view spoiler especially surprising as i thought dokka and akhmed's stories were concluded hide spoiler was particularly perfect","2022":"amazingly wonderful writing about such a tragic time and place","2023":"this book was absolutely fabulous i know little about war in chechnya and russia i know little about reviewing literature that being said this book takes the lives of would be strangers and unfolds out of order how wonderfully and painfully connected they are it is set in a war torn country and is about love not love as many writers would portray it but the connectedness of every action made by every soul you touch this is my very favorite aspect of love marra does such a beautiful job in some scenes using something as simple as a telephone dialogue to communicate everything that is unsaid there are a few passages that i can truly say i will never forget","2024":"slayed me","2025":"i didn't finish this book the names confused me and i just couldn't get into it","2026":"riveting heart wrenching","2027":"at times hard to follow the flashbacks flash forwards and perspective changes but worth the effort","2028":"if you liked cutting for stone i think you would enjoy this book as well","2029":"this is a beautiful profound book that takes the reader to the heart of the conflict in chechnya","2030":"4 5 stars another new setting for me and a good story","2031":"what can i say about this novel to convince you to read it i know you'll love it the writing is masterful and the setting though bleak is offset by relatable characters and a tasteful levity that comes into play every so often gorgeous prose with a sad but satisfying conclusion","2032":"a fantastic read all the way through remarkably moving my best read for the year","2033":"a tough book to read because of the subject matter but exquisitely written","2034":"i rarely give books 5 stars this one was phenomenal the writing was stunning and the story was beautiful i can't recommend it enough","2035":"loved so much and sad it's over will be hard to top","2036":"i almost stopped reading at page 100 or so but powered through and i'm glad i did the end of the book was good i liked the characters as i learned more towards the end","2037":" this is a stunning book it takes place in chechnya at the time of the 1st and 2nd wars for independence from russia the story begins with an 8 year old girl havaa who watches as her father is disappeared and her home is burned down by russian soldiers she is taken by her father's friend akhmed to be sheltered at a bombed out hospital run by a russian doctor sonja as the narrative circles around from person to person and back and forth in time from 2004 to 1996 the reader learns how the seven main characters interconnect the novel is beautifully written tragic and ironic","2038":"well written too slow for me","2039":"this a beautifully written book about a very important topic but i just could not get into it maybe sometime in the future","2040":"this book was very difficult to read... i had to step away quite a few times due to the upsetting content the writing is beautiful as is the message it might take a while to finish this book and it is totally worth the effort","2041":" please don't beat me up over this but i didn't think this was the best book i ever read it seemed to take me forever to get to the meat of the matter don't get me wrong i stayed with it and was eager to get it finished but i didn't find most of the characters to be folks with any direction other than getting the girl out of a bad situation this book educated me on the plight of suppressed citizens of countries so unlike the us but i didn't feel any love or attachment to them the un educated dr was sleeping with his best friend's wife the best friend was a smuggler the smart dr couldn't show any pity towards anyone and worked mechanically throughout her days until the end i thought the son in his own despicable way tried to do his best after horrendous torture and pain and the wife was lost in her own world possibly although never explained or i missed it a victim of her own mind and not aware of all around her the character i felt the most about was the sister which was the most emotionally sympathetic person in the cast to me i guess i can recommend this as a good read but not to me a great one","2042":"this is a remarkable novel that enlightened me to the plight of the satellite nations connected to russia and the middle east most notably chechnya powerful characters highlight this book","2043":" a constellation of vital phenomena deserves more than five stars it is a wonderful novel one of the best i've read in a long long time marra's novel takes place over several days in 2004 in chechnya after a young girl's father is taken by russian soldiers and another man tries to protect her this man akhmed brings the girl havaa to an all but abandoned hospital where sonja a talented doctor tries to do what she can for the injured dying and dead who come to the hospital the novel also flashes back to earlier times when all of the characters shared at least marginally better circumstances marra's novel is superior to many of its kind for a number of reasons this novel thankfully lacks the overwhelming earnestness that many similar novels get bogged down with instead a constellation of vita phenomena is told with much dark black humor a humor which makes the characters seem much more real and vibrant and then there is the writing it is simply wonderful there are so many sentences to savor the imagery is wonderful a constellation of vital phenomena is simply brilliant the subject matter can be harsh at times marra doesn't sugarcoat anything here so this novel isn't for those in the market for a light read but if you are looking for a satisfying novel this one is for you enjoy","2044":"i don't know where to start this is a beautiful story of love and strength terror betrayal and redemption in war torn chechnya i could not put this book down but forced myself to read slowly savoring every exquisite sentence this is the author's first book and should not be missed","2045":"i really enjoyed this book for it's opening up the chechnyan wars to me in a human though sometimes graphic way the passionate lofty and wordy sentence structure of the author's writing style tripped me up a bit but the intertwining of characters was together fascinating and heartbreaking it was a novel i was eager to turn to everyday","2046":"great slow read but well researched","2047":"beautifully written giving voice to akhmed's thoughts mara wrote as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there this concept encompasses the stories told in this book the myriad linkages of their lives are defined and enriched by their losses","2048":"this 2013 historical fiction is the profoundly sad story of a small group of villagers in the midst of ethnic warfare in chechnya with equal attention paid to grace humour and the relentless beauty of the human soul like a tolstoy novel the story covers a gigantic canvas the war in chechnya sparks references to stalin and the dislocation over time of millions of refugees the pages bleed with the disorientation one must feel in the midst of war where all normal social psychological and emotional compartments are broken open the contents dispersed to the wind a beautiful and significant read","2049":"hauntingly beautiful prose and an even more haunting a tale","2050":"why is it that books set in countries that were once part of the ussr are so dreary to me these countries are always cold gray dreary u0026amp hopeless chechnya was no different in this book very sad depressing story punctuated with passages of cruelty not a beach read","2051":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here although this book was painful to read at times emotionally it is worth reading all the way to the end i'm not sure what i expected this book to be i picked it up based on a mention on another webpage it was completely different than i expected but i am happy that it was it's a moving powerful book i'm not usually a fan of books where things jump from time to time or when they all wrap up neatly with everyone connected directly but this was different yes there is jumping from time to although this book was painful to read at times emotionally it is worth reading all the way to the end i'm not sure what i expected this book to be i picked it up based on a mention on another webpage it was completely different than i expected but i am happy that it was it's a moving powerful book i'm not usually a fan of books where things jump from time to time or when they all wrap up neatly with everyone connected directly but this was different yes there is jumping from time to time and person to person but it makes the story one complete entity i'm also happy with the connections at the end in this story it completely works more","2052":" audio bood review june 2013 1 stari can't do it this book is too difficult to listen to i read a review ironically by the author of the interestings and she said she spent a lot of time on wikipedia trying to learn russian history so she could understand this book but then discovered she really didn't need to know the history well i disagree i too was on wikipedia for way too long trying o educate myself on russia and decided there wasn't enough time in my life to understand it all one of the main characters of this book is russian history and maybe if someone could summarize that for me you know condense a few centuries down to a few sentences i might be able to connect the dots it also might help if i read this book and not listened because all the russian names sound so similar the book jumps years around and i couldn't keep up if you read this book and please don't let my review stop you and have a different opinion please let me know again here is a book with raving reviews that this mama just doesn't get actual paper library book review march 2014 3 8 stars rounded up to 4 this was chosen for our book club and a friend of mine liked this book so i was shocked when i looked back to see i had given it only 1 star i remember trying to listen to it and getting very confused by all of the russian names and places so i thought i would give it a go on paper so glad i did this is just another example of a book better read and not heard the story of this book is depressing it takes place in the late 90s all the way up to 2004 in chechnya that alone is shocking because it wasn't that long ago that this was going on and i had no idea i disagree with my first review you don't have to know a lot of russian history to read this book this book tells you what you need to know considering this is the authors first book too is very impressive he weaves his story so well that even if the history goes over your head which is won't you still can understand these characters will be interesting to hear what people say in book club","2053":"meh...i loved the characters but wasn't something that grabbed me and wouldn't let go i feel like the writer uses more words than needed to make something happen i understand all the praise it is getting for his first book for sure but it just wasn't my cup of tea it felt like a task to finish","2054":"at first i wasn't sure i liked this book i would lose the meaning in the long descriptive sentences i kept slogging through and then either i started to understand or probably more likely became involved in the story and i couldn't put it down i loved how the author let you know what happens to the characters years down the road as just an aside to the main story surely sparked my interest in learning more of this country's history thanks","2055":"it is so tragic that people suffer so at the hands of their corrupt government we are so blessed to have been born here where we take everything we have for granted this was an eye opening book and terribly sad","2056":"the book is about 5 days in war torn chechyna with many flashback chapters to fill in the backstories it centers around an 8 year old girl and the people who risk themselves to help her survive it is a story about love family and courage but is not for the squeamish and i mean it","2057":"i rarely give any book five stars but marra's debut is one of those powerful novels that only comes around once or twice per year the setting is chechnya the year is 2004 eight year old haava has watched her father be taken from his home by russian soldiers her neighbor akhmed hides her at the nearest hospital to the chagrin of the only remaining doctor sonja we find through vignettes ranging from 1994 to 2004 that the various characters are connected in different ways i had to read the ending twice it was truly that beautiful of a story highly recommended","2058":" i wasn't sure i was going to like this at first since it was pretty depressing right off the bat but you very quickly get invested in the characters and are sucked in to their stories i'd heard a little about what happened in chechnya but am still admittedly ignorant although this was a novel it included enough of the reality of what people went through to be interesting from a historical perspective i've read a lot of books lately that were either character driven or plot driven but were missing the vital connection between the two this book marries both perfectly it reminded me of a jenga game it's stripped down to what is essential and is perfectly balanced nothing excessive left on it to make it bulky and awkward and not so much left to the imagination that the story topples really a wonderful and beautiful book i received this book from blogging for books for this review","2059":" maybe i just need to read something more uplifting next but this was just another sad interweaving of tales overexposing the horrors of war as well as what it does to people there were moments of levity and one in particular was funny pg 200 a turtle is one hundred percent reptile she said don't insult me everyone knows a turtle is crustacean on its mother's side explain that to me she said a lizard f s a crab and 9 months later a turtle pops out i hope your biology teacher was sent to the gulag","2060":"i'm not even sure how to describe this but it was a transformative read","2061":"great book author does these interesting things when introducing characters as an aside he tells you where this character will be who they will be long after the story is completed it's an interesting way to learn about the characters and understand the world surrounding the characters","2062":"a beautiful sad bittersweet story that provided a good introduction to the history of unrest in chechnya","2063":"absolutely fantastic that's heartbreaking and endearing at the same time the sadness of survival and the love of common man makes this story come to life","2064":"considering the theme back to back wars in chechnya and the extremely bleak opening i didn't think i'd be able to finish this work of fiction once i settled into its rhythm and beautiful but sometimes exhausting writing style figured out who was who and actually got used to the descriptions of relentless brutality and i usually shy away from violent themes i truly loved this incredible book it builds with such intensity the final pages had me wiping away tears of both joy and sadness","2065":"spectacular writing","2066":" the interconnected stories of several characters in chechnya throughout five days in 2004 though there are many flashbacks to events in the preceding decade when havaa's father is taken to the landfill their neighbor and friend akhmed secrets her out of town to a hospital where he puts her under the care of the only doctor in residence sonja how the characters are all connected is slowly revealed which leads to a beautiful though sad ending the author also manages to convey a lot of history of chechnya and the recent wars there something i knew very little about i'm glad all the good reviews brought this book to my attention","2067":"complicated exquisite narrative a book i couldn't stop reading but often wanted to stop reading both at the same time","2068":"nine characters their hopes decisions and consequences beautifully weave together to make a captivating story about love pride and family set in chechnya during the second chechen war and spanning over 10 years these characters' stories are told non sequentially in smart and charmingly written vignettes read like piecing together a giant puzzle their journey will give you smiles surprises and a satisfying conclusion that brings closure to all the characters you cannot help but like my personal favorite characters are akhmed for his tongue and cheek charm sonja for her abrasive honest wit and havaa for her unwavering fighting spirit a constellation of vital phenomena is a delight from start to finish","2069":"starts out horribly slow it's depressing it's dark it's often hard to follow at times i kept thinking wth this makes no sense but then about half way thru a switch gets flipped and the things that seems fragmented join it still is depressing and dark but what was hopeless is hopeful did not give it five stars only for the slow beginning stick it out folks its worth it","2070":"this book is beautiful it took me a while to finish but that was due to a hugely busy summer and not wanting to sacrifice savoring it for the unexpected busyness of life savor i certainly did the effort to sit down and go slow to let this one seep in especially in the beginning when the year of the setting changes from chapter to chapter was key i never knew the richness of character and spirit through action until reading this gift of a book it set a new standard of expectation for all other reads going forward beautifully crafted it is from cover to cover nothing fell short and the ending the pace and wrapping of each outstanding piece of it until the last word just stunning","2071":"oh what to say it took me a while to get into this like nearly half of the book but once i did i couldn't stop reading i can't say that i love his writing style but the way the story lines intersect really hooks you i would recommend this book to a contemplative reader it is not an easy read with all those long complex sentences","2072":"dark especially considering this troubling setting occurred so recently in history i spent quite a bit of time studying chechnya and learning about the geography and the wars phenomenal writing","2073":"this kept slipping away from me but some of the imagery was incredibly stunning u0026amp pulled me back in every time things like her post exhaustion nap mouth felt like 'the inside of a lemon peel' so vivid i wish the story had grabbed me as firmly as the individual sentences did","2074":"had some trouble getting into it but enjoyed it as it progressed","2075":" i both liked and disliked this book well written with an interesting style i was intrigued by the way the author would introduce a character and then give both a quick one or two sentence back story and future for that character i liked the way he tied everything together i believe that takes some skill as a writer what i didn't like was the darkness of the subject war is horrible and brutal and if even what the author wrote in this novel was only partially factual the brutality in chechnya was particularly horrible","2076":"so beautifully written writing truly is an art form when done like this i didn't just fall in love with the characters and the story but also the very words and structure of the sentences","2077":" this is the kind of book that will haunt you for months after you have read it i read this book quickly and am now compelled to read more about chechnya and the ussr ashamed to say i know very little about either the characters in this book made your root for them in their darkest hours and sympathize even when they were making the wrong decisions beautifully written the format of skipping forward and going backward in time made me stay up late to learn about the histories of the characters and their fate in the end","2078":"i loved this book the best book i've read in a long time","2079":"that was powerful","2080":"life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written","2081":"six interwoven lives during the chechen wars the best book i've read in a stretch this blew me away compelling beautifully written insightful funny in parts and very sad","2082":" i couldn't give this novel a 4 star rating so i gave it a 5 has anybody every heard of bookcrossing they have a 10 star rating system which allows for a more precise review this novel would be a 9 why character development just a little more work for that magic element to make readers connect with the characters like kingsolver is able to do she has developed that concept quite well you leave her novels feeling like you're leaving friends and family behind even with that slight imperfection i was so impressed with marra's work i don't think it will appeal to every reader however i think mature readers will appreciate this more readers who enjoy the complexity and meatiness of a well written piece of literature i am so looking forward to reading more of this author's future work i hope he is working on something right now","2083":" chechntya is the setting for this heartbreaking novel it covers a decade with titillating comments of what happens in the future and encompasses the two chechntya wars one to gain independence and one to lose it the primary characters are akhmed sonja havaa ramzen khassan and the not ever to be forgotten natasha there are other interesting characters whose stories are also fascinating this book is not told in a linear fashion we go forwards and backwards amongst the years as we learn the stories of each of these characters and how they are interwoven in the horror of war sometimes we are led to believe someone is horrid and then we find out the atrocities that person was subjected to before and then you wonder what would you have done i had no understanding of the russian chechntyan situation i knew the russians always complain about chechntyan terroists but now i have a better appreciation of what was going on while dispassionately told my reaction to this book was anything but dispassionate even when i knew certain characters were doomed i so wanted to be wrong just an amazing first novel by anthony marra","2084":"yeah it's that good meaty tough to chew tougher yet to swallow when i began i found myself googling information about chechnya about the first and second war and about thing like disappearing and the landfill eventually i gave up and let the story take me where it was headed i cried","2085":" my favorite bookstore unabridged books read this recently for their book club so i knew it had to be good still i was surprised by how beautiful this book is i'm not one to pick up war stories though that's not exactly what this one is nor about chechnya but the characters are so rich and interesting and the story has enough light hearted moments that make what could be a sad and depressing story much less so the timelines at the beginning of each chapter were really helpful in navigating the time shifts in the story everything is revealed so masterfully i would give this book 4 5 stars if possible i highly recommend it","2086":" the short of it a haunting glimpse of war as seen through the eyes of those affected the rest of it i know little about the war in chechnya that's the first thing i'll tell you as i attempt to review a book that pushed me away as much as it pulled me in the second thing i'll admit is that i've never read a book quite like this one marra's handling of the subject is both delicate and brutal a combination that i was not expecting the story follows a handful of characters as they experience war between the years of 1994 2004 havaa a young girl who ran from her home as the russians took her father away akhmed the neighbor next door who lives with his ill bedridden wife ula sonja a brilliant surgeon trying to keep a hospital open with just two full time staff to run it natasha sonja's sister addicted to heroin and nowhere to be found khassan an old man who lives across from havaa and is the father to ramzan a young man who has been enlisted by the russians as an informer dokka havaa's father who gives refugees a bed to sleep in as they make their way to the camps the character list is short but the complexities of each character make this a very rich story filled with moments that will haunt your memories for days the hospital serves as a gateway to the other side many come for help but some never leave given their injuries or the lack of supplies available to sonja she makes do with dental floss for sutures heroin instead of morphine and when akhmed brings the young girl to her and asks her to provide a place for her to sleep sonja is not ready to care for a child akhmed's only saving grace the mediocre medical experience he holds help is what she desperately needs so she takes what she can get and agrees to take the girl in the pace of the story falters a bit as marra takes us back and forth through time at times i zipped through the pages and at other times i had to push myself to get through a chapter it wasn't until the final third of the book that i found myself unable to put the book down the fate of these characters and how marra walks us down each of their paths was riveting and heartbreaking it's beautifully written and the complexities of war are displayed in acts both large and small the amputation of a limb a young girl's collection of items left behind by refugees feeding a band of loyal dogs this is one of those books that seeps into you slowly but it's a story that you will never forget for more reviews visit my blog book chatter","2087":"it is remarkable that a book with this depth was written by an author with so little connection to the events of this piece of history","2088":"wow wow a 'heavy' read book quote life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i tried to find out if the title of this book was derived from a real book read many interesting things but didn't find an answer to my question regardless this book title is such an eye grab a fantastic title this link has a very good write up blog it will inspire people to read this book http egfabricant com anthony marras thank you anthony marra","2089":" gorgeously written but heartbreaking to read i found this one hard to put down my husband gave me this book because he'd heard about it on npr knowing my penchant for books about the darkest moments of history and my training as a historian of modern russia he thought i'd enjoy this he was right the plot is quite simple taking place over the course of just six days but the background to those events and each character meander throughout the narrative creating a complex story that is both bleak and beautiful if you need a story to have a linear plot and a happy ending this probably isn't for you to really appreciate this book you have to be patient and let the prose unfold and you must be willing to struggle with events and characters that are often quite ugly it's made even harder knowing that the story while a work of fiction takes place in the midst of a very real war that said it is very much worth reading this isn't one of those trite books about moments of goodness during wartime but nonetheless there are glimmers of hope and grace amid the often dismal background highly recommended to all my historian friends and anyone else with an interest in history human nature and sentences so beautiful they haunt you long after the book is done","2090":" i give this book which i listened to through audible a weak 3 stars and see that i am in the minority with my negative view i appreciate the characters and the grisly story but i found the writing convoluted and overly complicated i also found the narration abysmal to the point that i would re read sentences in my mind to get the inflection right it seemed the narrator colette whitaker perhaps doesn't even speak the language but simply read the words in a drone i had to constantly rewind just to get the gist however reviewers on audible didn't seem to mind either hmmm the setting and characters were interesting certainly the chechen wars were fairly unfamiliar to me so the history was welcome if ghastly i usually enjoy even mediocre stories but this one had me constantly frustrated in the listening","2091":"beautiful can't believe it is his first novel richly drawn characters compelling story and a chance to better understand a part of the world i didn't know much about set in chechnya caucasus region check check and check","2092":"very well written story about the simple details of ordinary people in war torn chechnya deep and haunting explores what people become when immersed too long in war reminded me of a fine balance because of the deep sadness of the characters' lives and their amazing ability to find hope in very dark circumstances","2093":"it took me a while but the last 100 pages or so were amazing","2094":"such a good book i learned things i had no idea about russia chechnya it was heartwarming heartbreaking and i loved how all the pieces tied together","2095":"delayed review this was absolutely one of my favorite books from 2013 amazing prose plot and historical content highly recommended for anyone with a passing interest in russian affairs","2096":"brilliant and gorgeous","2097":" while i was living my life during the years 1994 and 2004 grading lots of essays grumbling about my highway 95 commute attending two special weddings and welcoming beautiful grandchildren people in chechnya were experiencing a living nightmare one much worse than reported by the washington post or the evening news marra has captured the horrors of that time and place in a novel i will read again and appreciate more the second time his insight and compassion writing skill and historical knowledge combine in a moving narrative whose characters come alive on the page when you are ready for a tough upsetting read reach for a constellation of vital phonomena","2098":"fascinating and often beautiful but way too long","2099":"hauntingly beautiful prose with biblical undertones and hints of dostoevsky marra paints such vivid pictures with his words that the many emotional scenes of the novel felt like i was witnessing the characters on film and had my breath taken away truly the most beautiful book i've read in a long time and one that still resonates after turning the last page","2100":"worth the read especially for the writing","2101":"what a beautiful heartbreaking amazing book i literally cannot say enough about it the book is full of heart and it seemed that every chapter had a moment or more that clutched the heart made me pause to reflect in a way that is certainly unusual in my reading expeerience the writing is lyrical and yet matter of fact as appropriate this book was ridiculously accomplished for a first novel","2102":"very engaging novel set in chechnya primarily during the second recent war in 2004 well developed characters struggle for survival as akhmed attempts to help 8 year old havaa live when the feds russian troops search for her akhmed and havaa appeal to sonja a doctor who is unsure how involved she wishes to become told partially through well constructed flash backs i connected more closely with the characters in this gripping tragedy than with any book in some time","2103":"beautifully written every sentence is a gem difficult subject matter especially for summer time but really stunning if you read it take the time to read it slowly","2104":"a real eye opener to the atrocities of modern war and the innocent lives it destroys it's not preachy though you get a real connection to the characters and their lives there's a good mix of humor horror love and friendship interwoven in this book much better than i had anticipated a real page turner","2105":" a book that reminded me a lot of the book thief in that it had a young girl central character and an omniscient narrator that would tell you the fate of every character minor or not that came into the story with a quick sentence about the future i really like this method of storytelling because it life goes on after the series of events discussed in these pages however it is definitely more adult than the book thief more torture love and loneliness it took me most of the book to get into but when i saw how everything was going to come together at the end i couldn't put it down i love books that connect everyone and everything worth a read if you can get it also read over the books he uses as research at the end it will alarm you how little he actually made up for this book","2106":"poignant and thought provoking the imagery marra uses makes each description a delightful treat for the senses","2107":" if you haven't read this book yet stop now and go read it don't read reviews first or there will be no surprises left i enjoyed learning the meaning of the title that was a \"wow\" moment but wouldn't have been if i'd read the reviews ok you're back now having read it i found it amazing depressing but with shards of hope scattered throughout like the broken glass that embeds in their boot soles it illustrates the ways humans can harm each other from adultery to torture marra uses not only omniscient pov but also omniscient time--he occasionally lets us know what a character will end up doing a few weeks months or decades into the future this serves to blunt the unrelenting sadness of the present which seems to be a circle of hell even dante couldn't imagine it helps to know that characters survive though not all and the country rebuilds for writer geeks there is that sentence on page 138 that is longer than a page and the 18 sentences on page 180 that all complete the thought \"when had you last lived a day with...\" it's hard to read because for me and most americans our sentences would read \"when had you last lived a day without...\" if there is hell it will contain a special ring for first world people like me who never suffered who lived in a prosperity wrung partially from the suffering of others the beginning sometimes felt a bit too much like an american writing as ethnic russians and chechens such as when akmed says \"i'm standing right here\" while deshi and sonja talk about him there were also a few moments that did not ring credible to me but none of these affect the overall power of this story the many characters many years occasionally confused me where are we now but marra did an excellent job of noting the year s being covered with each chapter and bringing us up to speed after a long digression hopefully you can't read this and not wonder how you might behave in similar circumstances for me a middle class white american it was difficult i understood why the informer informed i was less clear why others let him get away with it this was given to me or else i might never have read it and what a shame that would be we all need to experience the world outside our own neighborhood to empathize with others not because we want to understand why they do what they do whether attack a school bomb a marathon or invade a country but to remember that they are humans just like us","2108":"when i started this i thought why is this taking place in some alternate reality but then i learned chechnya really was this messed up during the years this story takes place good exposure to a piece of world history i knew nothing about and beautifully written","2109":" this book is amazing unforgettable dark the story of people doing the best they can to survive in war torn chechnya told from multiple points of view after awhile you find your sympathies extending even to the bad guy one thing that seems sort of odd the author inserts little comments about what happened to certain characters in later years and since the time of the action is pegged for us at the beginning of each chapter it's not hard to realize that some of these years hence comments take place in what is still the future so the narrator is truly omniscient i sort of like that though it distances one a bit as if standing at a high point looking down on a timescape and some distance really did make this book a bit easier to bear it's a remarkable story that will linger in your thoughts long after you turn the last page a truly amazing first novel","2110":"i learned so much from this book the characters suffer in so many different ways well written","2111":"it's very very good violent but very good it reminded me of the cellist of sarajevo and the tiger's wife one can only hope that goodness will win out i agree that war is hell","2112":" i've read listened to several books lately told in a non linear format it's not my personal preference as it can be confusing and feels disjointed however upon reaching the conclusion of this book everything was made clear and it was so worth the effort as with any book that deals with the realities of war the subject matter here is hard to get through at times there is a lot of violence betrayal sorrow loss and death but there's also hope the ending brought tears to my eyes moving eye opening and beautifully written one note on the audio the performance was a bit lackluster and felt emotionally detached i'm still giving this 5 stars though because i think the book itself deserves it it will no doubt stay in my mind for a long time to come","2113":"i think i'll make this one of my 2016 book club choices this novel provides the foundation and reference points for so many interesting conversations i found it to be a very touching story about the horrors of war the suffering of those on the periphery and how we survive","2114":"i am not one to write reviews i read i rate but never offer up my opinion this book does not allow that it is beautiful story told by an author with amazing talent he used words like an artist uses paint and he painted a masterpiece i was left speechless by even the most ordinary sentences i cannot recommend this book enough","2115":" i had heard of chechnya before reading this book and i knew there had been conflicts there from watching the news but i never really stopped to think about the people that actually lived there and lived through the atrocities there chechnya to me was just a blurb on the evening news yet another place full of strife and war but no longer chechnya to me has become real and vivid thanks to the writing of anthony marra i admit that now at the end of this novel i am so emotionally wrung out that i don't really know what to say about it it is amazing yes it is lyrical and beautiful and heart wrenching and terrible and awful it is all of those things magically and as a friend of mine put it it may just be the most perfect book i've ever read for me this is on the same plane of lyricism and scope and heartbreak and redemption as cutting for stone another book that has embedded itself into my heart this is not an easy read it is heavy and dark and the torture that the characters have to endure is horrific leading me to have to slow down and step away from the book even just long enough to grab a drink of water just so i can compose myself and continue on i did enjoy marra's slight asides in some cases telling the reader what this person or that one would be doing in three years ten years sixty years in the future a slight reassurance that yes s he will live through the conflict and enjoy some form of peace in a life torn apart by violence highly recommended","2116":"dark and depressing on one hand and buoyed by hope on the other a constellation of vital phenomena delivers the highs and lows life under difficult circumstances full of beautiful striking details this moving and resonant novel captures the heartache of war and the depths of human resourcefulness in a narrative that will remain with you long after the final page read more","2117":"stunning for a story that spans just five days it encompasses many lifetimes i can not remember another book that somehow mixes horror and beauty and creates delight","2118":"i loved this book he has a great style of writing past present and future all rolled up in the same sentence he even did well ending it this is his first book i am hooked...","2119":"it was a good book not a happy book at all and a very bleak telling of life in checinyna","2120":"so i listened to this on audiobook and found it hard to keep track of what time and place we were in and what had happened versus not happened i think i'd give the first half of the book 1 5 stars and the second half 4 averaging out to a three","2121":" wow i loved this book despite it's heartbreaking story of life in war torn chechnya the story is beautifully written and i also liked the ironic comments i will paraphrase one i still remember russian soldiers who were more concerned about their mustaches than their morality war violence betrayal but more importantly sacrifice family love hope the story is nonlinear so as a reader it is most interesting to be condemning the actions of a character only to later discover the mitigating circumstances which means questions of morality abound highly recommended","2122":"i had no idea about the wars in chechnya and this novel does a beautiful job of explaining the wars it is the story of the families we make versus the families we are born into","2123":"sad but had some really funny poignant moments","2124":"the walkling dead has nothing on chechnya","2125":"when you first begin to read this book you believe that it will be sad because it involves war and distruction of lives but the beautiful writing begins to take you out of the war and into the lives of those affected the author does a wonderful job capturing the best of people in the worst conditions yes there are still sad moments but this is a book that uplifts man and what we are capable of when we follow our goodness that is in us all","2126":" at first glance it might be hard to get enthused about the prospects of a novel about the war in chechnya once begun it was a novel that had to win me over and earn my trust in large part perhaps because i was skeptical of a young western writer not so far removed from his iowa writers' workshop residency with no direct connection to the region and its warring ethnicities and sides venturing into such traumatic terrain but win me over marra and constellation did eventually even reminding me in some respects of a more prose dense and contemporary version of ondaatje's the english patient the novel takes time to gather momentum and force and maybe as it slides back and forth from chapter to chapter to years in the 1994 2004 period it tries too hard to formalize the disjointed broken sense of time that ensues from trauma and nearly a post apocalyptic experience marra's research one senses is deeply and conscientiously realized and in such a way that it never or rarely seems to be \"worn on its sleeve \" what eventually transfixed me were the evocations of the haunted wintry and forlorn landscape and especially the indelible characters those spectral individuals still seeking beauty love and life wherever and however partially they can at its best there is a hallucinatory power to this novel marked by poetic and powerful images of the realities of war at one point we learn that havaa's parents \"among other villagers pried toilet bowls from the rubble of collapsed houses and dragging them upside down and two by two gently set them over the unexploded shells \" and dear havaa is surely guaranteed to linger in the reader's consciousness at one point the heroic doctor sonja tries haltingly to comfort havaa when the young girl asks if her missing father will ever come back \"probably not \" sonja tells her and then pauses to consider her own missing sister \"i don't know where she is i don't know if she's alive or dead i know nothing \" of the lost generally havaa then asks \"'how do you find them ' she lifted her gaze to sonja as if teetering on the precipice 'i don't know havaa i'm sorry i don't maybe we try to find them in other people in kindness and generosity those things don't disappear '\" it's a heartbreaking moment full of deep pathos and puts sonja and havaa at the heart of this novel's many dreams of happier elsewheres and elsewhens its many dreams of sanctuaries of love and life and families restored","2127":" if any book will fill you with empathy for other people this will it is about how people can survive the hopelessness of living in a conflict zone by having someone to love and take care of perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written i didn't know anything about the chechen wars before reading this and i am so glad i read it for some reason it feels like doing a good deed reading this book about these fictional people going through this non fictional horrible time and loving them","2128":"portrait of several interconnected lives in war torn chechnya as horrific os some of the circumstances and events are the novel is hauntingly beautiful probably the best adult novel i've read this year","2129":"very rarely do i give a book 5 stars this one is it the setting plot lines characters work in perfect harmony can't believe this is author's 1st novel awarded stegner fellowship from stanford there are tragic circumstances in this novel but not a downer up lifting you'll learn to love some of the characters recommend obviously","2130":"beautifully written harrowing","2131":"unique plot a little slow at times but overall a great book","2132":"one of the best books i've ever read the dichotomy of horror and beauty in the midst of war and its war torn people reminded me of cold mountain another all time favorite i cannot recommend this book highly enough","2133":"chechnia what a disaster but some survivors and pure human kindness as well","2134":"a very powerful story told with almost dreamlike prose the author created great characters and wove their stories together with a really engrossing story","2135":"i might have liked this one more if i had read it rather than listened a rare comment from me","2136":"beautifully written historically accurate and emotionally heart wrenching debut novel","2137":"truly fantastic character development in s war torn setting ii loved the characters and their heartbreaking backgrounds and character flaws that forced them together","2138":"this might be my favorite book this year it's just heart breaking and warm and human in a way that only books set in russia chechen are able to be","2139":"2015 reading challenge week 6 book by an author under 30","2140":"i thought the story was great an eye opener about life in the soviet union for me the writing was too fragmented resulting in a hard to follow story due to shifts in characters and time periods in every chapter almost like short stories which all come together","2141":"this book unveiled a new world within my world that i never knew existed and all of its soul was revealed in each page a searing read showing illustratively the intersections of lives u0026amp their reverberations","2142":"a masterpiece breathtaking from the beginning till the end a wonderful combination of history and emotions","2143":"i stopped part way through this book i have heard raves from people i trust so all i can say is it isn't my kind of book reading this just wasn't an enjoyable experience and i had no reason to think that it was going to change if i read further","2144":"this was a beautiful and powerful novel not one i'll soon forget","2145":"although i found this book an interesting read it was a difficult start i found myself floundering in the beginning due to a lack of previous knowledge about the wars in chechnya the storyline however was very compelling and i found the characters to be not only unique but to embody the conflicts in a way that really brought to life the issues of ethnic conflict and displacement as seen by ordinary people whose lives were affected by the russian occupation and the ensuing battles for freedom","2146":" okay everyone heads up pay attention to what vladimir putin is doing in the crimea right now read this article and then read this book and angelina joli have you read this you need to make a movie of it http www bloombergview com articles absolutely heartbreaking one of the bleakest books i have ever read i am trying to come up with something to compare it to and am coming up empty countless villages have been wiped out because of war during the history of mankind but how many have been cleared out person by person by an informer who is one of their own who is doing this to save his own life and his father's even though his actions have distanced the father and son to the point of total detachment even though those reports are quotas and his victims guilty of little or nothing or of just being humane even though they are the few neighbors he has ever had and then there is the hospital with only one doctor sonja a woman who is practicing in chechnya only because of a sister whose whereabouts and fate are unknown to her her employees are an elderly woman who has lost a sister and a guard who is a former soldier now one armed sonja's sister natasha had escape chechnia only to find herself in but a brothel addicted to heroin she returns only to disappear again sonja acquires her medical supplies from a black market in gratitude from a man whose brother's life passed through sonja's hands the book begins with a nightime raid of a village house at which refugees would stop for a meal and night of rest the father is taken away his daughter havaa escapes to the forest with her suitcase their neighbor akhmad takes havaa to the only harbor of safety in the country a hospital sonja's hospital only five days pass for sonja akhmad and havaa in this book i have a few quibbles with the book i'm not sure if any child could be so beyond their years as havaa is even one forced to grow up and accept what war does and takes away i was excited by the timeline preceding chapters but the chapters did not stay in the year indicated flashbacks and information about the characters' futures dominated instead making me forget where a chapter started and therefore making those timelines a moot point but these are quibbles little irritants not enough to make me say anything other than this is an overachieving first novel marra's writing made me bleed with empathy i wanted to play god and staunch their suffering last week a co worker from russia passed her citizenship test to be reading of the crimean war and at the same time see this warm loving hard working woman become a citizen of our free and comfortable country was highly emotional for me as with any war there are people who survive they create new lives new families in spite of it all there is always that","2147":"finally finished this took me so long to get through it's very heavy subject matter but a well written story that helps when you're reading about war and refugees","2148":"anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena is a powerful telling of how the horrors of war can cause average people to do extraordinary things i loved the thought provoking style in which the author explored the relationship between the main characters painting a picture of lives that were lived to honor to betray to love to survive wartime chechnya","2149":"this is the best book i've read this year interesting characters non linear storytelling beautiful word choice fascinating setting i would read it again and want to look for other books by this author the audio was great but there were so many things i wanted to underline i may need to revisit it","2150":"loved the story but hated the story telling style it's such a moving story but because of the way it was written or edited it made it hard to enjoy for example it kept using the term'the girl' rather than 'havaa' which is what 'the girl' actually refers to and i'm not sure if the book was initially written in other languages rather than english a lot of sentences just sound backwards and awfully uncomfortable to read through","2151":"i'm the worst at writing literary critiques but oh my if you enjoy reading at all you should read this book next it is a luminous story that captures the big t truth about being human devastating and resonant","2152":"unbelievably good","2153":"though this book had a small interesting story about a group of people i found the book to be depressing and way to graphic","2154":" this book made me feel good after i'd finished it in the way that a really good workout does like it hurts but because it's exercised muscles you haven't used in a while i don't read stories about human cruelty for fun sometimes they sneak in on me and to say this story is about cruelty is inaccurate but the cruelty is such a part of it and is the entire reason why this story takes its shape but at the end when the people whose lives we've followed all seem to connect for just an instant and we recognize it they've been moving through the same geographic area for the entirety of the book back and forwards through time it was a wondering moment i went to sleep thinking about the horrible things people do to other people but that's not what this book is trying to do i think it's trying to show that those horrors do define the shapes our lives take but not who we are not unless we allow it i suppose it's like art and different people will take away different things that's what i take a really extremely good book","2155":"wow another great read takes place in recently war torn eastern europe","2156":"one of the most beautifully written books that i have read in years unfolds like gentle ribbons","2157":"beautiful prose the chechnyan setting intrigues marra explores the effects of trauma as well as any writer i've read but he doesn't ask readers to experience that trauma so much as use it to help us understand why the characters are who they are","2158":"amazing writing i reread many sections for the beautiful language and the author's ability to evoke emotion this book falls in the category of the kiterunner and little bee and so many others written about war torn and impoverished countries it's a heart wrenching but satisfying story i was sometimes confused by the switches between characters' narratives and would have benefited from a cheat sheet of characters and their relationships","2159":"the best book i've read in the last year and a wonderful book to begin my reading in 2015 the writing is beautiful even though the content is so heart wrenching i was struck with the intimacy of the characters and their circumstances while constantly being aware of how distant i typically feel from the daily media reports from worn torn countries the compassion for the characters trying to find survival decency love and dignity in such inhuman circumstances is stunning","2160":"loved it could not believe it is a debut novel the writing is exquisite and characters that have such strength compassion and to survive the chechchen war 1940 1944 they pull at your heart strings","2161":" this was a rather heavy read centered around the lives of people living through a history of violent occupation in chechnya there are some graphic scenes that depict torture and i personally always find this a struggle to get through i found the story to be quite engaging but did not care for the constant and abrupt changes to timeline the jumps were often very abrupt and pulled me right out of the story it was the characters that kept me so engaged they were so real and so damaged by everything they were living through heartbreaking really","2162":"curiously my copy of a constellation of vital phenomena was bound upside down so from the moment i opened the cover i was pushed off kilter it wasn't the last time i was knocked over this is a beautiful book i read tolstoy too long ago to say whether the comparisons made by other reviewers are apt but jonathan safran foer's everything is illuminated certainly came to mind--for its setting its precocity and audacity and its heart if i have anything to add it would be to compare this novel to joe sacco's palestine and other reporting from war zones it follows small individual stories rather than taking on the great sweep of events to illuminate the larger forces at work and makes it impossible to see these remote events in the same way writing about the corrosive effects of the soviet displacement and repatriation of chechnya is an ambitious undertaking especially for a young american novelist but it is also largely unplowed ground so marra has room to invent because we come prepared to accept the novelist's version of this dark history and follow him through we are conducted via the perspective of a few sufferers an inept country doctor who always wanted to be an artist an historian who regards himself as having failed with his magnum opus a surgeon holding together a nearly abandoned hospital a resister turned informant an orphaned girl thanks to the informant who is being sought by the security forces and others whose stories entwine and pull apart and come together again marra portrays the numbness that comes from living with the ongoing possibility of being sent to the landfill for obscure reasons but he also shows how dignity and a shrunken version of hope can survive under these terrible circumstances throughout he summarizes the breakdown of society and its effects in small but potent details farther down the street the side of a building had crushed all the cars in a parking lot he was thirty nine years old and had hoped to own a car by this age in one scene marra describes a hemorrhaging mother's futile trip to find medical treatment and a father begging her forgiveness for his failures if she had been dying every minute of every day they might have been a happy family hard not to see tolstoy there he launches into one sentence that lasts for more than a page starting with the effects of creating portraits of the disappeared and leading into the fates of two brothers reunited in a mass grave but only when i reached the end did i look back in amazement realizing how masterfully i'd been transported and went back to read it again just to savor the experience because this book is full of harsh realities and bad endings it may be difficult for some in fact i reserved judgment for some time because even though i could begin to see how the strands of the story would connect i wasn't certain the author could pull it off emotionally without leaving me feeling manipulated perhaps like his characters i had spent the pages holding myself together resisting the terrible fates i saw coming but also the human feelings that demanded expression a short distance from the end i finished a chapter and felt like my soul had suddenly inevitably been unzipped i had to put the book down and walk away so i could finish it with clear eyes and then write something that would tell you to read it","2163":"such a great book completely loved it was such a great book for book club discussion","2164":"this is a deeply moving sensitively written and brilliantly conceived novel about a constellation of people living in the ruins of chechnya the vital phenomena of the novel's title refers in the first instance to the events and people that survive amidst the ruins of a bombed out hospital however as the story unfolds those vital signs move far beyond the immediate backdrop of the hospital to chechnya's tragic history as seen through the eyes of the novel's characters marra masterfully weaves narrative time to offer a kaleidoscopic treatment of the affects of the chechnyan wars on three families bound by tragedy heroism and historical contingency marra's narrative is shot through with wit and irony as it takes up the worst and best of characters trapped in history we meet characters who make meaning even amidst the ruins of time and find there beauty compassion and a shared humanity marra takes up an event in a week of ordinary time or at least as ordinary as time can be amidst the rubble of a town whose residents are disappeared with heightening frequency into which she inserts flashbacks as well as flash forwards through to the middle of the 21st century what a great first read of 2014 i heartily recommend this","2165":"a very moving book as well as an education about chechnya the effects of war and a detailing of war's possible consequences but i don't recommend the book just for those reasons it is an engrossing story with real human flawed characters it will be enjoyed by the literary as well as the lay reader a real classic","2166":"wow i don't know what to say i need to gather my thoughts","2167":"not for the faint of heart i considered rating this book 4 stars because the subject matter was brutally disturbing it took me a long time to get through this book because i needed to take breaks after taking several days to digest the enormity of the emotions i felt after finally finishing i decided the book is brilliant and deserves 5 stars the main story takes place in five days yet the writing takes the reader through a non chronological narrative over a 10 year time period and beyond the interconnecting threads of the story establish connections between the characters that are surprising and meaningful as the story unfolds we learn exactly how the actions of the characters determined the fate of others this becomes truly captivating in the last 60 pages of the book by the end of the book i knew the past and future experiences of the characters and felt complete closure and satisfaction i recommend reading the author's notes at the end first time novelist anthony mara who is not chechen tells about his research of post soviet russia and how he was able to describe with insight and chilling detail the day to day life of wartime chechens the sex trade journey through the breaking grounds into western europe torture at the landpits and more he explains that the axis in which the novel rests is from two narratives shared by islamic and christian traditions that of a parent asked to sacrifice a child and that of an orphan delivered into the family responsible for her orphanhood","2168":"i adored this book the beginning was a little bit slow but all of it was written so beautifully i made myself slow down so this book could last longer it's definitely a book i recommend often","2169":"though i wish there weren't so much violence hard to do when you're writing about assassins i'm in awe of the political take he has eisler will be in houston 2 19 u0026amp i'm going to see him he's got lots to say on politics and publishing and isn't bad to look at either","2170":" i love this book i am quite impressed that it was the author's debut novel and he will be on my list as read anything he writes there were a couple things he did differently that i think really set his writing style apart and took a bit of getting used to but were very effective namely the way he gave you information about characters sort of in passing that served to paint a fuller picture without having to insert paragraphs of prose which is so annoying i also really liked how he was able to make the characters deep and complex and not just sad people from a war torn area which i think some authors and journalists and others really fail at","2171":"wow this was an amazing book i love these family epics that move forward and backwards through time taking on the perspectives of various characters the writing was lyrical and the story was rich and felt more like memoir than novel at times the topic was heavy but i loved reading it and look forward to doing so again soon","2172":" i'm about to list a bunch of things i didn't like about this book but am willing to state that it was generally okay and i'm feeling very cynical at the moment someone saw me reading this the other day and asked what i thought of it and my response was that it is very typical of what passes for award winning fiction these days see cynical i mean it just seems to check all of the boxes it's about people trying to find and save family members during wartime so you know it's real sad there's a bumbling simpleton enduring tough times who makes hilariously misinformed statements about stuff like mcdonald's so you know it's real tender and funny there's a precocious little kid who does cute little kid stuff the story is told in a non linear fashion jumping back and forth between time periods so you know the author is deliberately putting off revealing certain plot points for real drama later on there are multiple patches of purple prose that essentially play the role of crescendoing string sections during particularly emotional scenes in dramatic movies i dunno it all just seemed really paint by numbers at first i was excited because i thought i'd learn a little bit about the wars in chechnya an area i don't really know anything about but honestly this could've been set anywhere during any war in the 1900s i'm not expecting a full blown historical account or anything but a little more detail and interspersing of historical fact would've gone a long way and the prose i was into it at first but by the end i couldn't stop rolling my eyes every time marra left the story to use some kind of melodramatic technique i'll give you an example there's a recurring trick where marra will randomly tell us the future of unimportant minor characters for instance guard #3 at a post would wave the main characters through a border station marra would then say something like 12 years from now this guard would wave to his wife in italy and recall this moment or a policeman would kick a dog and we'd get 9 years from now the policeman would lose his testicles to cancer and be eaten by wolves haha karma bitch to make matters worse this recurring narrative trick ends up being part of the climax and by that point i was so sick of it i almost threw the book into outer space i mean am i being totally heartless here sure okay the plight of some of the characters was tragic and some of the scenes of wartime violence were absolutely horrifying but i wasn't really moved by anything and considering the material that is saying a lot now that i think about it 2 stars is probably generous i think i need to stop reading books with back cover blurbs like a flash in the heavens that makes you look up and believe in miracles at any rate this just seems like your typical wartime novel everyone else seems to be loving this so maybe i'm just a curmudgeon","2173":" this is a type of book that hasn't been attempted successfully in a while an american tries to write a book from the perspective of others the novel gets in to the minds of ethnic russians and chechens in the time of the first and second chechen wars for those who probably don't know anything about the conflict it's a great introduction to the era and the craziness of it all and i enjoyed reading it on a deeper level it somehow makes the characters too big and to stereotypical the book lacks subtlety not that i didn't enjoy reading it","2174":" this book was surprisingly good i heard a positive review on npr so i was expecting something noteworthy but the little literary jewels often caught me off guard i would be reading entranced in the story and would stumble over a beautiful sentence this book is definitely worth reading because of the backdrop of the two chechen wars that i personally hadn't really heard about before the character development and the emotions that the author can so effectively make you feel at times i felt like the author did too much jumping around between time periods he also glossed over some important connections between characters while spending a lot of time in other areas that didn't feel as important still a great read but be prepared to pay attention","2175":" this was one of the best books i've read in a long time beautiful prose and complex interesting characters one of my favorite passages \"at the kitchen table she examined the glass of ice each cube was rounded by room temperature dissolving in its own remains and belatedly she understood that this was how a loved one disappeared despite the shock wave of walking into an empty flat the absence isn't immediate more a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an erasure but a conversion in form from presence to memory from solid to liquid and the person you once touched runs over your skin now in sheets down your back and you may bathe may sink may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it \"","2176":"loved this one","2177":"i might come back to write a review but having just finished it i can barely think straight but i do want to record that this is an incredible book","2178":" this book received many great reviews and was on several 2014 best book lists i thought it would be better partly i was confused in the beginning about the history of the area there were references to many events that i had never heard of it also had a slow start and it took about 100 pages for me to be interested in the story once the story started however i did enjoy reading about the characters i liked how the author slowly revealed the characters back stories and how they were all connected although i am was not familiar with the area or history the story was really about trying to survive and find humanity in each other during terrible conditions created by war","2179":"wanted to be able to read but had to stop because of the foul language","2180":"wow the story is both uplifting and heartbreaking it's not a light read and is filled with thought provoking characters and plots i greatly enjoyed it and felt connected to the characters even though their experiences are so far removed from my own","2181":"i had pretty high expectations for this and at the beginning was unsure if it would meet them but it did the writing and storytelling were really great i thought the timeline and intricate connections were unique and interesting though at times slightly hard to keep up with one of the bestbooks i've read in a while","2182":"the author was able to give a good sense of the conflict in chechnya through the stories of a group of individuals from a remote village each character is distinct and intelligent and often funny perhaps the liveliness of the characters makes their often unfortunate fates fell all the more tragic","2183":"incredibly written beautiful evocative language and story and yet incredibly difficult to read at the same time for its reality of a difficult time","2184":"this is a haunting piece of work i cannot imagine that i will ever have the courage to reread it but i will surely never forget it","2185":"super fabulous beautiful and compelling and heart breaking so so lovely one of my new favorites and sure to stay on my list forever","2186":"beautiful very sad but full of hope didn't know much about the chechins and their wars with russia but now i see why the chechins feel and act as they do","2187":"beautiful there is much to say about this novel which works admirably at both the micro and macro levels lovely sentences and note perfect paragraphs meet well drawn characters and an intricately woven poignant story war informs this novel without taking over history and research seep through richly yet subtly perhaps most impressively hope persists in its fragile way you feel these characters' devastating circumstances while also getting caught up in their daily lives and choices they are so compelling that it's easy to forget momentarily all they have lost you find yourself smiling about the sea anemones and ists the murals and the portraits the moments of beauty and humor all the more lovely because they are fleeting this balancing act was handled deftly and with grace by the author without resorting to the cliches of war or obfuscating chechnya's history i cannot wait to see what he does next","2188":"a novel of 5 days in a chechyan town during what seems to be endless war it focuses on a small group of people affecting each other consciously and unknowingly as well there's great writing here as well as dire observations of interaction of relationships and consequences of actions taken by the characters","2189":"i liked that there were a few stories going on and how nicely they all tied together at the end i knew very little about the setting and so that was very interesting i also liked the way the author projected future actions onto the characters they were nicely developed in that manner","2190":" it's a great book not a light read and not a very happy read but it leaves you with enough humanity and enough people alive at the end barely that you aren't completely devastated by the book for me it caused a visceral sense at one point of the fatalism that comes to a place that is war torn for decades i kept wanting something good to happen then realized it probably wouldn't the writing is very good the characters are realistic and interesting and the story is heartbreaking if you're in the mood to go into the heart of a place torn by conflict and the into the hearts of the damaged people who are living there you should read this book","2191":" this book really took me by surprise i didn't know anything about it before reading other than that it was reviewed well and wow was it great the novel centers around a man named akhmed in a village in chechnya in the early 2000s the area is a battle ground between russian soldiers and chechnyan nationalist rebels and rebel sympathizers are frequently disappeared when akhmed's neighbor and friend dokka is taken away he sneaks dokka's daughter away to the local hospital for safehaven where they fall in with a doctor sonja who is basically running the place on her own as the book progresses a lot of detail is filled in about the lives of the people of chechnya trying to strike a balance between protecting themselves from the russians while also maintaining their values and their dignity this book is very sad at times but the prose is amazing and the story is captivating","2192":"one of the best books i have ever read marra is masterful and left me with a strong need to weep i put this right up there with marquez and other greats","2193":"heartbreaking and beautiful","2194":"beautifully written and told story though very sad","2195":"this book is haunting and captivating i couldn't put it down and it made me want to know more about a place i knew nothing about highly recommend it","2196":" i was between 4 and 5 stars so i gave it 5 this is a great book for book clubs very rich so much to discuss i knew nothing about the wars before reading and the author did a great job with what i had to know to enjoy the story he had great character development too i really enjoyed reading some of the commentaries on it after i finished those from npr and ny times are two that made me thing deeper great book slow in the beginning and hard subject matter along with difficulty with keeping the characters straight a bit were the reason i leaned toward 4 stars","2197":" two doctors risk everything to save the life of a hunted child in this majestic debut about love loss and the unexpected ties that bind us together \"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones \" havaa eight years old hides in the woods and watches the blaze until her neighbor akhmed discovers her sitting in the snow akhmed knows getting involved means risking his life and there is no safe place to hide a child in a village where informers will do anything for a loaf of bread but for reasons of his own he sneaks her through the forest to the one place he thinks she might be safe an abandoned hospital where the sole remaining doctor sonja rabina treats the wounded though sonja protests that her hospital is not an orphanage akhmed convinces her to keep havaa for a trial and over the course of five extraordinary days sonja's world will shift on its axis and reveal the intricate pattern of connections that weaves together the pasts of these three unlikely companions and unexpectedly decides their fate","2198":" it is a disturbing feeling to learn of endless atrocities in a war one hardly attended to it makes one wonder who the havaas and sonjas and dokkas are in the world today i have no problem imagining the unrelenting cruelty of the oppressor regime or the unrelenting hardship of the victims yet somehow the author includes one too many examples of pain and suffering mental or physical including achmed's mercy killing of his wife or khasaan's near mercy killing of his son while the effect is not gratuitous the difficulty of digesting one before the next occurs dulls the palate otherwise i feel grateful to the author for exposing the truth about this place and time as well as for his portrait of the gutsy and capable character sonja","2199":"i really liked this book it's fiction based on life in chechnya during two wars with russia i prefer non fiction so i did like the historical and factual events in this book it gave a good view of what life must be like to go from a modern society such as our own to walking through dirt and rubble every day for years trying to find food unimaginable i did some research online and now want to read more about chechnya one thing the author did that was at first cool then annoying but was welcome at the end of the book was that he would tell the reader what the outcome would be many years later for a particular character he over used this technique but at the end of the book i was grateful for the glimpse far into the future at what the life of particular characters would end up like","2200":"well written fascinating story set in during the two chechan russian conflicts 21st century","2201":"powerful wonderful and a must read especially for fans of the cellist of sarajevo lovely","2202":"a beautifully written novel","2203":"amazing i love books i can't put down that also teach me about a time or place i knew nothing about beforehand","2204":" ok here is my personal review author's first novel thank you for the history lesson sentences go on and on but he is never short for good descriptive words a very interesting writing style content was war and all the things i don't like about war but important to grasp what the characters endured to get to the end resulting in a page turner around 3 4 of the way through very interesting how the author intertwines the different stories for a full on emotional ending with great depth i want his next book to be just like the the last quarter of this book i know it is the ending wrapping up conclusion and so on therefore it tends to hold your interest but the style of writing at least to me was very different i say to the author focus on how you pulled the reader in towards the end there were no extra needless words just very descriptive and a very meaningful beautiful writing style","2205":"this perceptive novel is set in a small town in wartime chechnya only a few residents of the town have survived and they are interconnected in various ways the characters are wonderfully well developed and i was involved enough to care about them all even the informer who sets the main action of the book on its course there is also a female russian surgeon who is the only doctor to remain in a nearby city hospital these are people of principle trying to copy with what really can't be coped with it is a great read","2206":"this might be the best book i have read is what i said to my husband twice beautifully written and achingly sad","2207":"i took too long to get through the book but i loved it grim and tragic but beautifully written story of intertwined lives during the war in chechnya","2208":"sometimes i read a book and wonder how anyone could give it five stars this time i wonder how anyone could not the writing the story the characters pure perfection in my book this one will stick with me for a long long time","2209":"heartbreakingly amazing","2210":"this may be the best book i've read in the past ten years i think and hope that it will be one that people will be reading for a long long time very beautifully written","2211":"can't say i really enjoyed this book sad and hard to read just to much suffering for my taste i will say it was beautifully written","2212":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a remarkable debut novel the story takes place is czechnya during the second czechen war and it follows a group of people including an 8 year old girl who just became an orphan a young woman surgeon desperate to find her missing sister and a man with a dying wife who paints pictures of 41 murdered neighbors and hangs them around his ruined village three souls that have nothing in common and yet their fates intertwine with one another in ways they could never have imagined havaa's house has been burned down her father taken away by the feds never to return again she is only eight has no place to go no one to take care of her one blue suitcase filled with souvenirs is all she has left she is so vulnerable so breakable so pure and naive and confused by the cruelty of the world surrounding her she's just a little girl and no little girl should ever have to go through the things havaa went through see the things havaa saw and feel the pain havaa felt it's heartbreaking to even think about it and even more heartbreaking when you realize there are thousands of children out there whose faiths are equally or more tragic sonja's a surgeon the only surgeon in volchansk ever since her sister natasha disappeared sonja's life revolves around the trauma ward she doesn't even go home to sleep anymore the hospital is her home now she's burned out bitter and addicted to amphetamine she lived on amphetamine and sweetened condensed milk had regular hallucinations had difficulty empathizing with her patients and had seen enough cases of secondary traumatic stress disorder to recognize herself among them akhmed describes her as cold domineering woman whose glare could wither flowers and cause miscarriages akhmed havaa's neighbor carries his own burden his wife is very sick she's in and out of consciousness her lucidity comes and goes she's slowly becoming a shadow of the woman she used to be fading away little by little with each passing day she was gone but still there the phantom of the wife the war had amputated from him and unable to properly mourn or love her he cared for and begrudged her akhmed is the one who finds havaa in the woods after her father is taken away he can't take care of the girl himself and so he makes the decision to take her to the hospital and ask sonja to take her in sonja of course isn't very eager to add yet another burden to her already overwhelmingly messy life but in exchange for akhmed's help at the hospital she agrees to let her stay there temporarily the writing is beautiful achingly beautiful vivid saturated evocative illuminating powerful i can see myself re reading this novel just to experience the flavorful writing style again juxtaposed with the brutal depressing thoroughly disturbing reality of war immersed chechnya the narration style seems as light fragile and gentle as butterfly's wings and the contrasting combination of the two really enhances the reading experience i was charmed and disturbed mesmerized and scared all at the same time the historical backdrop is rich and accurate the book covers the decade of two chechen wars exploring different timelines through flashbacks and recollections of events from the characters' past when asked why he chose this particular period of history as the backdrop of his novel marra said czechnya is a corner of the world largely mysterious to most americans yet it's a remarkable place populated with remarkable people who have become accustomed to repeatedly rebuilding their lives to quote tobias wolff we are made to persist that's how we find outthink we are these characters commit acts of courage betrayal and forgiveness as they persist in saving what means most to them be it their families their honor or themselves from the destruction of war even the title of this book carries a meaning it comes from a description of life in a medical book according to that description life is a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement reproduction and adaptation six phenomena that structure our lives havaa akhmed and sonja might not be real people but they're very far from being purely fictional characters either what they represent and stand for what they witness and experience their pain suffering hopes and dreams all these things are very real these people stole my heart and became extended family i got attached to them very fast and will be thinking about them for a very long time a constellation of vital phenomena is a book not to be missed a true literary triumph in both the form and substance i am thrilled to have discovered it and to have the opportunity to read it it was definitely a life enriching experience","2213":"i found myself skimming certain characters' stories but riveted by others i really liked how the book truly was arranged in a plot like a constellation connecting dots until the very last chapter the time period jumped and changed during each chapter but i felt like i was watching a puzzle come together and liked that i just wish i'd enjoyed reading every character's story","2214":"well written but a yawnerand lots of disgusting detail of hospital horror with blood and guts yuck","2215":" gorgeous writing this book will stick with me for a long time we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written her father was the face of her morning and night he was everything so saturating havaa's world that she could no more describe him than she could the air how often is immense sadness mistaken for courage 'don't insult me everyone knows a turtle is a crustacean on its mother's side ' 'explain that to me ' she said shifting in the seat as the car spun in circles 'a lizard fucks a crab and nine months later a turtle pops out it's called evolution ' happiness came in moments of unpredictable loveliness 'you can tell by the way i use my walk i'm a woman's man ' laina said without lifting her eyes from the needle tips 'you know that song ' 'of course people used to recite it in the war i didn't know it was a song for the longest time i thought it was from the qur'an ' anthony marra a constellation of vital phenomena","2216":"i really liked this book it was incredible to me that all of this was happening in chechnya such a short time ago i had heard about it on the news of course but marra added such a personal facet to it","2217":"so boring i couldn't even finish it","2218":"one of the best books i've read this year heartbreaking every step of the way but so beautifully written","2219":" words are not sufficient to describe the beauty and impact of this novel the plot and storyline are intricately and masterfully crafted to render a story of chechnya told through the lives of four families the present day action takes place over the course of five days in 2004 interwoven with backstory spanning the preceding decade the descriptions are both lovely and unique the characters are full and real the story is imbued with moments of humor but mostly your heart will crack from the humanity that anthony marra delivers with each page","2220":" this is a book that i regret not paying closer attention to from the start it deserves and needs that focus to appreciate the subtle yet powerful unraveling of marra's story set in the midst of the war between russia and native chechens from the mid 1990's to 2004 the story goes far beyond the typical war recounting while i learned of a recent strife i knew nothing about i also saw how brutally and twistedly national conflict can affect friends family neighbors what may be even more astonishing is how compassion hope and bravery survive the horrors of war as they move into the homes of the innocent havaa the eight year old girl who the story seems to center around is the ultimate innocent akhmed who appears to be just her kindly neighbor helps hide her from rebel informants in a bare bones hospital sonja who appears to be just an overworked strung out doctor reluctantly takes havaa in and as the pages turn marra unveils layer after layer of relationship between these three and other complex characters akhmed's ailing wife sonja's tragic sister havaa's loving mother and father when you are done with your summer beach reads and ready for something meatier to delve into this fall this is your book while marra surely aims to explore recent chechen tagedy he accomplishes so much more not a book you will soon forget just remember to pay attention","2221":"beautifully written tragic and haunting typically this kind of eccentric organizing of time comes across as too self conscious in novels but here it feels like the natural way of things and true to the kind of fracturing that takes place on all levels during war i'm a little in awe a lot in awe at marra's skill in creating a novel that addresses so directly so many difficult truths at points so intimately it's uncomfortable to go on but you do go on because you just need to make sure each of these characters is okay in the end","2222":"i had a tough time getting into this started listening to it switched to reading it and switched back to audio i don't know why but i kept finding myself easily distracted i stuck with it because a good friend loved it and wanted me to read it i know that's not an overwhelming endorsement but i am ending up giving it a 4 stars i wish i had paid closer attention so many small details were related to others i want to go back and reread it now","2223":"excellent about a 4 5 for me i wasn't hooked for about the first 20 pages but then he had me a quite interesting recent historical fiction about chechnya and two wars in the 1990's and 2000's the character development was good it made for an interconnected web the writing was strong lots of well crafted sentences to appreciate as you went along the author would do this neat thing where he would be talking about a character in present tense and then poof offer a sentence or two that felt like a wisp of smoke a flash forward for what the future would hold for that character plenty of good discussion topics from family to loyalty to love i'm looking forward to talking about it","2224":"couldn't put this book down loved it","2225":"wow this book it started off bleak and intense and that atmosphere just ratcheted up with every single page although it skirted the boundary at times for the most part it didn't feel like torture porn or oppressive to read instead it was the most elegiac portrait of the way life's dramatic and small moments are magnified in a war zone and of the fluidity and iterative nature of time and memory i thought the slow reveals were absolutely stellar and perfectly constructed the language was gorgeous especially stark against this grim backdrop \"smuggling routes ran through the border regions like veins through marble\" and the character arcs built so quietly and powerfully you didn't realize how much you cared until the next revelation took your breath away although at times it felt a bit too self consciously literary and there were a few garcia marquez flourishes i didn't really care for i'm trying to be less critical of that because there has to be room for beauty and poetry when telling a story as difficult as this one","2226":"this story gives us a look into the ordinary day lives and struggles of the people of chechnya","2227":" intricately told this is not a book to browse or skim the humor interspersed with the horrors of war crimes and death along with the telling of two sides to most stories gave a picture of humanity that left me changing my feelings for characters from the beginning to the end of the book the author seamlessly told the current story as well as the characters history i especially liked that the author let you know how the characters ended up even if the endings weren't happy this book followed five days plus flashbacks in the history of chechnya a country i knew little about i'm horrified to think that these types of atrocities truly happen to fellow human beings","2228":"this is a difficult read but worth every beautiful word interesting history that i hadn't known dealing with war desperation and coping it's an amazing feat that this young author can write with such insight and beauty","2229":" this is a life changing book i don't want to write too much here i knew nothing about the book when i started it it was my total ignorance about the plot that made my experience reading this that much more profound about a quarter of the way through the book i knew it was by far the best i'd read so far this year by the time i read the last page i knew it was one of the best novels i'd read...ever i'm not usually this effusive with my praise for books so trust me on this one put down whatever you're reading and start this instead","2230":"i don't think i was in the right frame of mind to read this book there was a lot of background that i got lost in some parts did not need to be included in my opinion i will probably re read this book at another time but i will be in the frame of mind to take it all in","2231":" i'm changing this to a 5 star i finished this 2 weeks ago and am still thinking about it this is a great book about a topic i knew nothing about and really delves into the hope despair and resiliency of war i loved that marra went back and explained the reasoning behind each character's behavior those i originally judged i came to know in a whole new light once their often horrifying and brutal back stories were explained the writing is wonderful and i couldn't help but wonder what i would do if put in each of their situations","2232":"i am one of the few reviewers who felt this book was more of a chore to read rather than a pleasure throughout constellation i often found myself confused with the sequence of events i'm not dumb - i saw the years noted in the beginning of each chapter - but that still did not make the book come together for me i often found myself trying to piece together if a certain event had already happened or not marra says he wrote it in that style because it would be more analogous to the characters trying to piece together their broken lives while that may be clever for me it was more frustrating i actually like books that deal with various points in time books in which multiple stories unfold in a sequence that creates drama rather than chronological sense but unfortunately for me marra created more confusion than anticipation as far as gaining a better understanding of chechnya - i think i now know that i will never really understand all of the history and politics that lead up to the wars and fueled the wars but i'm glad i at least have a basic knowledge - where before i was clueless finally i will say that marra really does write amazingly moving passages that made the journey worth it in the end for me - and coaxed 3 stars out of me rather than 2 but it's probably not a journey i'll recommend to any friends dan","2233":" let me just say that a constellation of vital phenomena was such an amazing book it is so hard to believe that this is marra's debut novel this is one of the books where i am having a hard time describing it to people just because i'm so worried about giving the story its due justice the subject matter of this book centers around the chechen wars in russia in the 1990s and mid 2000s and focuses on several characters whose lives and destinies are interwoven with each other this book is heartbreaking but redeeming i loved so many of the characters in this book you really want them to pull through and for things to be okay for them there are a lot of characters in this book but the way that marra weaves them together is pretty amazing he focuses on the people that in many ways are innocent bystanders in all of the violence going on in chechnya i thought it was such an interesting way to allow the reader into the world of this region i fancy myself relatively knowledgeable about history and politics but admittedly i do not know very much about chechnya at all i know a little bit about the various wars and the politics of the area but this book gives a really intimate view of the war and the effect that it had on the people of the region although this book is fiction i think that it gives really good insight into what happened to this region and how the past events are continuing to impact what is happening in this region today i know that i certainly have a better understanding of chechnya in the author's note you get to see how muchmarra's writing is one of the stars of this book overall the writing is very good he pulls you very deeply into the lives of these characters ahhh it's so hard to describe one minute he's writing something really serious that made me tear up and the next he's sliding in a little bit of humor that comes out of nowhere i know that i will eagerly be anticipating his next release","2234":"this book blew me away i can't believe the author is only 28 i expect to see great things from him in the future i love books that have moments that make you say oh and this book was full of them an incredible story beautifully written this one will stay with me for a while i hope mr marra is already working on another book i will be first in line to read it","2235":"having just finished this book i literally do not have the language to review it it is a breathtaking debut that is so beautifully written simultaneously heartbreaking and hopeful this left me smiling through tears at possibly the best ending i have ever read my ties to russia may have slightly influenced my love of this novel but regardless this is one of the best i've ever read","2236":"dark and haunting and touching gave me more understanding and interest in chechnya","2237":"this is a harrowing and beautiful story of humanity and inhumanity it will resonate deeply with anyone who has an ounce of compassion","2238":"a constellation of vital phenomena is topping best of 2013 lists everywhere and i finally know why it's amazing anthony marra transports the reader through vivid prose and wonderfully complex characters to war torn chechnya circa the early 2000s i loved every minute of this book read my full review here http www thewhynottblog com book re","2239":"this book is full of sorrow and beauty in equal measures it shows the full scope of how human beings live with each other the capacity for evil as well as the capacity for love i didn't know much about chechnya other than what i've gleaned from headlines and i'm grateful to the author for revealing the harsh beauty of the place and its people amazing book","2240":"quite a bold book stylistically and narratively told using the now standard technique of jumping around in time and with lots of flashbacks but also employs flashforward epilogue tidbits scattered throughout many beautifully written moments of grand storytelling set in war torn chechnya a place i have never before visited in fiction non fiction or life","2241":"its hard for me to describe my feelings about this book it's a hauntingly beautiful story of people living in a small village in war torn chechnya some are ethnic russians and some are chechan muslins it's a story of destruction horror pain and sorrow it's hard to believe that the author anthony marra could write such a tale and not have lived through this time it's a story of relationships some long standing some new and forced by circumstances to blossom almost every character in the book is telling an important story although very depressing the book does hold some hope for the future of some of the characters and there are moments of humor and hope i wish i could give this book more than 5 stars but i would surely give it as many stars and possible it's interesting that the title of the book a constellation of vital phenomena actually comes from a medical text the title is a definition for life organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaption they are all surely represented in the book","2242":"like the title suggests a completely phenomenal book touching deeply tear jerking ending the author's literary skills left me in complete awe he weaves an incredible heart wrenching tale i highly recommend this book","2243":"brilliant touching a must read","2244":"unfortunately this book did not capture me at all my mind kept thinking about the bronze horseman which in my opinion this book did not hold a candle too and probably ruined it for me even though the two books aren't really comparable except for perhaps the setting it will be interesting to see what the rest of the bookclub ladies think of it","2245":"excellent writing interesting characters and great storytelling about a cluster of people in chechnya add up to a great read","2246":"interesting read knew nothing of the chechen wars this book doesn't really educate you on much of that rather it takes place during them so you learn along the way this is what i learned war is bad the writer is good i just can't believe people and governments devolve to that level it's awful","2247":"a haunting and ultimately lyrical novel about the wars in chechnya and their effect on the lives of some seemingly normal and random people i almost gave up about halfway through and now am profoundly thankful i stuck with it sad chilling and inspirational the lives and loves of these characters will be sure to stay with me for some time highly recommended","2248":"beautifully written and moving but oh so very bleak","2249":"a haunting novel heart wrenching and i was introduced to a part of the world i was completely unfamiliar with uncomfortable at times i kept being drawn to the characters and their quest for normalcy during a brutal period of history when humanity slips to an time low","2250":" life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation p 184 i'm overwhelmed this wonderful book is so powerful tragic brutal emotionally draining that i hardly know where to begin reviewing it many have compared it to war and peace but set in modern times and in chechnya and they may be right a volume of wu0026amp p is mentioned as part of the story which makes me think the comparison was intentional albeit apt while the story encompasses the decade of 1994 through 2004 its primary focus is five days in the final year during the second chechan war the unfolding of the stories about the three main characters an inept doctor named akhmed a russian surgeon named sonja and the eight year old orphan havaa who linked them together are what drives the novel forward but flashbacks to the stories of the supporting cast of families friends and enemies are what make the book unforgettable although i previously knew next to nothing about the struggles of that beleaguered country before reading this book my eyes have now been opened it seems incredible that anthony marra was only 28 years old when this book was published as his debut novel it is so beautifully written and deeply felt not to mention well researched and apparently not at all autobiographical that i expected the author to be much older and more seasoned but his gift is evident his style impeccable one device i especially appreciated was the closure given by foreshadowing the futures of both major and minor characters as they faded from focus i tend to forget most of the details of novels soon after finishing them but not this one it is definitely not a frivolous book many characters and scenes will haunt you but i am so glad i read it","2251":"this is a book about all those who have been lost that describes what particular things each person keeps and shows who that person is this is a book about the lost that resurrects everyone it can this is a book that lets us know what we must do to remain human civil what we must do to maintain our dignity when others cannot this is a book that hates and does not hate those who cannot maintain their dignity this is a book that comes from a field that sacrifices young women and centers itself on whether this one and that one and this one will live this is a book that while sometimes jejune i will be happy to teach and make my students buy","2252":"beautifully written with interesting characters in a sad and claustrophobic setting of war torn chechnya hard to read and hard not to read","2253":"i was curious to see how an american writer would deal with the history culture and mentality of the unstable region of chechnya i think marra does a surprisingly good job especially considering it's his debut novel the language is poetic in a very fine delicate way it doesn't give you the impression that the author was trying hard to find his metaphores they sound natural and beautiful and they do not overshadow the content the story is not too complicated in itself but the way it is given to us piece by piece by different characters makes it rather interesting the reader slowly uncovers the characters' past and motivations being able to understand their backgrounds and connect all the elements of the plot a war torn country ruthless soldiers human trafficking hunger lost friendships and in all that an everyday struggle to retain the remains of humanity","2254":"the gripping story sneaks up on you being revealed in bits and pieces as you would gradually get to know a new friend devastating heartbreaking and hopeful all at once","2255":"this book is so beautifully written that you find yourself reading sentences 2 or 3 times there are a limited number of characters but he connects them to each other in the most subtle ways really wonderful","2256":"as disturbing as the topic was i loved this book great read and i would recommend","2257":"i can't wait to see what marra does next this novel is sad and beautiful and wonderful i'm tempted to pick it up and immediately re read it one of my top read of the year most definitely some favorite lines pulling back a stray lock of hair she drew a question mark around her ear she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency how often is immense unhappiness mistaken for courage","2258":"wow what a book a story of love loss and longing a wonderful five day journey that left me in awe","2259":"an amazing read loved this book","2260":"this is a beautiful beautiful heartbreaking book the topic of chechnya's recent wars always breaks my heart but the stories of the lives of these people in this village i don't even know it's understated and full of humanity and perfectly life affirming and devastating all at once with the result that i felt much more earnest sadness than i've felt in quite a long time","2261":"tough but beautiful read it begins as an eight year old girl in war torn chechnya watches as her father is kidnapped and her house is torched her neighbor at great risk to himself steps in to hide and protect her the half dozen main characters are well drawn and complex they live in unimaginable times and have to make even more unimaginable choices and just when you think you know what makes them tick you realize you know nothing","2262":"this book is going to stay with me for awhile","2263":"this book was so beautiful highly recommend reading","2264":"an amazingly well crafted novel about the chechnyan wars as experienced by the residents of a small village akhmed a doctor with the soul of an artist and notably without the soul of doctor arrives at a barely functioning regional hospital seeking sanctuary for haava his disappeared neighbor's daughter and makes a deal with sonja an ethnic russian doctor notably without the soul of an artist for her protection this basic situation plays out over five days in 2004 but through a number of devices flashback the sudden promotion of background characters to central focus the gradual accumulation of significance around objects and gestures historical and moral complexity proliferates reading the story for me was much like watching a camera zoom in on a fractal with surprising connections and harmonies revealed at each order of magnitude it's not an easy read the subject matter is often brutal but there is plenty of wit and ultimately beautiful emotional payoff highly highly recommended","2265":"reading this when the worst migrant crisis since wwii is happening an ocean away made me realize that the reasons for war may be different but the impacts on ordinary people especially children are pretty much the same absolutely devastating i wish this book had moved a little faster through its first 250 pages but the last 150 make up for the first part's sometime slog and the story really came together heart wrenchingly beautifully by the end some of the most thought provoking parts of the book describe how fast a person can go from sitting in their office living their middle class existence to complete and desperate deprivation if this book doesn't make a pacifist out of you nothing will","2266":"given the ratings here i was very disappointed","2267":"it's been over a week since i finished this debut novel by anthony marra and i'm still finding it hard to capture what a marvel this book is and why it blew my mind and broke my heart before i even knew what it was doing as the story opens the second chechen war has already been dragging on for a while without a seeming end in sight as chechen rebels and the russian government continue to clash most folks not only have to struggle to get enough food on the table or avoid getting blown up into pieces from a landmine but they also have to worry about the menacing threat of the russian authorities--the feds--who can show up at their doors and \"disappear\" their loved ones in a heartbeat the stories of the handful of characters we'll spend time with collide with one another when the feds drag away dokka in the middle of the night leaving his daughter to fend for herself before his neighbor helps her run away as this neighbor akhmed tries to ensure that she stays safely away from the feds who are searching for her we eventually come to understand how the war has exacted claims on him and the other characters whom we come to know including the dispassionate no nonsense doctor who agrees to take the girl in her missing sister she's desperately search for the informer who directed the feds' attentions towards that disappeared man in the first place and the informer's father though the current story spans five days we skitter back and forth between the present time of 2004 and 1994 as well as the years in between marked by the first chechen war and the brief lull before the second one started up the novel starts out a bit slowly as puzzle pieces float seemingly isolated in lots of murkiness why did the feds take the man why did akhmed decide to bring the girl to this doctor who's this doctor who seems to be drowning in her own conflicts--what's happened to this sister that she keeps searching for obsessively gradually though these puzzle pieces do converge and interlock to provide us with the whole picture and as they're doing so they stir so many emotions taking you deep into bleakness as you see the unbelievable cruelty that people can commit and taking your breath away when witnessing both the grand sacrifices as well as the simple acts of human decency this is a book about how potent human connection can be in the face of a lot of ugliness in the world it's about imperfect people who make imperfect choices it's about families both the ones you can't choose and the ones you can it's about the good and the bad sides of human nature when we're pushed into a corner it's about life as captured by a definition found in a curious soviet reference book for doctors that the characters stumble upon randomly \"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" 183 some novels that i think highly of lose momentum or deteriorate towards the end but this book just keeps getting better the plot clicks together at a nice pace as characters unknowingly intersect with one another some have said that this seems implausible i say \"wow what a commanding ability to tell a story anthony marra \"really the writing is impressive the story feels grounded in reality can't get 'realer' than torture and war and life and death even as there's also a mystical absurd surreal sense to things as well like when a father takes all of the food his informer son brings home and feeds it to the stray dogs characterization is complex and deep and reflects the flaws and foibles of the innocent and the humanity of the guilty minor characters that show up can break your heart just as much as the ones you spend the entire book with marra does something that i thought was done really well in another favorite book of mine a visit from the goon squad as readers see a character in a scene dealing with whatever it is they're facing marra gives a glimpse of that one character's life in the future and we see what happens to that character so when readers are in a scene with a random soldier whose leg has just been blow off but also get a peek into the future to know that he survives and goes on to live with his mother and take care of cats or whatever other random tidbit he offers it imbues the current scene with a heft when otherwise that minor character would just be story filler it's just little touches like that that help make this novel special every time i encountered a lovely sentence pleasure bubbles would explode in my head here are a few that are beautiful even without any context 63 \"he was losing her incrementally it might be a few stray brown hairs on the pillow or the crescents of bitten fingernails tossed behind the headboard or a dark shape dissolving in soap as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there \" 286 \"for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric the circumference of the world tightened to what their arms encompassed \" 353 \"it was amazing to see her love you before you even met perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed with us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written \" 332 \"she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency \" 316 \"the definitions had the stately reassurance of orthodoxy reminding her of the prewar years when she had relied on the reference book to complete her weekly assignments...when she still believed the meaning of a thing was limited to a few tersely worded clauses but nothing she now knew could be defined in exclusion and every bug pencil and grass blade was a dictionary in itself requiring the definitions of all other things to fulfill its own \"","2268":"awesome book could not put it down a book that gives you goosebumps","2269":" the only reason why i didn't give this book 5 stars was because it got extremely difficult to keep up with not only the character i was reading about but the year in which the synapsis took place in each chapter i normally don't have an issue with books that go back and forth with the past and present i enjoyed the story lines and journeys of all the main characters and have always been intrigued by how everyone is some how connected to the next person possibly without ever knowing it the storyline reminded me of the movie crash for that reason the horror if the wars described in the book didn't upset me the way that other readers had commented but i was extremely touched by the relationships the main characters had with one another and their communities i do feel like i've got to give myself a break from reading anything for the next few days i finished this book in about a week and my head almost hurts as if i've sat through an extremely long and sometimes very difficult history class where i felt i was behind in understanding the lessons but don't let that deter you from reading this if taking frequent breaks is what you would need there's nothing wrong with that","2270":"4 5 good story and well written","2271":"it is january 2 and i just finished the best novel i will probably read all year quite possibly the best novel i will read for a very long time life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation anthony marra's words have power raw emotional and life changing words","2272":"this is the author's first novel he's had plenty of experience writing in other formats but this is a remarkable debut it's an epic story told from the viewpoint of six yes six main characters i don't know how he kept them all straight and made the story come around full circle but he did as soon as i finished i wanted to turn around and read it again but it was a library book and i needed to return it i will read it again but only after i've learned more about the history of chechnya and the chechen wars although you can understand the story without knowing the history you would get more out of the book with that information the author even suggests several books to read what is more vital though is reading this book carefully and for me slowly the story spans a decade in chechnya and not in chronological order every character and event will show up again in later chapters so keep that in mind as you're reading it there is no fluff in this book every character and event counts you also need to read carefully because the author doesn't come right out and simply state something he works around it and you have to do a little work to get what he's saying an example we don't learn a certain character is a prostitute by the author announcing that fact here is what he writes instead \"...there was this man and when he was dressing his wallet fell out of his trousers and he had a picture of his children in one of those plastic credit card flaps that was the day when i gave up \" i don't believe marra ever even writes the word \"prostitute \" a constellation of vital phenomena is a bleak and intense story much of the country has been destroyed particularly memorable was a description of the hospital where one of the characters sonja worked when she opened the door into one of the rooms there was open air and a view of the devastated city in front of her and rubble below the author couldn't have chosen a better scene to portray that desolation there are very disturbing scenes of torture and while i wish i didn't have to read them they are vital to the story except for one involving an aquarium--i won't go any further--which seemed to be there mainly for shock value although i may have misinterpreted its meaning it's amazing what human beings can endure and how they can adapt to that violence a character is glad he experienced this particular torture instead of that particular torture but even in the midst of that devastation and violence there is humor some of it reminded me of catch 22 and its message of the absurdity of war when sonja's sister natasha is cutting off the trousers of an injured rebel at the hospital he says \"what are you doing \" natasha replies \"giving you shorts you have lovely legs \" which brings me to the unforgettable characters each of them is good and bad tough and weak self sacrificing and selfish you might hate the informant at the beginning of the novel but by the end you will understand why he has done what he has done and even feel empathy for him nothing is clear cut and you will probably end up feeling empathy for all the main characters main characters--certainly not the torturers the author leaves no loose ends but they may not be the ends you'd hoped the characters would have i kept thinking \"well maybe...\" or \"what if...\" it's been a week since i've finished reading it and i'm still thinking about it while my review focuses more on the bleakness of the story there is a surprising amount of hope in it too it reinforced my belief that hope will always rise above the bleakness in life there is a large amount of positive hype about this book believe it and read it","2273":" this was a selection by my book group which i may not have otherwise read i found it a very compelling read in fact i'm glad marra included a list of influential source books at the end because i'm very interested in pursuing this area further chechnya has always been a gray area for me because coverage of it has been so sporadic and incomplete everything i'd suspected was borne out in this in brutal fashion and then some but it added an essential human element which had previously been lacking almost by necessity every character in here no matter how meek or nondescript was vividly drawn and ultimately stands out in the reader's mind and that's the big accomplishment putting a face on an obscure tragedy maybe there's more to the story to tell that this gives an incomplete or one sided view of the big picture if it does it tells it very well and i look forward to finding out more","2274":"i feel odd saying i loved this book because of the difficult at times brutal subject matter chechnya during the wars of the 1990s but it is the best book i have read this year the characters and their motivations their moral wrestlings their indifferences felt authentic the writing is compelling and each voice is distinct the plot resolves neatly in terms of events but left me with deeper questions that i am still thinking about somewhat unusual for a work of fiction marra includes a bibliography of titles he used for research in writing the book this is marra's first novel and i'm looking forward to reading more from him","2275":" a constellation of vital phenomena i admired this book more than i loved it anthony marra writes beautifully although some passages seem a shade overdone and many sections are very moving marra is also a great observer of details in particular i liked these moments from early in the book and now in the morning as he tightened the orange scarf around her neck he found a fingerprint on the girl's cheek and because it could have been dokka's he left it after crossing herself she lay back on the divan and squirted a cool puddle of hand lotion from the bottle she'd brought from london invariably she would apply too much and her hands would be slick and shiny in the candlelight as she asked for another pair with which to share the excess on the other hand though the plot mechanics were a bit too neat and relied too heavily on coincidence the characters' lives all fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle several revelations in the book fell flat for me because i was shaking my head at their implausibility a bigger problem is that none of the characters ever really feel like real people in particular havaa does not sound remotely like any eight year old girl i've ever known but really none of the characters seems to have much personality given the epic sweep of the story this isn't the fatal flaw it might be in another book marra isn't trying to write an intricate character study but it made it hard for me to connect with the book the way i might have still there's a lot to like here and i'm certainly glad i read it","2276":"this is one of the finest fictional books about the chechnya experience in their battle for independence it is heart breaking in ways that i have only experienced in godd fiction the characters matter the setting is stark and the value of a life is marginal i had a deep interest in how each person lived reasons for decisionss they made and what brought them to the final actions it is not a happy book but it is a true book in that all humans maake decisions based on their own past history present needs and future hopes","2277":"five stars plus a thousand more there aren't enough superlatives for this astonishingly remarkable novel go read this book about the 1st and 2nd chechen wars marvel at how each sentence is like a jewel encrusted noose around your unsuspecting neck become well versed in the topography history culture and weather of a country you've probably spent no more than five minutes thinking about admire the craft the structure the artistry of the plot the way time flows and the way the characters lives touch just barely but so intimately fall in love with each and every character from the most innocent child to the most evil russian federal commander and everyone in between and then take a moment to remember that anthony marra was just 28 when he wrote it anthony marra of chevy chase md who had never set foot in chechnya until long after both of the wars he writes about so gut wrenchingly were over i hope mr marra is busy working on his next book because he just may have ruined me for anyone else","2278":"not really a book i feel competent enough to review it's fiction but in reality very very real and i am in awe of how the author put these people's stories and environment together as spectacularly as he did there is so much in this book and it's one i would love to take the time to read a second time now that i know who's who and how all the characters are intertwined the irony of this story is so completely deep for lack of a better word that you could discuss it endlessly it's funny sad beautiful frightening and will affect you it's not a quick or light read and shouldn't be bottom line is that it takes place in chechnya which if you don't know is a country that has been relentlessly at the center of ethnic wars for a very long time specifically with russia this was a book that a few chapters in i put it down and spent an hour on line learning the recent history of this country which by the way led me to spending 2 hours studying everything currently happening in ukraine and as a result i really felt better off as a person for understanding a little bit more about what goes on in this world i think it was so timely that i chose this particular book at this point in time oh and my favorite part by far was the funny confusion over george bush","2279":"this is a beautifully written book about the chechen wars seen from a small village with no political stake but overcome nun the less by the horrors and tragedy of war alternately funny and tragic very relevant to current events regarding russia's dealings with satellite states","2280":" received this as an arc via my employer barnes u0026amp noble started on 2 13 14 finished on 2 21 14 the words war love hate and hope came to mind as i read this wonderful book it takes place in chechnya over a period of just a few days quirky characters and flashbacks explain why these people are the way they are in spite of several wars in the area there's plenty of humor as well as pathos to keep a reader involved parts of it read like poetry others like a crime novel the title comes from a definition of life according to an old russian medical book cover is pretty boring the book is not","2281":"wow what a beautiful read this book is just diamond sharp and deeply profound and revealing it's painfully brutal and stunningly poignant i know this is all vague but i hate reviews that leave synopsis because that's what the original synopsis is for instead i prefer leaving impressions i felt this book was just rough but worth it the author is a master of prose and has a keen eye for what it is about us that makes us human or alike or together in the blind stumble through it all it was eye opening in regards to a place and time i know little about and the unspeakable atrocities of war that happened there punctuated with these people who are the points of light in the title's constellation brutal but i'm glad i read it","2282":"beautiful not a history lesson instead as is the point with all fiction in my opinion a wonderful look into the human condition just happens to have post war chechnya as backdrop","2283":" chechnya this book made me cry clench my teeth reel cheer when khassan's dogs ran to jump into the back of his truck and gave me goosebumps it was a read that demanded a lot the prose so rich with beauty pain and information there were times i wondered what the author was going on about only to gasp when the pieces fell together a story very tightly woven phrase after phrase gave me pause he pressed his lips to his wife's forehead and let them linger until the kiss became a conversation between their shared skin truth was only one among many hallucinations rather than limbs she had somehow amputated expectations if the world was determined to drown her she'd stop swimming he spent his days caught like a coin between the divan cushions it was night it was cold her bones hated her this story though fiction was no doubt the reality for many--not during the cold war of the 50's and 60's but between 1994 and 2004 disappearances informants torture...","2284":"a beautifully written book disturbing heartbreaking and hopeful took awhile to get into it glad i stuck with it one of my favorite reads this year this story will stay with me for a long time","2285":"with russian tanks rolling toward ukraine this novel spanning the 1st and 2nd chechen wars is a reminder of the brutality of the russian state from the soviet union to putin's reign but despite the grim backdrop of the novel where betrayed neighbors are 'disappeared' in the night marra's characters persevere crafting family from those left behind","2286":"set in war torn chechnya this story of life and death and suffering and humanity and love and family and friends is so well written the characters and their lives become so vital to each other you want to keep reading one of my favorite books","2287":"i need more stars to rate this book i haven't read anything like this in a long time one of my favor books for sure","2288":"excellent book it awakens interest in chechnya that i never had before i thought it would be more about the little girl havaa but it centers more on the adults around her beautifully written and plotted memorable characters highly recommended","2289":" i don't know what catapults a novel from great to extraordinary but what ever magic that is this book has it in spades without going into what the novel is about what i want most to say is go find a copy right now and read it and then recommend it to anyone you like what you can get from the inside flap the novel is about life during and after the collapse of communism in a smaller former satellite country it follows the intertwined stories of at least a half dozen characters seamlessly glides around a fifteen year period and in doing so manages to tell one powerful story that of the hardship of keeping a life together when the world seems intent on pulling it apart i consider this novel a contemporary classic","2290":" \"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaption \"the fact that this definition is found between the flippantly perused pages of an old medical text by a character late into anthony marra's brilliant stirring constellation perfectly captures the spirit of the novel in a nutshell raw unalloyed humanity observed in the most clinical of places--a hospital in post soviet chechnya a refugee home run by a man with fewer fingers than beds the space between epitaphs in the clay of a pit laden with prisoners joy amidst desolation in a name a single name it's startling just how poetic this novel can be given how uncontrived and unpretentious it is the beauty in this novel is as natural as language--\"for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric\" or else \"he was losing her incrementally... as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there \" but marra isn't gratuitous in his poetry the moments for the deepest introspection are far and few between in what is essentially a chronicle of life in a small rural village in chechnya coping with the fall of the soviet union and attempting to achieve autonomy the soviet union is compared to a boulder from which autonomous republics \"fell like pebbles \" deceptively light at around 400 pages the novel is dense with reasonably obscure post soviet history offering neither the excuses nor apologies of mainstream historical fiction it's all the life and humanity of a khaled hosseini read without any of the factual patronizing or blatant emotional manipulation the separation of eight year old havaa from her father abducted by russian soldiers sets off a chain of events that involve the attempts of their neighbor akhmed to hide her before the soldiers notice her absence attempts that usher in the involvement of sonja the brilliant head surgeon at an abandoned hospital connected to these individuals are a web of others dealing with their own battles khassan who has become a pariah after his son becomes an informant for the russians natasha sonja's sister who disappears without a trace dokka from whom his friends hide duplicity and even havaa herself clinging to her father's last memories as tightly as her mysteriously guarded suitcase the density and slow pacing of the novel are hard to surmount especially given how spoiled contemporary fiction has made us but it's worth overcoming as there's a breathtaking organic beauty to this book the nature of the adaptability of life resonates between the pages pages that cleverly weave between separate years and decades and marra's brilliant at subtly making his points clear even more fascinating is how he uses the stage of post soviet chechnya to demonstrate terribly complex ideas such as the nature of morality to be twisted and shaped by the political climate towards the close of the novel we're treated to what is one of the most authentic depictions of the constitution of hope amongst devastation that i've ever read the last few pages are viscerally captivating propelled by quiet narrative power and sophistication anthony's marra's constellation elevates itself a tier above most other historical fiction with uncommon resonance and complexity disclaimer i received this book from blogging for books for this review","2291":"3 75 maybe 4 0 snoozed a bit through the russian history was a little confused through the first half and in general it required some effort but it ended strong and was worth the effort","2292":"absolutely heartbreaking","2293":"one of the best books i have read in recent years","2294":"this was a very difficult read set during two wars in chechnya there's brutality and torture a lot of language and it took me a while to get through it but it was worth it i learned a lot about a region and a conflict i knew little about and it's a repeated reminder about how good we have it here in america marra is a very talented writer weaving the stories of several characters together showing their motives behind their actions and responses to unthinkable struggles","2295":"this is a haunting often heart breaking story about love and family and survival set amidst the backdrop of the two wars in chechnya and the deprivation that follows it's beautifully written and the lives of the major characters are interwoven in complex and surprising ways","2296":" this book is why we read fiction it is a gift unexpected and wonderful a selection of my book club it's not something i'd likely have picked up on my own but then that's why one belongs to a book club to expand one's horizons in reading i find reviews tedious which rehash the plots so i'm not going to do that i will only say i never knew so much about the fall of the ussr the wars in chechnya or the people there nor would i have expected to be so moved and so entertained in reading about same marra is a deeply thoughtful highly skilled writer who finds the humanity in even the worst of people and the deficits in even the best all the characters here are fully dimensional and human and it is through their eyes and experiences that we can follow the horrors and the hopes of a newborn nation another aspect that normally would have turned me off is his use of a non linear chronology but the timelines is so seamlessly transparent and the reasons for the skips back and forth in time all make the central story and each character more clearly understood by the reader i love this book and cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who cares about good literature or the human race","2297":"subtle and beautifulvery meticulously crafted it was sometimes dense but always worth it satisfying conclusion to each story line included in the novel","2298":"well written and i learned about chechnya but i found the tone overbearing","2299":"in on the string of book of the season books that have actually delivered should probably be called natasha and other stories but that title's taken","2300":"worth a read for the scene setting alone descriptive language that never pushes to the point of an eye roll he shapes the mood by injecting minute details that carry serious emotional weight i liked the omniscient narrator and how it allowed him to write the epilogue as he went","2301":"i am ashamed to admit that i was totally ignorant of the geographic and political backdrop of this text set in chechnya between the mid 90s and the mid 2000's it is a deeply moving and beautifully written account of depravation horror personal experience and psychological torture the human cost of war it is also an amazing tribute to the human ability to find meaning in the worst of times not an easy read but well worth the effort","2302":" the genius of marra's narrative is that he moves beyond the political machinations and specifics plaguing chechnya he transcends the abstract and lands his readers in the midst of the realities of war his characters victims of circumstance exemplify the gradations of human casualty that accompany a conflict ridden landscape be it death torture or the hollowing of one's heart one does not need to be familiar with the chechen conflict to find this novel engaging informative and heartwrenching each of marra's characters bring a specific perspective to the situation at hand and through these tableaus the pain of an entire society is felt a wonderful debut novel and a must read for all","2303":"well written but oh so grim","2304":"4 5 stars slow start but totally worth it in the end although the story has three main characters their stories are woven between several others and their connections slowly reveal themselves throughout the novel it is a very heavy story terribly sad but with glimmers of hope that make it a terrific read","2305":"very overwhelming to read wow","2306":" a tremendous novel about the ways people adapt in the shadow of geopolitical strife and the lengths they go to in order to survive and ensure the survival of others marra opens the book in a lawless war torn chechnya with the immediate business of how to keep his youngest character alive he then spends the remainder of the book carefully peeling back the layers of the adults around her in a way that allows sympathy and understanding for each of them regardless of their actions some of the revelations and intersections in the back story and may be a little indulgent but when faced with such hopelessness those moments became rewarding pillars to hold on to rather than cliche and implausible great book set in a part of the world many of us know little about","2307":"beautifully written book about the brutality and horror of war during the two invasions of chechnya in the 1990's and early 2000's the atrocities of war and the amazing will of the people to survive and protect their families is heartbreaking this is a must read book","2308":" where to start i'll start with sonja she and i read books the same way for the same reason we read the end to decide if we want to go there i read the end i knew what would happen i knew i owed the characters my full attention right to the last word even though my heart was broken and i was sobbing out loud set in a tiny village that doesn't even have a proper name we see the interrelated lives of three families khassan and his son ramzan dokka and his daughter havaa and akmed as the book progresses we discover things are much more complicated than that much ramzan and dokka have been 'disappeared' previously each suffering hideous tortures and great losses they respond differently as ramzan has turned informer he has tried to save his ungrateful father an amazing war hero and author by ratting out his neighbors the structure of the story takes us through five days in 2004 but to understand those days marra takes us back to each character's earlier years to help us understand the man or the woman or the child in 2004 i began to perseverate on the word 'disappear' it's an intrasitive verb can't have a direct object but we have begun to change that turning it into a transitive verb the government disappeared dokka then we turned it into passive voice taking our humanity with it dokka was disappeared then we 'nouned' the word to talk about the disappeared each step of the way we lose who we are the complicated relationships spur discoveries or hide discoveries sonja is looking for her sister natasha dokka is trying to keep his daughter havaa safe akmed is trying to be of service and their stories are woven together like a tapestry they are related by love and by marriage not always the same thing by place the landfill the hospital the village by objects a nutcracker and a gun chechnya and its wars is the setting the reason these people live in extreme circumstances but unfortunately a story like this could be told with many different settings simple good people are victimized by the political lies of others marra breathes life into all his characters akmed a lousy doctor who really should have been an artist sonja an ethnic russian who returns home to chechnya when she could have stayed safe in london natasha her sister who suffers unspeakably at the hands of human traffickers only to rise dokka a good man whose daughter's safety is worth everything to him and havaa an irrepressible little girl who understands only too well the costs of war she and her blue suitcase full of other's keepsafes reminds us of why we must keep finding the good in the horrors the metaphor of the title keeps poking at me this village is a constellation the hospital is a constellation the landfill is one as well so sonja and i both read books with endings that break our hearts","2309":"one of the best books i've read in years highly recommend it","2310":" recovery rather than destruction the title of this novel a constellation of vital phenomena was borrowed from a russian medical dictionary it was the definition listed under the entry for the word life the definition strikes me as inexplicably lyrical and poetic making it a fitting title to this impressive work marra's book is all about life not just the lives of the main characters we follow throughout the book but also of a full constellation of lives that orbit them the lives of an embittered nurse once jilted by an oncologist a six year old in manchester england who desperately wanted to avoid another hand me down a neighbor an elderly woman who believes she gets daily visitations from ghosts angels prophets and monsters a swarthy opportunist smuggler who does good deeds for the doctor who saved her brother's life explaining that even though the brother in question was most definitely his least favorite of six brothers had remembered to feed his pet turtle once as a child so a favor was still owed for his life from these characters and countless more the constellation is formed the last word of the title phenomena is defined as a fact or situation that is observed to exist or happen and with that the story takes form as we learn how the full constellation of characters came to either be where they are or end up where they will based on the vital facts and situations of their lives other reviewers have discussed that the story was depressing the torture brutal the characters sad they definitely have very valid points but i somehow didn't find the book too depressing i was struck by the flashes of normalcy despite the terrible circumstances the unexpected humor and the strong underlying current of innate goodness and dignity that ran through the main characters we followed in an interview the author anthony marra shared i knew early on that though the novel was set against a backdrop of war it would be a book about recovery rather than destruction about surgeons rather than soldiers that is the feeling the story left me with","2311":"beautifully written particularly the tiny vignettes telling of the future of various characters as something quite incidental a sad story but one well worth telling","2312":"one of the finest books i've read all year","2313":"a book so beautifully written you grieve when you get to the end and search for more","2314":"i think was one of the most beautifully written books with the most heartbreaking realities","2315":"this novel rings all my bells it's fiction but also instructive hello troubled history of chechnya my copy is garlanded with a multitude of sticky notes tagging gorgeous passages that stopped me in my tracks and demanded another reading it's uncommon to find savagery and desperation relayed in such beautiful prose lovely complex characters traverse love and sorrow across a web of interconnectedness","2316":"this is a fabulous book about a little known country and conflict chechnya the story is so well done but in no way heavy handed or manipulative just very matter of fact but lyrical all the same highly recommend","2317":"wow this book was amazing great story great characters great climax great twists great everything this is one of those books that will make you speechless once you read the last sentence and close the book totally recommend it to anybody warning though it is very sad","2318":"chechnya civil war family stories multiple narrators changing time frames everyone dies beautiful tragic prose","2319":"hauntingly beautiful an incredible tour de force for a debut novel","2320":"full review and pairing at paper plates i found myself engulfed by a constellation of vital phenomena it opens on a disaster a house up in flame a father kidnapped a young girl hiding in the woods with a suitcase full of souvenirs a loving neighbor the father's friend squirrels her away to a nearby hospital where he intends to convince a legendary doctor to take her in it is 2004 and chechnya is again gripped by war every night countless chechens are disappeared no one is safe not even the girl the novel covers five days in the present through the perspectives of a connected yet diverse set of characters in backward war torn chechnya their pained histories collide and intertwine some in ways so unlikely it seems fate must be at play in those flashbacks author anthony marra develops the characters so skillfully it's hard to believe this is a debut work one of my favorite things about marra's storytelling is the way he extends even minor characters while much of the novel spans past and present some instances involve a small leap forward a peek at how the life of a cameo turns out it gives the reader a peek at the hope some individuals represent even if the characters are oblivious another beautiful detail is the minimal graphic timeline that leads into each chapter its inclusion provides an elegant guide to time that frees marra to focus on plot not setting plus it's easy on the eyes a constellation of vital phenomena was without a doubt the best book i read this year it may even be one of the best books i've read period please give it a try","2321":"hauntingly beautiful","2322":"i loved loved this book so well written with a heartbreaking story that also gives a message of hope read this book","2323":"i enjoyed the dry humour of some of these characters however i just found that something special to be lacking perhaps i am apathetic to russia perhaps there wasn't enough action in the story the book is well written and i am sure that some audiences would enjoy it in general i found it to be a little esoteric","2324":"just so sad i'm happy to know more about chechnya but honestly how much tragedy can a reader bear","2325":"i remember that i passed over this novel at first sight because of its title why the choice of those words for a title i thought couldn't its meaning be said more simply i was lured into reading it by rave reviews from so many others and by the author's note in the end pages of the book - once i'd cracked it open in which he laid out his impressive research for background i appreciate the book a lot for its incorporated reporting of history but i have a lot of trouble with it for two other reasons the female characters are flat to my ear i think the writing is sometimes over done too like a zealous reporter who's charmed by his own cleverness maybe i'm reading too fast and should slow down as others have suggested because i've stopped reading at page 153 there's a sentence there in which a character's pallor is described as being like frozen deer urine never before seen on a human face i need a break as a western reader to step back and remember the bigger picture of this ambitious and well conceived first novel read to the end well worth doing","2326":"i've been about 50 pages from finishing this for months now but the idea of re entering this world of contrivances fills me with immediate malaise i really need to man up and stop stringing this book along so i guess this goodbye phenomena you have some lovely qualities your readers are out there don't give up and please don't call me","2327":"while i was reading it i thought about giving it four stars just because it has some themes that i've seen before in books and i found the beginning to be a bit wordy but it's so brilliantly written with just the perfect balance between tragedy and comedy broken hearts and bad timings and the perfect bittersweet ending that i'm giving it five stars with all my heart an instant favorite","2328":" the dense prose and swirling narrative slowed me down pleasantly mostly and i would find myself surprised that the story was somehow light though never cute or easy the brutality comes in waves and is tempered with the disbelief an optimist carries i do not know how this place let in and held on to such misery how people learned to be so bad if i knew chekhov better i might say it had the dark humor and matter of fact brilliant absurdity of his work but i might also say it feels like a symphony or a beautiful and hard piano piece by kabelevsky recommended by klaus","2329":" rarely do i give a book a perfect rating this one goes on my have to read again shelf i picked this up as part of my effort to expand my reading horizons which normally don't go too far beyond mysteries historical novels and classics someone in the book universe wanted me to have this one as i kept seeing it whenever i went into the bookstore and finally gave it and just bought it raw powerful uplifting teaching gut wretching sad and totally absorbing this this is what a good book should be","2330":" at times i felt a bit confused keeping tabs on the characters which annoyed me until about midway through the novel once i reached that halfway point however i found myself enjoying the book immensely i was enthralled by the connections between the characters and their complex relationships as i neared the end of the book i couldn't put it down i needed to know right away what was going to happen next even if it was obvious to the reader a moving yet harrowing fictional novel that takes place during the first and second chechan wars with russia mostly second about the suffering and sacrifice people endured during those times anthony marra's first novel is beautifully written he explores its dark subject matter with delicate prose but never hides its harsh reality the characters are so well developed their lives so beautifully intertwined at the end i cried with them and i cried for them","2331":"i didn't mean to order this book on my kindle i was so happy to have made a mistake i very seldom choose to read about a war ravaged anything especially with an eight year old girl alone in the woods i would have missed this fascinating tale of inter connectedness against all odds i don't have a big enough store of descriptors a great enough range of adjectives friendship devotion family desperation deception torture great love and in any novel that haunts me like this of course hope","2332":"this was one of the saddest books i have read the portrayal of the agony of the human condition the use of strange coincidences that bond complete strangers and strains of hope were reminded me of the kite runner however the writing was much more subtle simple and beautiful i have a hard time saying i liked it since it was so so sad","2333":"it was essentially a good book well written interesting subject matter etc but i found it too depressing to finish it is so unlike me not to finish a book even a bad one this was just too bleak","2334":"amazing book i loved how the story lines for each character were gradually revealed and connected to the other characters","2335":"a gifted writer who told a sad story with his whole heart books about war are plentiful and its tough to love them as they never have happy endings i loved the way the author conveyed hope by letting the reader know that the country and its people would rise again havaa and sonja will stay with me for a while and dokka and akhmet too","2336":"http fitzwater stevens com bookgrrl","2337":"i've always been a fan of such mesmerizing prose like the one in this book where anthony marra so beautifully carves the tales of happiness sorry pain and suffering the tales of victory and defeat endurance and surrender and much more added to my list of best reads for this year and all time","2338":"this author is amazing love how he sees u0026amp what he sees and how he paints it with words love how he picks up on subtle nuances of a particular scenelove his ingenious u0026amp sometimes unexpected humor within an otherwise serious scene often find myself chuckling at a serious moment and i love it love the interaction between akmed and sonja kind of like an improv act they play off of each other again with appreciated humor i'm dragging this out because i don't want it to end","2339":"every now and then you read a book that just floors you with how well a person can write this is one of those books","2340":"an affirmation of life amidst the chaos of war torn chechnyafor a complete list of winners please visit www ala org rusa awards","2341":"beautiful beautiful writing i keep looking up from my book to see if there is anyone around with whom i can share this fantastic sentences and paragraphs here is one only when comparing herself to her classmates many of whom were subject to arranged marriages did she come to understand that in chechnya gravity pressed upon women with heavier hands her russianness exempted her from its grip and so yes she often floated","2342":"this book was written in such a way that if you didn't already understand the historical context you'd be left confused at times and stuck searching the internet to discover what exactly was going on in the character's place and time i felt slightly ashamed of myself for not knowing more about this history as i was alive for it but nevertheless i wanted the author to tell me more the story itself was quite interesting and i would say the last 50 pages or so redeemed what was at first a fairly slow moving novel well written though and i'd love to see what marra does next","2343":"this book is haunting and beautiful while it was confusing at times the characters weave in out of each others lives to tell a harrowing story the book really comes to life and is worth the read","2344":"at first i thought the book had been translated into english because the author uses the language in a way that is so fresh and poetic it seems other worldly the character's lives are magically intertwined with what at first seems to be the story but in the end is clearly just the backdrop i generally avoid war stories because they are so painful there were parts in this book where i felt trapped in the war story but i wasn't willing to leave the characters i highly recommend this book","2345":"4 5 stars beautifully written heart breaking and often difficult to read the ending made me think of the roundness of things the circle of life but not in a corny way very worthy read","2346":"so many people whose taste i respect recommended this i hate to give it up i'm 233 pages into this 379 page book doesn't seem like a good place to give up but i keep driving myself to pick up the book only to find a few minutes later that i put it down again i'm off to other fields","2347":"beautifully written and i imagine impeccably researched kudos for the annotated bibliography at the end it's not an easy book to read i got the vapors early on from a rather visceral description and it doesn't let up from there except for some really amazing grace notes and moments of connectivity between the characters who are all compelling in their own ways sidenote i am finding myself reading quite a few women in times of war novels this year","2348":"an absolutely incredible book i can't wait to read more by anthony marra","2349":"although this book was difficult to read at times i learned so much about an area of the world of which i had little knowledge details of the arduous lives of the people living in a part of the world that is largely unknown are presented in great clarity the reader can picture the desolation of this war torn community the reader longs for a happy ending knowing it will take overcoming impossible odds to make it happen","2350":"this is a very intense read it's a little slow at first but once it gets going you sort of can't stop worth the read though sad still there are uplifting moments","2351":"i almost gave this a 5 my favorite of the week at the lake","2352":"i really struggled through most of this book it was definitely not one i couldn't put down the time line and characters were confusing even with the year shown at the beginning of each chapter it wasn't until perhaps the last 100 pages that everything seemed to come together and the book somewhat redeemed itself however i'm puzzled by so many good reviews","2353":"this one was a random pick up from the library shelf and i spent much of the first third wondering if i should continue on with it seeing as i had amassed quite a stack of books i couldn't wait to get to reading but the pull of a world i had never read about chechnya between 1994 2004 kept me going i'm glad that i did it's not a novel that i will ever return to but the characters and life experiences that we so different from mine at the time i was a college student and then beginning teacher and just prior to becoming a mom that i had to continuously remind myself that this was not ancient history the simple fact that people lived these types of lives while i was in blissful oblivion was reason enough to educate myself interesting characters and a beautifully interweaving storyline were just a bonus","2354":"he dates which author anthony marra has chosen for his novel include the first chechen war from 1994 to 1996 and the second war from 1999 to 2009 as russian forces again attempted to regain control over chechneya when russian soldiers abduct the father of an e tthis novel is set in chechnya around 2004 but often switches back and forth in time to 1994 and various years within this decade in case your geography is rusty chechneya is north of georgia and azerbaijan and west of the caspian sea tthe dates which author anthony marra has chosen for his novel include the first chechen war from 1994 to 1996 and the second war from 1999 to 2009 as russian forces again attempted to regain control over chechneya twhen russian soldiers abduct the father of an eight year old girl named havaa their neighbor akhmed seeks refuge for himself and havaa in the village's sole hospital akhmed a doctor of limited skills forms an uneasy relationship with the hospital's chief surgeon sonja rabina sonja has a sister named natasha who helps out in the hospital at times but she and sonja have a love hate relationship that causes both women pain and anguish over the years treading this book is not easy primarily because the time setting shifts back and forth to different years more than once i was tempted to give up but i soldiered on and was ultimately glad that i finished it as you make your way through it you might feel like you're navigating a carnival funhouse of mirrors seeing images from different angles as you make the journey for example early in the book one of the characters remarks that he once heard of a wounded soldier being stitched up with dental floss later in the book you read about the commanding officer of a forty soldier troop being seriously wounded and taken to the hospital where dr sonja operates on him and sows up his chest wound with dental floss and still later near the end of the book there is mention by another character about this same incident tthe book is also depressing on many levels because of the many ugly things that can happen during a war starvation and lack of decent medical care interrogations accompanied by torture capturing innocent civilians and having them thrown into a pit and unwarranted cruelty for sport are some examples there is some black humor to relieve the ugliness villagers would rip ceramic toilet bowls out of deserted houses and place them over unexploded shells eventually the shells would explode but the bowls would not be damaged because they were well built russian products tthe writing in the book is extraordinary there is a single sentence which occupies an entire page one that tells a tragic story about parents whose son is missing and hoping that their other son will find his brother one day when i reached the end of it and the terrible facts became known i realized that i'd not taken a breath while reading the entire tale later in the book natasha is trying to escape chechneya and imagines herself in another country such as china or hawaii where no one could speak chechen or russian marra writes she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency tultimately this book is about the power of the human spirit to endure find love and treat others with compassion i was close to tears at the end of it","2355":"this is definitely one of those books you will need to read more than once this story covers a sad time in russia's history forced prostitution war and corrupt leaders are just a small portion of what these poor people had to endure back from 1994 2004 anthony marra ties the characters together in what can only be described as a constellation of vital phenomena beautifully written and one that makes you rethink what you read in previous chapters","2356":"some nice turns of phrase fully realized characters unusual and interesting setting pretty amazing for a first novel it was just a bit too atmospheric for my taste i would have liked a bit more plot but that's just my taste it definitely achieves what it's trying to achieve","2357":"oh my i tried i really did but this book is very depressing i finally had to give up and did not finish it sorry~","2358":"an enthralling journey through horrific brutality to incomprehensible love and compassion i felt embedded in the story i could not stop reading because i had to know what was happening to havaa ackmed dokka sonja and natasha amazing everyone should read this novel","2359":"this book is something else beautifully written fascinating window into chechen life over the last three decades powerful unique characters exposure to the full misery that occurred but i found it oddly hopeful and warm thank you to author for creating this story","2360":" beautiful probably the best work of fiction i'll read in 2013 it's smart philosophical tragic and hopeful for a debut novel it's incredibly powerful and poignant focusing on the intertwined lives of a group of people in war torn chechnya who find a special connection with an eight year old girl named havaa their collective wish for her is that she is able to grow old enough to die of natural causes which would be a gift in a village like theirs marra draws much of his factual information from politkovskaya's journalism and his own personal research so the background is as strong as the storytelling and narration also incredible is his ability with words he knows how to manipulate the language in a way that makes readers feel things with each of the five senses one of my favorites comes when he describes a character living abroad she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency i haven't read anything this good in a long long time and held off on finishing it for a couple of weeks because i never wanted it to end astounding work and one closest writers we have to a modern day dostoevsky","2361":"it's hard to express my experience with this book an unsparingly terrible and yet entirely realistic picture of ceaseless war and human savagery and yet exquisite lyrical cryptic intimate brave magical comical poetic and ingenious marra constructs a golden spiral of life and death i am awed","2362":"i thought this book was heartbreaking unforgettable and remarkable i will never forget the characters their lives and some of the phrases in the book i laughed and cried and couldn't put it down","2363":" i know of no other word to describe this book than masterpiece certainly the best book i've read in a very long time it's the only one i feel compelled to re read again to relive all the intricacies of what is going on though the setting is chechnya during the brutal warfare that has torn that country apart the book is rather dickensian in nature with a varied cast of fully fleshed characters who as is gradually revealed have unexpected connections with each other what more can i say about this book while there is a whole genre of post apocalyptic fiction this book is about a real apocalypse which few in the world are paying any attention to and the book portrays what under a reign of terror and violence a soul crushing experience it can be to all those involved heroism under such circumstances isn't revealed in acts of celebrated triumphalism but merely in acts of sacrifice done out of love through such does the soul survive i came to the end of the book feeling like i been emotionally punched in the gut the last few chapters was almost unbearably sad but what made this book different from one written by say cormac mccarthy is that there were also parts that were quite funny the soul is certainly dead if one can no longer laugh even in the midst of apocalypse this book will stay with me for a long time to all i can only say read it","2364":"people often ask me why i read so much it is a hard question to answer then i pick up something like mr marra's freshman novel and i remember why reading is so important to me i prefer character driven novels over plot driven ones and this novels have so many rich well fleshed characters it is difficult to pick just one point of view shifts from one to another from sonja the heart breaking but brilliant surgeon who with the help of and elderly nurse and a one armed security guard runs an entire hospital to havaa the young girl who has lost everything but teaches them all to be brave there's akhmed and khassan a bad doctor and a failed historian who both must learn to love again and natasha who's sister's love is both her undoing and her savior all of these characters are dropped into the horrible backdrop of war weary chechnya mostly around 2003 2004 but time shifts to earlier periods to fill in background bit by bit this is one of those novels that is difficult to read but also difficult to put down because the characters and the words keep drawing you back in as an example of mr marra's beautiful use of the english language for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric","2365":"ok first of all that title it is the definition of life in a medical book isnt it the best and this book about war death life friendship family is a constellation of all the the things that make life life set in the checheyan wars it is a beautifully written book so many great quotes i will tell you it is a slow burn but in the end it will consume you","2366":"best of the year","2367":"amazing book with great insights on the impacts of war on the ties that bind families lovers and neighbors very haunting and hard to read at times but skillfully written and totally worth it","2368":"this book was dense winding and sometimes confusing as it slipped in and out of time i expected to like it much more than i did especially since it had such glowing reviews it was because of those reviews that i forced myself through the first half of the book despite having little connection or interest in any of the characters i read it on my kindle on loan from the library and when i got the your loan is nearly expired email and i wasn't even halfway finished i thought maybe i'd just let it go but instead i kept reading the second half was better for me but still not the wonderful thing i was expecting it had its moments of beauty and well crafted thought but it also had pages of bloated prose that neither moved the story nor advanced the characters nearly everyone we met was then given an epilogue something like in three and two quarter years he would meet the woman he was to marry two years after that she would die in a train wreck no spoilers i just made that up as an example at first i thought it was interesting and maybe a commentary on how even in war time when committing atrocities everyone is still a person and no one can ever know what someone else has or will experience but for me it got old fast i didn't really need to know what this character who was tangential to the story was going to do in sixty years i would probably have given this 3 5 stars if possible just because i did find myself interested in many of the characters in the last half of the book it took a long time getting there though","2369":"amazing book beautiful writing sad story one of my favorites i listened to this one on audio it was definitely an easy book to listen to the reader did a great job","2370":" beautifully written the story takes the reader gently by the hand and leads them down a path that is sometimes dark and other times incredibly wry mara has found a gentle way to show the horrors of war through the lives of simple people who's journeys are surprisingly intertwined i agree with one reviewer's description of the writing style as astral calm long sentences built upon a dozen poignant phrases made me feel i was traveling down a long curving road leading to an destination obscured by the uncertainties of war a constellation of vital phenomena is well worth the effort of reading","2371":"easily the best book i will read all summer 2013","2372":"it took a good while for me to get through this book both informative and very very sad i read it to know more about chechnya and the wars that occurred there in the past 20 years when i located it on a map i was astonished to see just how small a country it is and why such a small place was so fraught with war marra's story is so complex and well developed and each of the seven or so main characters colorful and fully fleshed out too but i didn't enjoy the pace of it nor the back and forth chapters of the storytelling the cool predictions of some of the characters into the future was an interesting gimmick though what held back the book's greatness for me was the pretentiousness of some of the sentences that went on and on i know i'm in the minority here but this aspect just weighed down the novel and i couldn't wait for it to end and not to find out what happens to be done with it thus it's a 3 star review for me which seems more than fair","2373":"i really really loved the first two thirds of this book usually i am more interested in a good story rather than brilliant writing the writing in this book was amazing though i am happy that i read it with the kindle app because i was constantly highlighting sentences that blew me away through dialog between characters marra managed to convey so much about the realities and absurdities of life in a region beset by war and political uncertainty the disagreement that two characters have about which radio station has the best static as there is no working radio tower in the country was one of my favorite passages ever the book was filled with these little pieces that added up to really place the reader in the world of the characters often these situations and the characters themselves had a little humor to them even in an overall grim environment so the writing was great as were the characters i especially liked sonja and havaa but even days after reading the book seemingly minor characters keep popping into my mind why only four starts then it seemed like some of the magic was lost in the last parts of the book while i enjoyed the occasional whimsy in the early parts i found the ending contained too many convenient coincidences throughout the book different chapters move backward and forward in time and are told from the viewpoint of different characters near the end the switching seemed too abrupt and took me out of the story a bit the author also provided information about the future of every character sometimes 10 30 or 50 years into the future it was an interesting idea but again i found it distracting overall a very readable book with some great writing but an ending that didn't quite work for me","2374":"i'm not smart enough to write a review worthy of this book the title is discovered within the story to be the medical definition of life the constellation the web of holes uniting us all with empty spaces and forgotten memories touched me very deeply there may be a small scar in my heart now that i opened it to havaa and akhmed and natasha and sonja oh and kassan and ula and if you're used to reading about characters named amy or john or jennifer get over it and delve into a new land with the most human emotions of love loss faith and determination","2375":"breathtaking this book gets four stars which i don't give often at all for the magnificent language the author is so creative that almost every page had a line i wanted to read aloud to a friend simply beautiful the characters are memorable the story set in chechnya is sad to the nth degree what gives the book relief from the constant grief and horror is the language that mr marra uses to describe emotion physical characteristics and settings the plot may be a bit unbelievable as to the way the events are tied up at the end but i forgive the author completely as the haunting evocative and sometimes completely surprising language choices made this book simply unforgettable i suggest a quick peek at wikipedia or some source to get a grounding in chechnya's sad history that will make it easier to understand the conflicts the characters undergo and the history that is referred to the author's savage jabs at the soviet union provided dark humor in an otherwise grim situation","2376":"i hate books that jump around that being said this was an interesting read i didn't know much about the wars in chechnya or it's history there were many interesting characters and some compelling story lines but overall i found it confusing u0026amp hard to read","2377":"really liked the story but a lot of historical detail made it a slow read","2378":"you don't have to know much about chechnya to find this tale of the heartbreak of war affecting marra brings the story to an intensely personal level and with only a few characters manages to address a wide scope of the experiences of a war torn community mistrust and loneliness torture and betrayal it is a surprisingly upbeat and hopeful book for a topic so dark and marra's writing style which can bring a light touch of absurdism at points helps with this","2379":"a story of sacrifice betrayal and love all within the context of the war in chechnya so sad","2380":" it's really quite impossible to believe that this is the author's first published work the writing is so polished the story so tightly constructed the complexity of the beautifully drawn characters so perfect i am quite blown away the story concerns a small handful of people in a chechen village during the wars a failed doctor but successful portraitist with a vegetable wife a skilled surgeon with a hole the shape of her missing sister a historian writing an interminable history of chechnya and his son an informer responsible for making a lot of villagers be disappeared their orbits all collide over a little girl whose father has been disappeared their house burned to the ground it's a painful story to read as war stories often are but the glory of this one is that it concentrates so specifically on the stories of these few civilians caught up in power machinations far beyond their own spheres of control this is war from a noncombatant's point of view people just trying their best to survive to get by until tomorrow hoping that nobody lobs a bomb at them or sends a goon squad to the door at 2am the myriad joys of marra's writing are really quite too numerous to list and the deep empathy of the work is evident in every passage there are no heroes here but there are no villains either and in the journey through their lives there is a great deal of wisdom to be gained do yourself a favor read it","2381":"i won this arc curtesy of goodreads first reads program and random house canada i'm no stranger to reading difficult subject matters but i was wholly unprepared for a constellation of vital phenomenon i would be the first to admit my ignorance to war and strife that occurs anywhere in the world but i don't live under a rock i've heard about chechen rebels it's hard to believe that this is a debut novel by anthony marra whose narrative is what kept me turning the pages long after i wanted to give up due to the seemingly senseless violence this novel centers around akmed a failed doctor who would rather be an artist havaa the little girl from across the street who has lost everyone and everything sonja an ethnic russian surgeon who runs the hospital with skilled coldness and ramzan the informer marra has the ability to tell their story by seamlessly piecing the characters' lives together by sliding back and forth through the years each character is rich detailed and flawed but no less alive if only within the pages there were many times when i had to put this book down because i simply couldn't handle how difficult it must've been for the chechens during these wars but in the end i'm glad i did read this","2382":"anthony marra is a great storyteller the way he weaves through the story and develops the characters shows how talented he is i highly recommend this book and would definitely read anything else he writes in the future mr marra you succeeded i was laughing and tearing up throughout your book","2383":"a story of many lives entwined during the chechnya wars very good story though hard to read at points last 100 pages pull it all together good ending","2384":"i'm utterly speechless for a book telling a tragedy i come away feeling so undeniably hopeful marra has been able to capture the beauty that still stubbornly exists during war refusing to die reminded me of the book thief what an achievement","2385":"great prose separate stories and characters who's pasts are slowly revealed and who's storylines slowly converge heartbreaking but informative about a war that little is known about in the west","2386":"this was a beautifully written book that told a story about a time and place of which i was virtually unaware","2387":"the best book that i have read in a long time clearly worth at least six stars the fact that the washington post but not the nyt put it on their ten best list is causing me to re prioritize my go to recommendation sources","2388":"what an excellent haunting read really enjoyed the history lesson and the insight into the realities of a war torn country reminds me how much i take for granted everyday","2389":"intricate and interwoven","2390":" \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" written by twenty eight year old anthony marra was a compelling choice for reading on amtrak enclosed in my compartment riding along the coast to and from san francisco--an eight hour journey each way there have been such wonderful reviews before mine that have so perfectly described what makes this book so unique and special i will simply say that i found it to be a brilliant novel about the ravages and horrors of the war in chechnya-- about broken families and friendships--about bravery and small kindnesses and acts of heroism \"life is a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" a perfect description of the way these characters come together and perhaps how our own lives do as well marra's language sometimes has the lyrical voice of translation--like a painful love song the characters are haunting in their struggle to be good to be loving and to live as my train pulled into los angeles union station i quickly read the last page in order to give the book to a new friend and traveling companion from south africa--to share marra's extraordinary literary gift p s connie kalter at vroman's bookstore in pasadena said alice if you read only one book this year it should be a constellation of vital phenomena","2391":" i thought this was a good book but a labor intensive read the story is not written in chronological order and there are numerous plots and sub plots the number of characters is overwhelming yet there seems to be no main character the character's connections and loyalties are confusing and seemingly ever changing at the risk of writing your own book i would encourage readers to take notes of characters and their relationships in time and place beneath all this apparent confusion i think there is a good story if i were to read this book again i suspect would give it a higher rating although this sounds like a 3 star review gave it 4 stars and i would recommend the book for all","2392":"one of the top 20 books i have ever read like the orphan master's son the poisonwood bible or in the time of the butterflies this novel will stay with you haunt you long after you've read its last page a true masterpiece","2393":"breathtaking prose as good a book as i've ever read about war loss love hope and hopelessness","2394":"reminded me of jodi picoult's storyteller a little","2395":"this was stunning insight into life in war ravaged chechnya strange to call it delightful but the writing was just that the characters made realistic troubling and difficult decisions all the time decisions that affected each other throughout the book highly recommended if a challenging read","2396":"so different i listened to the first half of the audio book twice not one to listen to unless you can focus on it it may be cry twice not typical for me reading a book and it also made me feel grateful for my life it is a beautiful and haunting tale i would highly recommend it thank you to ben gunty for the recommendation","2397":"how often is immense sadness mistaken for courage","2398":"not an easy book to read sadness torture evil but gives me an idea of the recent history of chechnya the characters are very interesting the good and the bad how the good can change to the bad etc with each character there is more than meets the eye in the beginning","2399":"very powerful dark ugly up close look st the brutality of war well written but it was too much for me and i couldn't finish it","2400":"loved this book it's not an easy read there were many times that i had to reread sentences and paragraphs to fully understand what the author was trying to tell me but it was so worth the energy and effort uplifting horrifying and hilarious all at different times in the same novel incredible","2401":"this surprising book turned out to be a very educational experience for me i didn't really know anything about chechnya but marra's vivid descriptions and intricate storylines have made me feel like i've been there while technically a story about the brutality of chechnya's two civil wars after the fall of the soviet union this story is told through the experiences of a small group of people who lived through it and through their shared although not always known connections this book has everything love disappearances torture friendship death mystery compassion i found the writing a little choppy in places it's marra's first novel although over all it was still well written i really enjoyed how he sprinkled in information about the future even when it was past the scope of the book he did a wonderful job writing for all characters old and young although his strength definitely lay in the male characters sonja the main female lead was tough to really picture while this book has some very sad and difficult parts it's not overly disturbing i've read some war torn books that were a little too graphic for me the end felt a little abrupt but still a satisfying conclusion i will watch for marra's name i look forward to reading another book by him","2402":"so very very sad so much history i had no knowledge of","2403":"this book is my imperial affliction","2404":"extraordinary first novel about the chechen war","2405":"it's only june but this is likely to be the best book i read in 2014 you ache for every character even the villain the arc of the narrative encompasses so many lives u0026amp a decade's events yet it's really the story of just 5 days in a little village in chechnya there is humor u0026amp hope amidst the irrational tragedies of war that marra unfolds here for instance dental floss figures significantly in the story hard to believe this is his first novel","2406":"beautifully written a tapestry of wonderful characters doing the best they can in the insanity that is war","2407":"definitely glad i read but didn't really get hooked till the middle when the characters started connecting for me once it got me hooked on the characters i felt depressed with the stories can't decide if i love it for all the feels or if i hate it for said feels","2408":"maybe it's because i was reading something light and fluffy while i was downstairs yes i like a book upstairs one down and one in the car but i greatly enjoyed this book some of it is gruesome and a little dark for me the 5 stars is because when a book can literally stop me in a sentence and make me reread that sentence because it is just that perfect well that is a rarity","2409":"devastatingly sad but beautiful","2410":"this is a beautiful really beautiful gut wrenching book masterful","2411":"novel about a bunch of people living and suffering and dying through the wars in chechnya 1994 2004 sounds depressing but not at all a great awesome book by a first time novelist the story takes place over 5 days as well as a spam of 10 years one of the best","2412":"it took me forever to read this because it was just too depressing to read during a challenging winter but well worth coming back to","2413":"the orphan master's son meets cutting for stone in war torn chechnya akhmed and sonja's love story was very well done a reminder that even in the worst of times humanity can prevail it lifted the plot line to help drive home the title 'a constellation of vital phenomena ' the writer doesn't stretch anything to connect his characters the iowa writers' workshop really can crank them out","2414":"this book didn't draw me in like many similar ones do but the last 100 pages were amazing this book does exactly what a good book should do take me to a different place and teach me to see through new eyes","2415":"my first 5 star read since 2012 set in a small rural village in chechnya this book follows the lives of three characters over a five day period with flashbacks as well and tells the story of how they all are intertwined i was leaning toward giving it 4 stars until the last 100 pages or so then i couldn't put it down and the ending made me cry the writing is gorgeous there's a page long sentence on page 139 paperback edition that just takes your breath away i went back and re read it three times i can't believe this is the author's debut novel","2416":"it took me a little while to get into this but then i couldn't put it down powerful story to remind us that awful wars are still happening","2417":"well written the plot too fanciful and romantic for my hardened heart","2418":"she had believed happiness to be an absence of fear of pain of grief there are countless convincing recounts of the destructive nature of war but unfortunately this is not one of them the meaningless asides and foreshadowing cast an awkward tone on a very serious theme","2419":"absolutely one of my favorite books of all time i'll leave it at that","2420":"one of the most memorable novels i've read in recent years","2421":" i loved it it was beautiful i did not love everything about it for some reason the dog bits creeped me out a little and to be perfectly honest i did not fall in love until about halfway but when i did fall i fell hard the last forty pages or so were the best ending i have read in ages and will reread it over and over so many beautiful phrases and sentences how do people manage to out words together like that i stand in awe in particular and i am not sure how the author did it but somehow the way the story was presented it felt pure for lack of a better word i did not mind all of the coincidences between the characters because it read true and not as a designed plot point to manipulate the reader oh heck i give up i obviously lack the talent to give this book it's due normally i am careful which books i recommend to different people but not this one no matter your taste no matter if you do not like the time jumping style no matter if you have no idea of the history it does not matter just read it through to the end","2422":"marra's debut novel takes place over five days in war torn chechnya but through flash backs covers the 10 year span between 1994 and 2004 when chechen and ingush rebels attempted to gain freedom the story centers around two seemingly separate storylines that eventually comes together in a history that is more intertwined than anyone of the characters could have surmised one storyline centers on a group of friends and the daughter havaa of one the alternate story focuses on the competent female surgeon attempting to run a bombed out hospital and the mystery behind the disappearance of her sister natasha when havaa's father is whisked away to the landfill one of the friends ahkmed flees with havaa to the hospital in an attempt to save havaa from the feds intent on sending her to the same fate as her father for much of the book i felt like the book was a solid 4 star book about  3\/4  of the way through i realized it deserved at least the 5 stars most people assigned it but when at the end i was left deeply sobbing i knew it would accompany books like kite runner and rooftops of tehran in my esteem it is hard for me to contain my fervor for this work first marra adeptly provides an important history to a conflict that only makes its way into the headlines when the conflict of the country seeps into consequences for the outside world - think boston marathon and upcoming sochi olympics not only is the reader provided a concise history between wwii through the second chechen war but there is a great deal of context for how the muslim fundamentalist came to have such a stronghold in the area without being didactic further i found the way marra displayed the irony and hypocrisy of how soviet's socialism manifested throughout its territories fascinating while the history of this specific country is appreciated much of marra's brilliance shows in how he portrays the harsh brutality of those living under duress regardless of the war the country or regime yet he contrasts the brutality humans can dream up to perpetrate on others against the selfless sacrifice some chose to make but don't be fooled while much of the work is haunting and heartbreaking there are some real hearty chuckle moments as well when sonja is attempting to explain the history of u s presidents from ronald reagan through george w bush the scene plays out a great deal like a \"who's on first\" routine for me to love a book sound character development is essential here the characters are incredibly well drawn some of those who never appear alive in the tale are the most thoroughly developed by the time you learn the fate of natasha you have come to yearn for the resolution of her story as much as her sister sonja the victims who arrive in the hospital with no hope of survival are given a full history though fleshed out asides you actually sympathize for many of the families who will never learn the fate of their loved ones ramzan the friend turned informant is one of the most complex i've seen in quite some time you can't help but despise him at first and while you may never like him you can't keep from developing some sympathy for him but finally marra delivers on giving the reader something to think about it may seem that in the larger events of the world particularly the cruel ones a single life has little meaning maybe that is true in the big scheme of things but to those who love him or her individuals matter more importantly how we treat others matters because even after we are gone the memories of our deeds live on in other and can bring hope or pain","2423":"wow one of the best books i have read in very long time","2424":"absolutely remarkable prose that left me breathless","2425":"i could not wait for this book to end i have no clue why it is so popular granted it's nothing i would ever pick up on my own if it weren't part of my book club this month i also listened to it which made the changes in locale narrator and time extra confusing maybe the narrator was bad but it really felt like a book that i'll regret having spent time reading","2426":"i sort of wish i had read this instead of listening to the audiobook it was beautiful and i think i missed some of the details with the way i tune in and out when listening","2427":"another living during wartime book but this one takes place in chechnya and it's not always clear whose side you want to root for the feeling of too much time on your hands with an ever present lack of electricity water etc keeps you in suspense the story takes place in the street and in a dilapidated hospital the book jumps from one timeframe to another and back and the process is sometimes infuriating","2428":"anthony marra has written a remarkable debut novel that centers on five days in 2004 in chechnya a muslim villager dokka has been arrested by russian soldiers and will probably never be seen again his daughter eight year old haava ran into the woods to hide and was found by her neighbor akhmed akhmed a doctor whose true talent is in art offers his services at a shelled hospital to the surgeon sonja in return for her help in hiding haava sonja an ethnic russian had come back from safety in london to locate her sister natasha in their hometown in chechnya each chapter is headed by a timeline going from 1996 to 2004 with one year highlighted the stories of the war weary characters go back in time to let us understand their actions in 2004 chechnya is highly valued for its natural resources as well as its pipelines and oil refineries many chechen people had been killed or relocated and ethnic russians moved into the area by the former soviet union since the soviet union divided there have been two chechen wars where the russians have tried to seize control of the region and chechnya is currently a republic of the russian federation the people of chechnya have had to rebuild their lives as well as their homes and infrastructure multiple times the atmosphere in 2004 is gray and bleak there are shortages of everything including food homes have been destroyed people have lost everyone they loved and the occupying russians will arrest anyone based on rumors or informers despite the devastation the book has many moments of humor warmth compassion and love the meaning of family can extend beyond genetic boundaries the main characters showed remarkable resilience despite terrible circumstances the title of the novel comes from a definition in a medical dictionary that was circled by natasha life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i was impressed with anthony marra's beautiful lyrical writing this is a timely book to read since the 2014 olympics will be held in an area of russia near chechnya although the book did not go into great detail about the military aspect of the wars in the region and centered on the people it did help me understand the continuing unrest in chechnya","2429":" one afternoon as i am looking through new books at the local barnes u0026amp noble i came across \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" i read the jacket cover stating it is two doctors risking everything to save a hunted girl during the chechnya war i took the book to the cafe to sit and read a little to see if it was something i might be interested in since i am ignorant of the facts surrounding the chechen wars i found myself lost in this book right from the beginning author anthony marra writes a beautiful prose about a horrific time in that country a handful of survivors are struggling to get through the latest conflict in 2004 while the book also provides background information on these characters over the past 10 years and two wars somehow this small group of people crossed each other's paths without realizing it and author marra writes this spectacularly as i was purchasing this book the woman at the counter stated she was so happy i was buying the book because it is fabulous and not many people seem to be aware of it both of us agreed on the great writing that draws you into the story this book will certainly be on the short list of many awards and will be one of the best books of 2013","2430":" loved everything about this book beautifully beautifully written did not want to put it down it is a book you want to savor the only extremely minor criticism i have is the author's reference to tolstoy which to me is the author shouting this is my war and peace which was the one sentence i would have omitted told you it was a minor nitpick this book is one of those rare gifts where the universal is revealed in the particular all disguised in the seemingly small lives of its characters to me this is tolstoy meets kundera meets khaled hosseini and i can't wait to read what mr marra writes next","2431":"wow i'm running late for work but i want to make sure i put down my first impression upon finishing the book wow will add a review shortly","2432":"an astoundingly beautiful novel about the resilience of hope in even the most dire of circumstances not for the faint of heart but if you're going to read a novel there aren't many as rewarding as this one","2433":"what a wonderful book","2434":"oh wow this is another of those books that combines a great story with history but this time it's recent history chechen wars this was a difficult book for me to get into it jumps back and forth in time and the first part of the book didn't hook me i've had the book off and on for months fortunately a friend told me she liked it a lot so i continued reading and got hooked this author feels compassion even for his most despicable character and he is so very good at describing life i felt like i was there i felt like i could have been any of the characters and given the historical background of this book i can't help but view with horror the unfolding crimean story","2435":"what a powerful and eye opening story of love and loss as experienced through the lives of the innocents entangled in the atrocities of war and the destruction of home and family that we so often take for granted as is written in the reader's guide and so accurately sums it up this book deftly explores the human cost of war and the healing power of hope","2436":"i didn't know anything about this book when i started it russell pushed it into my hands and told me i must read it i'm really glad i did this book devastated me i wasn't very informed about the setting before this and my heart broke for so many of these characters the plot is a bit confusing on purpose this is one of those books where you don't know exactly how everything fits together but it all comes together in the end i recommend this to everyone","2437":"first novel about chechnya tough subject matter and somewhat confusing format but well worth working through the use of humor and characterization to level out the violence is masterful","2438":"brutal i mean that in a good way","2439":"four stars and a half","2440":"even before i finished reading a constellation of vital phenomena i knew that i loved it but in the weeks since i've finished the novel i've noticed an amazing thing everyone who has read it has loved it my friend chris who's into crime novels and mysteries loves it my friend julie who's into literary fiction loves it reviewers for the new york times npr the washington post indiebound the rumpus publisher's weekly booklist and many many more--they all loved it and while i want to praise so many specific parts of anthony marra's book--the compelling characters and intriguing plot lines and exquisite prose--i think his greatest accomplishment is simply the creation of a book that appeals to so many people that is so universally good to read my full review of a constellation of vital phenomena go to the bookpeople blog here http bookpeopleblog wordpress com 2","2441":"there were aspects of marra's first novel that i liked very much the man can obviously write well paragraphs pages characters descriptions of nature of situations there are however other aspects that irritated me that i felt could have been done more successfully first this is a difficult topic village life during the first and second chechen wars horror death torture not off stage but on so beware this is not going to be a fun read it's not meant to be but marra could have made it easier on readers not sent them off to wikipedia for background hoping to orient themselves the trick of historical novel is to make them self contained not easy he might also have found a better way to tell the story even keeping the vast amount to be told as flashback the foreground is just five days but the background is the more than ten years between 1994 and 2004 the reader knows this because heading every chapter is a time line with the year of the particular chapter bolded better than nothing but a more skilled writer could have done it differently done it differently and still managed to give the reader that sense of being lost in time i thought of on chesil beach for example which i recently read no timeline needed even as mcewan deftly leads the reader through his complicated dance and the title does not go trippingly on the tongue eminently forgettable i won't say anything about the ending the victorian wrap up i mean really but for all their irritating qualities however these are in the end just technical elements the thing that bothered me the most and i know not everyone agrees with me here but i can't help wondering why marra chose this topic these particular characters it's not like he's writing in familiar territory and i don't mean geographical or historical territory i am referring to emotional territory this is a very young writer a smart grad student he did his research he even took a trip to chechnya but he needs to live a bit before attempting to write what these people feel there was a kind of coldness about it all some feelings you can't just imagine your way into i wanted to shake him say leave your mfa program your iowa writers workshop even stop with the writing for a while or at least write on what you know live suffer saying this makes me feel so old well i am","2442":" this is a book about a war that essentially has very little war related content the author tells a story interwoven with richly developed characters set in chechnya during a complex conflicted time of war knowing hardly anything about the conflict in that region i was grateful for the brief clarified scenes that connected me to the story the author didn't overly describe the trials of the war but grazed them just enough for the story he was trying to tell the characters of the book broke my heart each one stuck in the life they were given never easy to face that the internal struggles of freedom betrayal survival love and loss are blanketed within all the different characters who're connected in the large web of life it's hard to break away from this novel i found myself researching and delving deeper into chechnya and it's history anthony marra may not have thrown down the entire history by pen but he definitely seems to have peaked this interest within his readers to find out for themselves what a clever little devil he is intentional or not","2443":"a very well written book that takes place over only a couple of days but covers a lifetime of the characters even though it takes place in a country barely known to us the struggles and triumphs of humans are all the same beautiful book i recommend","2444":"this book was very hard for me to get into however once i passed the halfway point i was genuinely interested even though i found this a difficult book to read it was well worth the effort to finish i really liked how all the characters and their stories interconnected and came together","2445":"halfway through this book i still wasn't sure i liked it at all i am unfamiliar with chechnya where the novel takes place and i was lost in the discussion of its conflicts there were long descriptive paragraphs and tangents about random people and their future that frustrated me because all i wanted to read about were the main characters i was introduced to in the beginning still i stuck with it and i am so very glad i did the tangents i didn't like became the very thing i loved when i reached the end the writing style finally made sense and it was so satisfying this story is heart wrenching and sad yet so well told very glad i read it","2446":"an absolutely phenomenal novel debut that tells the story of several interconnected characters living in the small village of eldar in chechnya over the course of 5 days their stories of living through the 2 chechen wars is told in all its brutality i really don't even know how to describe certain aspects of this book it is so powerful the characters endure torture deprivation extreme remorse and guilt for their actions and inaction and live in a sort of twilight that is clouded over at all times with war and hopelessness yet their stories are ultimately triumphant in that their spirit is never vanquished the author gives glimpses of what happens to them with subtle references to moments in their futures absolutely one of the finest novels i have read recently and this one should also be in the running for some awards this year life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaption p 317","2447":" i read this for book club the book overall was difficult for me to get through because the stories are very sad and it took a while for me to see the connections i started to get it at around the half way point from there i was very interested in finding out what other connections were made and how everyone's lives intersected and ended at the end i was pleasantly surprised to not feel as depressed as i did at the beginning i think that has a lot to do with the way in which the writer told the story and wrote the story i am really glad i read this for a lot reasons one is we often try to make characters good evil in books and really everyone has a story and one that can be be empathized with and also i didn't know a lot of what happened during the wars and it opened my eyes to life there during this time","2448":"not the type of book i usually read it was very interesting first novel by anthony marra about the war that was caused 1st by the soviet russia and then a second war the hardships the people had to go thru and the torture and killings but ends with hope","2449":"too depressing for me i had trouble getting into the story and i felt like it was bogged down in historical education for the lay person it was just too much effort for too little payoff and if you think this review makes me sound boring and unintelligent you're not wrong sorry national book award folks","2450":"i started reading this book and thought it sounded very familiar then realized i must have started it and put it down because i didn't think i would like it i read so many great reviews that i decided to try it again and almost put it down again but so glad i didn't it is a little hard to follow in the beginning with all the russian chechnyan names references but once you get into the story it is impossible to put down highly recommend and stick with it i feel like reading again now so i can fully appreciate the beginning","2451":"the history part was complicated for me since i know so little about the history of this region but the story is so moving and the characters are very deep and interesting not a light poolside book but so great if you are in the mood for something heavier","2452":"i'm not going to write a review because many of those already written have said what i would say only much more eloquently that said this is the best book i've read in years very difficult subject but beautifully and lyrically written","2453":" this is a novel about war in chechnya that takes you through two of the russian invasions of the country and a week in a village where an informer lives and turns friends and neighbors in to the occupying russian army the humanity of people comes through despite the horrible circumstances of the story and the real accomplishment of the novel is that mara breaks down barriers of religion traditions and ethnic differences to make us feel for the people of this different land and culture in addition there's an ending that despite impending personal disaster and pain remains triumphant mara's ability to mix humor love and family tragedy with the pain of history and the science of medicine is truly remarkable and inspiring","2454":"wow i don't often come across a book of this sort i couldn't read it fast enough because the story was so engrossing i also couldn't read it slow enough because i did not want this book to end i can only think of one other book that i felt that way about for the record it is lamb the gospel according to biff christ's childhood pal by christopher moore stories this well written don't come along very often this story was amazing i loved how the author intricately wove the story and the characters together and provided surprising back stories on the characters as well it's funny when i don't like a novel i find it so easy to tell you exactly what is wrong with the story editing characters etc however when i really love a novel such as this all i can find myself saying is read it just read it i don't think you'll be sorry","2455":"i loved the way the author played with chronology in this book and for a first novel it was beautifully written i didn't foresee the ending but i wasn't moved to tears would definitely read more by this author","2456":" the bookseller shook with enthusiasm as he recommended this book to me now that i have read a constellation of vital phenomena myself i understand his excitement anthony marra's novel is brilliant masterful and evocative my astonishment is heightened by the fact that this is marra's first foray into novel writing he writes with the serene wagnerian genius of someone who has penned 10 or more novels marra tells the story of chechnya which broke away in the mid 1990s from russia in the post soviet era the russians brutally restored the republic to their territory in a second war a couple years later the story's timeline is set between 1994 and 2004 but the larger story of chechnya is always in view indeed the character khassan an elderly man and veteran of the world war ii era soviet army has penned a 3 300 page history of chechnya a constellation of vital phenomena is not about battles leaders and tactics marra tells the story from the much more intimate level of 10 or so villagers in a couple small caucasus towns called eldar and volchansk the characters include two physicians one brilliant the other mediocre the sister of the brilliant physician the wife of the mediocre physician an informer and his father and an old man and his daughter the novel is bursting with subplots and each deepened my interest all these detours reveal just how interconnected the people in the small chechen towns are marra's point is that the conflict touched everyone in chechnya no matter how innocent he or she was brutality is a theme of every war novel i have read including this one marra depicts a never used landfill with two pits where chechen prisoners are kept exposed to the climate until the hour of their torture arrives once it does bolt cutters are used to remove fingers and testicles beasts are allowed bites and electrical equipment is used to zap victims with electricity given that it is permeated with atrocities the novel is optimistic in tone moreover mercy even for the self evidently guilty is deeply encoded in the story near the end khassan the man who wrote the history of chechnya plans to murder his own son ramzan for being an informer for the russians but a one word note from a disappeared villager stays his hand this resignation in the face of cruelties might strike some as odd but in a world that has witnessed a holocaust atom bombs wars of attrition and mass shootings forbearance patience and acceptance are necessary for the salvation of humanity","2457":"very sad but beautifully written account of life during the wars in chechnya","2458":"compelling artfully developed insightful","2459":"this book read like poetry to me at times the content was harsh and difficult to get through but it is a wartime story after all and it wouldn't have been true to form had the words been fairytale like the subtleties and intricacies of the story were also beautiful it's rare to find a writer who can balance plot and poetry of prose so well","2460":"astonishing book beautifully written and dramatically told a story of the various kinds of victims of the wars in chechnya highly recommended but very moving","2461":"i abandoned this one with only about a quarter of the book left but it lost my interest it was well written and i thought the timeline was particularly clever but new characters i didn't care about kept being added and it was hard for me to muster the effort to keep track of them","2462":"a very tangled web that requires thoughtful reading in the end it is a heartbreaking story told with beauty but you must be committed as it is complex","2463":"brilliant gorgeous unforgettable my favorite read of the summer so far at first i was put off by the idea of a novel about war in chechnya but immediately found myself swept away by the narrative and characters i very highly recommend this first novel","2464":"really good writing","2465":"wow this book is an interesting look at people as they struggle to survive the extreme conditions of war the loss the poverty the daily routine and the love and unexplained mercies i recommend this book to anyone who is concerned about human suffering that is occurring in our world today in countries burdened by war and violence","2466":"such a beautiful book the story is compelling and absorbing while the prose itself is memorable and masterful it's well suited for people who appreciate more classical styles of writing and marra adapts it well to the modern context","2467":"truly a 5 star book i feel liked i walked away from this book looking at the world around me in a different way","2468":"one of the best books i've read in a long time intricate characters whose lives dart in and out between staggering grief and slivers of hope","2469":"gorgeously written brutal sad poignant i didn't want it to end highly recommended","2470":"beautiful heart rending didn't want any part of it to end except the tragedy which was all of it i loved the characters and even learned to feel for ramzan worth reading to remember that war and the state and community investment in conflict twists and destroys people their lives and all the good things","2471":"a flash in the heavens that makes you look up and believe in miracles states wapo book editor ron charles and he is not mistaken i'm not sure how i missed reading this profound novel when it first came out but i am thankful i finally discovered it it is one that will stay with me long after i return it to the shelf","2472":"incredibly poignant without making me bawl like a baby books about war are never easy to read but this one was subtle and eloquent beautifully written with such compelling and diverse characters definitely recommend","2473":"at first i found the way it was written hard to follow it felt like it jumped back and forth in time too much but once i really got into it i hard a hard time waiting to see what happened what i loved most was that you got to know what happened to the characters after the book was done not in a 'this this this and then this' list kind of way but that it was written into the story so you didn't feel like it was just to tie up loose ends to get the book finished","2474":"this story takes place in chechenya in 2004 with flashbacks to 10 years earlier this is a haunting examination of the affects of war on both good and bad people eight year old havaa is saved from certain death by the involvement of many good yet flawed people fascinating account of a part of the world and a conflict most of us know woefully little about","2475":"so interesting to read a novel set in chechyna a beautiful moving tale about intersecting lives of people caught up in terrible times love grief brutality and more love","2476":"a book that will stay with you after finishing the last page this book was difficult to read but well worth the effort i knew very little about the events depicted here but i definitely intend to read more about it","2477":"an incredible story about 8 people and their lives before and after the 2nd war in chechnya haunting shocking brutuality and on the other side loyality sacrifice and the untold beauty in relationships","2478":"just couldn't get into this book made it a third of the way and had to force myself to read it too many books i want to read so decided this one was not for me","2479":"wish i had more stars to give this one","2480":"it's stupid there are maps to show you how to get to the place where you want to be but no maps that show you how to get to the time when you want to be","2481":"beautifully written story about people surviving in a small village in war torn chechnya","2482":"life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation this was the most brutal book i have ever read but the writing was spectacular","2483":" this is one of the best written books i've read the story is set in chechnya during the war credible characters natural dialogue an intriguing story which vividly brings to life the place u0026amp the period u0026amp its effects as well as being educational i didnt like the jumping around in time out of sequence the writing was superb i stopped often to re read a sentence or phrase which was beautifully imaginatively originally expressed so it was sometimes slow progressing but totally worth it","2484":"good book but a little too deep for a beach read","2485":"this book was so sad i had to put it down for a few days there is a lot of brutality some pretty graphic so it's not for the faint of heart it centers around a small town in chechnya i once heard a native russian pronounce it chech en yah with the accent on the first syllable which i prefer where the few townspeople who haven't been disappeared are struggling to survive the two invasions from russia there are also a couple of sisters living out their own hell in a larger nearby town one is a surgeon who does daily amputations b c of all the land mines but also delivers babies one character mumbles something like life and death our two national occupations the rest of the hospital has been either bombed or disassembled for the war effort the other sister lives sort of aimlessly and makes poor and tragic decisions that said i liked how this author played with time past present and future how these characters intermingled at different points in time and then reconnected later into a long chain of coincidence it is a very clever book regardless of the topic it seems of offer a accurate portrait of living during a war the idiocy of war time policy and the brutality of man","2486":"very much enjoyed this book would give it a 4 5 if such a thing was available because while only a few books get a 5 from me this was better than a 4","2487":" by far the best book i have read in a long long time anthony marra writes with simplicity and skill and a style i haven't been exposed to i have a soft spot for writing with 'flowery' language and beautiful prose that makes you want to highlight it and mark its location for future reference anthony marra has none of that but his writing is elegant in its efficiency there isn't a word in this novel that doesn't have a purpose and it's clear that this is a carefully crafted work throughout it i would find sentences that i truly feel could not have been written any other way his point had been made so effectively and in a quarter of the words it would have taken me as a result of this this novel feels so densely packed that i could not put it down i felt such a connection to the characters and was invested in their story within the first 20 pages it tells the story of eldar a village in chechnya and all the people who live there it starts with 8 year old havaa hiding behind her house with her suitcase when russian soldiers come for her and her father the story follows havaa and her neighbours as they live their lives in post war chechnya","2488":"this was such a beautiful and haunting novel i can't remember the last time i read a book that taught me something i knew little about the chechen conflict was beautifully and skillfully written and prompted deep reflection and some tears a new favorite","2489":" this has been a great year for reading fiction for me and it's only one third over a constellation of vital phenomena is also for me a very unique book because while it's about the soviet union in particular chechens and russians living in chechnya through the 1990s and 2000s it's a very western book in terms of attitude and style the deep seated anguish and yearning toska that resides in anyone including me who has been touched by russian culture is essentially absent in marra's novel we get the absurd we get the heightened operatic emotions of the west but toska it's not here i don't think that absence is a flaw marra is after all writing for an american audience but i've never read a book about russia before that didn't have a russian soul marra has written a very inventive page turner of a novel in a style that's somewhere between ann patchett and ian mcewan while its subject matter war in far off chechnya is obscure a constellation is a very accessible novel there was clearly a lot of research involved in putting this book together but marra certainly rises well above all the reading and chechen history he's accumulated the language is at a fever pitch throughout that's not a style that i particularly like but here like in the best of ann patchett it seems to be almost necessary given all the emotional tugs between loved ones in a constellation two doctors try to sustain their humanity in the rubble of a constantly war torn region by healing the wounded and maintaining their tenuous ties with the frail and vulnerable people they love it's essentially an impossible task but somehow they both carry on in their own way there's a lot of back story in this book probably far more than in most contemporary fiction and i would be tempted to edit quite a bit of it out not every character needs or deserves a twenty page treatise on how they got to the present that said marra has created a full world of people with rich emotional lives this book probably wouldn't fare well with a russian audience they wouldn't know quite what to make of it but for a western one i think it's an exquisite well told mainstream story","2490":"it is good i shouldn't give it three stars but for me it has 2 problems the time frame changes were too many to follow and it's just too sad satisfying ending saved it from devastating sadness","2491":"i liked the story here but had a hard time really getting in to it the story jumps around between about ten years time and there is a lot of history that is the author tried to cram in the writing is very heavy and i found myself having to reread parts of it numerous times i didn't know much about chechnya and found it interesting to learn a bit about the conflicts there glad to be done with this one though","2492":" \"time became more important the closer to death one was so an extra few hours to make peace with the world were worth more than years \"this is marra's debut novel and in it we see his queerly outsized talent and deep knowledge of human motivation and possibility where did he get the knowledge from which he created this book and how did he come to know it in what he calls his bibliography marra credits anna politkovskaya's a small corner of hell dispatches from chechnya asne seierstad's the angel of grozny orphans of a forgotten war and allah's mountains the battle for chechnya new edition by sebastian smith for giving him much of the background he needed to imagine this place in this time a ten-year period between 1994 and 2003 constellation immerses one in the east--at no time does one imagine oneself to be anywhere but in that place east of europe and west of the caspian i suppose everyone will have familiarized themselves with chechnya now after the 2013 boston marathon but it is north of the caucasus mountain range that separates russia and its \"rind of former republics\" from what westerners term the middle east it has been the site of grim partisan wars fought by hand and in person back when one actually had to show up to kill another this hard hitting novel shows us the broken families littering the landscape there some forced into unseemly alliances with enemies and the nearly limitless capacity of humans to inflict pain among the legion who are broken there are still some who retain a measure of humor dignity and goodness that they share with other good souls they recognize one another these folks who hold themselves aloof from the cruelty and it is because of them that we can even dream of a day when the sun shines on a peaceful patch of land where they can grow the food they need play chess in the shade of a large tree make music and make love and laugh without fear marra gives us all this--what is there and what is not yet there--through the depth and strength of his writing of a people place and time his descriptions linger in the memory and stop the eye on the page the russian doctor sonja was \"a riddle wrapped inside a mystery inside a set of unattractive but very white scrubs \" she returned to chechnya from a safe place in london to find her beloved sister natasha \"though she was the elder sonja was always thought of as natasha's sister the object rather than the subject of any sentence the two shared \"she met akmed a better portraitist than he was a doctor who helped her in the hospital and in life in the midst of the betrayals and the shortening life horizon for a brief moment \"the circumference of the world tightened to what their arms encompassed \" but that moment passed and havaa beloved daughter of dokka remained the daughter upon whom everyone's hopes were pinned the \"constellation of vital phenomena\" gotten from an ancient medical text is a term to describe life and in this definition consists of \"organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptation \" couldn't the very same words be used to describe any work of art in the process of construction like for instance a novel this is an extraordinary piece of work especially for a newcomer i challenge you to forget this book and your first up close glimpse of that place called chechnya it distinguishes itself by its subject and the incisiveness of the writing despite the horror or perhaps because of it one wishes to see the place to care and bear witness for the folks that stood up for their most basic rights--to live in peace if not happiness \"not knowing what to do kassan walked back and forth in the snow urging the dogs to do so likewise turning the snow into a riddle no one could solve \"an early essay of marra's when he graduated from the iowa writer's workshop is a deferential tug to the forelock to other authors but does not reveal the man only his leavings i look forward to seeing more of his work","2493":"a constellation of vital phenomena part of a definition of the word life two sisters discover in a medical book what a way to describe the soul of this amazing novel it's a curious feeling a gift a power a feeling that works the mind and moves the heart to find out the fates of loved ones that others siblings sons friends yearn to know i liked that feeling it made me consider if i were able to take sonja who keeps hospital number 6 up and running aside and tell her where her sister natasha is would i is it better to know or to wonder the little nuggets of humor in the book truly are priceless there is so much grief tragedy betrayal and absolute horrors of war two of them that the humor seems more vital than food sometimes and the humor is rare and understated so it never takes weight away from the grim reality of these people's lives there are some quips about american presidents the quest to discover who ronald mcdonald is the meaning and value of a shoulder shrug and a few other clever bits of humor tinged with sadness sonja needs supplies for her hospital when told someone is acquiring them through amazon she asks what is that and receives the reply i have no idea not everyone is familiar with the things food places resources i sometimes take for granted i liked how the story included the lives of chechens russians rebels the fed there were quite a few different perspectives and points of view and so many lives touched in ways most of the people didn't even realize so many whys were answered in creative ways that really worked well ways that were shocking thought provoking and absolutely heart breaking one of the whys answered that i thought was especially well done was why does someone inform on his neighbors what might cause a person to do such a thing to work with those who would come to your village and disappear people such a beautiful story despite the violence loss and grief i loved the characters what i learned about life as they learned it and in the face of death how a man can find such joy constellation made my heart ache and brought tears to my eyes but if i had known before starting it that it would hurt to read it i'd still pick it up and read it again","2494":"beautifully written that's why i gave it three stars but i found it confusing and rambling the sentences were wonderfully constructed but the paragraphs were too long i kept on falling asleep when i read this book maybe i just didn't find it interesting enough sorry but i'm part of the minority that doesn't really find this book riveting gave up after reading 200 pages i was hoping to be interested but no spark was ignited","2495":"the book was a sad story with an uplifting end","2496":"how can a novel that takes place amidst the brutality of 1990's chechnya be filled with so much love wisdom humour anthony marra tells a masterful tale of families intertwined and how they try to make some sense of the world they find themselves in","2497":"i finished this a few days ago and have been thinking about it since then how to describe this book certain words come to mind breathtaking mesmerizing lyrical disturbing a very ambitious and well researched first novel by a talented young writer a story of survival during the brutality of the wars in chechnya which i admit to knowing little about before this book this should be required reading for all of humanity though i wonder what the russians would think of this novel if i could give this book 6 stars i would read it","2498":"i was able to get through many of the award winning or nominated novels of 2013 and while i liked most and even loved a couple none struck a chord as powerfully as this marra's debut novel the best book i've read since carsten jensen's we the drowned nearly two years ago","2499":"wow too drained to say anything else","2500":"wow i had to back up several times to make sure i didn't miss something this an amazing book and one that will stick with me for awhile","2501":" this book is gentle in it's beauty and human intimacy but a sucker punch to the nose in it's small moments tangents really of figures passing through the narrative whose lives go on to hope tragedy frustration etc it's a horribly damning portrayal of war and the damage people do to each other side by side with this brutal violence heartbreak and betrayal is the love a father has for a son an effort to save a little girl that little girl's imagination at the world around her it's violently sad and violently beautiful all at once the plot is made up of a few days a man's effort to save an orphaned girl in a hospital and the ensuing relationship mutual understanding with the drug addicted doctor serving there most of the plot is flashbacks to these characters' lives and the events that brought each of them to this particular time and place this book made me cry real streaming down the face tears while reading in a coffee shop any book that can do that is a powerful book","2502":"this book is a work of art where did marra learn to write like this it's the first book i've read in 2015 and will make it tough for all subsequent books a constellation of vital phenomena is now my favorite novel of all time","2503":"i really wanted to give this book 5 stars it's for sure a 4 5 the writing is fantastic and the story is so moving you have to read it for yourself to understand it's an experience not just a story my only issue is with the complexity of his storytelling i enjoyed the time hopping and doubling back and forth on each character's story but it was often too complicated for me to follow with my first read through i love a book that makes you think and re think but this stretched my brain a little out of whack a few times definitely read this book just be ready to create a flowchart for yourself if necessary","2504":"this book is beautifully written from the heart and soul of this writer he weaves a tale of stories about the people who are trying to survive the conflict in their country i found myself caring for these characters as though i knew them such love and compassion against brutality and evil the insanity of war is played out in how these people survive what an amazing book i was reluctant to pick up this book when i found out it was about war but so glad i did it is a treasure of a book","2505":"such a beautifully written book it made me aware of how other cultures and countries have suffered so much and experienced deprivation cruelty and violence often for years here is a sentence that took my breath away as someone whose days were defined by the ten thousand ways a human can hurt she needed now and then to remember that the nervous system didn't exist exclusively to feel pain","2506":" this is a fine book it's well written it's just not my cup of tea i realized about half way into it that i was mildly annoyed by it i wanted to learn more about chechnya and as i finished the book i realized i'd rather have read some of the books the author cites as resources for his writing i need to be a bit more discerning particularly as i read reviews here i'm not really interested in well told soap operas dressed up either as costume dramas or adventure fiction these characters are dressed up in their place and time but i don't feel the book delivers anything richly rewarding for the trouble taken","2507":"i initially didn't know what to make of this book and it took me longer than it should have to get through it i knew nothing about the region the book took place in and while you don't need to know much to get through the book it did help me to finish it once i did my homework on chechnya overall a brutally honest and exceptionally poetic novel there were some absolutely beautifully formed lines in the novel that i just wanted to read over and over even amidst the overall dark themes of the book there were surprisingly little bright flashes of light the way the timeline flowed was unique and even the flashbacks made the novel flow i would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in historical fiction gorgeous writing and human love and loss","2508":"this is a devastating story of ordinary people trying to live meaningful lives in the midst of a civilization that has fallen apart i've read news about chechnya over the years and especially after the boston marathon bombings but the reality of people's lives there always felt removed from my own life they say fiction can make events more real than reality because it touches you on a more emotional level and i think that is true for this novel i felt the reality of the lives of ahkmed and sonja the story contains horrific descriptions of man's inhumanity but i was surprised at the optimism and hopefulness too despite the anarchy so many characters showed dignity kindness humor and an essential goodness that these things can still exist in a world of nightmares is a testament to human spirit it also explains the title which comes from a definition of life in sonja's medical textbook \"a constellation of vital phenomena -- organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \"connections between the characters are fraught with peril but also crucial for physical and emotional survival and the connection between natasha ahkmed sonja and haava run deeper than we realize something not revealed until the end of the book as i approached the end of the story i was astonished to realize that the intersecting stories of ahkmed and sonja only took place over three days the shifting of narrative between the time periods fooled me into imagining their time together as much longer the changing time periods in the narrative reveal the characters and how events have shaped them and led them to the present in the end even the son the informer reveals a core with much more good than we realize and he especially poses an uncomfortable question for the reader what would you do if it happened to you","2509":"i heard a lot of great things about this book so i had high expectations but i just could not get into it","2510":" writing a review of this book has challenged me for 3 days i would have given it 5 stars but it is so dark with the despair of lives lived in war time that it's painfully difficult to read there are only a few characters and their lives go back and forth in time mostly during the 10 years of two chechnyan wars the brutality of existence is carefully chronicled with lyrical language some of the characters' situations are so difficult to imagine this is also a book that requires focus and patience you will want to re read some passages and you will wish you'd never read others but the stories all come together demonstrating a lot of love loyalty regret heartbreak loss and fear highly recommended with the caveat that the brutality can be graphic","2511":"i have not read a more beautiful story in many many years i loved how the characters' experiences intersected in unexpected and extraordinary ways this book came highly recommended to me and i whole heartedly pass on the sentiments it will make you cry and sigh and laugh and smile it is a difficult heart wrenching read but very well worth it","2512":"a remarkable saga reading this book i was reminded of leo tolstoy and the way he completely captivated me into his world a san francisco chronicle reviewer said it best over and over again this is an examination of the ways in which many broken pieces come together to make a new whole","2513":" for those of you that heard about this book or plan to read this book in the near future or currently reading it and you're lost at the overall happenings in this story it's set in a ten year timeline between 1994 and 2004 that is also the timeline of the first and second chechen war which is basically the fight for chechnya's separation from the former soviet union's communist control continuing with this i liked how anthony marra took a topic of history that people barely know or remember except those that were solely affected by this and turn it into this dark tragic story about the ramifications of war and what it does to those that are more innocent in this in one of the praising blurbs his writing was compared to jonathan safran foer and i can see some resemblance in a sense that it's very wordy and seems to have this majestic complexion which seems to flow though the first couple of chapters were a little bit confusing despite the blunt beginning it git deep after page 150 and by the end even though there is that bit of silver lining for havaa the girl the story is focused around you cannot help but still feel sympathy for those around her","2514":"great book it was chosen for book club i listened to the audio version of it during various walks and while gardening not a light book much sadness and distress makes me consider my own worries much more closely i am so impressed with the author's ability to weave this storyline","2515":"about a life i cannot imagine skillfully written and researched a moving read that is not soon forgotten","2516":"weak 4 too cinematic maybe not the best developed characters","2517":"review to come","2518":"i may have read this book in a bit of a scattershot way and lost some of the heft of it as a result i really liked it but it's really more like a 3 5 star book for me worth reading and i think it will stick with me","2519":"it's a difficult topic to read about with war torture unjustified persecution starvation and the lack of so many things in 1994 2004 worth the read of first time author as he mingled the decency of humanity and respect among the characters","2520":"eye opening and soul shattering how wars destroy lives displace peoples tear families god knows that an eye for an eye will make the world blind thank god there are people like akhmed and sonja who can show compassion despite the misery around a great novel","2521":" i'm really not sure what the appeal is here although i am clearly in the minority i really disliked this book because it got such great goodreads reviews i plodded through to its conclusion but i found this story to be a complete waste of time i did not care for the writing i liked the characters only a bit better by the end of the book i did not care for the way the author basically stopped writing the story and told us what would happen to these characters in the future and i learned very little of the chechnyan conflict life is too short to read bad fiction","2522":"while i enjoyed it as much as one can enjoy a novel about ethnic conflict sex trafficking and torture it felt reminiscent of some other book i can't quite place my finger on which book or why but there are echoes of other stories here for me that's not a bad thing necessarily but it felt slightly disorienting as i read","2523":" wow imagery character development and general prose was excellent i don't know how many will be interested in a book revolving around the chechin wars with russia but i highly recommend there were a couple tough scenes i don't like violence but of course this is war i remember liking all quiet on the western front this definitely topped that way way more involving the human relationships of characters and the profound effects we have on each other despite the incredibly difficult times these people lived through as if they were real i found myself somehow uplifted at the end","2524":"an extremely difficult important uncomfortable subject that should be required reading for those of us privileged to live freely in a country exceptionally well written","2525":"this is a beautiful book the language and the story love and turmoil the connections between the characters are revealed bit by bit and the story deepens i absolutely recommend this book","2526":"a masterpiece an amazing amount of work must have gone into the writing of this novel and i was thankful for every last bit of it","2527":" the title is after all a definition of life and that is what you get in this poignant tale great story of chechnya and war torn countries and what each character must do to maximize their life and this around them maybe the kindness they showed other people is what we will search for in others and that will be their legacy that lives on after them the setting descriptions are amazing and make you feel as though you are right there as characters navigate land mines strewn throughout the country side and determining who to trust as we venture through the book and we get to know each character what was cool is how each character is interconnected to the others and you don't realize it until late int he book","2528":"beautiful story of love friendship and family and perhaps more importantly how those themes so not always go hand in hand","2529":"disturbing portrayal of life in chechnya drags a bit in the middle but worth struggling through","2530":"i really liked it but it was sad","2531":"a constellation of vital phenomena is a book i wanted to love but in the end left me wanting it is no easy task marra set for himself being a westerner and writing about a muslim former soviet republic but the research was clearly there and that showed through in the writing the surgery scenes were particularly well done the characters on the whole are believable even endearing especially the girl havaa though there were a few instances in which the motivations or actions seemed out of sync with the whole the prose is simple un flowery but effective like the bleak and snowy landscape of war torn chechnya where the book seemed to fall short was in pacing and some of the contrived coincidences of the plot at times the narrative lagged and the thrust of the book seemed to be bogged down in snow that being said marra is certainly a writer to watch and i have no doubt his best is yet to come","2532":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a difficult book by difficult i don't mean it's joycean although it is non linear and fairly experimental rather it's hard to read because the characters have to deal with a relentless barrage of suffering the things that make it a darkly enchanting book to read are also those that make it difficult to review it jumps back and forth in time meaning that some pieces of the story don't get resolved until much later it centers around a group of characters all of which the reader comes to know well but none of which can be called a protagonist mostly though it's a slice of life and a sad one this slice is a burnt piece of toast with no butter to spread on it shared by too many people who have been hungry for too long i don't know why but i can only speak in metaphors today so here's one more to me the book felt like a figure skater's spin it starts slowly with a wind up that's full of the anticipation of motion then slowly begins to be build speed once the skater starts to pull her arms in the spin goes faster and faster it sometimes appears to stop but a position change adds more energy faster and faster pulling more and more until it ends with a brief flourish it's a common misconception that skaters don't get dizzy when they spin but they do they can't spot like ballerina dancers on a low friction surface they simply go too fast to do anything other than give into the spin they get dizzy but they just get used to it am i selling the book well i hope so it's worth reading both for the beautiful writing and also because getting dizzy provides a wonderful reminder of how good it feels to be still","2533":"it's good but not really my kind of book","2534":"for me it's main and perhaps sole drawback is that it takes too long to get interesting page 150 which is almost half of the novel","2535":"this is a fabulous book of family of war of circumstance and healing amidst the wars of chechnya several family's lives are permanently woven together by circumstances beyond their control although many are tortured and die the final redemption comes in the life of a child upon whom all the other lives revolve i would highly recommend this story","2536":"i enjoyed this book and have a greater appreciation for the chechnya experience which probably speaks as well to other experiences under soviet rule at times the book jumped around too much for me or had toomany tangents but overall it was a good book","2537":"took some time to get into it and sometimes it was confusing because it jumped around so much but stick with it because the way it all comes together is powerful and moving the depiction of war torn chechnya was gruesome and helped me appreciate better the sufferings of the people and the brutality of some excellent read","2538":"incredible one of the best novels i've read in a long time","2539":"this book definitely won't be for everyone especially because it jumps around in time a lot but i absolutely loved it and it kept me engaged until the very last page","2540":"this was a tough read for me but in the end i decided the story was moving enough for me to forgive anthony marra for some of his more indulgent passages the middle of the book does seem to drag on and marra likes to use long run on sentences as a literary tool on for which i do not care and at this point i was all about to give up on the book but i pushed through and was very satisfied with the ending i would say this book requires commitment and focus and i think i might like it more upon a second reading but the story is rich as are the characters and that is the reason i gave it 4 stars","2541":"a beautifully written book the character development was perfect and the confluence of two wars multiple religions and cultures in a place where no societal rules really apply brought a point to the fact that civilization is a very fragile thing worth protecting even with your life","2542":"a really phenomenal book superbly written this book really brought to life things that had only been at the peripheral of my memory i learned a great deal even though the subject matter could be tough to take an incredible read i would highly recommend","2543":"i'm about halfway through this book i'm usually a fast reader but i'm forcing myself to slow down it is brilliant and it is heartbreaking and i don't want to leave these pages and these characters now i'm finished and this is one of the best books i've read in years gorgeous writing that offers a close up view of the worst and best in ourselves it's brutal and it's dark and it's frightening but i believed every word i'm still there","2544":"a beautiful terribly painful book","2545":"best book i have read so far this year","2546":"compelling story and a good read but the author does not make the reader work very hard interconnection between characters and events are nicely tightly packaged and delivered to the reader in an almost obvious way","2547":"terrific book best i have read in years i need to read it at least 2 more times to take it in fully","2548":"heartbreaking wonderful beautiful i finished it in the bathtub","2549":"don't be put off by the subject matter an amazing moving first book by this author","2550":"not a light read but well done","2551":" i actually put this book down for awhile because i was bored i thought it was a case of right book wrong time so after reading a few lighter things i picked it up again and i am so glad that i did the writing is excellent while i don't know much about that part of the world or the chechan war marra has a way of storytelling that simply weaves the characters in and around each other as the reader we know so much more than the characters and that is what makes it so good it's a heavy read hence my 4 vs 5 stars but well worth it","2552":" this is one of the greatest book i've read so far in my life it took about 160 pages before i got immensely invested in the story and it sure as hell was worth it wow i don't even have words to conjure up and describe the gem that this book is i recommend this to anyone and everyone if you ever have the chance and come across marra's well executed novel of interconnected lives read it life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irratibility movement growth reproduction adaptation","2553":"this is not a feel good novel so if you are not ready for tragedy and pain you might want to skip over it not that you wouldn't be well rewarded if you stayed the course but it will leave a lot of sadness as you unravel the connections among a group of chechens during the second war for independence an amazing book for a first novel","2554":"i finished this book days ago and can't stop thinking about it it is brilliantly written beautiful language that you will want to linger over of my favorite books of 2013 all of the characters are fully realized where the reader has insight and understanding of their motivations aside the tragedy of both chechnen wars the author gives the reader glimpses into future to inject bits of hope for the characters giving us an understanding of phenomena that are vital for life to exist","2555":"truly astonishing set in modern day chechnya this novel portrays the poverty and terror of war more vividly through the lives and memories of seven main characters this amazing novel offers hope that that love grace and forgiveness can survive the writing is so breathtaking that i stopped multiple times to read sentences and paragraphs over and over the last two chapters will break your heart","2556":"a constellation of vital phenomena begins in a small war torn village in chechnya in 2004 eight year old havaa has been left alone following her father's capture by russian forces her neighbor akhmed takes her to the town's shell of a hospital where he makes an agreement with the remaining doctor sonja to help him care for havaa the novel weaves back to 1994 to trace the roots of the chechen wars and the personal histories of its characters which wind up being more connected than they realize anthony marra's prose stunned me from the first sentence and it didn't let go with perfect balance he is able to create an incredible picture of a place very few readers are familiar with while also finding specific unique voices for each of his characters from the start i was struck by havaa's snappy wit and bold charm in the face of an impossible situation her attitude quickly made her one of my favorite characters of the year following the introduction of his characters marra follows them back to different points in the chechen wars from 1994 2004 rather than feeling disjointed it reads like a fluid journey that slowly reveals the binding eventually heartbreaking threads between each of the novel's characters a constellation of vital phenomena is a gorgeous debut revolving around a modern war that is written like a sweeping historical classic if this is anthony marra's starting point it's hard to imagine how far he will go","2557":"though using a similar episodic narrative that moves back and forth in time this novel set in chechnya is much better than the widely lauded and the mountains echoed by khaled hosseini","2558":"the sad story of checknen wartime yet another volume highlighting the trauma of war and the disparity of well being from one country to another some beautiful descriptive passages","2559":"interesting story i agree that the first half jumps around and takes awhile to get the characters straight the second half pulls it all together conveys the scarcity of chechnia and survival","2560":"i really loved this book it was heart wrenching to be immersed in the chechen russian conflict and its impact on the beautifully rendered characters in marra's novel in such a deeply descriptive way but it was worth it the closing chapters of the book may be a few of my favorites of all time","2561":"all in all a fantastic read with a gripping plot and a lot of important historical information for someone like myself with little familiarity with the region not sure what else to say at times the compelling plot overshadowed the character development a bit and that was exacerbating by shifting from one character to the next pretty quickly i wouldn't have minded getting more into the heads and hearts of all of the characters especially the lead women definitely worth a read","2562":" i finished this a few months ago so these comments are general impressions the ending of this book made it worth the time i spent on it it was sad moving and hopeful actually stunningly so especially reading it as a parent i won't forget it for a long time it reminded me a little bit of the ending of amy bloom's away most of the book however was a bit of a slog for me while i admired some very beautiful passages reflecting on death family and life i kept losing track of who was who and what time period the author was talking about maybe i wasn't in the right state of mind or maybe it needed to be read in fewer sittings this took me a long time because life interfered with reading time","2563":"an amazing new novel by a new fave author the most beautiful poetic interesting writing i've read in a long time i'm a slow kindle reader and would rather turn real pages so took my time war novels can be painful to read and this is definitely not an easy quick read however while heartbreaking it's also one of the most compassionate life affirming novel i have read the chechnyan setting and history was fascinating loved it","2564":"i'm probably in the minority here with this book but i just didn't love it it was really hard for me to remember people and details that were important later on in the book it was hard to follow when the story shifted back and forth in years i found myself skimming pages and also felt like important moments would just happen like any other part of the story instead of being built up slowly to be enjoyed or mourned disappointed in this one","2565":"brilliant and heartbreaking i loved this book i can't believe this is the author's first novel","2566":"a perfect impersonation of a book","2567":"what a beautiful book about a terrible subject the setting and the characters really come alive by the end and i loved the way the author pieced all the lives i'd come to care about together by the end very powerful i listened to the audio for the first 1 4 of the book and found it helped me with keeping names and characters straight and then i enjoyed reading the text for the beautiful writing","2568":" this was one that i had to work at i got really frustrated in the beginning of the book and almost gave up about halfway through there was just lots of skipping around and the characters were hard to kept track of and the sentences seemed long and rambling i'm nit exaggerating when i say there was a sentence that was a page and a half long but then somehow it clicked and it was great i learned more about a war that i basically had no clue about and loved his contrasting visions of love and loyalty worth the effort","2569":"brutal stark powerful there's not much more i can say about this book but it sticks with you after you're finished parts were painful to read but i feel like they were important to read i really enjoyed this one","2570":"such a good book the second read just deepened my respect for the story and the details see my first review for a much longer review","2571":"the war in chechnya but more a window into how people survive or don't brutal and capricious governments heartbreaking and beautiful my book club just read it we had a great discussion and we all thought it a deep beautifully written book","2572":"i had a hard time getting into this book but i am glad i stuck with it the author does a masterful job writing about five peoples lives that have come apart after a decade of war in chechnya although brutal in parts but war is brutal he writes using a 'dark sense of humor' to flesh out his characters and this helped me to understand the conflict and turmoil that these characters faced during a difficult time","2573":" a very sad book as we ate lunch together this memorial day i thanked god that we live here in america though far from perfect there are so many far worse places that one could be this is a story about people whose stories are linked in 'coincidental' ways amidst the horrors of life in a village in modern chechnya some are brave the father returned from torture with no fingers the doctor who labors to help others in almost impossible conditions some are cowards the son who betrays his father and his community by turning informer at the center is a little girl who holds all the stories together and provides the only hope offered in this bleak landscape hard to read i know this one will linger in my mind and heart provoking guilt for my lack of awareness and concern for those suffering around the world","2574":" this book is very complex and did remind me of jonathan franzen which is why i picked it up plus the title sounded cool the story is about russia and has a lot of layers really well written would make a good book club book for clubs that like complex complicated story lines that are pretty meaty because it is about wartime and i am not familiar with the recent russian conflicts i found that part pretty hard to digest not a beach read but i would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a book that is not cookie cutter that really looks at human relationships in very difficult situations","2575":" for more of my reviews visit http onthesamepagebookreviews blogs i'm rarely stumped for words but this book leaves me practically speechless i'll do my best but i forewarn you i didn't understand didn't want to understand or didn't care about three quarters of this book what initially piqued my interest in this story was the setting of chechnya and the mentioning of little eight year old havaa hiding in the woods at night as russian soldiers snatched her father and set her home ablaze after this initial scene my interest quickly waned it's easier to mention what i liked about this book otherwise this review would be rather lengthy * i like the story has a unique setting chechnya * i like little havaa's straightforwardness and the mystery that centers on her blue suitcase of souvenirs * i like that i completed the book resisting the urge to stop reading after nearly every chapter just to touch on a few of the many things i didn't like was the omniscient pov how havaa nearly disappeared throughout much of the story the nonlinear timeline constant head hopping of characters lengthy sentences and paragraphs cursing the constant depressing images of rapes killings tortures drug use prostitution and the sarcasm hatred and negativity i realize this takes place during wartime but i'd like to have had a break however small from the depressing and pessimistic outlook from every single character the darkness was overkill and despite the tragedies i failed to sympathize with most of the characters i tolerated the second half of this book better than the first but that's not saying much i feel the need to purge my body of the dirty nasty reprehensible mental images i ingested harsh but true i did not enjoy this read i did not enjoy the author's writing style i did enjoy putting this book in my donation bag i'm certain somebody out there will appreciate the author's vision and hard work publisher hogarthpage count 418disclosure of material connection in accordance with the federal trade commission's 16 cfr part 255 blogging for books has provided me a copy of this book in exchange for a review","2576":" an amazing book beautifully written full of nuanced and well drawn characters don't be intimidated if you don't know much about the chechen wars the book will provide you with the factual information you need the history is seamlessly integrated into the narrative without ever seeming clumsy or like an info dump the characters are so rich and complex and real this book is gut wrenching and unputdownable it perfectly captures universal truths about humanity as it also perfectly evokes a specific time and place one of the very best books i have read over the last few years","2577":"it took me 100 pages to get into this book but then i could not put it down it is heartbreaking at times yet full of hope in unexpected ways very well written with a great combination of historical context and individual journeys","2578":"fantastic writing but i found the storytelling aspect to be confusing creating choppiness in the story","2579":"excellent writing and a good look at the impact of the chechen russian conflict on the civilian population","2580":" this was beautifully written a book i couldn't stop reading once i finally committed it's about the horror visited upon everyone by war and i wasn't sure i wanted to read something so dark but the beauty of the prose pulled me in i also really appreciated how the author would toss in asides about minor characters letting you know for example that a woman in the hospital will bear four children and die and old woman in prague which kept me going knowing that despite the horror i was witnessing there would be survivors","2581":"i found these characters and this book very well written and interesting amazing to me that an author from usa could understand so well the layers of village life and life during war in chechnya some elements were not as well explored but that allowed for a faster pacing and a facility that could easily have been lost if this book had become more didactic or thorough","2582":"how did he make this book seem so effortless great writing it flowed really well","2583":"a very moving book","2584":"very touching story about surviving in war torn chechnya heartbreaking and difficult to put down","2585":"this is a very great book marra is one to watch as he already writes with the style and composure of a veteran novelist with many books to his credit he spins gold from the darkest human experience the result is transcendent","2586":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book but i am having war novel fatigue as i look at the pile next to my bed i realize i need some different subject matter for my next few books i knew very little about chechnya before reading this book i still don't know much but a novel is always the best way to learn about other cultures","2587":"read this novel after and the mountains echoed war in afghanistan war in chechnya i don't want to study war no more nonetheless well written and engaging the characters drew me into the story found myself caring about what happened to them","2588":"a deep and moving novel of the wars between chechnya and the russian federation marra brings to his readers the cruelty of war along side the need to be accepted and loved his descriptions of a war torn chechnya are clear and well written the reader cannot help but feel part of the pain and hopelessness along side of his characters i recommend for fans of khalid hosseini","2589":" spectacular writing ingenious story telling brilliant imagery this novel would be on my short list of best books i have read amazingly anthony marra has somehow been able to blend humor into the horror of everyday life in chechnya during the two recent wars i was blown away by his ideas and had to stop on almost every page to savor a sentence or phrase or simile here's an example akim had survived the night but died the next morning akhmed said that those hours were a gift she'd given akim that time became more important the closer to death one was so an extra few hours to make peace with the world were worth more than years though how he could have made peace while screaming she didn't know","2590":" at first i was so engaged by this story set in chechnya during the second war there in the early 2000's it involved a young girl whose father was disappeared and a neighbor who took her to a hospital with an impressive female doctor who he hoped might protect her however when the book to a graphic turn toward describing in excruciating detail the methods interrogators including shoving a live black eel up a man's anus i had to abandon the effort i was at 68% according to my kindle too bad since i would've liked to know what happened to the girl but the knowledge isn't worth nightmares yet another book making me glad that my russian grandfather knew to get the hell out of dodge","2591":"over a span of 5 days marra takes the reader on a journey through the lives and history of members of a village in chechnya a london trained doctor desperately searching for her sister another doctor who acts as a caregiver for his terminally ill wife a father who opens his home to refugees and his young daughter who quickly becomes orphaned and a strained relationship between a former soviet soldier and his informant son their lives and stories represent the struggle for peace stability and finding love and contentment it's a poignant sad and very engaging story all at the same time about a war and unique part of the world","2592":"i was hoping there would be some silver lining to all of the war atrocities and awful human behavior but the book ended and i thought that's it ugh it's still a 3 because the author's writing style along a moving timeline and the historical background of the 2 wars in chechnya are interesting","2593":"humans at their most vulnerable survival the war torn country of chechnya is portrayed thru its people hard ti imagine the atrocities they have gone through only a timeline of five days but packed with emotion drawing from real facts marra presents the history and day to day life of this war torn country","2594":"it is hard to believe that this is marra's first novel there are strong characters whose lives become intertwined as the novel progresses marra makes the setting of war torn chechnya come alive i did find the jumping back and forth in time 2004 to 1995 to 2003 than back to 2004 confusing so i was glad to be reading an actual book no spoilers here but i did like the way marra narrates all the charcters' ultimate endings","2595":"simply amazing a heartbreaking story of contradictions life and loss humanity and inhumanity love and hatred and how everything is connected","2596":"exquisite writing i did not know much about chechnya but the book not only brought so much insight into the history and current events in chechnya but also more broadly about human love tragedy and resilience","2597":"so very beautifully written hard to believe it is his first novel","2598":"beautiful writing characters and story will stay with you long after reading i will re read","2599":"i didn't think it possible by the end of the book i felt for ramzan as i did the rest","2600":"wow what an amazing book it is now in my top 5 favorite books","2601":"brutal and beautiful","2602":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a powerful and painful read there were several times when the unrelenting horrors of this novel caused me to set it aside because i needed distance i have had a similar experience with other books like night the color purple and the kite runner it was a rough read this author anthony marra is skilled he weaves the physical horrors of war with emotional and spiritual devastation for a lethal combination self destruction or the loss of one's soul how much worse can it get marra ends the novel with a thin thread of hope i will be processing this book for awhile gifted writer","2603":"yet another one that i had to return before i finished i couldn't justify the $3 dollars it had already cost me but i will pick it up again soon and update the review when i do finish it i was loving the book before i put it down","2604":"the author has very impressive writing skills and the book began well as it starts with an interesting storyline and the unusual setting of chechnya but for me it ran out of momentum and was progressively less interesting the longer it went on despite the well structured narratives throughout i felt like i was crawling across the finish line by the end of the book","2605":"the washington post reviewer said at the end read this book so i did and i am totally blown away amazing writing so human story and when have you read a novel taking place in chechnya","2606":" i loved the first 100 pages or so and i loved the ending the middle had too much backstory for me so it loses a star fantastic audio performance as well but i dare you to read this book and not be moved you'd have to have the heart of a stone i also loved the characters particularly the young girl havaa who will grab your heart right from the start the writing and the characterization here are top notch but i think i'd have got a lot more out of this if i had more of a historical background period but particularly in russia there's lots of figurative language here which called the book thief to mind many times although marra's use didn't feel as prevalent as zusak's and i can't believe the author is apparently in his late twenties no one reading this would ever guess that because there is wisdom here earned wisdom and a profound understanding of despair and suffering that in my opinion come from experiencing more than one's fair share of both this is a book of the ravages of war and it's not a stroll through the daffodils but if you read it you won't be sorry","2607":" like a knitter marra has woven a story of chechnian history filled with everything i love about a good novel love hate betrayal war family a constellation of vital phenomena has it all if you want to understand more about the u s s r oil reserves and chechnya this is the book to read but make no mistake it is a powerful story in it's own right whoever came upon this house next would find fallout chaos and would not see the way akhmed had lived a stranger a refugee would discover this place and never the man and woman it had belonged to","2608":" 5 stars i have to gather my thoughts u0026amp let them settle u0026amp then i will write a review for this book... i would not typically be interested in reading a book such as this... i know next to nothing about russian or chechnyan history i was afraid that my lack of knowledge on this subject would keep me from being interested after reading this book i still have no idea what was going on as far as the war u0026amp the continuing troubles...but i can feel something for the people put a name to the face i guess this is a the story about a hand full of people over the course of 5 days each chapter is dated by year so the entire story goes back about ten years none of it was easy to read none of it was pretty but the writing was beautiful i had a hard time at first getting the rhythm of the author's style the going back u0026amp forth wasn't difficult once i made sure i knew where we were in each chapter i am amazed at what people will do in the time of war what people will do to survive u0026amp how there can still be love u0026amp respect u0026amp caring... several parts will stay with me forever... not only graphic in some parts but so visual the village in ruins u0026amp the lack of water food electricity i could see it all... not a book i would care to see as a movie...","2609":"surprisingly beautiful and poignant for a debut i was wrapped in this world and these characters and i didn't want to let go","2610":" i just finished this book and can still hardly breathe wow it was quite an experience to read it right after reading and the mountains echoed because the 2 plots are structured similarly like hosseini's book a constellation centers on a pivotal heartbreaking event then winds through the lives of the people connected to it showing what led up to the event and what came after and how each character was linked to it the writing is subtle in how it gives plot information and sometimes is almost stream of consciousness some sentences going on for a page and a half and you forget to breathe as you follow it i especially loved how the author tells me the reader what is going to happen to this character in the future which is so often what i want to know in a book these snippets of info are given in between the main happenings side by side here is one of my favorite quotes i could list many perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written for their entire lives even before they met your mother and father held their love for you inside their hearts like an acorn holds an oak tree you were their rain and sun their morning and night this is marra's first book and i really hope it is not his last","2611":"amazing to think that this was the marra's first novel beautifully written hauntingly sad and truly a pleasure to read i loved every moment of this book","2612":"great storytelling the setting is bleak but there is hope and acts of kindness to temper it","2613":" something about russia maybe it's me but i find the hopeless hopefulness the comic tragedy and the bittersweet relentlessness of russian characters' lives pick a time in history any time in history both fascinating and real by real i mean when written well as with this novel a book set in russia often has characters who experience life at its extremes so different from many contemporary western books where character concerns seem hollow and trivial petty and vain familiar and tiresome similar to david benioff's city of thieves in sweep and tone only more rich in characters this book takes us to wartime russia only not world war ii but the war in chechnya it may seem modern to many readers but the struggle between chechnyan rebels and russian feds goes all the way to tolstoy's time in fact tolstoy mined it for many of his early short stories including hadji murat mentioned in this text what makes me proudest about this book is its refusal to cast characters in black and white even the informer whom you expect to be a hollywood villain truth is i can even feel a mote of sympathy for him so convoluted are the personal moral and ethical threads in this book and what powerful women characters sonja running the shell of a hospital as the only doctor her complicated sister natasha and a story that takes the entire book to unfold its secrets deshi the crusty but darkly humorous assistant at the hospital a town away the small time we have big dream lives of dokka and his daughter havaa the war veteran khassan and his son ramzan and the neighbor akhmed who scoops havaa up and hides her in the hospital once the feds show up and abduct her father strong strong character book with some solid writing too no it's not a book to break out into zhivago like asides with description but author marra nonetheless crafts some real writer's writer sentences along the way good for plot lovers and character fanatics history lovers and contemporary fans men and women readers a constellation of vital phenomena a title that's circled in red in a book in this book as you'll see should be circled in red on your to read list no matter what country you live in","2614":"incredible one of the most beautifully written stories i've ever read","2615":" there are very few books that i take the time to read twice i was so enthralled by a constellation of vital phenomena that after i finished it and read american sniper i went back and read constellation again it is the story of the chechen war but more it is the story of the akhmed sonja and havaa and their struggle to survive the war havaa is an 8 year old girl whose father has been disappeared and akhmed the neighbor and family friend is looking after havaa trying to keep her from being disappeared too sonja is the local hospital director who helps akhmed and havaa there are lots of flashbacks that make the story flow and mesh everyones lives together the writing is fantastic some language best book i have read in a while","2616":"challenging and sometimes painful to read but definitely worth the effort a story about humanity and inhumanity the characters come to life in an unforgettable way","2617":"my favorite book of the year the beginning was slow for me but have faith this book is worth reading and rereading","2618":"anthony marra's first novel is not to be missed steeped with humanity soul and with great generosity toward each of his characters the author finds something to love as well as frailties in each of his well drawn characters such insight and a real belief of the power to triumph shines through though one may not be drawn to a war torn culture and the history of chechnya much of the same could have been said about the setting for the kite runner it is a gorgeous story of humanity reminds me of ann patchett in this way set in a troubling and tragic context i loved the writing but i also learned a great deal as well about chechnya and its history","2619":"a constellation of vital phenomena is mostly sad occasionally uplifting and well written novel","2620":"just not compelling enough to keep going","2621":"haunting and very daunting trying to compose an illuminating review twelve months down the track my memory fails me so i'm going with gut feeling here so my quick summary is ordinary people can become quite extraordinary despite their foibles and follies apart from that i'm really rather shamelessly fond of its title january 2014 kindle on ipad $10 99","2622":" what is a constellation of vital phenomena according to anthony marra's character in his new novel of the same name it is an \"organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" all words that conform to a remarkable set of individuals set in chechnya from 1994 through 2004 a period of rebellion and warfare on the part of the chechen people against the now truncated russian empire a constellation of vital phenomena is marra's first novel and he has produced a marvelous book that carries the reader on an emotional roller coaster as each character is carefully crafted as the narrative unfolds the story immerses the reader in the chechen civil war as the chechen people jealous of other former soviet republics that have gained their independence fight for their own following collapse of the soviet empire by 1994 the fictional characters are improbable recreations who perhaps on a more psychological level than one might expect try to navigate the psychic and physical minefield that their lives evolve into the narrative brings together muslim rebels russian federal troops and a remarkable cast of characters centered in the village of volchansk's hospital no 6 as one begins reading the works of alexander solzhenitsyn come to mind the soviet gulag appears in part as the landfill that brings about the death of so many chechens and other nationalities who are in the wrong place at the wrong time the character of khassan emerges as the institutional memory of the chechen people a historian who tries to write a complete history of chechnya is thwarted repeatedly as he must past the muster of several editors as soviet history evolves through the 1970s to the 1990s through the travails of khassan we peer into the inner workings of soviet publishing as there is little consistency as to what can be read by the public as each general secretary dies from brezhnev through chernenko the editors keep altering their standards pertaining to how conservative or liberal the prevailing winds of change might be once the berlin wall comes down khassan refuses to publish until chechnya's battle for sovereignty is included for khassan who eventually publishes part of his work \"everything did change faster than his fingers could type \" 80 khassan uses his writing as a means of escapism from a dysfunctional family torn apart by the chechen wars as he interacts with the other characters in the story marra creates numerous relationships and themes for the reader to think about obviously wars cruelty is paramount but within the context of never ending war the relationship between father and son is explored in all its dimensions khassan's son becomes an informer resulting in the shunning of the family by the rest of the village this creates a crisis his father must learn to cope with the dichotomy between childhood and adulthood is seen as one relating to wisdom trying to determine which has more despite the age differential the relationship between sisters one a successful surgeon and another tries to find herself as she emerges from drug addiction slave prostitution and battles other demons the friendship between two men who love the same woman and the daughter that is born from this triangle leads the reader on a journey as the characters try and understand their feelings and what they have become finally the relationship between a man and a woman reflected in a number of emotional unions that transverse the novel will finally become clear at the end of the narrative the fragility of life and the inevitability of death permeate each page as the different characters try to relieve the suffering of others marra produces scenes that only make the reader wonder if anything can be done to offset the misery that is chechnya as the characters seem to hang on to life by a thread even sonja the stoic hospital surgeon and ahmed the \"pseudo doctor\" come together in a relationship that was difficult to fore see or how natasha sonja's sister tries to cope with life's inadequacies as she struggles to survive her situation there are many other examples throughout the book that reinforces this theme and it is to marra's credit that he weaves them throughout a somewhat confusing chronology that once the reader adapts to enhance the narrative as a whole a constellation of vital phenomena is an exceptional work detailing the travails of war and how people try and adapt and overcome the topic here is the chechen civil war but it could be any other violent strife that seems to burden the world each day for a first novel this book reflects mastery of language and character development integrated into an accurate historical setting further the author applies sarcastic humor that tries to humanize the experiences that his characters are faced with i would conjecture that once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down","2623":" i'm kind of sad that i experienced a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra through an audiobook rather than reading it it's set in a village in chechnya during the war in 2004 it's centered around the lives of akhmed an unskilled doctor havaa the 8 year old daughter of a friend he rescued and sonja the surgeon running the area hospital this story was rich with details and i think i could have loved it had i read it instead of listened to it i think the visual of seeing and reading the words would have made it easier for me to follow the lives of the characters were so layered and intertwined and it was often very heartbreaking i just think i would have been more engrossed had i read it","2624":"if you're one of those readers who likes to read award winners a reader who reads all the books on the best of lists at the end of the year a member of a book club that will likely read this book in the distant future or just someone who wants to read great fiction before anyone else knows about it a constellation of vital phenomena is the perfect choice no words are wasted in anthony marra's debut novel about chechnya the plot is woven very intricately every loose strand is tied before the book reaches its conclusion and what a beautiful tapestry it is it's lyrical and affecting intelligent but never boring the scenery and characters come alive marra does a fabulous job of crafting a moving novel without becoming overly sentimental in short i cannot praise this book enough a constellation is the sort of book that will likely fill a significant place on your bookshelf but leave a hole in your understanding of the world it will likely send you to wikipedia or your local library searching for information regarding chechnya do yourself a favor do the research and get the book now before everyone else has that way come september when one of your co workers says \"oh my god you should so read this book about chechnya \" you can stick your nose in the error correct your co workers mispronunciation and tell her all about it","2625":" adjectives that come to mind for this book bleak desolate and dreary yes i knew it was about the chechen wars so didn't expect a fun filled comedy but wow this was just page after page of dreariness i had read many glowing reviews of this so i was disappointed not to enjoy it as much as many others apparently did i'd pick this up read a few chapters put it aside and read something else then pick it back up again and struggle through a few more chapters the story is set in a small village in chechnya during a 10 year period between 1994 and 2004 the timing changes goes back and forth in time and each chapter focuses on one of a small set of characters the pace picks up in the last quarter of the book which was the most interesting part of the book","2626":"i was reluctant to read this not drawn to a book about the chechen wars and at first i was a bit lost by the travels back and forth in time but i was richly rewarded for persevering the story is woven elegantly across time and place braiding coincidences until they give meaning to cruel and random actions this book could almost make me religious","2627":"anthony marra sets his wartime story about ordinary people trying to overcome the devastation to their homes and lives in the russian republic of chechnya marra picks a few atrocities to center on and brings them down to the personal and therefore universal level you may find yourself asking questions about life what if i lived in a small town that was continually overrun by an enemy what if i were always waiting for the knock on the door that means i will be dragged away and tortured what if i didn't know where any of my family members were and if they were alive or dead through various characters' contexts marra demonstrates what war does to people there are sharp contrasts we see humanity at its least and most humane we see regrets and sense of honor there is love a child for her disappeared father a russian nurse for her stolen sister a man for his dogs and a village doctor for his peaceable but demented wife marra has a knack for bringing the inconceivable to your emotional doorstep but there are so many uplifting moments in this book that sustain the reader through the dark and that i believe is how helpless civilians get through wars moments of intimacy tenderness forgiveness and creativity steady these characters cruelty is cruelty but humans are wider than its effects this is marra's debut novel author ann patchett wrote on the back if this is where anthony marra begins his career i can't imagine how far he will go","2628":"exquisitely written and hauntingly beautiful novel about chechnya","2629":"this book was phenomenal and the first i've given five stars to in a while marra masterfully constructs beautiful syntax and characters who are connected in ways they don't know i like that the focus wasn't on the political details of the war but on the ongoing lives of the characters the themes of war siblings and medicine remind me of cutting for stone","2630":" i wish they had a 3 5 rating or a 3 8 rating this book is better than 3 but i certainly wasn't enthralled the writing is fantastic the use of language and manipulation of past and present stories is excellent what left me unenthused was not the characters beautifully developed and complex but the context of story itself the neverending wars in chechnya and the brutal impact on every innocent citizen just trying to survive is overwhelmingly depressing sorry but there is no happy ending i'm glad i read it and i learned a lot but this one definitely needs a follow up that is a bit lighter","2631":"a sophisticated wonderfully imagined and intellectually fulfilling novel powerful and brilliant set in war torn chechnyan as a little girl is saved from being disappeared by the feds in the hospital it saves the surgeon from her own loss of her sister by saving another she is saved philosophical and moving emotionally this novel is without question one of the best contemporary novels i have read in a decade it is a masterpiece","2632":"judging by the other reviews people loved this book but it never fully grabbed me it actually felt like a chore to finish most of the characters didn't seemed fully formed to me if you have an interest in chechnya i'd recommend this","2633":" havaa focused on her fingernails she wanted to speak but didn't wanted to flee but couldn't ~quote from a constellation of vital phenomenathe quote above pretty much sums up the way i feel about this book i wanted to flee after the every chapter i wanted to like the book wished to give it rave reviews wanted to find a reason to go on reading the only reason i continued was hope hope it would redeem itself hope i would connect to the characters i lost hope halfway through it was like watching a movie then wondering why i stayed to the end i don't understand why this book is on the bestseller list i've never given this low of a rating ever however i received this book in exchange for an honest review and honest you will get now the book has great prose wonderful metaphors and intensive research that is the positive aspects of a constellation of vital phenomena unfortunately the book head hopped constantly causing me to pull out of the story scavenge through pages to figure out what point of view the author switched to again there were no scene breaks no warning at all that the reader needed to hop into yet another character's point of view omniscient point of view or not this is no excuse to bounce around like an out of control super ball the non linear timeline throughout the book is just as jolting i would've put this book down by the third chapter had i not agreed to write a review so i plodded through there were parts that were so unbelievable that i laughed out loud for example a blind man guards a door a deaf child as his assistant the deaf child pulls on the blind man's finger to signal when to let people in to see an underworld criminal seriously the blurb is misleading i wanted to read this book because of haava who if one were to believe the blurb is the main character the first chapter introduced haava and then the character was forgotten she disappeared for chapters on end on a positive note--and it's hard to find a positive--the author slaved through this book he did his research for that i give him credit i'm very disappointed the only things i enjoyed about a constellation of vital phenomena were the first chapter and reaching the last page drawing a breath of relief that i was done finally i can't recommend this book i will avoid reading books by this author in the future disclosure of material connection in accordance with the federal trade commission's 16 cfr part 255 blogging for books has provided me a copy of this book in exchange for a review less","2634":"absolutely stunning book i laughed and cried wonderful writing great descriptions haunting story a must read","2635":"a detail three wishes from the moba surgeon stuck in rural

time","2636":" the best part about this book was not the plot or the characters but the words the words and the way they were stitched together were often captivating moving and beautiful there were also however times when the words were too good and the story suffered from too long too sentimental sentences or at least too many such long sentimental sentences in a row i came into this book not knowing anything really of the chechnyan wars this book did little in informing me of the big picture the backstory of the conflict the important battles or strategies or dates the things one might learn in a history class bit it did present me with a great feeling of what it might have felt to live as a citizen in that region while the wars were going on the minutiae of everyday life trying to keep a semblance of normalcy despite the disappearance of neighbors and the size of the guns carried by guards stationed along the street and the distant sounds of warfare a constellation of vital phenomena shows us the best and worst of humanity though most often by letting us glimpse into a character's thoughts and motivations rather than in his or her actions and interactions with others it

matter when pounded against the anvil of history to live with dignity meant a premature death no life is a line hide spoiler","2637":"between 4 and 5 stars on this one i'm rounding down because it took a while for me to get into this novel but by the middle of the book i couldn't put it down set in chechnya between 1994 2004 though the main story is told over a five day period in 2004 it's a heartbreaking tale of loss and war there's no happy ending here the novel jumps around in time and in voice allowing us to see different events and perspectives from different characters marra also has a way of quickly letting us know what happens in the future so even minor characters or events take on a larger life than their role in this story would give them","2638":" i'm slightly ashamed to say i don't know very much about the two wars referenced in this book set in chechnya the book spans from the first war with the ussr to the second war with russia i'm not positive what either of these wars was about although it would deepend the reading experience i don't feel like i missed out on anything because the book focuses so closely on this small group of characters who are so isolated from the outside world they live in bombed out villages and towns harassed by both the rebels who are supposedly fighting for them and the federal army at any time anyone can be taken to the landfill where the feds torture citizens for information or sometimes just because the landfill is a kafka esque location in the physical map of the book as well as the mental space of the characters maybe 10 characters make up the bulk of the book which spans five days but jumps backwards in time to review how everyone became situated we find out through a russian medical dictionary that a constellation of vital phenomena is the definition of life which somehow endures in the midst of this madness however i see the constellation as the series of asides marra uses to tell us how major or minor characters will fare in the future one nameless soldier might pass through the main plotline for a paragraph but marra will tell us that in six and a quarter years this man will own a grocery store and be married with a child on the way marra throws out these facts like stars scattered across the novel and the future beyond the war beyond the immediate terrors becomes a constellation as a backdrop for the novel","2639":"finally finished it after nearly two months of savoring it but also avoiding it this book it should be illegal for the myriad of emotions it evokes i think if any other author had written it the sad parts wouldn't have been as sad but marra's way of writing god it hurts i can't recommend this book enough it's beautiful in its melancholy even if you're not a fan of stories set during war i don't know maybe i'm just at the perfect time of my life to be reading this book and that's why i love it so much either way i'm glad i came across it never has a book affected me this much and i don't think any others will come close","2640":"not sure the audio version does this book credit","2641":"one of the finest novels i've ever read inspiring shattering extraordinary anthony marra is a c r a z y talented writer how could this be his first novel","2642":"i was halfway through this book when saw it had been nominated for the national book award i hope it wins as the author is very talented this story is so awfully sad though and i had a hard time slogging through the first half of the book the timeline jumped back and forth erratically and i was challenged trying to remember enough from previous chapters to keep my narrative string going if he was attempting the disorientation of the time in his readership he succeeded completely but i felt very removed from his characters that changed dramatically and then i read straight through to the end i was glad to read the ending to learn how each character finalized but more ambiguity would have felt authentic to his story instead he wrote a poignant hallmark ending which rang somewhat false to me all three of the key moments could have been omitted with only a hint for what might have occurred and i would have been more satisfied but then it would be just another book and not nominated for an award that also nominated 3 other books i did not like pacific fools and the end of the point in fact the latter was so mediocre i returned it to the library after only 30 pages it suffered from my previous read of my education by susan choi but still was so mundane i had no tolerance for one more insipid page i thought the cover unappealing although not sure what would have succeeded for this story","2643":"a 2013 staff fiction favorite recommended by jo who calls it stunning and heartbreaking '' read her review here https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore of vital phenomena","2644":"very beautiful and sad story of intertwining lives during the fall of the soviet union and the aftermath in chechnya though it's fiction it seems well researched and has inspired me to read more about the u s s r","2645":"this was easily one of my favorite books of the year i became so attached to the characters and the way it came together at the end was just beautiful","2646":"it took a long time to get into this book once i did i loved it maybe if i knew more about the russian and checsen struggle it wouldn't have taken so long","2647":"best book i read this year could not put this down and stayed with me really interesting perspective on chechnya and amazing characters","2648":"i thought i'd like this better but didn't find it terribly compelling learning of the war in checnya and understanding the russian position was a great side benefit however","2649":"nothing to add to the many reviews don't understand why it didn't receive bigger awards it's better than the highly touted tiger's wife the shifts in time made it seem like a whirl much as war must feel and he did an interesting thing of giving even characters with a brief one time only appearance a few sentences of future like in 30 years she would it gave the book depth the villain is understandable but the humanity of the others is palpable and the ending made me cry not for soppy reasons and not because 2 main characters were in deep shit but because in the midst of that shit they could celebrate a life saved oh and the writing wasn't too shabby either","2650":"if you had told me that a book about the political unrest in chechnya would be one of my favorite reads of the year so far i would have laughed you off of goodreads but here it is and i loved it of course what this book is really about is the connection between people and how lives are so entwined together marra is just a beautiful writer his characters are so real i expect to be able to go visit them from akhmed the doctor who spent more time sneaking off to art classes and therefore isn't the most competent physician but shows more humanity and caring then should be possible to sonja the work aholic surgeon who forgets that her patients are hurting people not just bodies this is a book that shows that while some decisions are unthinkable especially during war love and kindness can rise to the top i dare you not to sob like a baby at the ending i sure did","2651":"after anthony marra finished his first draft of a constellation of vital phenomena he printed it out and started re typing the entire thing he did this after typing the second and third drafts too he typed this entire novel cover to cover four times in total to say he is worthy of all the awards he has received would be an understatement this is a beautiful potentially life changing novel well worded and exquisite throughout marra said his goal was to produce laughter and tears within the same page to an extent yes but don't go expecting rainbows kittens and butterflies this is chechnya circa 2004 people here are identified by which body parts are still intact if you have all ten of your fingers you are a rare and beautiful specimen the scene is grim but marra is right there's still plenty to smile about despite feeling third world the high value of an autograph of a formerly fat person soviet constructed toilet bowels covering unexploded bomb shells this novel paints a contrast with the mysterious modern world outside of their grasp is the president of america ronald mcdonald what is this amazon that underworld members can produce books from it may feel old but the real tragedy is the life altering wars that take place in our world today...so many ignored the stories tie together to paint the beauty of life and the importance of family the title is taken from one character's medical journal under the entry for \"life\" life is defined as \"a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" this is shown throughout marra's book the characters evolve with growth though their livelihoods are torn asunder their spirit holds fast to that which is most precious their hopes their futures and their family even the most apparently vial of characters has something to share though the flashbacks may at times seem irksome they are excellent tools that reveal some of the most surprising secrets and though not the most happy of endings again chechnya circa 2004 the way the author ties it all together is one of the most unique methods i've seen employed this is an emotionally moving masterpiece in the hands of a skilled author thanks to the folks at hogarth crown and random house for sending this book i received this book for free from blogging for books for this review here are a couple of interesting things from the publisher book excerpt http crownpublishing com feature ex press release http crownpublishing com wp content","2652":"a stunning novel that takes us into the world of five characters over the course of five days-with many dips back in time dealing with the war in chechnya the stunning prose combined with the loving development of these characters creates a novel that at times is very difficult to read war is not kind and at others times transcendent reflecting the power of the human spirit in the bleakest of times","2653":"the book requires a great deal of concentration to follow the different interlocking character threads but is tremendously impactful","2654":"five days in the lives of eight individuals in war torn chechnya beautifully written but heartbreaking","2655":"marra has the makings of a brilliant writer the book is sad but has moments that are incredibly touching and a few that are witty my only criticism is that the narrative jumps back and forth in time and is sometimes confusing","2656":"this book was beautifully written and i loved how the stories were interwoven though gut wrenchingly sad it's also about resilience and people making peace with their lives","2657":"so good and so so heartwrenching","2658":"intricate that is how anthony marra wove his story intricately delicately and beautifully the way everything and everyone came back full circle everything meant something i am in awe of how much i ended up caring","2659":"after about the first 10 pages of a constellation of vital phenomena i had to stop google map and wiki chechnya this book gave me a chechnyan history thanks to author anthony marra i think i read this book at the wrong time i just had a hard time dealing with the hardship of life for these people seriously aren't we blessed to live the way we do today","2660":"brilliant characters and a setting unlike any i've encountered or can properly imagine as a privileged 'murican war torn chechnya comes to life in this novel that spans generations in only five days","2661":"i was enthralled by the harsh foreign indignities of war that echoed through a battered and broken soviet republic that i previously knew very little about the dusty hungry lives lived among the treacherous minefields of daily life painted a bleak bullet ridden tribute to hope heartbreak and hardship the necessary arrangements made inside ones own thoughts and with others to eke out a livelihood live on indefinitely in memories dreams and an unwritten history of the magical earthly phenomena we all share","2662":"this book was tedious but one of the best books i've ever read very worth the effort","2663":"does it get any better than this thank you powell's for making this an indiespensible selection the book is so beautifully written i found myself reaching time and again for my pen and notebook to record the language it's rare that i so sympathize with characters in a book as i did in this one i want to share this book with my friends but i'm afraid to lose it so please go and buy a copy you won't regret it","2664":"for me it took a while to get into this a slow burner however a really wonderful story devastatingly painful very funny totally human","2665":"what a timely book as it gives insight to the russian soviet soviet satellites considering crimea problem and the boston marathon chechnyan ties this book gives deep insight to the big issues in that part of the world but it is not about the politics or the despots it is about the consequences that living in despotic warring societies has on regular people there is a real grandiosity besides the historical details it delivers a memorable tale that is revealing about the human condition at first i thought marra's clownish characters were a clumsy way for to gain the reader's interest as the book unfolds though it is exactly the clowning and peccadilloes that deliver the bang oh and the sacrifices so many of the characters make in the name of love stuff that dreams and nightmares are made of i seem to forget the details of a lot of what i read but akhmed will stick with me prediction borat will play akhmed in movie version and will win the oscar","2666":"wow such an amazing story","2667":"well for me this was one of the better books i have read the characters presented are compelling multiple point of view technique is interesting and in this case probably the only way to tell the story although the locale is certainly foreign to my experience the basic human desires exposed are not give this book a try i think you'll like it","2668":"disturbing yet powerful","2669":" there is so much to love about this book it made me learn a lot about russia chechnya and pushes for sovereignty after the fall of the ussr the olympics in sochi and conflicts in ukraine were made more meaningful because of what i learned while reading this book i am grateful for google maps and wikipedia pages and have a greater interest in ethnic groups throughout russia i loved the richness of each character and how my emotions and sympathies toward them changed as their stories and connections were revealed each character had gone through such profound trauma and though it was hard to read about some of it it created the space for understanding motives and providing redemption most of all i loved the writing i loved the subtle omnipotence of the narrator and the sprinkling of knowledge about what happened to someone seemingly unimportant years later or how people were connected the style of writing in and of itself produced a force of hopefulness in each character","2670":"this book is fantastic so sad and upsetting while also uplifting and challenging amazing that it never goes too far into sentimentality or cheap tear jerking earns it the whole way through read it","2671":" i remember catching scarce details about chechnya's black widows on the news in the early aughts i knew russia was brutalizing their tiny neighbor but i didn't realize the extent of damage that occurred to the country and people marra communicates the devastation thoroughly and without reservation through our three main characters the reader is exposed to the detailed horror of the war crimes that took place over the course of ten years this is marra's first novel and although it has moments of lucidity and insight i found that the tone is uneven and brackish the circles of life and coincidences come across clumsily and lack the true ring of epiphany i do however recommend this book to anyone interested in the depths of human endurance in a time of lawlessness and war or the effects of torture and coercion on communities that have no power to stop it","2672":"very well written but i just didn't care that much about the characters the history aspect bogged me down a bit it's important to the story of course but was just a little dry the last 50 pages or so were the best part of the book it was all wrapped up nicely","2673":"profoundly and hauntingly beautiful","2674":"i give a five star rating to very few books and many of the others were childhood favorites this novel is in the same category as night by elie wiesel in terms of the subject matter although this book is fiction there is violence and hatred love and generosity bravery and selflessness sorrow and fear the language the stories the metaphors are very compelling i started highlighting things that stood out to me and ended up highlighting half the book","2675":"i can't say anything other than i will never forget this book about such strong characters who face man's inhumanity to man it broke my heart and lifted my spirit in the way only a truly outstanding work of fiction can thank you anthony marra","2676":" absolutely loved this book i picked it up on a whim at the bookstore and i am so glad i did i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since i finished it the novel takes place in chechnya and while there is much violence in the book it is about so much more than about war i particularly liked the focus on the importance of history and its use and abuse and how well the characters are portrayed while the subject matter seems depressing the book maintains a ray of hope and is just so beautifully written one of the best books i have read in a long time i highly recommend it","2677":"an amazing experience especially if there's ever a day that you may be tempted to say whoa is me my life is difficult and because of your troubles you feel like giving up this novel will inspire you to do your best with whatever your life becomes and to cherish everything","2678":"i first stumbled upon anthony marra when i read a short story of his called chechnya published in narrative magazine that story went on to win a pushcart prize for marra i immediately was stunned by his talent and ability to make universal truths from stories rooted in a local place i was thrilled when i heard his debut novel would be coming out and i'm glad to say he didn't disappoint with constellation of vital phenomena some reviewers here lament that you don't learn a great deal about chechnya or the conflict this is true it does not educate you about chechnya the way junot diaz' brief wondrous life educates you about the dominican republic but i almost feel that this is more a strength than a flaw in marra's novel what i enjoyed about reading constellation is similar to what i love about reading the russian classics it captures man's simultaneous brutality and kindness within the same setting marra's characters are well drawn and some of the scenes are incredibly intense the closing scene of the novel is beautiful and tragic and sad this is probably the best contemporary novel i've read since the moors last sigh marra delivers a gem here i understand he has a collection of short stories slated for an october 2015 release this pits his book against mine which comes out in july so for that i hope it falls flat on its face kidding i'm looking forward to his next work with baited breath","2679":"easily the best novel i have ever read it was so well written i read the acknowledgements and was surprised and delighted to find that my cousin once removed was one of the author's consultants a beautiful story complex but clean lyrical but accessible and a pleasure to read","2680":"this was one of the two outstanding books that i've read in the past year or so along with cutting for stone beautiful writing but unlike some books that seem to be focused on great prose i really enjoyed the story it built to an extremely emotional ending i didn't cry but the room was pretty dusty","2681":"terrorism begins and ends at home and 'home' includes the communities we live in in this story the larger community is chechnya the macro community the micro includes a village a hospital a few homes dotted along a road which edges a forest more to come","2682":"this is a really hard book to review i can honestly say that at first i didn't think i would like it i read a few pages at the library and almost didn't take it home but i'm glad i did an amazing novel i felt so attached to the characters and i couldn't stop reading toward the end i had to see what happened","2683":"thankyou anthony marra books like this are the reason i read a beautiful tragic and very clever book definitely in my top 5 and a book i will not hesitate to recommend","2684":"beautifully written but quite tragic not for the faint of heart or stomach still highly recommended for poetry and poignancy challenges conceptions of family love and loyalty","2685":"this is a hard book for me to review if you ran into me and asked me to refer a really great book i probably would not pick this book so 4 stars seems really weird the thing is the book is very well and creatively written 5 stars on the other hand i found the story so depressing also i don't know many people including myself who know enough about the history to truly appreciate the novel","2686":"best book i've read this year","2687":"certainly the best debut novel i've read and possibly the best novel i've read in the past five years beautiful prose although a bit workshoppy marra's a graduate of the iowa writers workshop well rounded characters and a tale that braids a decade of chechen russian conflict and the characters' life lines into one succinct entity i finished this book in tears which happens rarely five stars","2688":"rich in oil chechnya's economy and infrastructure were reduced to ruins by years of war between local separatists and russian forces combined with armed banditry and organized crime when wwii ended stalin accused the chechens of collaborating with the nazis their punishment was mass deportation to siberia and central asia they were not allowed to return until 1957 when khrushchev was in power the book is set between 1994 and 2004 in chechnya when russia and chechnya were at war the two main characters are doctors working in a war ravaged hospital one is a russian and the other chechnyan the chechnyan doctor watches as russian soldiers abduct his neighbor who has been accused of aiding chechen rebels he later rescues the neighbor's 8 year old daughter then colludes with the russian doctor to form an unlikely family this is not the most uplifting book but it is a well written book that you will remember","2689":"parts of the book i loved other parts not so much","2690":"enjoyable reading i like the way the author peeked into the past and future of the characters while the narration was in the current timeframe even though i have never been in a war i think this book captures the horror of war","2691":"a constellation of vital phenomena a novel set during and post war between chechen and russia in a haunting tale spanning 1994 to 2004 we follow four families as they struggle to survive amid the devastation of war great read a story of love loss survival hope and family","2692":"haunting heartbreaking hopeful beautiful","2693":" here the plot does not unravel it unfolds reading it was like watching time lapse photography it was like taking in expansive views while somehow looking through a microscope it was like scent memory it was like taking a bubble bath in words it was ugly and it was gorgeous and i guess it has the effect of making its readers wax poetic because damn anthony marra has written some of the most beautifully crafted prose i have ever read it's at times raw and real and at other times flowery and at all times exactly what it needs to be his omniscient perspective was brilliant here the reader is god and can see the past present and future in blips and all at once knows the innermost secrets of the characters loves them despite everything empathizes with them damns them cries with them as far as the actual reading experience i was stuck immediately by the craft in every sentence but the process of peeling apart the layers of this story does not begin as a gripping page turner i was held by the beauty of the prose until i could see how the pieces fit together and frankly until after i did a little homework on the chechen wars understanding the human rights violations of those wars helped my enjoyment if you can call it that of the book anyway i loved it in a way that pained me and will pain you if you give it a chance the content is not easy the reading is not page turning but this book is written art","2694":"wow definitely will have to re read this one it was epic in the true sense of the word i struggled at first with the characters the story the timeline the main story takes place over 4 days but it really spans almost 2 decades or more if you count khassan and his story i knew nothing of chechnya and reading this made me think of the current tragedy unfolding in syria marra is a gift and i look forward to his next triumph","2695":"i wasn't sure at first if i wanted to hear this story i was won over by the fascinating manner in which the author ties all the characters together i enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about a group of people about whom i know very little once i began the rhythm and tone of this audio book carried me away i was sad to have to say good bye to all these troubled and wonderful people","2696":"i became enthralled with all the characters' humanity through their desire to live and love during the unending chechen wars the author's masterful use of time propelled each person's story and his struggles outstanding writing an excellent novel","2697":"if you liked this book you might also enjoy life after lifecity of thievessold","2698":"this is an achingly beautiful novel that left me breathless countless times by the end i felt as though the characters had invited the reader into their deepest joys and sorrow in the course of reading this book i also took some time to learn about the chechen wars which helped me understand some details i otherwise would have glossed over as this a multi layered work i imagine i will return to this novel many times for its insight brilliance and deep humanity simply marvelous","2699":"perhaps because i listened to this book rather than read it i found it incredibly repetitive did i hear this part already well no this is another version of the same story much like the history book written by one of the characters i really only needed the first 20% of this book to get the point","2700":"an interwoven story of the war s in chechyna havaa's father dokka is taken during the night ahkmed a family friend takes the young girl to the hospital and sonja a russian doctor keeps havaa safe the best book i have read this year life is the constellation of vital phenomena","2701":"this book is getting a lot of buzz it lives up to expectation the story is gripping the characters are fallible and the history is compelling i was stunned to learn about conditions in chechnya during the 90's and early 2000's","2702":"ambitious and smart a political novel that is also character driven and affecting","2703":"\" by that point a career change was beyond consideration he was a bottle thrown to the sea into which the villagers had folded their wishes and thought he was willing to give up on himself he wasn't willing to let down those who believed he could carry them over the water yet he drew still lifes when he should have drawn diagrams studied models when he should have studied corpses when he graduated from medical school in the bottom tenth he didn't know the disgrace weighing on him like a hundred rubles in five kopek coins that would one day be converted to less cumbersome denominations when families like this one came knowing he was too incompetent a doctor to save their sons life but so skilled and well trained an artist he might bring their son back \" above is probably a quote that best represents anthony marras debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena a book while reading i had to often take breaks due to how emotionally draining it can be the book is moving with characters that make you realize the capacity of both human pain and love the author captures perfectly with his prose the stark reality of life during war and the hopelessness and despair that even the readers can't help but feel set in the chechnya region it follows the lives of civilians who have had to live under the violent reality of war jumping through a timeline of 1994 2004 the plot towards the second half of the book seemed a little slow seems to fall into place at the end perhaps the best part of the book is marras writing style haunting would the way i would describe it the author with his eye for detail seems to describe even everyday human things into beautifully documented events everything seems to be tinged with a bit of sadness and nostalgia while it be a winter coat from the soviet union era or havaa the youngest character in the story \" they came stooped and waxen downcast and wary from grozny shali urus martan one long exhalation toward the mountains some carried the most necessary provisions boots woolen socks more woolen socks bribe money those who had lost everything even their reason carried the most ridiculous things a man who lost his parents and children in the same uragan rocket blast carried the key to the flat they perished in a thrice widowed woman carried the framed portrait of a face no one had seen alive for over a hundred years and no image of her husbands a retired bureaucrat carried a twelve hundred page regulatory binder convinced that rules were forever inviolable others carried nothing at all \"i would recommend reading this book on a saturday when you have no plans so you can stay at home glued to this book without being distracted you'll have to pause for beaks sometimes due to how strong the feelings of gloom will be and how cruel it will seem but that's the thing about good books like this one it makes you feel and leaves you changed","2704":"brilliant did not know much about the conflict in chechnya a confronting story but told brilliantly","2705":"this book has been sitting on my desk since i got it as an arc at a conference in late january the publishing rep who handed it to me said it is kind of like the english patient and has to do with war and so i thought 'i will never read this ' after its release i noticed people who had actually read the book reviewed it favorably and decided to give it a chance best decision ever and worst publishing rep description of a book ever this book is wonderful and sad and beautifully written","2706":"exquisite writing about lives in a tragic situation it helped me to understand more about the struggles of chechnya and the terrifying realities ordinary people endure when living in an area of such conflicted loyalties and ideology ultimately it's a book about the worst and best aspects of human nature deception betrayal greed fanaticism love integrity compassion and self sacrifice","2707":"excellent writing and a compelling story spoiler alert i am getting a little tired of books where everybody dies maybe i'm reading too many post apocalyptic books this isn't one of those i exaggerate for effect not everybody dies but books are a way to escape the real world and the steady stream of depressing news so i need the happy or at least somewhat happy ending at least some of the time maybe i'm just picking the wrong books ok i'll get off my soapbox now","2708":"devastatingly beautiful in so many ways this is one of my favourite from 2013 the author's style reminded me of jonathan safran foer one of my favourite authors in that the subject matter is heavy but there are bit of humor that ease the tension and reflects the dichotomy of life where both horror and love exists","2709":"beautiful and brutal many times i had to resist the temptation to read the last page to know what happened","2710":"2 5 stars sorry guy's but this book was just lost on me at times i got flashes of brilliance and then i was lost again i tried so hard to love and just be wowed but it just didn't happen so many people loved this book so i would recommended it to people but would be every open to tell people the book was hard for me to sucked into the book's world","2711":"the book seems to be very one side all russians are evil and all chechens are holly and honorable victims it almost feels like a cold war propaganda reading the book is filled with near swearing hate language and terrible scenes the author was trying to create a style of telling a story through half mentioned facts and hazy references it made the book feel very over orchestrated and very tiring to read","2712":"a marvelous book in many ways but it describes a very ugly reality and for that reason i found it rather difficult to read","2713":"i loved this story very well written","2714":"life a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" this haunting portrayal of the chechnyan wars jumps back and forth through time offering glimpses into moments and decisions that forever alter the lives of individual characters and their relationships with one another marra's non linear style depicts the confusion and fragmentation of families and a community during wartime and captures how those who are left struggle to create a narrative of their loved ones' lives based on memories speculation hearsay and what they left behind havaa's suitcase full of souvenirs a constellation of refugee lives and the micro stories of every patient and soldier with whom the main characters intersect reveal the ordinariness of so many human lives and yet for all the sadness and cruelty there are beautiful moments of grace and redemption it is a beautiful read and provides a lot of history of the chechnyan conflict without going into long historical narratives","2715":"heartbreaking story of ordinary people in wartorn chechnya the book starts out slowly and explains little of the ongoing wars in the region but it builds steadily and pulls you in","2716":"i had concerns that this would be soul crushingly depressing but i had read some excellent reviews that persuaded me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did although very sad in parts the book manages to write about characters who have to endure tremendous suffering without becoming unbearably dark","2717":"this was another find in my recycle room and i was excited to read it as it had a ton of buzz around it i need to preface this review by saying i don't know a lot of russian history and this book assumes you know about russia in the wars chechnya and the surrounding areas they go in with the assumption that you have a basic understanding so when they are discussing things you should already know i didn't know which made this more difficult it wasn't overall a difficult read though it follows loosely the stories of a neighborhood and it's residents it jumps back and forth from their past to their future and doesn't clearly follow a traditional timeline out of all maybe 8ish charecters i was only very interested in the story of 1 of them overall i found it to be a bit tedious and boring but i wonder if i had studdied russian history if i would have been more involved either way i would give it a pass 2 out of 5 stars","2718":"audiobook review this book made a region and the conflict it is experiencing come alive the characters in the story and what happened when their lives intersected made for a great saga that captured my heart","2719":"outstanding and heartbreaking","2720":"if you're looking for some light summer reading this book is not for you it's a dark despairing tale about war torn chechnya the story bounces back and forth across a span of 10 years which can be confusing but there's a timeline at the beginning of each chapter to help guide the reader other than that it is well written and will make you feel like you're right there if that's where you want to be","2721":"best book i've read in a while masterful storytelling and endearing characters that i'm sure will stay with me","2722":"didn't finish got about 3 4 through and found i wasn't interested probably my problem not the book's","2723":"horrible that people should have to live in fear but wonderfully written","2724":"best book i've read in several years a beautiful haunting brutal tale marvelously told","2725":"i just loved this book the story was so engaging the topic was very informative but best of all the author's writing was just mesmerizing","2726":"loved this book it makes a case for both the horror of war and the absurdity of war in this case in chechnya in content and style this novel reminded me of the ministry of special cases and also the history of love two of my favorite books","2727":"i'm going to be a minority that could not engage with this book as deeply as i would have liked i don't think withholding so much connection and information from the reader not just the characters helps rather it hinders mimicking the disjointedness of war and the pain of families torn apart with prose that does the same made this more of a muddy mess than i think it could or should have been but i'm often an idiot about these things and dense and perhaps i'm completely wrong","2728":"was a slow start but well worth the end","2729":"this book topped the npr recommended reading it's an exquisitely well woven tale about a serious subject life in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 riveting to the end","2730":"this book is amazing i don't even know how to fully articulate it it's not a book about the chechan wars it's just a very very well written touching devastating beautiful funny book that takes place with the chechan wars as its background marra imparts an immense amount of humanity to his subjects in writing that is vivid and interesting throughout just a remarkable novel","2731":" in september i saw what i think is a great film leviathan is a russian movie incorporating the philosophy of thomas hobbes and the book of job to tell a story of a family living on the shore of the barents sea destroyed by the pervasiveness of corruption and a ruinous lifestyle which we are encouraged to understand are inherent in modern russian society anthony marra's novel a constellation of vital phenomena is enshrouded in the same atmosphere some novels as you read make you feel a sense of darkness as if it takes place at night and in the coldest hours of night too because after all this is russia in the iron grip of winter but marra's russia is chechnya and his story tells of a few days in the time after the two wars in which the russian federation cruelly overpowered the chechen separatist movement we follow the slim staff of a dilapidated hospital as they try to survive while knee deep in the chaos governed by the feds who can be seen as the persecuting demons in this hellish environment so this is a novel dark in tone about a society beaten down by war and oppression it takes place in the murky depths where the leviathan of state exerts pressures great enough to crush the human soul still there's light the novel is lighted by luminous characters who swim in the depths of this narrative with hope their only solace it may be cold and dark at these depths but there's still life here the constellations of vital phenomena of marra's title perhaps the best descriptive word is powerful reading the events occurring in the 5 days of the novel's primary action you'll be immersed in the atmosphere i spoke of as it's constructed from the same dark detail and emotion its entire length of almost 400 pages it's as if you lose all sense of time it's a little like waking up after having finished the novel to find yourself in a different place and time not having been aware of the passage it's that absorbing the ride is bumpy the anvil of history is hard and those pounded on it are shaped and misshapen until all that's left is the luminosity of their hope the blows upon the anvil are softened by marra's humor for this is a funny novel the bumpy ride is smoothed by the fluidity of his prose for it is also lyrical making such powerful fiction must be harder than we suppose those of us who dig for nuggets like this in the vast rubble field of contemporary fiction some novelists struggle to find such light in communities smoking with despair and hopelessness i admire marra's ability to write truth with such expressive passion it creates a reality on this site dedicated to good reading i suggest marra's novel is exactly that a good read i recommend it i think you'll like it","2732":"excellent read like stones from the river only about chechnya difficult to read because of the subject but so well written interesting information about a little known situation","2733":"every now and then a book comes along that restores my faith in the future of the novel all over again a constellation of vital phenomena is such a book anthony marra has the gift and his work is more assured than writers who have toiled for years i'd like to say i was immediately captured by his novel but that wouldn't be true my lack of familiarity with war torn chechnya with russian history distanced me at first a number of original and whimsical characters were woven into his rich tapestry of words and for many pages i wondered just why such character was being portrayed in great detail but then it all started coming together the title comes from a description of life in a medical book life is a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptation a careful reading reveals that for this community of characters the description is quite apt the novel primarily takes place throughout a decade and a line graph at the top of each chapter centers the reader in the timeline there are three key characters akhmed an incompetent doctor with a good heart sonja a bone weary surgeon who labors each day at a bombed out hospital that serves as the only respite for those who have been injured and havaa an eight year old girl who has already been forced to endure and lose too much many other secondary characters populate this epic tale including a beautifully detailed portrait of a damaged man who has turned informer ramzan all of these characters will become tied in an intricate web of connections that reveal how human fate is not just in our own hands but in the hands of all humanity the result is a haunting and original look into many universal themes ramzan says we're beyond obligation we wear clothes and speak and create civilizations and believe we are more than wolves but inside us there is a word we cannot pronounce and that is who we are rather than ramzan's view of the world this book shines a spotlight on the true meanings of love and sacrifice and the lengths we will go to connect and endure while heartbreaking at times the book at its core is hopeful and proves that an immense spinning joy can occur even when one's very humanity is threatened i view this constellation as a potential classic","2734":"a truly exceptional novel an incredible look into war poverty and the connections we make during abnormal situations the characters are vibrant and the plot twisting but satisfying this book was memorizing","2735":"not a happy book but it's really good","2736":"i can't stop thinking of this book the writing is beautiful the story brutal and enthralling the people unforgettable heart wrenching and heart warming","2737":"a constellation of vital phenomena by antony marra while beautifully written is certainly not a light read in my opinion i found myself reading this story very slowly as there is a lot to digest the writing is beautiful and the story is interesting and very well researched anthony marra takes a subject and a place i for one knew very little about war ravaged chechnya in 2004 more than a decade after the fall of the soviet union the story centres on a war ridden village that most people have deserted the central characters lives are interconnected in unexpected ways that we learn more about as the we turn the pages the reader is introduced to what life is like in an ethnic war zone of a mostly unknown place especially for me so i was eager to read and learn something new this is certainly not a light read but having said that the story is told with a surprising and unexpected amount of humour i did laugh out loud a couple of times in the novel s and the following was one such time i thought ronald mcdonald was president or maybe that ronald mcdonald told gorbachev to tear down the wall you're thinking of ronald reagan she tells him at other times i found myself flinching at some of the descriptions and atrocities of war the book is not a history lesson about the chechnya wars but rather a story about people who lived and coped through the ordeal i did google quite a bit about chechnya while reading this story as i like to have some facts in order to understand what i am reading and i especially like to have a map to hand i did find the story initially a challenge to follow the chapters go back and forth between events and years it took me a while to get a grasp on names times and places overall a very interesting and well told story i would advise if reading the book to google a small bit on chechnya as i certainly felt it helped me while reading the story","2738":"you've got to be kidding me with these ratings i feel like i've been bamboozled and i'm kind of wishing i could demand my money back from...someone i didn't hate this book i came close to hating it i'm not going to lie but i was able to see it through to the end that's quite an accomplishment given that i hated every character and that the friend i was reading this with was ready to give up after only five chapters maybe the best way i can sum up my feelings would be to tell you about my favorite characters the first was a one armed guard who didn't have a name until approximately 300 pages in and who spoke maybe six lines throughout the entirety of the book my other favorite characters were a pack of feral dogs yes you read that right the pack of feral dogs that were left to die but found a caretaker in one man - these dogs somehow elicited stronger feelings from me than any human in this story but back to the story there's a timeline at the start of every chapter yet the author found it necessary to take one inconsequential half character meaning this was a character briefly mentioned with no name no back story no reason for being in the plot at all and proceeded to jump all over space and time to give you an ending that you neither needed to know or cared about that last part may just be me projecting... for example the timeline at the start of the chapter says we're in 2001 the story goes plodding along following these ridiculously annoying characters and then bam you're semi introduced to a half character - someone you've never heard of before and will never hear from again - who is talked about in such detail that you can almost convince yourself there's a reason for their appearance the crappy thing is there is no reason you're in 2001 with this no named character and the author goes \"thirteen months from now this happens but eighteen months before that happened whereas in two and a third years this other thing will happen...\" all in reference to a character whose existence has no bearing on the story the first time that happened i thought it was odd but dutifully tried to flesh out the timing in my head \"okay it started in 2001 and thirteen months from then would be 2003 but then eighteen months before would have been 1999 and then two and a third years after...after when the first event or third the second event or the first the...eff this \"the second time that happened i was understandably annoyed the third time i was frustrated the fourth time i was in disbelief the fifth time i wanted to smash my nook against the wall and every time after that i had to fight the mounting tide of curse words that threatened to spew forth why didn't someone tell the author that it really isn't necessary to provide an ending for every tangential character in the novel we can't be the only ones to have noticed or been irked by the unnecessary skipping of timing plots and stories can we there's a spot about halfway through the book in which a page and a half are taken over by short pointed \"when why how\" questions which i'm sure were put there to make the reader think but which only made me groan in agony a page and a half it was like being why'd by a three year old only it was worse because i couldn't distract the book with the promise of cookies and a tv show to get it to stop it already i don't know maybe i'm just not smart enough to get why everybody else on here seemed to love this book so much i mean as a history i'd say it's spot on it provided a lot more information about the civil strife that visited the people of russia and chechnya which would have been just fine if that's what i had signed up for but as a historical fiction novel it fell with a big dull thud and i do want to emphasize the d u l l i hated akhmed but then there was a very brief period where i thought \"aw he's not really that bad \" and then i turned the page and found i was right he wasn't that bad he was worse view spoiler schtooping his best friend's wife then sonja all while his legal wife is bedridden is one thing but then killing his wife - convincing himself it's okay because she's obviously mental - without one shred of guilt adulterer or remorse murderer ...argh hide spoiler i despised sonja how can a person who's supposed to devote her life to others be such an uncaring cold unsympathetic bitch i get her initial reaction to akhmed hell i agree whole heartedly with her assessment but in the doctor business isn't half of being a good doctor your ability to relate to people in that game she fails miserably i wanted to smother havaa i know she's supposed to be cute and precocious and she's supposed to tug at my heartstrings but it just didn't work on me and if you know anything about me from my other reviews you know i'm a bleeder i've cried over more books than i care to admit i've been known to verbally curse and reprimand fictional characters over one decision or another i've even carried grudges towards fictional characters for the things that they've done so for me to not be moved by this flat unbelievable little girl speaks volumes i think the other characters were confusing and blah the least blah of the bunch were ramzan and natasha and by the time the author gives the reader anything real or true about them i was past caring i'm annoyed that i spent so much money on this book and angry that i put so much faith into the ratings and reviews on goodreads there was far too much frustration and nonsense crammed in every chapter and i was fed up still am actually stupid effing ending...","2739":" this is a grim tale set in war torn chechnya its grimness relieved by the beauty of the prose and the depth of humanity that prose reveals the story is framed in a small village where two men are disappeared over the course of 4 days but it takes in a number of other memorable characters as well filling in their back story as we pass through the days it could be confusing in lesser hands but the stories are so memorable that it's not too difficult to keep track of the various strands two of the stories amount to retellings of two narratives shared by muslims u0026amp christians the story of a parent asked to sacrifice his child and that of an orphan delivered into the care of the family responsible for its orphanhood all of the characters are good people except one and even his villainy is revealed as much more complicated than it seems at first who somehow retain their humanity in a world that seems to have lost all semblance of humanity i highly recommend this though perhaps not for reading as i did over the christmas holiday","2740":" as a debut novel i was stunned by the depth and understanding given to the chechen conflict by anthony marra the story is told through the eyes of people just trying to survive terrible hunger devastating murders of family members through political and ethnic cleansings and a lack of any type of basic infrastructure despite their horrendous challenges they desperately try to save a young girl whose family is gone it's hard to believe that life in chechnya was this difficult without any real coverage by the american news media is it still like this in chechnya","2741":"such a beautiful story i didn't know anything about the chechen wars prior to reading so it took me a few chapters to get oriented i was completely drawn into havaa sonja and akhmed's world of war torn chechnya their stories are heartbreaking but beautifully told this is the kind of book that makes you re examine the meaning of life love sacrifice and family","2742":"wow i don't think i have the words to describe this book it was truly amazing to me and an eye opener i rarely re read books but i will definitely be reading this one again","2743":"a story that is very interesting and informative so little i knew about chechnya i'm glad i read this one","2744":" marthie anthony marra has been receiving amazing praise for a constellation of vital phenomena and it is well deserved he writes like a dream his sense of place is remarkable and his characters beautifully drawn the story is set during the chechnyan war in a tiny village with a derelict hospital close by the lives of a small group of villagers are forever changed over five days by forces beyond their control it is a story about the power of love and sacrifice when all hope seems lost an unforgettable debut comparable to books like the english patient and the kite runner highly recommended","2745":"i really loved this book","2746":"a novel in the mode of the tiger's wife but harder to love on the positive side it took me into situations and places i've never experienced before and it had a non linear structure that was interesting and worked pretty well but it tries way too hard to be meaningful and to make sure you know just how meaningful it is i have some criticisms of the writing some of which are related to this irritating impulse for one thing the narrative voice is too omniscient too much person x did not know that 10 years from now overly described event y would happen just stop pulling your reader out of the narrative flow in an attempt to be profound there are some gruesome depictions of torture grievous injury and other war related atrocities be ready for it 2 5 foot draggy stars","2747":"what an intricate story of loyalty and life in the harsh landscape of chechnya and war anthony marra did an amazing job","2748":"i can't write enough praise for this book the characters are so richly drawn the story line is compelling and unique the writing is absolutely beautiful and engaging this is one of the few books i was not hurrying to finish at the end i intentionally slowed down i did not want it to end i did not want to know the secrets i just wanted to keep enjoying the writing","2749":"this book is amazing i loved the story the writing the characters i truly loved everything about this book you just have to get past the convoluted title of this book","2750":"i just finished this wonderful haunting book i loved it the author has an interesting style i am honored to have met him and listen to him speak great character development i enjoyed them living and haunting my mind","2751":"struggled to get into this one but it was definitely worth it in the end learned a lot about chechnya","2752":" i was convinced after reading george saunders's tenth of december that i wasn't going to read a better book this year but this one has me completely eating my words it's heartbreaking illuminating perhaps a bit draggy here and there but never for long but ultimately amazing i teared up numerous times and kept sneaking peeks at my kids to see if they'd notice why mommy was a weeping mess on the couch only to see that they were always too engrossed in fighting over which marvel superhero could trounce which villain etc the book reminded me a little bit of tea obrecht's the tiger's wife which also focuses on a part of the world that not too many americans are super familiar w maybe w some pinches of history of love and everything is illuminated thrown in i'm not going to sum up the plot b c so many have done it before me and i'm not even going to go into why it's so good b c again so many before me have already done so plus i'm lazy but i will say that i'm not seeing as much mention of the humor in this book for how absolutely depressing the subject matter is it's actually really funny throughout so yes here's a book that is rooted in death and unfathomable loss and unrequited love and somehow he got it to be funny despite being proven wrong earlier i'll venture to say again that i don't think i'll read a better book this year","2753":" weeping openly for the last twenty pages i am thoroughly moved by the horrors endured by the people of chechnya anthony marra writes so beautifully that even the most brutal of details can't detract from this stunning novel i was so invested in the characters hoping against hope that each would survive marra's style of enumerating objects and experiences is very effective at moving the story along i especially like the way he lets the reader know what has happened and what will happen in hours days weeks months and years to come in the end from such devastation we are given hope and i think my tears were as much for joy as for sorrow","2754":" though by no means the longest book i've read or even the longest book i've read in the past month this was more dense than anything i've read in recent memory which simultaneously works in its favor and sabotages it don't get me wrong i'm glad i read this book it's the story of akhmed a doctor who prefers drawing portraits to treating patients who finds a precocious little girl hiding in the woods after her house burns to the ground and seeks shelter for her in the local hospital which is run by the ruthlessly competent surgeon sonja of course it's about so much more than that the title of the book comes from the definition of life in a medical dictionary and that's a description of the book that is much more accurate it's about the monstrous and beautiful interweavings of human choice and consequence it's a book clearly intended to transcend the limits of its plot sentence after sentence the writing took my breath away marra writes with an intensity of emotion that is completely truly and unequivocally stunning anyone who claims that the writing is poor here is lying delusional or both i wrote down many quotes but this is my favorite he emptied his lungs but his sigh wasn't finished it went on emptying him come on but and i can't believe i'm saying this there came a point where the focus on lush writing really began to feel like it detracted from the plot rather than enhanced it certain sections felt more like a writing exercise an excuse to digress and explore which resulted in many paragraphs that were gorgeously pointless and vaguely self indulgent somewhere around the halfway mark i set the book aside out of pure mental exhaustion and only came back to it a week later because i forced myself to as i said i'm glad that i forced myself to but the fact that i had to knocks it down to a 4 star book","2755":"i found it quite difficult to get through this book but it was well worth it i knew almost nothing about the wars in chechnya and this book has helped me to understand just how devastating this period was for the local population the book is bit confusing because it jumps around in time however each chapter has a timeline with a year and this was a big help to stay in touch with the story the book is beautifully written and many passages will want to be reread","2756":"this was a hard book to read about a political situation in a country i don't know a lot about how any people survived the wars in chechnya both physically and emotionally is beyond me a haunting heart breaking story","2757":"this book was a little hard to follow at first because of my unfamiliarity with names and locations what kept me going was the author's way of jumping forward and backward in time and revealing additional characters in small increments although the topic was very disturbing my interest was held until the end of the book","2758":"love gaining new information when i read set 1994 2004 during the chechnya russian war tells the story of akmed u0026amp the neighbor girl he attempts to rescue so well written with harrowing characters u0026amp insight into how humans must deal with an inhumane time","2759":"absolutely phenomenal book for me this book mixed the most memorable elements of a thousand splendid suns with catch 22 love sacrifice and survival in the altered reality of wartime with the ability to find humor and light in the absurd","2760":"not sure why i never read this till now","2761":" i swore after reading the execution of noa p singleton that i would never pick up another book written by someone possessing an mfa that was a short lived vow and am i ever glad i broke it marra is someone who took that mfa and has written a book of great depth and meaning with a story and plot to go along with it he avoids the i am just writing because i can pitfall this book is throat clenching heartbreaking and yet so beautiful at the same time what a talent this is a book that is tough to say you loved because it is so gut wrenching but for lack of a better term i loved it","2762":"so this is by far one of the most beautiful books i've read in a long time it is tragic so tragic but the prose is sublime and the entire story is suffused with this tenacious sense of hope this book will probably make you cry but it should also make you marvel at humanity's heights in spite of its depths in terms of craft the novel is wonderfully plotted its timeline darts back and forth but the exposition is so naturally blended into the story that it's really quite incredible i'm jealous of how well marra has told this story it's 5 days but you get the main characters' entire lifetimes detailed in such lovely moments throughout really skillfully done i knew a little bit about the chechen wars beforehand but reading this book will strip you down and expose you to the horrors of those two awful wars that being said you really should read this book i don't like to call books important but this one felt that way it's a powerful story about humanity struggling to thrive amidst inhuman conditions the writing is marvelous the characters fascinating and so beautifully developed i don't have anything bad to say i mean you're gonna cry but you'll cry for the bad and the good the last line of this book left me with goosebumps that are still hitting me when i remember how it all ended days after finishing there aren't a lot of books that give me goosebumps days later it's a wonderful thing this is a wonderful book","2763":"a couple of weeks ago i finished what i was sure was the most beautiful novel i would ever read then i finished this one which i am quite certain is truly the most beautiful moving novel i will ever read i am at a loss everyone should read this novel immediately","2764":"after reading this beautifully written novel i am reminded again of how much i have to learn about other areas of the world in this case chechnya courage humor and honor live on amidst the rubble","2765":"took me a bit to get into the rhythm of it but i loved the precision of the writing throughout a book i fell more into as i went along and an ending worthy of the journey to get there a very reflective reading often contrasting my 2003 2004 with that of chechnya which led to me being extra thankful over canada day this year","2766":"i couldn't put this one down beautiful and heartbreaking","2767":"the first book i have read about chechnya very interesting i especially liked how the author intertwined the various storylines together","2768":"i finally got 2 3 of the way through this book and then realized that i just couldn't finish it the story was choppy and disjointed the characters were flat and i just didn't care what was going to happen next i very rarely leave a book unfinished but in this case it was the best choice for me i don't understand what all the hype is about many people seem to love it it's a mystery to me","2769":"hard to believe this is a debut novel it so beautifully written a haunting story though and most definitely not a light read","2770":"this is a strikingly poignant and beautifully written book set in chechnya during the second war the book covers only five days in the lives of those torn by war indifference drugs secrets and torture with flashbacks to provide the needed background this book is at times difficult to read it becomes too real reminding its readers of the real human cost of war","2771":"one of those books you think about long after you finish it it also points out how one part of the world can know so little or choose to learn so little about another part of the world the barbarity of war is a constant timeless and time bending i had a hard time remembering the book occurred in the 1990s and 2000s despite the fact each chapter started with a timeline and the part about the book occurring over 5 days is a bit misleading because of the flashbacks i will need to read up on chechnya before book club however i liked sohja ahkmed haava dokka and the old man next door they were well developed sympathetic and interesting their stories intersect in ways that make you believe that coincidences are more like fate","2772":"what beautiful beautiful prose anthony marra has produced a wonderful well researched and well executed work i won't give a summary of the plot there was so much more than plot the hyper omniscient third person narration is so masterfully excecuted that nearly every character feels like the main character and that this is their story","2773":"the last 20 30 pages are worth 4 or 5 stars drew everything together in a beautifully tragic way","2774":" i highly recommend this book what a find i just stumbled upon it at the library and thought why not what a gem the words and use of language are stunning beautiful rich sentences in such a bleak sad war stricken world the characters were tragic flawed courageous strong and so very funny the humor in such a sad time i laughed out loud after reading sentences that would break my heart i also loved the writing style of introducing a character and then fast forwarding their life she shared her bread with x and he would never forget that act of kindness in 12 years x would be a millionaire living in hoboken new jersey he would spend his saturday's at a food bank helping to feed those who so reminded him of his young self","2775":"one the best elegant and brutal novels i've read in a long time","2776":"a russian doctor searching for her missing sister a man who just barely qualified as a doctor a young girl whose family is taken away and other characters of anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena are broken and justifiably so one man writes a history of chechnya only to destroy all thousand pages of it while a son loses touch with his father because he informs on others to survive alternating between the two chechen civil wars in 1994 and 2004 the stories of these fractured characters take shape the managing of so many different times and characters is done well through good writing and also a helpful timeline that appears at the beginning of each chapter with the year in question for the chapter bolded i would like to think i'm a reader that could have done without that device but with the large cast of characters including the russian doctor's sister who falls in and out of her own misfortunes it is helpful to keep everything straight the story is richly layered and connected and switching between times makes for a more suspenseful and layered telling of these characters' personal histories a constellation of vital phenomena is engrossing and a powerful novel of human interaction in extreme circumstances","2777":"fucking brilliant","2778":"well written and haunting","2779":"this was hard to read because of the content and my lack of knowledge about eastern europe i was a little uncomfortable with what i didn't know it held my interest and was well written i am glad i took the time to read it","2780":"i love historical fiction and wanted to like this book a relevant and current story unfortunately i didn't learn much about the roots of the chechen conflict and the resulting terrorism the back and forth of the chronology was confusing and didn't serve a purpose the book was all misery with no uplifting moments or inspiration what a disappointment i worked really hard to finish this book","2781":" this book is so beautifully written i forced myself to read slowly to savor each sentence spanning ten years the novel reveals the heartbreaking reality of the chechnyan wars through the lives and relationships of a handful of characters who have no allegiance to either side but are caught in the midst of terror alternately liberated by chechnyan guerrillas then russian forces then guerrillas marra wonderfully captures both the complexity of human relationships father and son husband and wife friends lovers sisters and the complex way in which all lives are entwined i am moved by his illustration of the way terror and war can force a person to choose between survival of the body and of the soul and how difficult it can be to preserve both so looking forward to reading more from this first time novelist","2782":"made it halfway and could not finish","2783":"simply stunning beautifully written emotive complex characters","2784":"great story of intertwined lives in chechnya characters are well developed and i couldn't wait to read more about their stories","2785":" very detailed story of chechnya citizens and the brutality they suffered during two wars and then some the author incorporates the history of the wars with the back stories of each character then shows how they're all connected through love brutality betrayal and courage all the history and back stories became a little mind boggling for me and a feeling of complete hopelessness almost overwhelmed me however i was rewarded in the end as the author foretold the fates of the characters who lived and the redemption of those who died","2786":"beautifully written book set in chechnya in the 90s and early 2000s i didn't know much about chechnya and really still don't since this book concentrates on the characters and their struggles another real pick me up of a book so bleak but written in a way that i loved i found the timeline jumps to be somewhat confusing but probably because i had to readit in smaller bits","2787":"arson adultery amputation prostitution kidnapping orphaning drug addiction impotence starvation dementia freezing informing execution boy this book really had it all i found this book to require a lot more stamina for suffering vicariously than i possess not worth the effort","2788":"very well written two wars back to back in chechnya this book depressed the shit out of me horrors of war torture rape and so on it was tough to get through it's hard to grasp how these people were able to carry on your own problems seen insignificant by comparison methodically cutting off all ten fingers with a bolt cutter shoving a live eel up some guys ass i can't remember ever reading a book that made me physically ill a few of them make it out alive","2789":"for once a book i wish was longer the language is beautiful the characters are interesting and the structure is unique marra does a wonderful job moving the plot back and forth in time without confounding the reader i only wish we had been more fully introduced to characters like natasha and amzan earlier in the story i felt their stories were more profound and their character's better drawn than sonja and akhmed the protagonists","2790":"one of the most well written books i've ever read","2791":"http teensniper tumblr com post 528","2792":" this was a really hard one for me to review the writing is very powerful and i think that this is a writer to watch for in the future i had a hard time getting onto this story for the 1st 100 pages i didn't care if i finished it or not it picked up and got very good toward the end but the author uses devices i just don't care for personally like jumping back and forth to the present past and way past i felt like he went over the same episodes over and over until we finally learn everything that happened no matter where you are in the timeline he would say things like eight years from now this will happen or if he had seen the note before he left the future would have changed she wouldn't have married three years from now etc etc also the story is very dark if you feel like reading a novel about war torn chechnya deprivation torture mistrust go ahead the main people in novel don't become very likable until almost the end but you do learn what it is like to live with the constant stress of being picked up and tortured or killed and the psychological problems this can create i can't stop thinking about this book","2793":"this was a beautiful and sad story i haven't read a lot on chechnya or had any idea about the devastation in that region in modern history it's incredible to realize that while the western world was recovering from the world wars eastern europe was still fighting is still fighting this novel definitely changed my life for reading it","2794":" absolutely gorgeous book what scenes what writing what imagination of tending to a disabled wife how long since he'd last changed ula's sheets ten days at least she rarely rolled from her side of the bed and when he carried her to the living room divan and stripped the linens from the mattress he found her tawny silhouette sweated into the fabric that musky darkening was so particularly irrevocably ula that he would hesitate to wash it but then scolding himself for being sentimental he would fill the basin with soapy water and submerge her outline and watch her disappear he was losing her incrementally after a relative has disappeared at the kitchen table she examined the glass of ice each cube was rounded by room temperature dissolving in its own remains and belatedly she understand that this was how a loved one disappeared despite the shock of walking into an empty flat the absence isn't immediate more a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an eraser but a conversion in form from presence to memory from solid to liquid and the person you once touched now runs over your skin now in sheets down your back and you may bathe may sink may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it she raised the glass to her lips the water was clear is that not gorgeous is that not just so extremely fine a female physician muses as someone whose days were defined by the ten thousand ways a human can hurt she needed now and then to remember than the nervous system didn't exist exclusively to feel pain way later way paraphrased he found in her name an immense spinning joy which is what i felt reading it all","2795":" this book was beautifully written the images that were painted were incredible i'm glad to have read it for understanding a little bit of the history of war torn chechnya such an eye opener but the subject matter was so heavy and depressing that i can't read many books like this over the weeks that i spent reading this book it felt like i had a dark cloud hanging over me so intense painful and infuriating it is overwhelming to think about the torture that humans can inflict on one another i'm always left wondering how anyone's conscience could allow them to perform such atrocities on other people it is mind bending and not in a good way i am giving it 4 stars because of the awesome writing and clearly well researched subject but i can't actually say that i liked it","2796":" a soul wrenching journey from beginning to end a constellation of vital phenomena tells the story of five lives intertwined in oppressed modern day chechnya the imagery and prose in this novel is stunning and the characters are well developed products of the harsh world they come from the author uses non chronological storytelling to gradually reveal how the characters' lives have become tangled in ways they never knew and little by little give the significance to a title that seems at first to be arbitrary i was very impressed with this book on several levels and would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep and meaningful read","2797":"filled with infinite sorrows and joys in this way the book mirrors the human experience as well as the definition of life from which it takes its name a constellation of vital phenomena ceaselessly and achingly beautiful language complex characters and an honest story","2798":"complex and captivating story very well written this novel threads through the landscape and lives of the characters simultaneously it took a bit to get into the story but once hooked there was no turning back","2799":"i would have given it 4 5 stars because it starts slowly nonetheless by the end this overwhelming book grabs you hard it is about the horrific tragedies of the two chechen wars of the last 2 decades it also about the nature of heroism and family terror and brutality destroy the humanity of several characters in this book but most are silently heroic and fully human","2800":"a tragic story that is beautifully written any book that has me crying for the last 30 pages and yet finishes on a hopeful note surely deserves five stars","2801":"harrowing i had to stop reading it for a while but the beauty of the writing and depth of the characters made me come back to it","2802":"so creative and surprising knew very little about this part of the world and so glad i learned about it through this great story and characters","2803":"this is the best of what fiction has to offer characters that feel like people you might have once met quirky flawed and real a plot that is captivating an insight into a part of the world you probably know very little about and brilliant prose that makes you catch your breath and double back and read it again because it is so lovely this is my go to recommendation for when you want to lose yourself in an amazing story it is hard to capture as a plot because the best part of the book is the journey of each page each story i barely put this down from the moment i picked it up and i cried when it was over not because it was over but because i was so happy someone had written it","2804":"good sad informative about a piece of history i wasn't aware of before reading this book well written but certainly not uplifting","2805":"so it was kind of a hard book to get through i don't know if it was because it was a really busy time personally or if it was because of the subject matter it does skip between a few story lines so maybe i was just not giving it the attention it deserved almost half way through and i found my groove with it and i found myself lost in the story not light beach reading but really good","2806":"excellent best novel of 2013 for me you will cry when you finish it though","2807":" i have only just turned the last page so it is hard to shake off the feeling of sadness and compassion anthony marra's novel inspires and clear my head sufficiently to write a review marra succeeds in releasing feelings of ' mercy mercy' for men whose actions make them more repulsive than rats this brutal and beautifully written account of the lives of a group of individuals during the war in chechnya is enlightening as to the psychology of war and of survival it is of such literary merit that my own writing can only be inspired by dipping back into it to admire and savour his choice of words rhythm and imagery a remarkable debut i am convinced i will not read a better novel this year i rarely consider rereading a book but this work of brilliance will remain by my bedside for a while to come","2808":"whoa that is all i can say about this book it is intense but yet hard to put down so many people and events interwoven throughout it's amazing i had a few moments of wow mind blown","2809":"decent wartime story taking place during the 2 wars in chechnya started off fantastic and hooked me right away but got a bit tiring as the book went on found myself skimming sections with to much skipping back and forth between time periods overall enjoyable with some nice messages but could have been more","2810":" this is a powerful and moving novel about war torn chechnya which explores how war and politics affect individuals relationships and communities the story begins with akhmed trying to save a little girl named havaa from russian soldiers who have just disappeared her father dokka hoping to hide havaa akhmed brings her to sonja a reputable ethnically russian doctor at hospital no 6 who has a host of worries of her own namely that of finding her sister natasha in eldar akhmed's village lives khassan a writer who does not so much write but continually edits history there too lives khassan's son ramzan a runner for the chechen rebels and an informant for the russians the characters are complicated and deep their lives have been altered dramatically by war love betrayal shame desires fear darkness change and ultimately forgiveness no character is set in stone and no character leaves the wars unscathed all possess intense and real emotions that show you not only who they are or where they have been but who they may become and where they may go a constellation of vital phenomena spans the decade of 1994 to 2004 woven into the perspectives from these years are stories from the past and stories of the future some critics and reviewers disliked so much hop scotching in this novel because it prevented the novel from attaining momentum but i loved how the author blurred and stopped time in the suspended and unfocused pace of the novel i felt pulled into the darkness that was inflicted on people by the chechen wars and felt the instability of their lives anthony marra is a bold and inventive writer not only did his emphatic and poetic writing make me want to keep reading the novel his facts and stories about chechnya made me want to learn more about the country's history and its people this is undoubtedly my favorite book of 2013 to date","2811":"coming off of a not so good book this was a pleasure to open and grabbed me with the first few pages it was a little bit hard to follow sometimes with the back and forth remembering all of the links but when it all came together towards the end the wait was perfect i really enjoyed how the author mixed in where a character would be in the future even though it was a character of the moment this style of description continued to explore the culture and lives in this part of the world","2812":"just finished this book wow such mixed feelings the book tore at my heart the suffering of each character i almost could not finish it at times i liked his writing style and at times his writing was contrived and ambiguous if this was non fiction i would have given a higher rating i did learn about chechnya however the history was too vague i wanted to know more about the causes politics etc of the wars i would have preferred to have a true story and learned more about chechnya and its people","2813":" one reviewer called this novel both devastating and transcendent i obviously couldn't have said it better set in the chechen conflict of the 1990s it tells the story of eight people and their nation i confess i knew very little about chechnya before starting the book i couldn't get this novel off my mind while i was reading it and it will stay with me for a long time i read some books via kindle but i really recommend reading the printed on paper version for a constellation of vital phenomena i found myself frequently going back to remember more details about the characters","2814":"excellent novel the book is set in post war chechnya but goes back frequently to wartime to unfold the story if you aren't familiar with the particulars of the wars there are times in the book where you may be a bit lost but only if you are someone who needs to know details since i don't know anything about the wars there i was distracted that said it didn't ruin my enjoyment of this story about betrayal love and forgiveness","2815":" this book is beautifully written marra jumps back and forth so characters are revealed slowly and richly and the readers are continually adapting to the new information marra also did not attempt to condemn any side of the conflict in books like these so often the writer will try to subtly weave in their own political judgments and opinions it is a personal pet peeve of mine as political situations are often to complex for 'simple' solutions marra's characters are not bright shining moral stars of virtue they are people who do the best they can with choices they are presented and sometimes they do not do their best they are wonderfully human i enjoyed this book thoroughly and would highly recommend it for full review visit http ireadalotofbooks com a constel","2816":"not on the level of writing as say a markus zusak or julian barnes hence the 4 star rating but excellent storytelling in very readable prose with enough highlight worthy wordsmithery to keep me on the lookout for his sophomore effort i think marra could become a new favorite if he continues to hone an already remarkable talent","2817":" this book was so good i couldn't wait to put it down anthony marra renders the brutality of the chechen wars in unsparring affecting prose things come apart and fall back together in a most exquisite way i have to confess to being lost a few times who is this how is he she connected to whom as the action moves from university in london to brothels in spain and back to the no man's land of chechnya but it's worth the confusion my god human beings can be brutal with one another in the end i felt a kind of gratitude for the luck of not being born anywhere near these brutal war zone and a sadness for those caught in its grasps read this book for it's beauty and ugliness","2818":"wonderfully written characters and a creative chronological structure made this book about a country and its people being torn apart by civil war incredibly readable none of the characters are perfect and the events that unfold are dark and often gruesome at times but the book still manages to feel uplifting best book i've read in awhile","2819":"this is a very good book and i wish i had read it more slowly i think i didn't do it justice but i wanted to finish in order to start my next book group selection and in addition it's the second book in a row i've read with a somewhat grim story and a partly nonlinear story line i should have read something else in between","2820":"the story was an interesting one and the characters intrigued me i struggled with the way the book was written it covers a pretty short time frame but jumps around so much it was hard to track","2821":"i absolutely loved this book one i wished would not end so beautifully written little gems of hope perfectly placed amidst the horror of the time and place i would read this again and again just to be with these characters again and i'll definitely look forward to more from this author","2822":"i wanted to know more about the country and the wars but don't think i've learnt much on that front the main characters are very well written but the back stories drag as fiction it's a good read but in wanted something more country era specific to set it aside from other 'war time reads'","2823":"i loved anthony marra's writing the book was achingly sad to me but marra's way of describing the surroundings the feelings and thoughts of his characters and his observations were beautifully stated","2824":"i would give this book six stars if i could","2825":" i have read several goodreads rave reviews of this book and i can't really disagree with any of them but i admit i decided to put this one aside after 100 pages or so it just wasn't to my taste it certainly recorded the heroic dignity and pathos of ordinary people in the harshest possible environment and often the writing was wonderful although as another goodreads reader suggested sometimes marra overreaches himself and flies too close to the sun but finally i was put off by its repeated use of the techniques of absurdist fiction example a little girl decides to teach a one armed man to juggle she had only learned herself six months earlier using small pieces of gauze which blew around in the wind it took her all afternoon to learn to juggle one some would consider this a perfect metaphor for the heroic but ultimately pointless struggles which apparently are the subject of the book but the combination of sad hopeless humor and meaningless effort is not what i enjoy reading about","2826":"though it will leave your heart aching it manages to fill the open spot in your chest with an illustrative love and sense of resounding and unqualified hope","2827":"best book i've read in so long beautiful moving and so human","2828":"beautiful writing with many lines that stopped me dead on a page i realized though that i don't love the narratives that do a lot of jumping backwards and forward in time because of this i lost the story arc a little and as a result this book wasn't as urgent of a page turner as i was hoping for glad i read it though beautiful cover design","2829":"this was a tough book to read about a country i know little about chechnya by chance i started reading this when russia invaded crimea it certainly made this a more powerful read","2830":"beautifully writtenone of my top favorites","2831":"the best novel i've read in ages what a smart unique and devastating read","2832":"not a fast read but that's because it's so beautifully written hard to care at first about chechen troubles but the characters bleed into you so you care deeply about how everyday people try to cope with a new again nation in turmoil","2833":"anthony marra certainly has been garnering accolades for his debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena his book has received praise from authors such as ann pratchett and t c boyle and it seems as if many other people are eagerly anticipating his writing career i would count myself among them as this book stands out from the many debut novels i have read although not my absolute favorite book i applaud marra's decision to write about a seldom approached topic the war between chechnya and russia in \"constellation\" as i will refer to it not because it is a very long title but because it is more convenient to type it quickly a chechen man named akhmed escapes an attack with his neighbor's daughter eight year old havaa whose most memorable trait is the fact that she carries a suitcase filled with souvenirs from people who have stayed at her house together they flee to a city hospital where they meet a seemingly cold hearted and irritable doctor sonja even as a child she had hated children she still did sonja's mood is to be blamed on the circumstances treating hundreds of victims of attacks by chechen rebels and \"the feds\" which would expectedly make one very depressed and angry at many things and not on her actual personality over the course of five days akhmed and sonja form a very deep and intimate connection she tells him stories of her sister natasha whom is missing in reality and maybe missed in sonja's heart and he tells her stories of his childhood as well as the events leading up to the time the wars began it is unfair to judge someone's writing based on the fact that a certain book is their first as if a debut author couldn't be as talented as a previously published novelist but regardless anthony marra's writing is very good he is very careful with each sentence and his writing makes the events of the novel somehow less harsh even the mention of topics like blood or defecation he was unable to father even a soft dollop of excrement each character stands out on their own and you are given the impression that he wants you to think that that person is important no matter how fleeting their appearance in constellation the reader learns that whether they know it or not the characters have encountered each other before and shared little bits of themselves and their kindness and warmth and humanity i want to share some more tidbits that i admired she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency the second bullet put a hole in her chest and she felt her breath leave but neither the third nor fourth nor fifth nor sixth nor seventh nor eighth nor ninth nor tenth nor eleventh nor twelfth nor thirteenth nor fourteenth nor fifteenth nor sixteenth nor seventeenth was seen or felt or heard \"what is her name \" the nurse asked as your father held you to his chest \"havaa \" he spoke your name like the rhythm of a pulse when they took him he held your name right there in his chest and you were with him even if you didn't know it when he reached the end he did not die he called your name and began to live in you \"how do you find them \" the girl asked she lifted her gaze to sonja as if teetering on the precipice \"i don't know havaa i'm sorry i don't maybe we try to find them in other people in kindness and generosity those things don't disappear \"according to the short bit at the end about marra it says that he has lived and studied in eastern europe he must have been very observant because i can only imagine how close his writing is to the actual atmosphere of these war torn nations i rarely read historical fiction novels but of those i have read few have been as good as a constellation of vital phenomena this definition being given to life","2834":" i wasn't sure about giving this book a go until i saw that it had lots of good reviews this book is really good and sometimes a little confusing with the story line switching back and forth between narrators and time periods also there is some russian words included that made it a bit hard to decipher either way this is a beautiful and brutal novel the author is very good at putting the reader down in war torn chechyna to have a look around and to find sympathy and remorse for his characters this was not the easiest read but it was worth it","2835":"i loved the intricacies of the intertwined story lines but sometimes the author's style was too detailed for me it occasionally felt like he was adding details about passing characters to try to give the book more depth when it had plenty of its own with the larger story lines i definitely learned a lot about that region of the world which i knew almost nothing about before","2836":" i wrote out about five paragraphs on this read and freakishly i pushed the wrong button and the whole thing was wiped out i can't repeat the better review i wrote but i will try to say something seldom do i come across a new writer and such a young one this man is all of 28 who has this sort of talent it's so rare no matter a writer's age to see a display of such rich mature ability a talent like this happens to come along maybe every 100 years that's how strong a writer mr marra is this is war torn checnya in the caucasian region once controlled by soviet russia it's a complex history of a group of individuals sisters parents in laws etc and their difficult journey but the breathtaking prose the stunning almost metaphysical prescience in the sentence structure is simply drop dead dazzling we often enter the very interior essence of these characters as they contemplate and struggle with heart wrenching day to day ordeals but it goes deeper than this in one sentence we get a picture far into a character's future destiny all while he's ironing his shirt but the maturity of this writer the depths he plunges the intelligence at work in getting into the very inner intricate places in the souls of these characters is what is so unusual it's a talent that is rare and makes many a prize winning and over touted writer today seem silly and almost embarrassing by comparison never mind the pages you will savor every polished sentence","2837":"if there were 10 stars to give it still would be inadequate for this book heart breaking beautiful and more this will be one of my favorite books forever","2838":"this is one of the most beautiful perfectly crafted novels i have ever read anthony marra has managed to write a story that left me utterly devastated but never depressed and quite literally breathless i couldn't speak at the end more about the novel here http www npr org 2013 05 25 1860902","2839":"unbelievable book takes place in chechnya beautifully written","2840":"great moving book i am still thinking about it","2841":"this was a whirlwind of a book once caught up it spins you around and around and it's this sense of dizziness that exhilarates and pushes you on i feel that to hold this novel steady i would need to read it twice a statement which for me is high praise be warned that this review is based on only one read and therefore is only half accurate summary this is the story of several characters whose lives are intertwined in chechnya between the years 1994 and 2004 the backdrop is the two wars that ravage the area during these years characters deal with the normal ups and downs of friendships and relationships loves and betrayals all while trapped between two dangerous armies this story is told by a true omniscient narrator i e there's no character telling the story rather it's just being told to us by a god like narrator sure this happens in roughly half of all stories so why should i bring it up in a review because this narrator seems to also be a psychic with an obsession for numbers for example on page 305 one very minor character will one day have eight hundred and eighty two cats \"all named for his mother though he would never know that exact figure \" any object or character can be suddenly alighted upon with these ocd visions this gives the book a rare quality a lightness of distance putting everything in perspective with such a breadth of information the language is haunting and beautiful i almost couldn't highlight anything because i wanted to highlight everything my example is early on page 40 \"his love pity and revulsion each claimed her each occupied and was driven from her and even now as he sealed a postage stamp sized square he was afraid that in moments when he broke away his disgust would overwhelm the imprint of his lips \" this language is poetical without being difficult to read with themes like war and fear woven into the description here of akhmed's feelings for his wife this history of the place can prove a challenge as a backdrop it's hard to keep up with at times i'm guessing not too many readers out there have much knowledge of chechnya history and with the stories hopping back and forth during those ten years following the timelines can be frustrating with some slow mindful reading though it's worth figuring out how the history intertwines with the story and never does the book feel like a history textbook i highly recommend this book to everyone this is not a beach read though so be prepared to dedicate some quiet hours","2842":"there are maps to show you how to get to the place where you want to be but no maps that show you how to get to the time when you want to be this book is brilliant and beautifully written it really shows how interwoven and connected we all are it was phenomenal","2843":"i want this book to see some major prize love","2844":"this was a difficult book to get into however as the story unfolded i enjoyed it more the story is based in chechnya during the 1st and 2nd chechnya wars between 1994 and 2004 it revolves around an 8 year old girl havaa whose father is abducted and her home set on fire and sonja the doctor who ends up taking care of havaa this story is vivid in its descriptions of life in the war torn region of chechnya","2845":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2013 04","2846":"this story is delicately profound and captures a lot about human relationships and the intimacy of shame i thought it was really beautifully written and had a gripping story and writing style i had dreams about the characters looking forward to this guy's next book","2847":"more than i ever wanted to know about the ethnic wars in chechnya very sad","2848":"so many words to say so little it took so long to get to the point with the mopey characters i have read many novels set in many war torn countries and have always come away with much understanding about what happened there until now i have very little new information from this novel to help me understand what happened in chechnya and why other reviewers led me to believe i would learn a great deal about chechnya from this book","2849":"a gripping funny as funny as the two chechnyan wars can be that is and intriguing novel from roughly 1994 2004 based on the old saw about abraham willing to sacrifice his son to god cuz god said so seems to be fairly accurate ideas of the bitter wretched laugh to keep from crying horrid deep history of this little understood land where in the 20th and 21st centuries alone unspeakable wars have raged accurate i say as marra does good on describing countryside towns cities mountains armies cultures as we sort of know it he mentions some very good books to read in an afterword author is still in university for god's sake this is an incredible novel for that alone as happy an ending as abraham had too d b c pierre attemped sort of the same in ludmila's broken english but marra does it better relying on is journalism worth dying for final dispatches and el juramento the oath among the few books reporting about chechnya this debut is as good as and reminiscent of pulitzer prize winner the orphan master's son","2850":"goodreads on ipad is very user unfriendly","2851":"there were some really wonderful story lines in this book and it definitely came together better in the second half however i felt like the author assumed a background knowledge of historical events in chechnya that i don't have and it made it confusing to follow the storyline which bounced around overall decent book but not a must read","2852":"beautiful ending to a very difficult to get through book if you have the patience and perseverance to finish it the puzzle of how the characters fit together is complete in the end but it is a tough subject matter and the back and forth of past u0026amp present is not easy to follow","2853":"intense but very good book about the chechynan tragedy and lives weaved around it","2854":"this book would be an amazing achievement for any writer let alone for a young writer publishing his first novel he writes like an angel with amazing insight into his characters both male and female aged from 8 to 80 scenes at the landfill torture center are hard to read but the book affirms the power of love and joy in living against all odds","2855":"blew me away some of the most beautiful and heart wrenching writing i've read","2856":"painful but recommended book about the 2 wars in chechnya the story takes place for the most part from 1991 to 2004 the book represents multiple points of view and incorporates humor as a very welcome relief from the brutality of much of the story it is beautifully written","2857":"i feel like i may like this book better after thinking about it for a couple of months but for now i'm sticking with 3 stars i have to say i learned a lot about the chechen wars and also appreciated how the author didn't completely rely on horrific descriptions of surgery and torture to keep the book moving i thought the writing was pretty good and plot construction was almost brilliant","2858":"lovely and my measly description and praise won't be adequate so just read it","2859":"this is a very well written book and if it had not been such a downer i would have scored it much higher my book clubs put this book back to back with running the rift both of these books are very good but the speak of situations so sad that i had to time share the reading with an uplifting book the world is a difficult place to live i am not sure why anyone does it","2860":"a hauntingly beautiful novel very well written and historically pertinent","2861":"easily the best of 2013 so far","2862":"it didn't grab my straight away but i'm very glad i persevered beautifully written heavily researched and at times emotionally heavy going","2863":" a constellation of vital phenomena is not always an easy read there were a number of people in our book club who couldn't make it to the end - which could be attributable to the number of war books we've had on our palate lately i admit there were moments where after three or four pages i would ask \"where did the author just take me \" but when least expecting it there were times where words became a sensory experience where poetry was put in motion where i was enjoined with description that lingered unlike some historical fictions it wasn't a history lesson although anthony marra in his debut novel gives every impression that he was thorough in his research on modern russian but at first when it sparked his interest as marra claims in the back notes chechnya was a place that he couldn't properly pronounce inevitably the trauma and atrocities of war are part of the story's journey but the reader is connected to people it is the human spirit aspiring for all of the same goals all of us have for life and hope and peace but in the midst of opposing circumstances war is cruel morality is contextual hearts are sometimes hardened our book club wondered if anthony marra had written the last 175 pages first and then went back to fit in the beginning one of our members described the end as ingenious and changed his rating from a 2 to a 4 still the interactions and interdependence of people tell the story decisions are made for the sake of nobility and honour blood lines run deep moments of levity offer humour people are sometimes quick witted ronald reagan and ronald macdonald are confused as one of the same and prayers breathed in one's final moments aspire for a young girl's life to outlast war and only end of natural causes after a long fulfilling life sonya's role in modelling a profession otherwise not held by women helped make that prayer live i would rate the book a 3 5 if i could but just couldn't make the jump to a 4","2864":" this book took hold of me and moved me tremendously i recommend familiarizing yourself with the history of chechnya before starting this country has more land mines than any on the planet the people were displaced to siberia under stalin and came back after wwii there were various ethnic uprisings two wars during the 90's immense destruction no infrastructure left marra manages to gently infuse the history of the country while telling stories of its current inhabitants and how they manage to survive amid all the disappearances murder deprivation he finds hope as soon as i finished it i read it again","2865":"i liked this book and the subject matter but i thought it moved too slowly and was kind of depressing i guess when you're talking about life in a war torn country there really isn't much that isn't depressing i loved the writing style in this book but otherwise it was just ok for me","2866":"i'll be processing this book for awhile it's not an easy read i won't lie but it's beautiful and horrible and powerful","2867":"i approached this book knowing next to nothing about modern day chechnya i knew it was war torn but i had no idea of how people currently live this book is set in the chechnya of check points land mines and frequent disappearances of people they know akhmed a failed physician after witnessing his friend and neighbor be abducted takes his neighbor's young daughter to a hospital for safe keeping the bombed out hospital is run by the only remaining surgeon in the area a very gruff female doctor who is constantly tasked with delivering babies and amputating legs this is an unusual story with vivid characters the lives of these people are difficult and their outcomes are often bleak but there are some truly magical moments as well as some memorable humor i don't know that i'll ever think of turtles or whales the same way one to look out for this is probably one of the best books i've read in a long time","2868":"this was one of the best books that my men's group has read a number of years the writing is exquisite the story fascinating and the history very interesting it is a wonderful book for discussion as there is a lot of nuance to both the history as well as the chronology of the story the characters are very rich while the story takes place over 5 days it is a longer 10 year history that is written in a non linear manner i knew little about chechyna and this book beautifully created a landscape to explore the country","2869":"probably one of the most depressing books i've ever read the last 50 pages will have you balling your eyes out","2870":"a beautifully written emotionally excruciating narrative about a handful of people caught up in the terrible events of the wars in chechnya it had me crying almost continuously for the last fifty pages i'd give it five stars were it not for the sometimes schematic iowa writer's workshop bred flourishes that distracted me from the riveting story","2871":"this was a beautiful book minus 1 star b c i'd often need to re read multiple sentences b c of style ie commas in strange places complex sentence structure without etc","2872":"our book club found the writing very lyrical and nice but the overall story to be quite bleak understandably","2873":" i found my opinions conflicted i didn't really like any of the characters enough to have a particularly vested interest in their outcome however that doesn't mean their stories were not well told when i finished the book i thought it was good but wasn't particularly impressed but over the following days i found my mind wandering back to it and components resonated with me a very powerful story and i'm very glad i read it i enjoyed it in the same way as cellist of sarejevo and the book thief","2874":"$24 95 and in a dozen more countries no small feat for a first novel to me the awkward title is the only flaw everything else in this book is memorable as the world watches the atrocities pile up in syria it is this review first appeared in the waterloo region record sept 7 2013 the title of anthony marra's first novel comes from a definition of 'life' in a russian medical encyclopedia a constellation of vital phenomena the book appeared in may published by random house in canada $24 95 and in a dozen more countries no small feat for a first novel to me the awkward title is the only flaw everything else in this book is memorable as the world watches the atrocities pile up in syria it is instructive to review the history of horror that was chechnya in the 1990s before and after the breakup of the soviet union was it just my turning a deaf ear to that conflict or was the war in chechnya under reported in the west either way i finished this novel both better informed and more empathic to the suffering that war always entails havaa is an eight year old girl who watches hiding in the woods nearby as russian soldiers abduct her father for aiding the chechnan rebels from across the road her father's friend akhmed watches in fear as havaa's house burns to the ground he finds havaa clutching a blue suitcase and decides to take her to the only woman he knows who can offer her sanctuary sonja rabana is the sole remaining doctor in the region's hospital which remains open despite being partially bombed by the russians akhmed is also a doctor who barely graduated and would rather make drawings of his patients than treat them his wife is slipping into dementia so when sonja insists that he help at the hospital in exchange for her caring for havaa he agrees walking the eight miles to and from his home each day a constellation of vital phenomena takes place over just five days with alternating chapters exploring the back stories of each of the characters during the period between 1994 and 2004 havaa's father dokka was the village philosopher who sheltered any and all war refugees who passed through their village his price for this hospitality was to ask each of them for some small token - a photo a button a clump of hair from a deceased son all of which havaa saved in her suitcase he had already been arrested and his fingers were severed when he kept silent he still played chess with khassan the other village intellectual forever working on his multi volume history of chechnya khassen lives with but won't speak to his son who avoided torture by providing names of their rebel neighbours doctor sonja lives in hope that her younger sister natasha will return sonja was a brilliant student who completed her medical training on a scholarship in london her sister disappeared while she was there and was forced into prostitution and drug addiction in romania she finally returned and eventually helped sonja in the shell shocked hospital where she acted as a midwife at havaa's birth but this thread is only one of several remote connections between the pasts of the characters revelations that the reader knows even as they do not khassan's first volume of chechnan history will inspire both sonja and natasha to keep serving their war battered compatriots natasha has again departed and was a guest at dokka's shelter on her way to the border the pistol that dokka gives her will be traced to a colonel's murder and lead to his second arrest historical fiction is a blend of author directed 'fate' amidst the chosen facts of what happened and was recorded constellation is a brilliant combination of fate and facts humanity continues to ignore the lessons of history and civil wars and atrocities against nationalist uprisings still crowd today's headlines a constellation of vital phenomena should be required reading","2875":"wow i'm not sure how to describe this book but the writing is outstanding and i got a huge chechen history lesson i waffle a bit between a 4 vs 5 star review only because it was sometimes so heavy and so quantifiable that it drove me nuts by quantifiable i mean there is a lot of 'sixty six years from now she would be here and three years before that she would be there and 13 hours from now she would do x and 2 minutes ago she thought y it got a bit repetitious with all of the numbers if you liked cutting for stone verghese you will love this book and by the same token if cutting for stone irritated you a bit by the end this will probably do the same","2876":"this broke my heart and destroyed me i loved every minute and every word it felt like the book version of a symphony where the characters are the instruments each coming in to the play their part intertwined with one another it was beautiful be forewarned this will wreck you have tissues handy","2877":" beautiful writing so artistic so meaningful i found myself rereading sentences just for the pleasure of better understanding their meaning or discovering deeper intent the second time what a well researched heartachingly poignant novel of life love and the devastation of a war ravaged country i'm amazed at the amount of history the author was able to incorporate into his setting i have quite a few history books to read now thanks to marra's suggestions at the end of his novel it's a tragic story which is why the rating isn't higher but a beautiful work well worth the time it took to read it","2878":"quite a depressing read overall but that was to be expected since it took place in chechnya the character development is excellent and the way their lives are woven together would definitely take some mapping diagrams to keep it all straight a very real account of the wars in chechnya and what it is like to live there","2879":"by far one of the best debut novels i have read in a very long time think the tiger's wife meets the orphan's son meets city of thieves","2880":"i want to give this well written and researched book a 5 but just didn't find it as compelling i e pick it up and read at any break as a 5 should be plus i don't like the title the setting is war torn chechnya feds against the rebs there are ied accidents and bombed out homes and villages - pretty sobering there are 4 family stories interwoven while intriguing some of the connections between among them can seem a bit too contrived however the characters are wonderfully developed my favorite is the woman surgeon doctor - tough hard working needs to chill out and does once in awhile she has a love hate with her sister who has been through hell even the guy who rats out his friends is a good man in many ways the book ultimately is about love and caring for others even though several of the characters are killed by the feds after torture the artist doctor who tenderly cares for his invalid wife is one example of this love but there are many others","2881":"loved it i love books movies that can find the room in a grim grim subject to use levity in a way that doesn't diminish the grimness - in fact it emphasises it as humanity and love are juxtaposed against cruelty and evil the timeline was challenging in places but really cleverly done i really liked that in one paragraph we could see past present and future the characters were complex and real i despised ramzan but as more about him was revealed it was not possible to just write him off loved it ti love books movies that can find the room in a grim grim subject to use levity in a way that doesn't diminish the grimness - in fact it emphasises it as humanity and love are juxtaposed against cruelty and evil tthe timeline was challenging in places but really cleverly done i really liked that in one paragraph we could see past present and future tthe characters were complex and real i despised ramzan but as more about him was revealed it was not possible to just write him off other characters similar - the circumstances they were in magnified the consequences of their decisions as in all the other war books that i've read my conclusion is war is a bad thing i found the torture scenes almost impossible to read had to put the book down several times and come back to it more","2882":" late one snowy night eight year old havaa's father dokka is violently taken from their home in a small village in chechnya as she watches from a hiding place in the woods also watching is their neighbor and family friend akhmed knowing that dokka has been abducted by the feds for aiding chechen rebels and that his daughter is not safe akhmed rescues havaa and takes her to a nearly abandoned hospital in the nearest city where he hopes the only remaining doctor sonja will allow them refuge the overburdened surgeon reluctantly allows them to stay in the partially bombed hospital partly due to akhmed's false claims of being a skilled doctor in addition to the strain of running a hospital in a war torn country on her own sonja is struggling with the disappearance of her sister natasha a year before meanwhile khassan an elderly pariah who spends his days with a pack of wild dogs is distressed by the actions of his son ramzan who is the informer whose betrayal led to dokka's abduction a constellation of vital phenomena spans from 1994 to 2004 encompasses two wars and weaves together the stories of its six main characters revealing surprising connections between them this is a very complex story and the fragmentation of marra's non linear storytelling sometimes made me confused about where i was in the plot especially because i don't really know anything about chechen history the concept of weaving these stories together in the context of chechnya's wars was very ambitions and despite my occasional confusion i think marra pulled it off really well the characters' stories are so intricate and it was amazing to see the pieces of this story fall into place and fit perfectly together like pieces of a puzzle each character is well developed and marra does an excellent job of portraying their multiple dimensions for example although we first see ramzan as a horrible untrustworthy character who is ready to inform on any villager who crosses him the reader eventually sees how he came to be that way and must feel sympathy for him i loved seeing the characters' histories and relationships unfold as marra unveiled more and more of their pasts additionally the writing is rich and beautiful and i loved basking in marra's sentences as i've already mentioned a constellation of vital phenomena is a very complex novel and i definitely plan to re read it so that i can more fully grasp the connections and straighten out the order of events in my head i thought this was an excellent compassionate book about the strength of love in the face of war and an impressive debut novel i greatly look forward to reading anything anthony marra writes in the future i received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review more book reviews at books speak volumes","2883":"this heartbreaking story about survival in war torn chechnya takes you into the hearts of people who's motives may seem clear to their loved ones but are in some cases very far from what is assumed haunting and brilliant","2884":"subtly gorgeous overtly devastating","2885":"trying to find the words after finishing this book is nearly impossible marra brings a depth to his story and characters that wreaks havoc on your emotions in the final chapters this is truly one of the most beautiful books i have ever read","2886":"a wonderful read which truly captures the human spirit initially i did not find myself drawn into the novel mostly due to the bouncing back and forth between gaps of time that really happens in the first hundred pages this continuous shifting seemed to almost jolt me and diminish the various narratives in the novel however later on as the details all seemed to come together i could not stop reading","2887":"this was a beautiful book sad but uplifting it reminded me of a day in the life of ivan denisovich it shows the resilience of people in heartbreaking situations it made me cry and smile you should read it for the authors first book really magnificent accomplishment i ll be watching to see what he does next","2888":"so much to savor about this book glad it was a book group pick i would not have chosen to read a book about chechnya 1994 2004 that would surely include descriptions of hardship torture and other violence i love the author's observations about daily life allegiance loss family and friendship some examples p81 the things in his life that caused him the most sorrow were the things he'd lived with the longest and now that everything was falling they became the pillars that held him had he a thirty two year old toothache rather than a thirty two year old son he would have treasured it the same p144 dokka explains to his little girl havaa the draft soldiers in blue uniforms are scared teenagers they are what we might call the victims of absurdism they would surrender if you waved a soup spoon at them most can't find chechnya on a map p145 the shame of his firstborn son a boy who could have been anything but chose to be a puppeteer pp146 147 no one wanted to risk moving the unexploded shells that lay scattered across the village so the next morning havaa's parents among other villagers pried toilet bowls from the rubble of collapsed houses and dragging them upside down and two by two gently set them over the unexploded shells so many dozens of inside down toilet bowls crowded the street that cars wouldn't pass for weeks and in that time she would occasionally hear the overdue explosions the shrapnel ringing within the ceramic but those bowls the one decent legacy of the soviet union never broke p184 natasha reads sonja's medical dictionary only one entry supplied an adequate definition and she circled it with red ink and referred to it nightly life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation p271 sonja tries to describe natasha to akhmed how could an instrument as blunted as language express one as strange and fleeting as natasha metaphors failed her natasha could not be summarized what she possessed were losses the loss of natasha's laugh the loss of natasha's scorn the loss of natasha's begrudging love and as a phantom limb can ache and tickle her lost natasha was still laughing still scornful still loving begrudgingly burgeoning with enough life to make sonja wonder if she herself was the one disappeared now i have to read leo tolstoy's hadji murad","2889":"i had a tough time getting into this book but once i did i really enjoyed it beautiful story and beautiful writing","2890":"anthony marra is the winner of a whiting award a pushcart prize and is a stegner fellow and attended the iowa writer's workshop it shows in his writing set in chechnya from 1994 2004 check out the reviews by goodreads readers most all are 5 s warning some pretty horrific things happen the situation in chechnya was is awful","2891":"sometimes i read a book that i consider important and this is one of them i can't look at any news story about strife and civil war without thinking about the affect of these events on the people living in these areas this book was beautifully written and compelling and described the lives of the common person caught in the middle of revolution and how their lives and decisions are drastically altered","2892":"very good read it","2893":"devastating historical fiction offering the reader heartwrenching glimpses of war torn chechnya allah help them beautifully written for a first novel","2894":"gorgeous story can't stop thinking about it","2895":"most thought provoking beautiful and moving piece of fiction i've read in a while i didn't want to finish it","2896":"anthony marra is a master storyteller this book is beautifully written and researched i laughed cried and learned","2897":"wow incredibly complex and beautifully written piece of art it is a book that needs to be read uninterrupted for big swaths of time i would recommend it to people who love a very well written historical novel it is not an easy read but so well worth it cannot wait to discuss this with my book club the metaphors and language culture and history were so incredibly weaved into a fantastic story tears mine humor a few of the characters interspersed throughout","2898":" this book is extraordinary the story of a few people affected by the chechen war all real complex humans who navigate a war torn region with strength intelligence and perseverance the characters are rich vibrant and compelling each have their motivations and who crisscross each other's lives at the smallest and largest moments marra treats his characters with empathy and respect giving even ramzan a traitor to his community a story that explains even if it never forgives sonja one of the main characters a doctor is particularly strong refreshing that she relies on herself to survive what's most important is marra's writing style which draws you in immediately to the story and pulls you along with beautifully written passages that celebrate life as much as the story does this is a must read for people who love reading","2899":"it took me a while to get into this book largely because i was unfamiliar with the history of war torn chechnya but once i got into the characters it all started coming together and i could not put the book down the title although difficult to remember has meaning definitely a book that stays with you","2900":"anthony marra's first book is set in war torn chechnya during the late 1990s and early 2000s but reads like a sweeping classic novel his ability to capture the voices of his vastly different characters all struggling to stay alive stands out from the first few pages","2901":"the worst part of this review is that i cannot give this book 10 stars it is easily the best book i have read in years the beautiful and haunting writing and lives of everyday citizens attempting to survive the chechnyan war it was magnificently written it took me a month to read because i dreaded having to finish it i knew this from the first chapter bravo to anthony marra on this debut novel i can only hope he has much more coming for us","2902":"this book was like a marathon so hard to get through at times but i am so glad i finished it so well written and amazing how everything ties together at the end","2903":"let me start by saying that i really liked this book but war is so depressing i have read too many depressing books recently and i really need something light and uplifting okay that being said this story about life during war in chechnya is well written thoughtful full of interesting characters who come together in unexpected ways i liked the character development i just wish it didn't have to be so sad","2904":"i really enjoyed this book the way the author went back and forth between characters past and present lives kept me interested while parts of the way the story wrapped up were predictable other parts surprised me","2905":"this is a book about the war in chechnya it is often violent and sometimes reads like a history book boring for me the last 30 pages are pretty good but not enough to make up for the first 350 the one thing i really liked was the forward flashes about where the characters would be later on after the book ends","2906":"hailed as a masterpiece with good reason violent yet tender portrayal of important recent fictional history","2907":"this book was touched me deeply you can feel what the characters were feeling however many of the segments about ramzan were slow and somewhat boring","2908":"this was a weird book for me i had a sort of love hate relationship with it i didn't particularly like the chapter to chapter character changes and i definitely did not like the parts on torture and deprivation i also did some speed reading thru the history of chenchen sp but i did like most of the characters and their connections the book is very well written it just wasn't my cup of tea","2909":"i loved this book it takes place in post war chechnya it's a heartbreaking story full of sacrifice and betrayal i highly recommend it","2910":"this is a truly lovely moving story the beginning is some what slow and the subject matter chechnya deals with people living in very desperate and bleak times by the end however it has taken the reader through all permutations of humanity from the most base and violent to the enduring power of love a ttruly amazing book that left me in tears at its conclusion","2911":"this is a beautifully written book the way the author weaves together the lives of the disparate characters is so well done and i suppose there is hope at the end but the slog through all the adversity and inhumanity to get to that ray of hope is just dispiriting maybe i am burned out on these kinds of books but as excellent as i found the writing i had to make myself finish because i just couldn't stand to witness the sadness and cruelty although perhaps that is the author's point","2912":"haunting i wish i had read up on the history of chechnya before reading this","2913":"just read this book it's the perfect combination of compelling story line quirky ideas and interesting construction you'll get a brief history of chechnya some laugh out loud moments and some sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach moments you'll not want to put it down and so read into the wee hours only to regret doing so because then there's less left it's the best book i've read in a long while","2914":"if you liked this book read hadji murad by leo tolstoy it covers russia's war with the chechnya area in the 1850's it's a short book but worth a read to learn how little things have really changed over time","2915":"shattering haunting and beautiful","2916":"my sister has been recommending this book to me for what seems like 6 months she was absolutely right to recommend it it's a beautiful heart breaking bewildering story that breates life into its namesake","2917":"this book will hold your soul","2918":"it took me a good bit to get into this book but around half way through wow","2919":"very moving and very well written would like to give it 6 stars since it's even better than some of the others i rated with 5 i'm going to keep this book for a long time","2920":" heartbreaking it took me a while to get into this book as i kept finding myself mixing up the characters and not knowing why i should care probably my fault for reading a chapter or two right before bed when i'm not my sharpest but just when i was about to give up on it about a third of the way in the interrelationships and general trajectory of the story plot might be too strong a word became clearer and the characters took better shape there are weak men and strong women in this story as well as strong men and weak women many with non stereotypical roles that i appreciated greatly a constellation of vital phenomena is a story of perpetual disappointment and loss seemingly hopeless and tragic narrative page after page yet the people populating this part of the world chechnya during a particular period of time survive it is truly amazing how unbreakable the human spirit is and how persistent we are at eking it out in spite of the low odds of survival much less happiness or contentment there are a handful of main characters here each approaching the challenges of living in a senselessly and seemingly endlessly war zone in a different way these are not only victims they are in some respects perpetrators and enablers bystanders small scale subversives for not simply laying down and giving up these characters make love they protect the innocent they make art and tend the wounded and bed bound and the refugees even the stray dogs in spite of all the senseless hell around them they are still good even the bad one is deep down good just more broken than the rest there are overt references to abraham sacrificing isaac and other religious and spiritual allegories from both christianity and islam yet they are not intrusive to the story at all those stories are so important even in modern times because we still struggle with the core ideas of identify faith obedience loyalty and love marra writes beautifully elegantly even lyrically and in spite of the often stark and ugly subject matter he succeeds in painting a beautiful portrait of the world as well as the people inhabiting it i kept asking myself how i would deal if i shared a day to day reality with these characters and i honestly don't know how i would or if i could marra's characters are in many respects powerless over anything but their own movements their own small decisions but he makes it clear that even in those small acts people demonstrate tremendous courage and sacrifice they keep their humanity in spite of the enormous challenges amen to that","2921":" wow i didn't know much about this book just buying it off of someone's recommendation at powell's when i was visiting seattle it took me several months to actually start it after reading the first chapter or so at a cafe in seattle it was truly a random buy and one i honestly regretted at first having only limited space to take books home from the trip but just wow one of my all time best random buys as far as books go this is such a beautiful beautiful book i found myself continuously underlining passages just so i could come back to them later if i could write well this is how i would want to write this man can write some mean prose the story itself is beautiful too and is interesting from a historical and human perspective the author paints so many vivid pictures for the reader just seemingly simple things from everyday life made more vibrant and newer in a sense i found myself laughing and crying which rarely happens with contemporary literature these days i was riding to bus to work today when i finished the book and found myself crying in part at how beautiful the ending was but also in mourning for losing the opportunity to read this anew everyday i hate comparing authors because this is truly a unique voice but if you are a fan of jonathan safran foer check this book out","2922":"i imagine this book will stick with me for quite awhile the writing was beautiful with many phrases i stopped to reread and while the setting war torn chechnya was often devastating there were still small moments of humanity and kindness to be found i enjoyed the complexity of the characters and their interactions with each other as the story moved along a timeline between 1994 and 2004 definitely one of the best books i've read so far this year","2923":"beautiful compelling in a way that i find too few books are found myself crying in airplanes and airports 4 separate times","2924":"the book of 2013 for me and maybe even the current year haunting","2925":"very good storytelling i got this through powells' indiespensable subscription so it came with a bonus author interview that was illuminating there were some subtle religious allusions i hadn't caught on to author anthony marra is american but studied in russia and visited chechnya he did a lot of research to write this book and it shows he also went through five drafts before arriving at this finished product this is the best work of fiction i've read so far this year beautiful language a steady plot deft character development but most importantly he avoided stooping to emotional manipulation to get the reader hooked the only thing i'm meh about is the cover art and the font on the cover i think it's a little too whimsical and juvenile marra did manage to keep a good balance between whimsy and gloom this is a book about war but i just don't think the cover sells the story within update i chose this book to be the march read for my book club and it received positive reviews one of the members admitted that she bought the book read the front flap and told her daughter i'm not going to read this she said she bought it while on a trip and almost left it behind but by the time she had finished it it was one of her favorite books","2926":"beautifully written but oh so sad","2927":"i couldn't finish it","2928":" beautiful and transfixing marra introduces us to ordinary people making complex decisions over the course of five days in 2004 chechnya he reveals the personal stories the government policies the displacement and brutal wars that shaped these people through a series of flashbacks it's a quick read with incredibly rich characters i was amazed at the scope of experiences the impossible decisions people have to make when they and their families are threatened with death that marra conveyed through several interconnected families he truly brought alive the everyday experiences of people that i previously only heard about through grim headlines","2929":" this is one of the best books that i've read in years it's is a terrifying yet exquisite accounting of war torn chechnya a place that few people would find on a map but more that that it is a story of human pathos resiliancy grief and humor in other words humanity in the face of unimaginable horror the ending fills the reader with hope for the future i compare this book to another that dealt with the same type of horrors inflicted on humanity perla by carolina de robertis another beautifully rendered work i will look forward to more works by this very talented author","2930":" here in fresh graceful prose is a profound story that dares to be as tender as it is ghastly marra's first novel opens in 2004 in a tiny blood soaked village of chechnya when the father of an 8 year old girl is abducted by federalist thugs a peasant doctor is determined to save his old friend's daughter by spiriting her away to an all but abandoned hospital in a nearby town the experiences of these neighbors come to us in flashbacks that reach back years as the elements of this complicated plot begin to align in ways too tragic and moving to anticipate the past resolves into focus the future is freighted with anguish but flecked with hope the novel made our 2013 top 10 list here's ron charles's review http www washingtonpost com enterta","2931":" this book grew on me my favorite part about this author's story is how we learned about the characters and what happens to them in the future this reminded me of the season finally of six feet under how we learned what became of their lives in the last few minutes of the show although it takes most of the book to learn the whole story of the main characters we learn about how their lives came to be both though their perspective and from the other characters there were a few points in the book i was shocked to learn something significant about the characters and how their stories connect it was sad to read about the lives of the characters through two wars in chechnya i think that may have had been why it took me awhile to get into the book the destruction of everything was so sad","2932":" outstanding it's a gift to read a book so well written that you force yourself to slow down so that you don't miss the poetic imagery never overdone never contrived that illuminates the human condition while advancing the plot i marveled at the authors skill and talent throughout the whole reading experience it's not so much a book about war torn chechnya as it is about the pull between good and evil and the lasting impact born from personal decisions it's an incredibly relatable book that sheds innumerable insights on this vital phenomena that is called life","2933":"this is one of those stories that can classed as haunting it is set in the years 1994 2004 in chechnya as historical fiction it is very informative the author's list of books that he based the story on illustrate the level of research he performed it is the kind of novel that is very difficult to read because it tells about how extremely cruel people can be toward one another violence is graphically depicted yes it is war with sex trafficking too in countries beyond chechnya it is haunting because there but for fortune go i i found myself thinking a lot about the story and fervently counting my blessings it begins with the 2004 abduction of dokka whose wife had died a couple years earlier i think it was a couple of years one down side of the novel is the amount of jumping around in time that it does not only back and forth between years but also between months in one year it could be that my old brain had a more difficult time with this than others may dokka sent his daughter havaa age 8 to hide in the woods when the russians came for him in the middle of the night dokka's buddy and neighbor akhmed retrieves havaa from the woods and takes her to the only 'safe' place he can think of the hospital in the town nearby there is only one doctor sonja and one nurse left sonja reluctantly agrees that havaa can stay with her the remainder of the story involves only five days in the life of these characters however more time is covered by the larger story of the characters' lives and chechen history through flashbacks the characters are intricately entwined as evidenced by natasha sonja's sister who was present at havaa's birth but turns up in 2003 as a refugee at dokka's door he took in hundreds of refugees on their way to the mountains i won't go in to the details as it would be a spoiler but the interweaving of these lives can only be explained by the very small size of the village marra has a beautiful way with words in a letter to havaa from an old man of the village khassan about her parents just prior to her birth it is written perhaps our deepest love is already described within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written for their entire lives even before they met your mother and father held their love for you inside their hearts like an acorn holds an oak tree you were their rain and sun their morning and night i will complain that he has a habit of digressing on details of people that exist in the story for only one page the use of foreshadowing on characters that are not really in the action was very distracting and near the end of the story it was actually annoying i thought that he is simply so clever and full of ideas that he can't stop himself from adding sentences where they are not necessary i really did not want to know that a man named said ended up living his entire life with the offspring 882 of the cats his mother had taken care of before her death really","2934":"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones set during the chechen conflict the book follows 8 year old havaa who after her father is disappeared is whisked away by her neighbour akhmed to a crumbling hospital where she meets the grim surgeon sonja a host of other characters float in an ever connected periphery -- but all this is just the book jacket synopsis covering the who what where i won't say it's irrelevant but these are just the facts of the story it's the writing that's the star here anthony marra hadn't reached 30 when he wrote this his first novel and it's incredible there are entire paragraphs that just fucking devastated me these characters are defined by what they have lost the people that have disappeared from their lives as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there just some incredible writing throughout","2935":"a great journey the characters are fascinating and the writing is extraordinary","2936":"fabulous a perfect book beautiful writing and a wonderful story","2937":"deep and dark but a beautifully told story of life on the edge of civilization anyone who's walked through a war zone lived long in the third world or endured the hardships of totalitarianism will understand this from the inside out compassion love and tenderness break through the violence cruelty and insanity which surround the unforgettable characters marra paints with such intimacy and vibrancy an amazing first book from this young author","2938":"i'm only 70 pages into this book but i think it's going to be great well written interesting subject matter with touches of humor possibly one of the best books i've ever read hard to read due to the subject matter but immensely moving and so well written i was moved as much by the words as i was by the story incredible","2939":"i loved everything about it except the shuttling back and forth between time despite the chapter headings indicating where in the twelve year span of the novel the narrator found himself i was confused because the characters were practically all the same the wars were almost identical and the existential questions were unwavering as was the beauty of the writing and images i was reminded of the book thief in fact i am troubled by the extraordinary beauty of these two books in which death surveys and defines life while i have no doubt that there is an exact perspective that illuminates the beauty in even a putrefying corpse as this novel is essentially the autopsy of a decomposing country chechnya the insistence on the connection between death and life torture chambers and epiphany reveals as much about the artist's objectives and the artist's wonderful rendering of the human psyche as it does on any actual link uncharacteristically i find myself reluctant to pronounce one way or another on this link the artifice is there but i have glimpsed death and it is sublime in its awfulness","2940":"best book i've read this year","2941":"a beautifully written book marra took me to chechnya a place i barely knew existed and immersed me into a story that showed me the perils of the politics there this is a novel where horrible unjust things happen to good people and the scars they bear after those things happen the characters are rich and complex marra tells a story at a particular point in time creating a sense of dread that anything could happen to any one of these characters at any time the tension of waiting for the feds to show up and take a character away for no seeming reason is hard to stomach and happens regularly yet he employs a technique i've seen rarely but seems to crop up in a few books this summer in the narrative the omniscient persona gives us a quick view into where a character heads and ends up as if to assure the reader that a character goes on or to share another's internal life during a discussion of where the female doctors sister who the doctor has been searching for the entire novel is with the hunted little girl who is the central character moving the plot of the novel the doctor discovers the girl had an encounter with the sister years before as the doctor is questioning the girl and she answers the girls future unfolds from the narrator during the urgency of the conversation was she alone yes she was alone in twenty eight years and seven months at a limnology conference in cologne the girl would meet the man she was to marry nine years later at the age of forty six she would have her one and only child in the same maternity ward she was born in a boy to carry her father's name hers would be the second hands to hold him at the age of sixty eight she would hold her first grandson also to carry her father's name hers would be the third hands and she left your house i said good bye and she left pg 174this wasn't an easy novel to read characters are taken from their homes by the feds tortured killed characters are wounded physically and emotionally that the reader knows and is attached to but in the end there is some solace even though it made me cry when a book moves me to tears that is something in fact i originally rated this novel 4 stars but just reread the last chapter and up'd it to 5 it's horrifying and devastating and haunting and just a bit hopeful and very well done","2942":"this was an illuminating and heartbreakingly beautiful book there is so much real history here and mara brings compassion and understanding to a conflict that is terrifyingly murky i loved this novel and look forward to his next one be warned though this is a commitment but one you'll be happy you made","2943":"i listened to this book but i wish i had read it the males names sounded so much alike i was confused whoe they were talking about most of the time","2944":"not for the fainthearted this book tells of the suffering and occasional triumphs of several people who live during the wars in chechnya the author writes a convincing story","2945":"this novel published in 2013 was the author's first novel and is an impressive work anthony marra has such an interesting style of telling the story able to give you snapshots into the future of the character as he is writing about the present the words easily flow into past present and future the main story takes place in a very short timeframe five days during the second war in chechnya though the novel itself spans many years telling about some characters during the first chechen war in a small village in chechnya russian soldiers forcibly remove a man from his home while the 8 year old daughter is hiding in the woods the neighbor a doctor finds the little girl and takes her to a nearly abandoned hospital to find a safe place for her because the soldiers will be returning to look for her there he meets the only doctor left in the hospital a woman who has a missing sister the story is about family love loss war betrayal you'll find the meaning of the novel's title a constellation of vital phenomena in the book a definition that the female doctor's sister found in a russian medical dictionary it is an incredibly sad story with all the loss and torture though it gives a personal perspective of the chechen war which has also been called russia's forgotten war","2946":"tough book to read both because of the dense writing and the story itself","2947":"i struggle with reading historical or political literature of any kind so one of the things that i found most appealing about this book was the intertwined stories of ordinary people living in a war zone while living through two wars back to back i loved each of the characters and found myself hoping for the best outcomes but never disappointed in the reality of how things played out a profound novel not only in what it says but also in what lies between the lines","2948":"i struggled through the first half of this book and i truly thought i would not finish it which almost never happens then i mentioned to a friend that i was struggling with it and she said it was one of the best books she's ever read and that i should stick with it boy am i glad i did i loved this book if not for the slow start it would've been a rare 5 star for me it is exactly my kind of book dark deep thought provoking with a bit of hope for humanity thanks jessica","2949":"revised upwards my rating months on a lot of the book remains with me vividly which is unusual and it's the parts in the forest in the pits the stories of the men more than the women thinking of it now it is an astonishing book heartbreaking and cruel beyond belief but wonderfully written with clear characters makes me feel weak not to have had the guts to put it out there with a high rating for others to step up to read it deserves it there you are a sit on the fence 3 stars despite nearly everyone else rating it at 4 or 5 stars for me it was such a depressing story and had so little uplift set during the second chechnya war in 2004 with flashbacks to events years earlier the narrative weaves well and certain of the characters are fascinating just not a book i'd be passing on to friends","2950":" the history of ethnic strife in chechnya is long and confusing anthony marra bypasses the facts and figures and takes us directly into the lives of ordinary people trying to make a meaningful existence amid the rubble and death and ongoing violence living in a state of constant trauma changes all the rules young and old ethnic russians and chechen muslims the characters' lives intersect in such a way that they cannot hate each other with the intensity prescribed by their ancestors with a complete absence of emotional manipulation marra takes us back and forth in the lives of the characters moving along a timeline from 1994 to 2004 as they move in and out of periods of war we see the events that led them to their current behaviors their choices begin to make more sense when we see how they have suffered and the sins they have committed in the name of self preservation these are the sins for which they are now seeking absolution whether from a higher power or from those they have wronged i'm a picky reader and my friends tell me i'm a hard grader when i rate books i'm always skeptical when i hear raves about an up and coming author who's supposed to be the latest writing phenomenon i always have to give them a chance though because once in awhile they turn out to be as talented as promised anthony marra is one of those who deserves all the praise he's receiving if you like serious literary fiction this is a novel you won't want to miss addendum if you think you're too much of a history dolt to enjoy this book don't let that stop you a quick overview here http en wikipedia org wiki chechnya with focus on the first chechen war interwar period and second chechen war will give you enough context to understand the impact on the characters the economy and the infrastructure of the country","2951":" i had a hard time rating this novel i debated between a 3 5 to 5 star rating i ended up giving it a 3 5 rating because while the story was good and moving it didn't connect on a personal level with me a constellation of vital phenomena takes place between 1994 and 2004 in chechnya the stories goes back and forth in time detailing the lives of sonja an ethnic russian doctor natasha her beautiful but scarred sister akhmed an artistic but horrible doctor khassan a father silently rebelling against his traitorous son ramzan and dokka the father of havaa the story starts when dokka is taken by the feds and akhmed and havaa escape to sonja's barely functioning hospital as the story unfolds you find how the characters are all connected and how the war has destroyed their lives i liked how the story moved in time and the author's writing style the story is beautiful and terrible and sad chechnya is a current hot bed of terrorists and after reading this story it is not surprising the story sheds light on war torn nations russian nationalism imperialism and how war can make you do horrible things","2952":"wow what a great author this book is so dense with facts and characters and emotion it really needs to be read by someone who does not have such an interrupted life as mine i had trouble keeping track of character names and the intertwining of them all i so appreciate this historical type of novel though do read it it seems important somehow","2953":"it's been a long time since characters have so held my attention and captured quirky human nuance that i spent every minute away from the book wondering what they were up to i devoured this book and highly recommend it","2954":"3 pages in and it was obvious this was going to be a very important book not just because it's well written because of the way it took a small group of characters and told a universal story of love loss politics and change i am woefully ignorant on russian politics so much of the content was new to me but that didn't matter this book was painful and beautiful at the same time it was raw in places it was spare in its descriptions but there was a vividness to them that made each place real i didn't love it partially because it was so painful but i know this book made an impact and i will be revisiting scenes for a long time to come","2955":"i read this book at the recommendation of a friend and i'm not gonna lie about halfway through and i wasn't loving it it wasn't bad but just didn't really keep my attention and wasn't jaw dropping as i had hoped so why the 5 stars well because something changed i'm here to tell you that if you set out reading this book stay committed marra sets up several back stories and then past the halfway point begins to reveal how carefully woven they all are it's really quite beautifully done and once he starts revealing the tricks he's played on the reader i couldn't put the book down in the end the book turned out to be phenomenal and i would definitely recommend it one word of caution it does take place during the chechnyan wars and addresses topics of war time torture it's not too gruesome but sensitive readers should be forewarned","2956":"great parable about change seeing it coming being prepared for it changing our behavior and getting on board with change when it happens","2957":"wow what a beautifully written albeit harrowing novel i am amazed this is a debut novel anthony marra writes like a seasoned author","2958":"this book is amazing it's one of the best books i've read in awhile and the first that's made me cry since the god of small things","2959":" i don't think anyone could read this book remain unaffected the setting is chechnya 1994 through 2004 and about life there through two wars with the russians a real war through the eyes of fictional characters with shifts of time between the two chechen wars but the main plot covers just five days in 2004 a constellation of vital phenomena begins in a small war torn village in chechnya in 2004 eight year old havaa watches as her father is abducted by russian forces akhmed a family friend and neighbor finds her and takes to her a nearby hospital for refuge where he makes an agreement with the only doctor there sonja to take havaa into her care and through these characters we are transported to war torn chechnya as anthony marra slowly carefully reveals how their lives are connected and as the story unfolds we learn more about these wonderful complex characters who are trying to survive in a land where one wrong step can detonate a land mine the torture and pain they face in the story is horrific yet it is so common in their lives that it doesn't even shock them ordinary people doing their extraordinary best under the stress of war in chechnya living life as defined from and old definition life a constellation of vital phenomena-organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptationthe chechen conflict is a heavy topic to be honest i didn't know much about chechnya before reading this novel but i was still able to connect to the story beautifully told with lyrical phrases poetic sentences and written in such a way that i felt as if was right there with the characters trying to survive with them in a war torn corner of the world while reading i never once forgot how fortunate i am to live in this country absolutely loved this one highly recommend","2960":" i was deeply touched by anthony marra's book about the people struggling to hold onto their humanity and dignity while trying to survive and cope in war torn chechnya marra manages to hold us in the historical arc from past to future even as he maintains our focus on the present moment sometimes the looking ahead technique he uses is all that makes the present moment bearable life does go on it is a lovely book a terrible book a book in which everything happens just as it did and does and must i was continually surprised by the plot resolutions the way the threads of disparate lives came together in random unremarked stunningly poignant ways we as readers see more than any one character ever can and what we are witness to is nothing less than the spirit of a people my favorite characters were akhmed and khassan i especially loved the way they passed like ships in the night through ula's perception ula who simply saw the simple truth and natasha of all the natashas i was cheering her on even as i knew what had to happen to her my only regret is that the advanced reader copy i was given to review was not a kindle edition because i tend to read in snatches and found myself wanting to search back to remind myself of who this or that person was i'm unsure enough now of the relationships that i must--and i do mean must--read the book again that's how captivating intricate and haunting it was i've got to go back and find akim and alu if dr sonja had picked up anthony marra's book and read as she always did the last pages first i think she would have gone back to the beginning to read the whole book without spoiling it let me say that i don't think the book could have ended in a truer or happier way than it did a very satisfying read to say the least","2961":"best novel i've read in long time a rather grim look at the war in chetnya seen through the eyes of what they call collateral damage ...","2962":"this book lived up to its publicity and more as i read it i often forgot where i was and became completely drawn into the story anthony marra weaves together the stories of individuals and families as they do their best to survive in war torn chechnya this book will become a classic i'm sure","2963":"surprisingly good book learned a lot about chechnya and the wars there some beautiful writing","2964":"he title comes from \"the medical dictionary of the union of sov this a story of people living and dying amidst the chaos of war but it is much more than a war story both the characters and the plot are complex and deep love is of unfathomable depth and yet residing as it does in humans is flawed evil is of unfathomable depth cruelty and torture at their worst have as their end purpose the enjoyment of inflicting of pain itself the setting is chechnya the time span is 1994 to 2004 tthe title comes from \"the medical dictionary of the union of soviet physicians\" in it the entry for \"life\" reads \"a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" the book is not without hope perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so its object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written tmarra has made complex characters come alive and has built a complex plot both of which taken together place the reader amidst war torn chechnya - a place that is painful to be but which gives the reader so much to take away with himself herself my only problem with the book is that the narrative is not told chronologically marra gives the reader much needed help by including the year in each chapter heading some chapters continue the timeline of the previous but many don't for each that didn't i had to reorient myself as to where each character was at that point in his her life","2965":"this book published just after we all started hearing about chechens again and while we've had to wait too long for a book to open up the conflict in chechnya to us this one is just about perfect one feels great sympathy for all of the characters even the worst of them the landscape is exquisitely drawn the effect of the long protated struggle is thoughtfully expressed and it all results in an unforgettable book","2966":" hard to read at times both because of the disturbing content as well as the complicated history i'll admit i wondered early on if i would have the stamina and sophistication as a reader to get through it i'm so happy i stuck with it by the middle of the book i was completely engrossed powerful writing beautiful story one i won't soon forget i would never have thought i'd say i want to learn more about chechnya and it's people but this book brought both so vividly to life i'm now eager to know more","2967":"an incredible book hard to believe the author isn't chechnyan or russian he did great research the characters are very real i will read it again as i know i missed some things","2968":"absolutely loved this book one of my favorites of the year set in a small village in chechnya this story covers the lives of a small group of people through both chechen wars but the book doesn't delve into the politics of the wars who is fighting whom or what were the causes or issues it's the story of how people in this community try to live their daily lives through the horrors of war some of the images still haunt me like the way the villagers used toilet bowls to cover unexploded mines to keep people from tripping them or how people brought into the detention pits carved their names into the dirt walls and when they were taken away to be executed the other prisoners would pray in front of the names for a day and finally rub out those names haunting and memorable","2969":"a brilliant novel about people and faces in war torn chechnya","2970":"this was great fiction and a real history lesson about a war i knew little of","2971":"it has been a long time since i have read a new release that was as ambitious in scope as beautifully crafted and as moving as mr marra's novel i didn't want to put it down i occasionally read it in 2 or 3 minute bursts at work always finding a good place to stop usually after any given paragraph at first it seemed odd that the author employed the perspective of the uber omniscent narrator projecting scenarios and outcomes onto characters in the novel beyond the internal time period and into the not so near future i came to realize that mr marra was just bending some of the rules of fiction that seem solid but may deserve to be bent in the same way that einstein saw light as a flowing substance affected by an unseen and mysterious gravity field not unlike water in a stream but in a sub atomic way marra might not be einstein but i am looking forward to his next book these characters jump out from behind black and white and lodge themselves in your brain with their faces eyes limbs or lack of scars and all that is both admirable and faulty within the human spirit marra treats each character with respect and care the narrative and plot move along driven by a hundred forms of emotion and nuance it feels like i have been privy to this sad but still beautiful world of war in chechnya this is a tale that is universal and deserves to be told told is was brilliantly my understanding of post soviet union eastern europe and chechnya may not be too much more than from the scattered news reports of the 90's but my faith in our shared spirit as humankind has been reflected upon and expanded two russian women i knew years ago once remarked that i looked like a chechnyan rebel while i was wearing a balaclava for cold weather bicycling i was unsure what kind of connotation this joking comment carried it is good to know or remember that chechnyan rebels were people responding to a complicated geopolitical situation not just fighters who hid their faces behind balaclavas","2972":"i wasn't a huge fan at the beginning but i found this to be a heartbreakingly beautifully written book even though i don't usually care for a novel where the timeline jumps backward and forward the stories of all the characters unravel into a seamlessly complete whole in the same manner of the road hard to read at times but with a modicum of hope and so profound a must read","2973":" despite knowing that i had to wake up at 6am this morning i stayed up past midnight to finish this book one of my absolute favorites of 2013 deeply researched and reconstructed like the pencil mural of city park on the boarded up window of the 4th floor maternity ward marra brings to life a world of unfathomable brutality and sublime absurdity as the story unfolds backwards and forwards in time with the years gracing the top of the chapter headings we realize that this all happened neither so long ago nor so far away the second doomed chechen war was so under reported in the us that it's breathtaking to experience it in these pages to feel the vibrato of every landmine blast in the exposed sinews and nerve endings of the people crafted like an escher painting with a hopeful flourish this is the rare novel i'll read again","2974":"clear and clean prose a harrowing story about chechnya and it's history and recent wars sad to say that i didn't know much about the atrocities and struggles i'm glad to have read this book and greatly appreciated the lyrical and intelligent writing i won't soon forget the characters","2975":"set in war torn chechnya from 1994 2004 this incredibly sad novel reveals all the horrors as well as the triumphs experienced by a host of characters who have the misfortune of living through 2 wars in this godforsaken country we first meet havaa an eight year old girl who is rescued by her neighbor akhmed after her house is blown up and her father dokka is carted away by the feds akhmed takes her to the one place he feels she will be safe the near empty and mostly destroyed hospital in the city several miles away from their village at the hospital we meet sonja a fierce strong dedicated surgeon who had once left chechnya for a promising career in london but who returned to her homeland in search of her sister natasha who had disappeared at the start of the first war told in a back and forth fashion we learn the back story of the characters and meet khassan the elderly kindly writer and his son ramzan a young man capable of the utmost cruelty the fate of hafaa lies in the hands of these souls and even though we want to hate ramzan whose actions are unspeakable once we learn his story we understand that he is as much a victim of the brutal history as the friends he is so willing to sacrifice i do have one quibble though throughout the novel the author when talking about a particular character will add a few lines about that person's future revealing their fate sometimes good sometimes bad i'm not quite sure what the point of that is and for the most part found it annoying but that is a small flaw in an otherwise amazing brave startling and riveting novel","2976":"he was losing her incrementally it might be a few stray brown hairs listless on the pillow or the crescents of bitten fingernails tossed behind the headboard or a dark shape dissolving in soap as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there anthony marra describes complex relationships and emotions in words that are so beautiful simple and powerful that i had to stop and reread several of his paragraphs another example at the kitchen table she examined the glass of ice each cube rounded by room temperature dissolving in its own remains and belatedly she understood that this was how a loved one disappeared this is one of the best books i have read recently all of marra's characters are well developed and sympathetic even the one who is the catalyst for the tragic events around which the narrative revolves his writing is incisive direct powerful and in a word beautiful marra's style with several unusual stylistic teachniques some of which work extremely well for one long paragraph he alternates descriptions of ula's thoughts and akmed's actions as he gives ula a sponge bath this was a very touching description of what has been left unsaid between the couple and the caring and affection between them throughout the book he sums up the fates of minor characters in a sentence or two i found this a little distracting though it did have the effect of broadening the impact of the wars beyond the central characters and demonstrating the numerous responses and fates of those swept up in it i am amazed that a young american author can create such an astounding and beautiful description of a war torn country in his debut novel no less i will follow anthony marra's writing and career with great interest and enthusiasm","2977":"an atmospheric and beautifully written debut novel set in 2004 war torn chechnya in a half bombed abandoned hospital over the course of five days the plot intricately weaves together diverse characters and back stories while connecting them in ways you did not see coming this novel will satisfy many readers it is a love story test of family loyalties and deceptions suspenseful and beautifully crafted makes you ask yourself many questions including what would you do to survive or to save someone you love i was also pleased with the ending it is very hopeful i sat and just smiled for several minutes anthony marra is far from being new to writing as his prize list demonstrates","2978":"4 5 stars a beautifully written story the point in time jumps were a little off putting but once you have a firm grasp of the main timeline and events you don't trip on them the interwoven fates of the villagers is heart wrenchingly poetic there's just enough redemption good will and humor to add that silver lining to what would otherwise be another depressing tale of war and man's evil potentials","2979":"well written enjoyed the character development and story","2980":"the last fourth or so is when it really hits you","2981":"i love this book i will read it over and over because finishing made me sad and heart broken and desolate","2982":"it took me a little while to get absorbed but i was indeed what i liked was the author's style his descriptive prose his characters i didn't much like reading about how people were tortured and the anticipation of knowing it was coming was difficult their lives had no breaks it was such a relief to read about havva towards the end but even did any of them truly survive the effects of the war it was a wow book glad to have read it but saddened me","2983":" maybe more a 3 5 but let's round up there was a lot i liked about this most particularly the way the story circled back on itself adding layers upon layers and details that explained things more and more it reminded me of a tale of two cities in a way the layering of bits of story that created a full picture it was languorous but constantly moving though i do wish marra would have trusted the reader to understand some of the things he implied early instead of spelling them out later the story was strong and it told me about a place that i didn't know much if anything about and the chapter treatment helped me stay in the tale in time i'm glad i read it","2984":"i can't do it it's too boring i'm putting it to rest it would be one thing to develop multiple storylines but this thread is lost so often with side stories there is no point","2985":" my completely ignorance in regards to chechnya and their wars with russia almost led me to close the covers of this book after a chapter or two because the idea of getting lost in a story and trying to understand the real life politics and histories pertinent to the story was a little daunting anthony marra's exquisite writing held my hand long enough to lose myself in the characters and like cauliflower mixed in to mac n cheese absorb what was good for me while enjoying something more entertaining fans of khaled hosseini will love this writer and this book","2986":"this was an excellent book it is a poignant gut wrenching and at times humorous story about a group of people trying to survive during the two chechen wars for independence from russia i highly recommend it","2987":" prior to reading this book i had no knowledge of the chechen wars that were being fought as recently as 2000 i had heard of them embarrassingly in the bridget jones movie and that was about it i was not paying attention to news in my early 20's this book is hard to read in parts because of how sad the character's situations are but it is refreshing to read a book about true strife and hardship the character's names were difficult for me to remember because of the russian caucasus names that are unfamiliar to me but the story of the main character and his unlikely friendship with sonja sp and the unlikely father like relationship with the child are heart warming the author shows humor at certain points of the story which i enjoyed for many of these people living in through this war this was all they ever knew war and being displaced and being threatened had been going on their entire lives it was nice to see they were still human and still found things to smile and laugh about overall a great read it is difficult to get into this book but once you get through about 100 pages you'll be hooked the ending and way the book circled around were nice and provided some surprise enjoy","2988":"this is an incredible book i actually read it twice the second time i was really able to fully appreciate the excellent writing","2989":"loved it great description and imagery","2990":"amazing beautifully written and well researched you'll be attached to each character by the end the best book i've read in a while","2991":"unusually written this is a dark novel about the impact of war in this case chechnya to a person's soul i would recommend reading it in long chunks of time to ensure you can understand and recall the details of events as the novel bounces round between 1994 and 2004 years are indicated at the beginning of each chapter which helps thanks to my friend meg for this signed copy i'm adding it to my permanent collection","2992":" this is one of my 2 favorite books of 2013 the other is the goldfinch by donna tartt i love the way mr marra tells the story in increments with characters introduced then followed within different time frames they are revealed slowly all is not as it seems at first glance the characters are believable well drawn and if not always likable are eventually understood within the context of their shortcomings a complex very sad novel that will keep you reading bravo anthony marra don't let the setting chechnya and its wars put you off everything is explained and the writing is so good you feel like you are there with them highly recommended as a matter of fact i can't understand why this didn't make the nytimes 10 best books for 2013","2993":"this extraordinary novel is set in chechnya between about 1994 and 2004 i knew little about the wars there during that period and was stunned by the events so movingly described the main characters are wonderfully portrayed as their tragic stories are revealed little by little it is a painful book to be read slowly and is beautifully written despite the horrors depicted","2994":"a beautifully written book with well drawn characters about a part of the world i know nothing about very interesting read","2995":"it is not often that one comes across a debut novel of such breadth beauty and insight the beauty is in the prose and the characters who are struggling to make sense of life before during and after the wars in chechnya it was at times very painful to read about the horrific details of war torture and it's consequences but the brilliant writing offset some of this indispensable discomfort i can't wait to see what marra does next","2996":"great book the end brings it all together we'll written","2997":"mankind have always been set to hurt and destroy others and in the process themselves awful material written with wit empathy and bright words e g for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric the circumference of the world tightened to what their arms encompassed this may sound corny but in this novel it actually has a very sad affect i knew nothing of this area of the world and nothing about its history","2998":"an interesting read set in chechnya somewhat confusing at first due to the out of sequence story with flashbacks i almost gave up reading after the first 40 pages once i persevered i was rewarded with some thoughtful writing about some people trying to survive during a bleak period of chechen history when to live with dignity meant a premature death","2999":"really well written book about havaa and her life in war torn chechnya she is on her own at 8 years old and has to figure things out this story spans her life back and forth putting the pieces together being that havaa is a nurse in her hometown which is always in turmoil she sees quite a bit of the people she grew up with coming through the hospital she works","3000":"oh my god i loved this also i realized after reading the middlesteins recently that i really like the plot device used by both of sort of showing what happens to characters in the future in a short aside while in the present it sort of takes the sting off of knowing the book can't last forever","3001":"really good especially the forward looking narratives about minor characters very thought provoking about a place and conflict i didn't know about","3002":"one of the most moving books i've read beautifully written","3003":"wow great great book the characters writing plot were all stellar marra paints a portrait of chechnya spanning from the fall of soviet russia through two wars and the effects on the population who had already been shoved out by stalin in the earlier part of the 20th century then told they could return under glasnost although this is a work of fiction the author heavily researched the past and recent history of chechnya to tell the story of a pair of sisters sonja and natasha one a doctor who returns to her native land from london to find her sister natashya who had been forced into a life of sex slavery and heroin addiction a father khassan and his two sons a sort of cain and abel scenario with one ramzan turning in his fellow neighbors in to the enemy the other achmed a reluctant medical student who cuts classes to paint life studies in the local art school one by one the villagers disappear taken to the landfill as ramsan betrays them in order to afford insulin for his father and other necessities to survive dokka a neighbor who is kidnapped and taken to the landfill at the beginning of the story tries to save his young daughter havaa by sending her out the back door when the troops are coming in the front she is later saved by achmed the good son and taken to the chechen hospital where sonja works anthony marra can weave a story shakespearean in its tragedy yet peppered with sharp uncanny humor i would love to see this book made into a movie think of what you were doing from the years 1994 to 2004 juxtapose that with the lives of the chechens portrayed in this book and you will be astounded most of these people are muslims good ones and bad ones just like us they knew about as much about what was going on in the us as we knew about them achmed actually thinks ronald macdonald and ronald regan were the same person i'm sure this book is going to win awards fantastic","3004":" not for everyone and at times not for me i think i was expecting something like a modern hadji mourat and it took me awhile to get into this very different story that takes place in chechnya i also kept getting lost as to where i was in time in the story since i was listening to the audio version and so couldn't easily flip back to the beginning of the chapter to remind myself which year i the story was in yet in the end a deep rich haunting novel with moments of great despair and yet of hope i think part way through i would have given it 2 or 3 stars towards the very end 5 and so all in all i give it a 4","3005":"best book i've read in 2014 so far amazing rendition of characters tight plotting and a remarkable ability to place the reader inside a war one that this reader knew little about with all the vividness of a fully realized life there is humor and love and compassion alongside the cruelty and barbarism the hard choices that people are forced to make again and again come to life on the page i can't recommend it highly enough","3006":" this was a beautifully written book that i simply didn't connect with on a deep level but there were passages that i read and reread because their force their truth was undeniable and i admired how the disparate narratives began weaving together and yet i just couldn't really find my way into the book overall perhaps because i lack knowledge of that part of the world chechnya and russia and the author definitely assumed some knowledge there a good book and i feel like it's kinda my own failure that i didn't love it marra is a talented writer","3007":"this extraordinary book will stay with me for some time set in modern chechnya during the two wars between the russian forces and the chechen rebels it takes us into the lives of ordinary people surviving in the worst of circumstances war brings to mind atrocities and cruelties and there are certainly those in this story but it also conveys so well the endless challenges of day to day life during wartime the chaos the uncertainty the lack of infrastructure the breakdown of trust at the same time this book is glimmering with humanity marra has created some truly memorable and affecting characters from an orphaned girl who's father is taken in the dark of night to a gifted get 'er done surgeon who keeps her hospital ambling along with scant resources and he weaves their personal stories together so artfully it's emotionally compelling without being sentimental it's sad but hopeful and it's beautifully told","3008":"i should start a new bookshelf called heartbreakingly beautiful this would be #1 on it set in war torn chechnya the novel is really about love and the effects of war and trauma on those loved most","3009":"it's about chechnya during the wars that went on when we were kids which doesn't sound enticing but it's really actually wonderful very moving it uses time in interesting ways i thought a lot about djokhar and tamerlan while i read it which makes today an appropriate day to finish it this was a coincidence the first time i cried today was waiting for the verdict and the second was finishing this book","3010":"heartbreaking and beautiful","3011":"this was a good read but i was expecting a bit more from thisnovel the beginning grabbed me adn the ending was fantasticbut there were many parts in the middle that were just so so nonetheless i do recommend this book and look forward to others by marra","3012":"i love this book it's beautifully written and simultaneously heartbreaking and uplifting it speaks to the grace with which human beings can endure the most unimaginable hardships","3013":"amazing not an easy read but very well written beautiful language tells the moving powerful disturbing and yet hopeful and uplifting story about family life and love in a part of the world remote and vague to me with its confusing violent history","3014":"a book that makes you think my favorite kind","3015":"heartbreaking with unexpected humor amazing one of the lines that i can't get out of my mind and between the creation of this body and its end lay the mystery the girl would spend her life solving and what about this one she wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency oh my goodness beautiful","3016":"apparently this is a debut novel spectacular storytelling part historical fiction with dabs of magic realism puts the reader in a part of the world that most of us will never get to and it feels like one grew up there life such a wonder this book is a vital phenomenon","3017":"i had to work at this for much of the book and it is by no means an easy read the rewards however are there and it really is an astonishing work of art","3018":" this is a dark complex story which takes place over five days during the end of the chechenia war yet spans 11 years of the full war with the use of many and confusing flash backs through these flashbacks we come to understand how the lives of dokka and akhmed friends and their families are intwined the small village of eldar mostly destroyed by war has one bombed out hospital staffed by one doctor sonja and one nurse who treat the wounded and deliver babies the story is filled with betrayal torture lies and fear when dokka is arrested his eight year old daughter escapes and is rescued by dokka's friend akhmed a village doctor who entrusts her to the care of sonja in the end sonja becomes a mother to haava i really did not like this book which became clear to me when i cleaned the garage rather than read the book if you can get read through the first 300 or so pages of darkness the last 50 or so pages of the book and the characters do have redemption marra writes very well and has an excellent way with words which was what kept me reading the book war is an ugly place marra holds no punches as he explores the hearts and minds of the costs of war of a handful of people from a tiny village","3019":" maybe i just haven't been reading enough 'good books' or maybe anthony marra is just amazingly talented but i have never come across a book with such gorgeous prose before although it was hard to read at times because i was unfamiliar with the chechnyan war s i was still able to enjoy this book thoroughly i feel like this is one of those books that require a quiet space and a lot of time to fully understand there is a lot to take in but once you get further into the book i feel it becomes increasingly more enjoyable i loved the way everything unfolded i particularly liked how the book did not follow just a linear progression in terms of time but jumped forwards and backwards year to year overall i thought this was a terrific book and one to save for a second reading later","3020":"i loved this book i thought the way the story would touch on peripheral characters and then describe their back stories was amazing it was also extremely depressing but in a beautiful way cannot recommend highly enough","3021":" i'm going to be punny and say this book was phenomenal i must admit this was a challenging read as i am so admittedly unfamiliar with russia's history and geography while my lack of knowledge made this novel more challenging it also made it more rewarding as i truly felt i gained a great deal from having read this it did take a while for me to truly get into the pace of the novel as it also spans many years and jumps back and forth between time periods however once i fell into a comfortable pattern with the book i was truly astounded at marra's incomparable characterization and beautiful language marra writes of truly horrific times and events but he does so with such poetic and magical language he is an incredible wordsmith this book easily holds some of the most sincere and immensely creative similes i have ever encountered the imagery is spot on the book literally made me shudder at some scenes i don't want to give any of the plot away in this review because i just want anyone who sees this to go out and read this book wow as an aspiring author however this book kind of made me want to hide my head in the sand and call it quits because there is no way in hell i will ever be able to write with the flow creativity intelligence and supreme quality marra displays here even if the plot weren't compelling the language drives this book onward in its brilliance and mastery","3022":"a good book but very sad learned about the chechen wars and a tiny bit of russian history it seems so obvious i don't know why the lesson is so hard to learn war is a bad thing","3023":"beautiful perfect it's just one of those books that i fall into and never want to end it is an actual work of literature and not just a novel and deserves serious consideration and even immediate study as the story is one of history and current events the definitions had the stately reassurance of orthodoxy reminding her of the prewar years when she had relied on the reference book to complete her weekly assignments when she had sat at her desk her ears plugged with cotton balls as that awful thudding natasha called music had pounded from the next room when she still believed the meaning of a thing was limited to a few tersely worded clauses but nothing she now knew could be defined in exclusion and every bug pencil and grass blade was a dictionary in itself requiring the definition of all other things to fulfill its own that's a run on sentence a teacher can let slide i'll write more when i can wrap my head around it better","3024":"just beautiful brutal intense and compelling","3025":"so sad but great writing based in chechnya","3026":"oh my goodness this is an absolutely gorgeous book one i feel so privileged to have read an absolutely brilliant achievement particularly as a first novel there are passages in this book of such beauty paragraphs sentences phrases that i re read multiple times just to play the images back i can't let go of this one thirty two and three quarter years had passed since he had first felt those fingers and they had astonished him delicate as sparrow feet and holding onto his thumb as if he were the sturdiest branch in the forest a constellation of vital phenomena is a novel to come back to over and over again just like time itself in the novel folding back on itself extending out folding back a little farther knitting delicate loops into an utterly dazzling pattern so much pain and love despair and hope all the very best of what a book should be","3027":"a dark and heart wrenching account of life in war torn chechnya beautifully written but complex not an easy read but the effort is worth it characters are well developed and empathetic but not without flaws its scary to think that there are places like this in the world 5 stars","3028":" damn this book deserves all the hype and more first off it's so well researched this author did the homework on details big and small and it shows second it's just damn brilliantly written marra manages to weave the narratives of several characters and wars together in a non chronologial but emotionally and thematically sequential timeline in a deft and smart way i never felt lost in the narrative third these descriptions are just absolute gob smacking i feel like anyone who reads his description of torture will be absolutely changed i'm tagging this book as a favorite not in the can't wait to snuggle up and re read it sense but in the however long i live it won't get out of my head sense anthony marra if you ever write grocery list i'm buying it in hardback","3029":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a heartbreaking yet beautiful journey into the lives and consciences of those characters brilliantly depicted by author anthony marra i have to confess that i was previously less than well informed regarding the history of war ravaged chechnya which is the setting for the novel in order to completely grasp the situation and to follow the jump between time periods in the book i found it necessary to do a little research of my own to learn more about the first and second chechen wars this foundation allowed me to focus more on the characters rather than getting caught up in the timeline as it switched back and forth throughout the story the story centers around akhmed who has made it his duty to rescue havaa the eight year old girl who has just lost her father and home at the hands of the russian soldiers and sonja the gifted surgeon who runs the neglected hospital where the two seek refuge sonja herself has suffered great loss as the result of the wars and is less than eager to take on the additional responsibility of housing these two burdens these seemingly unrelated individuals are bound to each other and to the lives of the other characters who are so vividly portrayed by the eloquent narrative the story is at once harsh heart breaking and yet inspiring out of a grim reality both hope and compassion still spring forth just as akhmed sketched and displayed his portraits of the disappeared from his village in order to preserve the memory of those individuals so has anthony marra painted the indelible images of these unforgettable persons in the minds of his readers i would give this book 4 5 stars my only complaint was that there was a bit of confusion for me in keeping the timeline straight but this may have been a flaw related more to my relative ignorance of the history than to the author's style of writing","3030":"haven't been this excited to read a book in a long time going to take it slow","3031":"beautifully written hard to imagine having to live through anything like it","3032":"a good story but the constant jumping around in time place and characters annoyed me i also had a hard time with a certain literary device the author used to tell the future such as in three years and two months time she would","3033":"a pretty sad tale to read it is though a good lesson on chechnya recent history an eye opener to those of us with first world problems well written and good character development","3034":"excellent book i learned a lot about chechnya difficult read at times but good job about cost ofwar to individuals families and communities how there are no easy choices when faced with survival","3035":"a difficult read at times but worth it haunting is a great word to describe it i wasn't myself while reading it i was so absorbed","3036":"the book is a reminder of the strength resilience and beauty of the human spirit no matter how terrible the circumstances","3037":"beautiful but so depressing wanted it to be over","3038":" hard to say much more than wow i'm a russophile so the topic already interests me especially since i was in russia when chechnya first heated up in the mid 1990's while this is a work of fiction it is very much based on fact and the fact that such horrible atrocities have occurred so recently is astounding worse still is the fact that so much of the world didn't bother to pay any attention the atrocities and the world apathy toward them speak poorly of the state of humanity the book itself is wonderfully written the cast of characters is small enabling the author marra an opportunity to fully flesh out their stories marra delivers through the brilliant use of flashbacks and flashforwards that build depth and reader interest in the characters while generating suspense despite the temporal bouncing the book is easy to follow because it is so masterfully crafted at the core of marra's skill is the ability to generate a tightly interconnected web amongst his characters his plot is amazingly well conceived and stunningly executed this is not a feel good book by any means but the darkness of background helps generate the power of the book remarkably given the content marra includes a remarkable amount of humor further stretching the emotional range of the novel and thus enhancing the emotional impact of the pages the humor often hits in simple single lines of text that pack an incredible punch too be sure it is dark humor but such is the nature of russia and war zones if you aren't afraid to peel back the veneer of civility that most americans can choose to hide behind i highly recommend this book our contemporary world is not a pretty place and we have chosen to ignore so much of it commentary on humanity aside this book is so well written that even if you choose to bury the fact that this work of fiction is deeply embedded in fact it still retains its power as an incredible story expertly written","3039":"reading this leaves me aching for the fate of so many visibly and invisibly wounded and stunned at my own ignorance of history these events were happening in 2001 2004 horrifying to recognize the devastation is much closer than my insulated self imagined","3040":"another book along the line of the orphan master's son in that it was excellent beautifully written but difficult to read because of the subject war is so much more than the headlines portray first worlders in general are so unaware of the personal tragedies wrought by wars fought far from our shores and we do humanity a disservice by not informing ourselves of the full human condition","3041":"gorgeous book i barely made it through the last 5 pages i was crying so much","3042":"this is a beautifully written book and i gave it 5 stars my only caveat is that it is set in the 1990's during the wars in chechnya with the locals against the russian state the feds this was a period of hell on earth and the brutality and destruction can be difficult to read about the main characters including the villain are complex simple survival is at a premium but at what cost","3043":"an amazing book the author has a gift for putting together words in a phrases that makes you stop reread and just wonder since this book is about chechnya in war time it can be very disturbing while also being such a work of beauty","3044":" very well written story i didn't know much about chechnya before reading this it is a very sad story and hard to imagine these atrocities were happening in the not very distant past i fear it could be happening again with russia in the ukraine the story bounces back and forth between the early 1990s and the early 2000s and it takes some time to figure out all the characters stick with it though because it is a very well written story just know it is not a light read i think it will stick with me for some time and marra has certainly peaked my interest in learning more about this region","3045":" this is one of my favorite books of the year or years the third person narrator gives hints of what will happen in the future which doesn't detract from the suspense of the story i knew nothing of chechnya so it's fascinating for that aspect alone this is about the horrors and betrayals of war perhaps civil wars most of all but also about the survival of decency and love despite all there are 3 main characters a young girl a doctor with great compassion and limited skills and a gifted doctor who has returned to chechnya searching for the sister who disappeared years before spoiler alert if you haven't yet read the book stop reading this review now and don't read this book if you want your books to to end well for all the characters you care about this is one of the saddest and most moving books i have ever read most of the people you care most about die in terrible circumstances but a few do survive and for that i am very grateful","3046":"on one hand what a debut terrific writing well documented historical setting characters that 'll stay with me on the other hand i fell in and out of the story almost constantly i found it hard to reconstruct the chronology of events maybe i'm too dumb or not patient enough so not an easy read but what a promising new author","3047":" i received an advanced copy of this novel from the goodreads firstreads giveaway we know what goes in a war we know what happens after a war right we read about it in the history books that is one side of the story in war ther are a million stories and the stories do not end when the war ends teh suffering continues all of theses stories need to be told this is what this book is about the stories we will not read in the history book this may be a fictional book but i believe it close tot he truth of what happened this novel follows the lives of three peopl over the course of five days there are many flashback chapters to build the characters and explain how they got to this position in their lives this was a very character driven novel as the actions of the characters were mostly the result of their characters they had their strengths they had their flaws they were very believable i found this to be a very strong novel as a charcter driven novel often is i enjoyed the characters i became emotionally involved with their stories their successes and their defeats i was impressed by how the authour was able to bring the different stories together even though they allcame from different backgrounds even the sad story near the end did not take from the moment of triumph at the end i endjoyed this novel i would recommend it it was a heavy book to read mainly because you don't want to skip a word it is worth the read","3048":"best book i have read in 2014 i have to admit i know nothing of checknya learning about their brutal history with russia since wwii was eye opening the best part of the book was the haunting characters havaa the eight year old little girl who's father is abducted by russian soldiers in the night akhmed her neighbor who comes to her rescue sonja the doctor with no supplies treating the land mine victims do not miss this one","3049":"beautifully written heartbreaking to read","3050":"read this book","3051":"wow i didn't realize these kind of wars are still taking place i love reading about russian history i recommend taking notes of each character in the book it can get confusing towards the end great book","3052":" stories of people living in war torn countries can be harrowing and emotional especially when innocent civilians are the main characters chris bohjalian's the sandcastle girls set during the genocide in syria in 1915 is one such novel made more poignant by the ongoing civil war there anthony marra's debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena covers the years 1994 2004 which encompasses two wars in chechnya as they fought the russians for their freedom the title refers to the definition of life in the medical dictionary of the union of soviet physicians life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation by that definition this beautifully crafted novel is full of life sonja is a young surgeon who left chechnya and her younger sister natasha behind to study medicine in london natasha disappears and ends up in the sex slave trade as she tried to escape the civil war in chechnya sonja returns home to look for her sister sonja works at hospital #6 one the few buildings not bombed out during the first war when sonja saves the life of a man whose brother is a gangster she is able to get supplies to keep the hospital running along with two older nurses natasha eventually comes home completely traumatized by her experiences it breaks sonja's heart to see her sister and she feels helpless and guilty about what happened to natasha after a long time natasha comes to work at the hospital too helping women deliver their babies by the time the second war has begun ramzan a young man from a nearby village has begun informing on his neighbors to the russian soldiers his father khassan is devastated by his son's behavior and refuses to speak to him ramzan has informed on his friend dokka a man who has taken in many refugees as they make their way to the camps dokka's home is burned down and he is taken away to the landfill a dante's inferno like place where disappeared people wait to be questioned and tortured dokka's eight year old daughter havaa has escaped but the russians want her too akhmed another neighbor who is the village doctor finds havaa and hides her at the hospital the story shifts back and forth over the years and we see how these character's lives are surprisingly entwined the writing is beautiful and the imagery marra uses is stunning this paragraph in particular is so vivid no one wanted to risk moving the unexploded shells that lay scattered across the village so the next morning havaa's parents among other villagers pried toilet bowls from the rubble of collapsed houses and dragged them upside down and two by two gently set them over the unexploded shells havaa would never forget the sight so many dozens of upside down toilets bowls crowded the street that cars wouldn't pass for weeks and in that time she would occasionally hear the overdue explosions the shrapnel ringing within the ceramic but those bowls the one decent legacy of the soviet union never broke there are so many brilliant scenes in this book and i learned so many things i wish no one had to know like how people would sew their names and addresses inside their hems so that their bodies would be sent back to the families and havaa saving a frozen bug in her pocket so that she would have something to eat later as akhmed watched the nurse emptying the pockets of dead people looking for id cards he thinks it was a simple gesture no more than a flick of her fingers performed without malice or contempt but with complete disinterest and it cut through akhmed like a fin through water in her indifference he saw the truth of a world he didn't want to believe in one in which a human being could be discarded as easily as pocket lint this novel took my breath away marra empathetically tells the story of these people and how life has forced them to adapt to a situation not of their making and he contrasts the horror with the tenderness of humanity reading this made me hope to not be so judgmental of others as we see things are not always what they appear to be here this is not a book you can read in one sitting you read a little close the book contemplate and digest it and then go back for more i did not want it to end yet felt an overwhelming need to know how the stories of these people finished quite simply every human being should read this haunting amazing book","3053":"unbelievably good it's about a small group of people trying to keep each other alive in the midst of an endless grinding war it's about humanity and how the tiny simple acts of living build up to form our character our families our communities it's about what great feats love will allow us to do and how deeply it condemns us it's about how no matter how narrow the road gets how close the walls come in there is still the opportunity for deep care and generosity and kindness it's about how cruelty isn't perhaps evil but part of the world like wind or fog and whether we bear it or not does not say anything about our character it's a modern literary novel the author's first and though the prose is across the board excellent he isn't a showoff there are sentences that are literally dazzling several made me blow out my breath with a 'woof' shake my head and go back for a second taste but they don't feel forced they feel perfectly suited to the moment the author's goals and every beautiful moment augments our understanding of the world i can't wait to read more of his work i put the book down and started crying it was painful the end but it was a wonderful sort of pain the pain of recognition of experiencing a truth expressed so cleanly and plainly that tears of gratitude were the only possible response the rest of that morning i thought 'that is what art is for' and i still feel that way i felt clarified by reading this what a gift","3054":"this is the first book in a long time that made me feel so many emotions what a beautiful story that left me utterly exhausted in a good way my heart aches for these characters but he have me closure on each i loved this book","3055":" i was captured by the title of the book it is the story of havaa an 8 year old girl in chechnya whose father is taken away in the middle of the night and their house is burnt down the neighbor across the street akmed takes her to the hospital in the next town and convinces a doctor named sonja to care for her in exchange for him doing labor around the hospital this story is beautiful and is well written but it is definitely a story of hopelessness every character has suffered through personal losses as chechnya became a battleground between the government and the rebels there were moments that really caught my attention such as havaa wearing a manchester united sweater that had been donated to the red cross by a boy who was tired of hand me downs and wanted his own sweater some of the description could get lengthy and a little repetitious but it was a well written story and good learning for an area and a time that i knew little about","3056":"one of the most powerful diverse thought provoking novels i've read in years","3057":"one night russian soldiers bust into the house of dokka in a small village in chechnya dokka orders his young 8 year old daughter havaa to escape into the woods with the small blue suitcase that she had packed and ready at a moment's notice dokka is hauled away by russian soldiers and his house burned to the ground havaa is a charming little girl who dreams of being a marine biologist a dutiful daughter who helps her father in every way she can and when he tells her to grab her suitcase and whisks her away to the woods behind their home she does as he says and waits waits in the woods with her little blue suitcase until ahkmed finds her dokka's neighbor ahkmed searches the woods for havaa and shuttles her away to the safety of his own home where he lives with his ailing and bedridden wife ula but determines that havaa is not safe in the village the soldiers will return for her so he takes her to the nearby hospital to leave her in the care of a doctor he's never met before but learned of from a passing refugee sonja is the only doctor at the local hospital she is responsible for the care of everyone that comes through her doors from injured soldiers and civilians with missing limbs and mortal wounds to women giving birth sonja was always the brilliant academic daughter overlooked by everyone outshined by her beautiful younger sister natasha now after many hard hits and years of war and loss she is toughened and embittered and searching for her missing sister sonja is none too happy to be burdened with the care of a young girl but agrees reluctantly to do so with the offer of ahkmed's services he trained as a physician but his skills are greatly lacking in that area sonja's sister natasha was always envied for her beauty natasha seemed to have always been the only one who recognized how special her sister was and sonja never really seemed to resent the way the very presence of her sister usurped all recognition from sonja herself everyone knows when someone in the village goes missing they will wind up at the landfill where all of the missing turn up and the blame can be laid at the doorstep of ramzan the village informant who was once a good friend of dokka ramzan's kind father khassan is much shamed by his son's activities and has been ostracized by the village because of his son havaa was a very likable little girl very endearing ahkmed was a good selfless man although sonja was tough and detached she showed through her actions that she was a woman of real character and depth i found that it could be difficult keeping track of the characters foreign names are often difficult to keep in mind as they are so unfamiliar but part of that is my fault i was so distracted while reading this book that i'd only get a few pages before putting it down it made it hard to retain some of the characters and get it all straight in my head but even while being distracted and a little detached from the book i sensed this book was a bit of genius and beauty bound and titled the way that the author would express things really moved me this is really a character driven story the timeline shifts back and forth from present to past and from the viewpoint of one character to another the transition from past to present and vice versa is assisted by a timeline at the top of each chapter reflecting the year the current narration is taking place the narrator is all knowing and will share tidbits of information about the future and past and present that the characters themselves don't know i found myself thinking during the final quarter of the book that this story is like a tapestry many of the characters and events were interwoven and they would only come to light as the tapestry grew and developed really beautiful and brilliantly executed my final word this is one of those rare and uncommon novels that you come across every now and again provocative and riveting it is a beautifully written story with well developed characters that you can really care about a lyrical and intelligent tale of war torn chechnya i found myself moved i feared for the safety of those in danger was sickened by the brutality and indifference and yearned for the security of all in the end i found this to be a hard hitting novel that is soft in all the right places","3058":"a constellation of vital phenomena is a beautifully written but heartbreaking book about chechnya in the 20 years between 1994 and 2004 there are several sets of main characters two sisters a child and her father's best friend that man and his sick wife an elderly man and his son that cross over into relationships with other characters the character development is good the dialog is believable the descriptions of life in chechnya and of the choices real people living there had to make can be very hard to read but this is a beautiful book if you can deal with those realities the book contains great moments of despair and hope the plot does rely a little heavily on coincidence although most of the coincidences are not revealed until the book's final chapters the author jumps around in time but a helpful timeline appears at the beginning of each chapter the author has an odd habit of suddenly revealing a character's situation years into the future at times acting as a spoiler to his own plot but these passages also reassure the reader that at least some people had futures after the atrocities a constellation of vital phenomena will make a thoughtful reader consider many issues what it means to be family the importance of home how ordinary people survive and make decisions in terrible circumstances one of the sisters a doctor has a useful but shady contact in grozny whose least liked brother alu she saved in the first war p 188 poor berated alu whose name was beaten more than a donkey's ass six months after they met she had learned his brother's name was ruslan but she would always think of him as alu's brother she knew he had amassed a small fortune smuggling arms heroin and luxury goods for warlords and had used that fortune to rebuild his ancestral village after the first war when his ancestral village was destroyed again in the second war she knew he had paid passage to georgia for his parents brothers aunts uncles cousins in laws thirty seven in total even the oft cursed alu plus the neighbors on either side of every uncle cousin and in law one hundred and seventy four in total where the lived in the tbilisi apartment block he had purchased for the occasion neighbor by neighbor his ancestral village saved for a second and final time it can be a challenge to finish a book about a difficult subject but i definitely recommend a constellation of vital phenomena it was hard to read at times but i'm glad i did","3059":"a really gripping gritty book full of surprises in terms of both relationships and war stories i needed to read up a bit on the region after the first chapter and still wonder if more info in the book would have helped the underinformed reader or if would have dragged the story down the story travels back and forth in time and keeps revealing connections between people which makes me want to read it again sometime soon hard to read but well worth it","3060":" a remarkably good book for a young author with limited experience in the area he's writing about chechnya during more than a decade of war the book introduces a cast of characters whose connections with one another become increasingly clear as we move back and forth in time each has his or her own fraught experience with the violence and disintegration in which all are caught up and each makes decisions that have consequences not only for him herself but for others we're left asking ourselves what would we do if we were confronted with the prospect of torture and death how would we decide and can love finally redeem us i was reminded of chris hedges' book war is a force that gives life meaning as a war reporter he knew firsthand the seductive power of violent conflict he also had an opportunity to witness the one thing he thought might have the potential to reach across the dark chasms of war simple humble caring i wonder whether the author of this book may have taken some inspiration from hedges or even from thornton wilder's bridge of san luis rey with its famous closing line \"there is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love the only survival the only meaning \"","3061":"what an incredible 1st novel the style of writing is fantastically done with the last idea breath of an ending chapter become the first heartbeat of the next chapter there are many characters developed through this novel each one so strong individually and so incredibly tied into one another the characters becoming a constellation so intricately woven it is breathtaking magical anthony marra i will look forward to reading more of your work","3062":"a whole lot of ideas plots and slightly overwritten prose crammed into one first novel about chechnya and how just completely f ed up it was for so long but how its inhabitants are oh so human and profound and funny one of my book club members remarked that there seems to be a trend wherein privileged white guys in stanford and such places write novels about the torture of innocents in horrendously unfree war torn regions of the world i think she has a point and maybe i'm being hard on this book because i've just read one too many american novels where people of various specific ethnicities have sarcastic worldly and often beautiful conversations intermixed with scenes of rape torture mutilation degradation etc this particular book even includes a scene stop reading now if you're squeamish where an electric eel is brought into contact with the behind of an imam i'm putting that as delicately as possible if it seems ridiculous now it was only slightly less ridiculous when reading one random thought i had while thinking about this the setting and situation of the novel have a lot in common with zombie vampire apocalyptic fiction except this is historical yet it has i don't know the deadpan survivalist tone of the walking dead so but there's a lot of other stuff going on here the storylines and chronologies are intermixed and often confusing but this is on purpose of course and it's quite compelling i liked the characters a lot there's lots of movement and development as you come to understand people's experiences and motivations etc it's beautifully written yes but i preferred the dialogue to the off putting omniscience of the narrator who will tell you the future of random characters when you could care less get back to the story already it felt almost hyperactive the teller trying to tell too much at once while reveling in the awfulness and misery of it all here's a typical quote which i both love and hate you are mine i recognize you we twist our souls around each other's miseries it is that which makes us family thematically the book is super dense there are doublings all over the place two pairs of siblings two artists two doctors impotent husbands two infidelities sure much of it is powerful and interesting but it also feels like a first novel trying hard to cram it all in so you get the idea i loved sonja the awesome doctor who stitches people up with dental floss and her sister natasha whose story is a wonderful tangle of events very well told","3063":" this book floored me it is beautifully written and full of eloquently poetically described tragedy but studded with flashes of beauty and compassion the characters' personalities and the overall emotional heft of the novel grew for me throughout the book with the weight of the accumulated details of acts of humanity of brutality of hope and defeat and the slow revealing of the connection and intersection of lives feeling incredibly emotional by the end anthony marra manages to weave the past and the future of many characters wonderfully deftly into a present day 2004 narrative that takes place over 5 days during the second chechen war the novel speaks with devastating poignancy of the horrors of war of what can be endured and what cannot and of the toll it exacts on individuals and on families it also offers a profoundly nuanced understanding of families of family relationships of the hardest decisions and actions that can be made or taken and of the price of living with these actions a medical dictionary definition referred to in the book and read by different characters in the novel describes life as a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i wonder if the suggestion is that life is all of this and not just what you want it to be love pride and family which are the things that the war takes from so many people in this beautiful memorable heartbreaking novel","3064":"poignant heart wrenching novel beautifully drawn characters","3065":"great writing but the story didn't move me","3066":" it is undeniable that this author is talented he can take a sentence and turn it into a work of art the non linear format took a while to get used to and the first 1 3 of this book was a struggle after finishing i understood better why the story was told in such a way and how everyone is inter connected very little happens in the five day span of the main story as almost everything significant has occurred previously and is revealed in flashbacks and flash forwards the main plot revolves around akhmed's attempt to keep havaa safe after her father is taken into custody by the feds sonja's quest to reconcile with her lost sister and khassan's dilemma with his son the informer but this story ended up being so much more than its individual parts the writing was incredible moving horrendous mesmerizing and so thought provoking that had me re reading a lot of sentences but i also found parts of the plot that was slow and hard to enjoy the constant and abrupt switch in perspective and timelines also left me more often than not a bit confused so even if this book felt at times as hard work it was worth the effort","3067":"outstanding book about people living during the 20th century russian revolutions more on http bookwinked wordpress com 2013","3068":"i was thoroughly engrossed from page 1 reading this well written intelligent compassionate first novel by anthony marra i look forward to reading his next book with nothingshort of eager anticipation","3069":"stunning one to read slowly one that will stay with me for a long long time gorgeous writing such an amazing and important work--both timely and timeless how did the author fit all the details together so seamlessly what a moving novel i had trouble finishing it as i couldn't see the pages for my tears anthony marra sets a new standard i would give this book six stars if i could","3070":"beautiful tragic heartbreaking gritty and eloquently written fictional account of chechnya's wars and the people that are impacted important read about a conflict i am embarrassed to say i knew nothing about characters to love and hate and understand and a broken landscape so clearly described you can hear the glass grinding under your feet","3071":" the author writes with a beautiful prose about an ugly bit of chechan history that really only happened a short time ago the novel covers 1994 2004 touching on the two chechan wars while covering only 5 days in the present of 2004 the way the points of view and the story interrelate are a wonder especially if one is patient and does not easily give in to feeling confused the book concludes with a satisfying and hopeful note immense spinning joy main characters inept village doctor portraitist akhmed informer ramzan brilliant surgeon sonja eight year old havaa havaa's father dokka former soldier and historian khassan sonja's sister natasha akhmed's wife ula nurses deshi

what the backstory is of any person one meets deprivation betrayal guilt shame cruelty bribery","3072":"lovely tragic and somewhat existential such a beautifully written well crafted novel","3073":" second reviewthe second time was a gem as you can see below i couldn't warm up to this book the first time around i guess i wasn't in the correct mind set thanks denise for urging me on it was definitely a great call the writing was spot on can't believe it was his first novel i'm all in on his second book whatever it is one word of advice stick with it you won't be disappointed promise enjoy first reviewseriously my head hurts from reading this book i wanted so much to like this book especially with all the rave reviews i thought it was a definite slam dunk sadly it wasn't when reading becomes work there really is no enjoyment any longer sorry mr marra i think i'll pass on your second book enjoy if you're take the plunge","3074":"i enjoyed listening to this story of chechnya on audible at times it was confusing to keep track of the characters and the transition between the 1990's through 2004 how fortunate we are in the us not to have to live with the conflicts the chechen people have had to face for decades if not centuries","3075":"a tough read for me the characters were hard to keep straight and the time skipping baffled me through much of the story i had to re read many paragraphs multiple times to decipher which character year or what was actually happening in the scene this was a book that demanded full attention and not one to escape to definitely not a vacation novel not sure when a good time to tackle a gritty very complex read is i could appreciate learning about something i had no idea was going on in 'my' lifetime i had to remind myself repeatedly that the setting was not 1920 1930 1940 it was modern day i could not recommend this to many of my fellow bookworms not sure if i would revisit this author on another subject","3076":"a grueling look at the wars in chechnya beautifully written but difficult to read because of the subject matter","3077":" beautifully written with humor love and hope despite its sadness and violence i loved the alternating timeline of present and past memories as if you're being told stories of the past by an old friend it reads like the whisper of ghosts that float through the present loved this story in the face of horrible circumstances characters make difficult and often unsavory choices as the characters expose their motivations it is easy to understand their motivations and empathize with their actions i enjoyed learning some history of chechnya in a fiction format i did some additional reading for background on the conflicts in chechnya i highly recommend this book","3078":" this novel simply blew me away it's engrossing appalling touching educational and powerful going into anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomenon i knew next to nothing about chechnya and its recent wars with russia other than headlines about chechen terrorists now after reading marra's heart wrenching story i feel i have a bit more insight into this topic this novel is wonderfully structured so full of memorable characters and settings and with such beautiful prose so accomplished that it's hard to believe it's a first novel i'll be surprised it this isn't named one of the best books of the year dare i whisper pulitzer nominee the tale revolves around akhmed a incompetent doctor with a heart of gold who seeks to save his neighbor's eight year old daughter havaa from sure death after her father is disappeared akhmed takes her to sonja a very competent doctor who carries plenty of her own psychological baggage around what is to be the fate of akhmed havaa and sonja that is what kept me up late turning the pages i won't detail the plot but i do want to say a word or two about the use of an omniscient narrator and how marra uses this voice to great effect i really enjoyed and was often amused by the all seeing and all knowing narrator who often pauses tangentially to clue the reader in about the past or the future for example giving us a brief description of the person who donated a manchester united t shirt to the red cross that now appears on a chechen peasant or telling us the future of a woman who sold a hot plate to a main character the narrator even provides details down to the number of years months weeks and days that an event did or will occur i found this narrative structure to be very engaging and often a comic break in an often bleak story and in the end it helped create the closure i needed to finish the book let me caution some readers to the fact that this novel is about a troubled country and there are scenes and descriptions of women sold into sexual slavery and graphic depictions of torture these details are necessary to tell this tale but i would be remiss if i didn't mention it i highly recommend this fascinating and well written novel these characters will live in my mind for quite a while i'll be in the front of the line to read anthony marra's next novel the high quality of this first one speaks well for a host of more to come","3079":"i can honestly say that i was a little disappointed i love historical fiction and this is the first one that i came across about chechnya and the two wars that they fought for independence i was excited because this would be different than any other historical fiction that i have read i loved the characters and how all of their lives were woven together through the birth of havaa natasha staying at dokka's house khassem being akhmed's father and akhmed having an affair with havaa's mother it was a great story however the book itself was unorganized there were many times that i was frustrated because i wanted him to get to the point and get back to the story i usually enjoy books where the chapters shift from present day to the past but this one was not consistent and it got confusing overall i loved the story but it could have been written better","3080":"excellent bleak vivid a good novel for a winter read i feel priviledged to learn about the war s in chechnya how brutal for everyone","3081":"an absolutely brilliant book about the wars in chechnya i was amazed to find out that the author did not visit chechnya until after he had finished the novel","3082":"so glad i decided to read this book one of the best i have read in a long time give it a try","3083":"a stirring heartbreaking and hauntingly beautiful story of war families and hope this narrative opened my eyes to a piece of the world that i knew little to nothing about chechnya marra researched non fiction reports and first hand accounts from the area and used them to build this magnificent story at times shocking at other times striking in it's compassion and humanity this is a story that tolls heavy on your heart and makes you think about every page before you turn to the next","3084":"i won this book from read it forwarda constellation of vital phenomena takes place in chechnya over a course of five days in 2004 with chapters recalling various times from the 10 years prior this was not a time location combination that i was at all familiar with before reading this book and that probably would have put me off a bit had i just come across the book in the store although i was very drawn to the cover so i might have picked it up anyway it took me a little while to get really into the story but once i did i couldn't put it down the story was so very well written that it stayed in my head after i was done and i actually went back and read the last chapter again the following day i look forward to hearing more from anthony marra","3085":"not gonna lie this is a tough read in that very few good things happen to the central characters however i was fascinated by the book's depiction of the recent history of chechnya and the hardships these people faced marra is a talented writer and he obviously did loads of research to inform the novel but there were times when i felt like the prose was weighed down by too much backstory and history still an important and terrifically written novel","3086":" oh my how can i say i loved this book when parts of it were so painfully hard to get through particularly in light of current world events and the thousands who are being disappeared by despots zealots rogue governments drug lords and a world that looks the other way i don't want those five stars to suggest that i enjoyed reading passages that made me wince because i didn't honestly the ways humans can think of to torture each other as if the things we do unintentionally aren't enough but this novel is first and foremost the story of people who faced brutality deprivation and terror at the hands of seemingly soulless automatons with human traits at the other end of the spectrum love kindness generosity selflessness faith and the hardest of all to come by in times of chaos and war hope anthony marra is an exceptional writer who is able to weave connections between characters and events past and future that often made me cry sometimes from sadness sometimes from relief sometimes from the sheer beauty of the whole inexplicable mess of life which can only be defined as a constellation of vital phenomena five stars","3087":" sometimes the best way to get at the heart of an historical situation is to write a novel that disregards too much in the way of political fact in order to evoke the the truth of the human situation tim o'brien says this in the things they carried \"that's what fiction is for it's for getting at the truth when the truth isn't sufficient for the truth \"anthony marra's novel is set in chechnya a location that i'd imagine few westerners know well except to equate it with jihadists russian brutality and the endless strife of the 90s only returning to our american newscasts as the land that nurtured the psyche of the boston bombers it's so easy to label and stereotype i can't lie if someone had asked me last month if i'd ever want to visit chechnya i'd have said a quick flat no but somehow this book opened up the beauty of the ethnic variations and customs that make up this profoundly complex place i have no interest in summarizing the plot action i think other reviewers have done that instead i'll merely comment on my reaction despite the sadistic violence the language of the novel is elegant and beautiful sure there are a few clunky spots big deal and some places that i think could have been less long winded but the contrast between the graceful imagery and the machinery of war had an interesting effect it caused me to love the people it's hard to believe what they endured what they endure and i'll never feel the same way about chechnya again because the truth about chechnya won't be found in its political turmoil it'll be discovered inside the hearts of its citizens and the richness of their culture","3088":"really beautiful although tragic it was hard to take such an intimate look at ordinary life in a war zone but i think it's important especially when we live so removed from what is reality for so much of the world from a writing standpoint i appreciated the way the flashbacks were incorporated but dates were given they contributed so much to the story but it didn't get too confusing","3089":"wonderful book likes strong developed characters that are easy to love creative story structure intertwining different time periods and plots that seamlessly converge at the end really enjoyed the vignettes on each character's ultimate fate scattered throughout the book that enticed the reader to reach the end dislikes none","3090":"a sad story of the never ending conflict in chechnya two doctors try to save the life of a young girl by keeping her safe","3091":"this novel is so interesting i had no idea the horror that the russians chechnans endured in the 2000s","3092":"i needed to take notes of each character as each chapter was a different person u0026amp sometimes even a different time period i'm sure i missed a lot of the connections because i could not remember about the little people who are affected by the two wars in chechnya","3093":"this is one of the best books i've read in my lifetime it is a stark moving spellbinding haunting debut novel about ordinary people leading extraordinary lives in war torn chechnya 1994 to 2004 it is so very timely given the recent olympics and what is currently transpiring in the ukraine and makes me think about the people in the villages as i read of the latest invasions i am astonished at the utter brutality of the russian regime and had to remind myself often that this was not a story from wwii but of today's mass murder by soldiers of civilians i was in a hurry to finish it so i could get it back to the library on time and am sorry i didn't slow down to really relish it i will certainly read it again which is not something i ordinarily do it is not an easy read but one well worth the time that will not be forgotten","3094":"absolutely a terrific book well written beautiful and sensitive a compelling story of tragic but not depressing characters utterly believable caught in the throes of the chechechian wars just a few short years ago best book i have read in a long time","3095":" one of the more beautifully written books i have read in some time all the while being one of the devastating and heart wrenching and yet it remains hopeful i hesitate to write much about the plot because the way it unfolds is part of what i loved about it it's not the sort of book i would recommend to everyone i know it emotionally hits you in the gut and overwhelms you but if a story of love family and the absurdity of war is one that you can handle i would push this book in your hands and ask you to read it this is not escape literature i find myself thinking about it and the characters long after i put it down","3096":"a beautiful and tragic tale of family love and sacrifice during war this was a lovely though sad read about friends and family in a small village trying to find comfort and survive during a depressing time","3097":"the line the rising sun had never before made him feel late hooked me on page 1 and 379 pages later i am thrilled to report that this is a great book and highly recommend it the author's writing style is mesmerizing and the story which spans eight years in wartime chechnya is absolutely engrossing","3098":"tough content but a worthy read","3099":" i went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars but i think my final rating had more to do with the reader than the book itself extraordinary writing story and recent history of chechnya i knew very little of the wars and russia's repeated invasions so it was very enlightening this is a very hard book but one i would recommend if only to realize how little we really know of life in other countries especially the downtrodden ones but aside from that the story is very good and beautifully written i actually wish i had it in written form so i could highlight some of the more beautiful phrases","3100":"which i could have given it 6 stars","3101":" havaa is eight when her father dokka is abducted from their home in a small village in chechnya by russian soldiers and she is rescued by akmed a longtime neighbor together they seek refuge with sonja rabina who is the only remaining doctor trying to run a nearby abandoned hospital this story the account of five days tells of their separate lives and how they will interconnect as they try to survive this beautifully written book is told from many angles including one which allows insightful glimpses into the future of the characters 5 stars","3102":"hauntingly beautiful and achingly sad the narrative flips between the first and second chechyn wars to slowly reveal the interconnected lives of the war's victims and victimizers the language of the book is beautiful with striking imagery and turns of phrase highly recommended","3103":" the author says in the conversation with the author section at the end of the book that writing a linear book would not capture the absurd recursive manner in which its character assemble their chaotic narrative i will admit the book did capture me right away u0026amp kept its hold on me until the last page but i found the bouncing back u0026amp forth in time very difficult when i decided not to try so hard by flipping back u0026amp forth among the chapters it got easier for me the story is intense u0026amp brutal the civil wars in chechnya from 1994 to 2004 u0026amp how they affected a small group of people comprise the story the settings are in a bombed out hospital a little village the forest u0026amp a disgusting landfill where prisoners of war civilians mostly were thrown along with the garbage it was merely deep muddy stinking holes in the ground the story centers around 2 families in the village u0026amp one female doctor sonja u0026amp her sister natasha one of the families has a daughter u0026amp the soldiers are after her u0026amp her father the book only covers 4 5 days as the father tries to safely hide his daughter with the help of his neighbor during those 4 5 days however the author gives us a more detailed picture of the characters' lives for the past 10 years hence the skipping back u0026amp forth as to the title i found its meaning at the end of chapter 12 life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation i think that means the book is about life maybe marra gives his reading list at the back of the book u0026amp it's impressive it seems that he has studied chechnya u0026amp its history extensively i came away from the book with much sympathy for its citizens what horrors war can wreak i recommend this book because the characters are so wonderfully depicted but you'll need a strong constitution in many sections of it","3104":"my book club members voted to read this but i wasn't interested i am thankful to them for choosing this incredibly well written tale of life in an area of the world that i knew very little about few books affect me in a way that promotes me to learn more about that area the people and their history but this one did the writing style is memorable think i have a new entry on my top ten list of favorites","3105":"this was a really hard book to get into it was a depressing story and jumped around a lot i skipped over a lot of it i don't recommend it","3106":"i read this while traveling in europe while refugees were still are fleeing syria and iraq and other countries maybe that is why this book wrenched my heart and soul in such powerful ways but maybe it's because it was written so beautifully i smirked at the wit and i winced at the sadness i am thankful that i read it","3107":"a real struggle to get through i can't understand how folks can give this book 5 stars maybe i am not as intelligent as other readers but this was tough i did appreciate some of the writing there are gruesome details i could have done without yet felt a lot of compassion for all the characters as i hated the tiger's wife i should have known better than to start this book... well i did finish it and the plot came together at the end and some sense was made","3108":"set in the years of the chechnyan revolution this book made me laugh and cry wonderful characters excellent writing unique subject matter the events are dark but the overall sense is one of hope","3109":"it was a very slow starter but earned another star for the power of the last hundred or so pages","3110":" russia is depressing this was my basic take away from this book it made me grateful to live in a place that had a firm infrastructure of government rules and civility despite my opinion on the current state of things in america just be glad you didn't live in chechnya in the 90's and 00's as far as the novel goes i enjoyed seeing the story told from different characters points of view and seeing how their lives intersected and entwined what i didn't care for in terms of writing style was the sheer magnitude of some sentences the author liked to insert tangential stories for example describing an object and then the ultimate fate of its end owner while in the middle of relating the importance of the object to the main character at that particular point of time making for sentences even longer than this one if you want to see a semi colon properly employed this is the book for you it just made it hard to follow sometimes overall totally fascinating learning about the region and the unrest and seeing a few people struggle to make a life of it","3111":"beautiful book highly recommend","3112":"this one took me a long time to get into it and i almost stopped reading several times mainly because i am snowed in and was looking for a good fluffy murder mystery and this is definitely not that i am very glad that i stuck with it the stories all come together nicely and i really liked the way they unfolded because it is not told in chronological order so you get information that influences and explains what you read earlier in the book i would highly recommend it but not for a quick or light read","3113":" a constellation of vital phenomena book reportthe novel \" a constellation of vital phenomena\" is about a girl named havaa whose father was taken by the russians her neighbor adopts her and takes care of her he takes her to a hospital where they can stay but to give her complete happiness he must risk everything one thing that the author does really well is on the character havaa she is similer the boo from the novel \"to kill a mocking bird\" although she is more talkative then boo they have suffered the same havaa has lost her parents and boo has nobody until later on however that's what made it interesting none of them gave up they kept trying and later on they got people who cared for them and love them for who they are addition to why the novel is awesome is that it goes back to the past it shows how the world war affected some people's life and by reading the novel you get to imagine how you would fell do if you were in their shoe in my own opinion i would like to stop any world war from happening because i don't want anyone to suffer like havaa anthony marra is no doubt one of the best writers i have ever seen he creates stunning images inside of the readers mind and also tries to trick them a little by putting in false informations the characters he creates are very unique they all have different personality and of course different story line darren shan is also a great writer but the main character for cirque de freak and the demonata series all have the same story line darren have to leave his parents for power but gains power grubbs lost his parents but he gains power while reading the novel \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" i was getting the chill all along since it was based on winter i felt like i was actually in it also when it was at a sad scene you can feel how the character feel and you actually want to cry for them anthony marra makes amazing scene and adds a lot of emotions into them making him an awesome dude there was nothing really to dislike about the novel but if i had to chose it would be about how the story line goes a little slow there's nothing really wrong with that it's just that i like a fast paste book so the slow paste got me on the edge a little over all the novel \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is absolutely an amazing book due to it's emotions and perfect image and i'm sure you would like all the character that are presented in the novel if you like a novel that is action pack then this is not a book for you but if you like a heartwarming novel then come on in this book will suck you in until you've finished it in my honest opinion this is an amazing book and i recommend this if you just love reading","3114":"mystical beautiful and dark incredible story of chechnya a window into the country's present that is haunting the writing is wonderful but becomes more extravagant as the book progresses overall a compelling read","3115":"terrible and beautiful astonishing work for a first novel","3116":"interesting in terms of chechnya and the wars but just felt a bit manipulated by the somewhat heavy handed writing some beautiful moments but overall a little contrived","3117":"admittedly i travelled through the book with some effort at first as i was constantly distracted by my utter ignorance of the chechen wars feds landfill but the story gradually dug its hooks into me with the empathic characterisation and masterful imagery which set it apart from the many many other books that depict love in wartime","3118":"an incredibly accomplished debut novel by 28 year old anthony marra a constellation of vital phenomena is a story of compassion ambiguous morals and at times unfathomable optimism in war torn chechnya the main plot spans five days in 2004 opening with russian forces abducting a man in a small village and setting his house on fire as his eight year old daughter havaa hides outside in the snow ahmed an incompetent doctor but talented portraitist who lives across the street decides to hide havaa at a hospital in a nearby town where the stern sonja is the only remaining doctor the plot frequently flashes back to the nineties and extends throughout a decade of chechen conflicts to connect these characters their families and their neighbors in devastating and utterly unexpected ways alex sarrigeorgiousee more

should have liked this book more but it meandered so much through characters and time that the payoff at the end wasn't enough","3122":" the title is a mouthful and the idea of reading about war torn chechnya was not too enticing to me but this book had been recommended to me a number of times so i plunged in this debut novel is a moving portrayal of the effects of war on average citizens doctors an arborist and the thousands of innocent refugees that are thrown from their homes as one country exercises its power over another there are without a doubt grim moments in this story but there is also immense love and compassion this book will stay with you for some time after you close the last page","3123":"not since the book thief did i cry so hard","3124":"historical and literary author recounts the atrocities of deportation and war situated in the independent republic of chechnya russia during the period identified as the first and second chechen wars 1994 2004 one other goodreads reviewer noted the story takes five days a fact divulged at the book's end yet the plot covers years at least from the mass deportation in the mid 1940s the narrative development and characters' memories belie those few days in contrast to the disappearances landfill and female slavery there's hospital #6 a place of births amputations and medical attention and there's dokka's house for thousands of refugees on the move the ending bears a seed of optimism in the midst of ghoulish events with the joyous hope for one child's survival","3125":"a very ambitious book the characters are interesting and very human the setting is war ravaged chechnya the storyline and connection between the characters emerge slowly as the narrative drifts back and forth in time creating one impression and then challenging it as new details are brought to light the author paints a harsh reality with poetic prose","3126":" whew what just happened somehow i came through this universe of war desolation unspeakable injustices through a vortex or black hole and into the light of day knocked speechless and astonished incredible writing at first the going back and forth into different time periods and different characters was a bit confusing but i got over that the writing at times was very raw other times most compassionate but always very very vivid the images created will surely not be forgotten soon some images were horrible others touched your heart as the main characters did their best with the war thrust upon them their struggles to survive and maintain their sanity was gut wrenching how does one stay sane when the constant threat of torture or death is your everyday companion what happened to loved ones who went missing how do you keep your loved ones alive not to mention yourself how much can you endure how much can you love","3127":"perhaps one of the most powerful books i have read in the recent past chechnya and its wars are the backdrop for this novel that centers around a small town its missing people and two physicians who are intent upon saving an 8 year old girl i knew little about chechnya and though the book is at times dark and depressing with torture death and mans inhumanity to man it is in the tradition of great russian novelists","3128":"started off way too grim for me but i'm coming to love the intertwining of the characters and the connection i'm starting to feel to the universality of their thoughts emotions hopes etc","3129":"haunting and heartbreaking and beautifully written","3130":"i know i am in the minority for this rating i thought he book was very choppy and without a nice flow i had a hard time investing in the characters","3131":"a solid read overall but i'm definitely in the minority of people who didn't love it i suppose i just don't see what the fuss is all about the story is well written and all but to me it lacked pizzazz when i was reading it i was enjoying it well enough when i set it aside i didn't think about it at all i believe this will be one of those books that i will have difficulty summoning many if any details about as time passes i'm not disappointed that i read it it just is what it is and that's not much","3132":"my absolute favorite book so far this year just like the kiterunner i was taken to a part of the world in this case chechnya where i really didn't think i wanted to go through the strength of marra's storytelling we care about the people we understand the people and we laugh and cry with them wonderful characters and his style of writing going back and forth in time allows them to grow and become fully realized i hating coming to the end of the story","3133":"3 75 stars to the point yet striking writing the history was new and enjoyable this book felt like a smooth course maybe a little too smooth the jumping time periods were surprisingly well done the transitions smooth however i felt like the plot wasn't moving enough for my liking granted it takes place over the course of five days but i craved something more out of the plot still i look forward to picking up more of marra's works in the future","3134":"this is a touching story but i had trouble keeping the characters straight leading to a frustrating read","3135":"funny tragic and haunting","3136":"this book was published soon after the boston marathon bombings i decided to be more curious about chechnya there are interesting 10 yr timelines at the start of each chapter with highlighted years to help the reader navigate the complex back and forth in time storytelling method in the book the characters are so flawed and real it was sometimes hard to put the book down there are many unbelievable acts of cruelty contrasted with equally difficult acts of self sacrifice the writing is very clear and concise the author took the time to physically type up all four drafts just like the writer in the book there is a memorable exchange between two characters both quoting the qur'an one violent and predicting the end of the world and the other more peaceful and stressing the importance of what you do in life","3137":" a lyrical book talking hard topics of war the book pings back and forth from the 1990s and mid 2000s and the tumultuous two wars in chechnya just when you thought surely another war won't happen it does the book focuses on a village and the hospital near by the characters range from a tough brilliant russian surgeon who leaves london to come back to a chess playing arborist missing all his fingers and his precocious daughter who has seen to much people are spirited away in the night to horrible endings morals are compromised and tenderness shows up in the weirdest places all while chain smoking cigarettes it's funny sad brutal wise cracking and a pleasure to read","3138":"two physicians' whose paths have unknowingly crossed via tragic circumstances with loved ones collaborate to save a young girl from being disappeared in war torn chechnya that this is marra's debut novel makes it very impressive his characters' inner thoughts and complexities are fully known to the reader at times his paragraphs long sentences make it difficult to read and certainly the circumstances in which the story takes place are tragic","3139":"skip the goldfinch read this instead many of us cannot imagine why this book did not win the awards given to goldfinch this is not a matter of taste but a matter of quality this book compares in quality to almost any book on any list for top 100 books of all time since reading constellation i have not been satisfied by any other book i have read it has become a high standard that few other books can live up to i hope you enjoy it too","3140":"the best book i read this summer i know so little history of russia and the caucuses but i did not feel hindered by my ignorance this book will haunt me as i draw parallels with the wars and refugee crises going on now i recommend it","3141":"it was a beautifully told story of several interwoven lives in war torn chechnya it is easily one of the most well written books i've ever read","3142":"it took me a while to warm up to this novel but when i did there was no turning back it is different and it is excellent","3143":"beautiful this by far the best book i've read in a few years it joins a few select others on my favorite books bookshelf i'm not sure i can express why though the writing is perfect i wanted to stop highlight retread and remember so many sections the story is rich and folds in on itself perfectly pulling together the details the characters are so vibrant i feel like i know them but the writing if i could write a book this is what i would want it to be i especially adored the way the author would take people or objects that appeared in passing and alway let you know what happened to them over time go read this one","3144":"this book is gorgeously written it is an amazing story of loss despair and still finding enough hope to carry on an absolutely stunning first novel","3145":" i took a course in college entitled life vitality and thought which covered late 19th to early 20th century debate on how and why living things are distinct from dead matter the definition of life as a constellation of vital phenomena is a repetitive theme in the vitalist works from that time which is to say that i really wanted to love this book just based on how much the title revealed alone to be fair marra never truly disappoints he writes fiction as though writing poetry every word seems carefully considered conspiring towards the most perfectly formed sentences it's like watching a really talented artist sculpt before your eyes the sheer amount of research that must have gone into the book is also astounding i don't know who marra is and i must confess that i don't know much about chechnya except that which is reported in the news but he leaves the impression of having actually been there of having genuinely lived and loved and lost much in that time and in that place of having witnessed these horrors through someone else's eyes if not his own i was also blown away when in the afterword marra says that the axis on which this novel rests is formed from two narratives shared by islamic and christian traditions that of a parent asked to sacrifice a child and that of an orphan delivered into the family responsible for her orphanhood in literature we always talk about authorial intent and this if nothing else says so much about the depth of thought that must have gone into this piece so why did i not love this book it took a lot of thinking to pin it down and i think it has to do with how the book somehow ultimately failed to really move me intellectually i could look at each of the characters and mourn for them but always as as a stranger one step removed natasha was the closest i came to really feeling something but much of her personal journey is told backwards by design and the book had ended by the time it had gotten to her pov in all i'm going to chalk this down as akin to one of those great film classics that i can appreciate technically but that my heart just couldn't really get into","3146":"as hard as parts of this book were to read and engaging with such detailed and honest writing about war should be hard there was no way i could stop until i knew the fates of the child the grimly driven doctor and her lost sister the bottom of his class doctor whose art captured the disappeared the severely damaged traitor son and his father who fed the spoils of his betrayal to the dogs in this small village in chechnya during the russian invasion the author captures the cruelties and kindnesses of humanity under the worst possible circumstances i appreciated his temporal device a grey timeline from 1994 2004 with the year of that scene at the beginning of each chapter moving about in time was necessary and effective for the way he told the story knowing when we were moving backwards or forward was most helpful","3147":"it was slow starting for me but the excellent writing had me hooked i was also unaware of the war in chechnya during that time much less 2 wars i always find it especially hard to come to terms with such cruelty and pain when it is so recent i needed to read up on the history of chechnya the characters were believable the emotions were very well developed and conveyed to the reader hopefully this will not be his only book","3148":"i just don't know how i feel about this on one hand i love stories about connections and missed connections and i did love unravelling this on the other i also felt the plot wasn't totally there and sometimes marra was stretching for the message overall i did like the book and it read fast i just don't know that it's a book that's going to be a lasting impression or one that will fade away quickly","3149":"this is the perfect book to read while the us government is stubbornly set to shut down mode in chechnya the rebels put enemies of the people into a deep landfill they don't collect garbage because nearly everything is bombed in this setting anthony marra has created a handful of vivid characters who bring this embarrassing piece of history to light some of the prose is hard to read violent and despairing but then i would close the book and see the author's young innocent face how could he write such unrelenting horror this book is a major accomplishment but don't expect a happy ending","3150":"well written almost lyrical in parts some disturbing images of torture but the characters are memorable u0026amp will touch your heart the last section of the book is heart rending u0026amp powerful","3151":"this books makes my all time top 10 list maybe top 5","3152":"a very good book one of the best i've read recently the weaving of past and present isso skillful the characters are sad funny heroic despicable it shows what happens to the innocentbystanders caught up in ethnic wars it's novel of five days in chechnya in 2004 i wished it could havecontinued i so bought into the believability of the characters and cared about their lives","3153":"this novel was incredible not only because it was a first novel but because of its depth and beauty i recommend you go to wikipedia and read the history first because that will make the context much clearer for you this book stayed with me and is my current best book","3154":"whoever destroys a soul it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world and whoever saves a life it is considered as if he saved an entire world talmud","3155":" o k here is the deal i started this book then had company and got sick so it was almost a week before i picked it back up again i wasn't getting into it it was a little hard at the beginning so i almost dnf but boy am i glad i did it was intense but as the pieces unraveled it was un put down able i'm sure this was the author's intent but it reminded me of those russian dolls with layers and layers that you dig down through to find the germ of what is important at the end i immediately recommended it to a co worker who is russian not for the faint of heart but worth reading and possibly re reading","3156":"great title great book i heard the author being interviewed and he talked about how personal character is amplified in times of conflict the characters in this book are layered shaped by their situation flawed but at times perfect highly recommend","3157":"perhaps the best book i've read all year in the past 5 years i resonates with me like jeffrey eugenides's middlesex and louise erdrich's the master butcher's singing club it is with magic that these authors tell their stories","3158":"few novels are as good as their hype this one is an absolutely stunning novel especially remarkable as a first novel the writing is often poetic the plot gripping and quite moving marra has managed to provide a counterintuitive view of chechnya and the chechens this work joins the two other spectacular first novels of the year the orphan master's son and the golem and the jinni there must be something in the bay area water since all three live in this area","3159":"a beautifully written story about chechnya and therefore very very sad i still recommend it","3160":"a 3 5 for this one i liked the second half better than the first great characters just took awhile to get everyone straight with the time changes by chapter worth reading","3161":"really interesting characters set in a very interesting time place wartime chechnya transitions are a bit jarring at first but by the middle end i didn't notice and it did move the plot along and allow an interesting window into characters' backgrounds and motivations beautiful writing and lovely characters recommend","3162":"horribly depressing can't finish","3163":"i thoroughly enjoyed this story compelling for the characters and for the representation of what it is like to live divided by and affected by war past and present","3164":"excellent poetry in prose along with education in the horrors of the wars in chechnya and more","3165":"this guy is an amazing writer one to watch for sure sometimes the book is confusing because it goes back and forth on a timeline and follows the experiences of several characters i think part of my confusion was from not knowing much about recent chechnyan history i can recommend the book very highly to anyone who likes literary fiction","3166":"interesting but i needed to pay attention in the brginning because i kept losing track of who was who","3167":"great book profoundly moving and sad based on recent history of chechnya","3168":"good book took a little to really get into it not sure i liked the author's style of the really long run on sentences i think one was more than a page but i liked the way he told it in pieces jumping through the timeline and wrapping everything up at the end i learned a lot too","3169":"mixed feelings 1 this is a book about war 2 it is really depressing 3 shouldn't books about war be depressing 4 the author's writing was so brilliantly beautiful that it brought me to tears several times 5 yet by the end i was so depressed i didn't care about the beautiful writing i just wanted to stop thinking about death torture murder blood and men missing limbs and fingers in fact the author's beautiful writing just made all of the above worse 6 time for something lighter before i need therapy 7 i still might need therapy 8 where did i put the chocolate","3170":"amazing book incredibly well written engaging story strong female characters","3171":"slow at times but beautifully written and i loved the ending enough to bump it from a 3 to a 4","3172":"this novel wound back and forth from despair to the daily grind when life is reduced to its bare essentials organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptation are truly vital strong characters with flawed humanity reside within these pages war isn't pretty swift or merciful i found this book an uncomfortable yet memorable read","3173":"one of the most beautifully written and heart wrenching books i have ever read a masterpiece","3174":"hot damn i can't wait to see what marra does next i often found myself rereading passages because they were simply so beautiful i wanted to underline so many lines circle them star them but i couldn't do that to a library book i just many need to buy this book right now this is easily the best book i've read this year","3175":"for starters i had to spend 30 minutes or so on wikipedia to get a gist of the history of chechnya to have some frame of reference for this story chechnya is the sort of place where i thought bad things happened there fighting sounds funny to say chechnya don't know much about it after that it was a well written sad non sequential story which loosely links a lot of people in unfortunate and fortunate ways there is a lot of heartache in the interwoven stories loss of spouse to cancer loss of spouse to cognitive dysfunction from stress loss of all digits on both hands loss of freedom loss of safety for everyone in the book loss of rule of law and justice loss of homes loss of sister loss of parent in the middle of the night to russian feds the list goes on there is murder and betrayal and infidelity and brutality but also small kindnesses eternal devotion and a feeling of connectedness for all the harshness and war the ending is a little hopeful and i loved the depth of the characters especially khassan sonja havaa who has seen more in her 8 short years than most of us in our lifetimes and akhmed i would rate it higher but it was just so depressing notes l1839 as the saw teeth caught on the bone she had performed a second surgery one less bloody but no less brutal excising from his heart the impulse to run to cower to let the man bleed to death rather than face the horror of saving him the amputation had left both patients lighter l3946 as someone whose days were defined by the ten thousand ways a human can hurt she needed now and then to remember that the nervous system didn't exist exclusively to feel pain l4605 he understood why the feds would want to kill a child accompanying that understanding was a second equally shameful recognition this incomprehsnsible war would take from him even the humanity to find it incomprehensible","3176":"a bit complicated if you don't know much about chechnya but a fascinating if intense story","3177":"i wanted to read this book because my knowledge of chechnya was almost non existent though i knew it was a place where the history and the stories should be known to all and i find sometimes through fiction at least for me you can learn at a much deeper level than pulling up a wikipedia page really history is about the collective of individual experiences and this proved to be exactly what i was looking for in increasing my awareness of chechnya even though this was fiction and not exactly a full history it certainly provoked my interest to learn more and marra obviously did his research what i wasn't expecting however was that my heart would be picked apart page by page that by the end it would be back in my chest fuller than it was before it is a book that makes you want to atone for the sins of the world leave all your worldly possessions behind to find those who might be in need and hug your loved ones tight there were so many sentences that i read over and over again just to make sure i fully absorbed their beauty and as soon as i finished the book i went back to my dog eared pages to re read them one more time","3178":"war torn chechnya is horrible no resources water electricity food wildlife to kill schooling it's made worse by warring factions of muslim extremists and russian federalists the only way to survive or get any resources is to join the black market or become a snitch this story is about the terrible toll that sustained starvation oppression and torture can inflict on people and the love that can survive in spite of it it's pretty bleak but beautifully written","3179":"i found this book hard to follow it would jump back and forth between years it probably didn't help that it took me over 2 weeks to read and i kept forgetting what i'd read i was hoping for more information on chechnya and it's wars i felt like i would have enjoyed it more had i know more about chechnya and it's history before reading it it sort of is a depressing book","3180":"my only regret is that i read this book too quickly and didn't take the time to savor the writing the command of language is profound i don't often read books a second time but this is one that i might have to","3181":"beautiful and rich and wonderfully written account of finding life in the midst of death and hope among despair in a place most of us know very little about","3182":" a seemingly simple story that takes place over five days in 2004 during the second chechen war as akhmed an incompetent doctor but a decent man tries to save an 8 year old chechen girl havaa whose father dokka has been taken away by russian soldiers who believe that he collaborated with the rebel forces in this stunning debut mara places these fully realized characters in the larger historical context of a decade of conflict in chechnya by toggling back ten years to the first war and sometimes flashing forward in time akhmed and havaa seek refuge at a hospital where sonja the only physician remaining resists akhmed's offer to work in the hospital until suitable accommodations can be found for havaa as \"caring for the dying overwhelmed her she couldn't be expected to care for the living as well \" sonja is haunted by the disappearance of her sister the haughty beautiful and beloved natasha who survived human traffickers in italy only to disappear years later after working in sonja's hospital delivering babies akhmed's \"uncle\" khassan a sharpshooter in the great patriotic war who at 79 is completing his 3 300 page \"history of this sliver of humanity the world seemed determined to forget \" khassan is a pariah because he is the father of an informer ramzan who he ignores despite the fact that ramzan procures the insulin khassan requires to live ramzan began running guns for rebels with dokka but after a detention resulted in castration he rationalizes the lives he had extinguished \" w hether eating scavaged food or selling an old friend they had all shamed themselves to survive greed didn't motivate his informing at least not primarily primarily he informed by necessity to survive for his love and hate and above all awe of the power wielded by the interrogating officer \" the novel contains brutal scenes of torture but mara somehow balances the horror with gallows humor reminiscent of catch 22 and concludes this ambitious tale with humanity and hope you must read this book","3183":"a powerful book will stay with you long after you finish the last page","3184":"a beautifully written story i enjoyed all of the characters the extent to which were all intertwined though gave just a tad bit of pause really good nonetheless","3185":"i really wanted to like this but had a tough time getting into it ultimately worthwhile but took some determination to get there","3186":"brilliant a novel about the trauma and insanity of war but in equal part how it bares the essence of character the constellation of the title consists of six main characters who each get a voice and a score of minor actors who blaze briefly but brightly at the center is havaa an eight year old the feds are intent on disappearing one surreal fact in a novel brimming with the black comedy of war havaa's fate becomes inextricably tangled with everyone else's including people she's known only for a moment or not at all i'll long remember both akhmed the hapless humble surgeon who becomes a hero through no design of his own as well as ramzan an informer guilty of countless deaths a man marra refuses to judge and so makes fully recognizably human the language is exquisite much of the dialogue improbably funny chechen history unspools ravels spins back on itself lord knows how he ever managed a plot so intricate","3187":"one if the most amazing books i have read will make you contemplate the human spirit long after you've put it down","3188":"4 5 stars i was nervous about the comparisons to the tiger's wife and the english patient but they were apt if you liked either you'll like this book the same epic scope u0026amp fantastic writing bring this book to my favorite of the year","3189":" andrew marra's debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena about the last two decades in war torn chechnya isn't an easy read -- but not in the sense that it's difficult to understand it's not an easy read because it's in a word unflinching there are depictions of torture that can make even the most iron stomached reader squirm and there are also stories of human trafficking drug abuse and plenty of violence additionally it's not in easy read because of the simple fact that it's a little embarrassing not to have ever heard of or have been cognizant of this pain and these atrocities and the sheer lack of humanity that was happening here is this tiny central asian eastern european country i'd known nothing about and to learn about all that has occurred there in the last 20 years it's just sad on a number of levels how do more people not know about this but amidst the pain and sadness is a finely wrought character driven novel that shows that in war and its aftermath there are few good guys and many bad guys and there are certainly no winners but many many losers the real time action in this novel occurs over about five days in december 2004 -- four years after the official conclusion of the second chechen war but still in the midst of a prolonged insurgency by chechen rebels the novel begins with a chechen man named dokka being disappeared -- that is captured by russian troops and brought to a torture chamber called the landfill but his neighbor akhmed helps dokka's 8 year old daughter escape to a nearby hospital where a woman named sonja is the lead doctor sonja though is trying to hold together her own life her younger sister natasha is missing and sonja fears the worst moving back and forth in time marra slowly and carefully reveals how all these characters' lives are connected it's a brilliantly layered carefully constructed story -- as these characters often find out how they're connected with each other and more importantly why at the same instant the reader does it's powerful and often very sad part of the point is that in a war torn country logic breaks down when russians are bombing a chechen village a character exclaims to another we are being liberated of course they're not being liberated they're being conquered the villagers then use toilets to cover unexploded ordnance leaving a patchwork of craters and upside down toilets in the bombed out village so many dozens of upside down toilet bowls crowded the streets that cars wouldn't pass for weeks and in that time she would occasionally hear the overdue explosions the shrapnel ringing within the ceramic but those bowls the one decent legacy of the soviet union never broke what an image marra is a writer of immense talent -- and it's mind boggling that this is his debut novel there are even moments of levity here that help move the reader along at the beginning of the novel when akhmed brings the young girl to the hospital he tries to brag that he's also a doctor sonja quizzes him about what would he would do with an unresponsive patient he replies that he'd give the patient a questionnaire sonja just rolls her eyes -- how could an unresponsive patient complete a questionnaire later we learn that akhmed interpretted unresponsive to mean a patient who couldn't or wouldn't talk -- and so the patient would have to write out answers to question to determine the problem this novel is highly recommended but again not for the squeamish and it does take a fair amount of concentration to keep track of how all the pieces are coming together and what the relationships mean but it's well worth the effort it's a brilliant novel -- one of my favorites of the year","3190":"such a well written book with a story that draws you in as the characters live as best they can through the sorrow and tragedy of wars they don't seem to understand the brutal acts of torture by the soldiers are unforgettable as are the characters who seem to accept their fate as being caught in the middle of hell on earth the ending makes the journey worth it","3191":" four and a half i had some trouble with the chronology of this novel even with the year markers at the top of each chapter but the beautiful writing and characters pulled me along and i'm so glad i stuck with it if i ever have the urge to read it again it will make more narrative sense the second time with that said the threads do come together so take heart there are strong male and female characters here and a lot of suffering and love it's impossible to not think about the ukraine russian conflict now when reading about chechnya in these pages and wishing for peace in this unstable and uncaring world of war i think the novel's title while mysterious and lyrical might turn some readers away but if they give it a chance they will realize that their effort was worthwhile great book club read so much to discuss","3192":"well crafted i appreciate the way the author shows the reader the perspectives of many different characters","3193":"it was really hard to follow at first but i'm glad i didn't give up on it the last 100 pages were great and the story all came together finally","3194":"brutal heartbreaking and yet funny in parts horrifying to realize most events in book took place less than 10 years ago and how little i knew about them","3195":" thank you deni yes this book is possibly perfect it has been a while since i have cried at the end of a book due to its sheer beauty i echo some of what marc x said too learning about chechnya through this novel also gave me such appreciation for what the soviet ssr's may have gone through i knew nothing of the place and time before and now feel deeply about them also just gorgeously written almost every page has an image or a description that i wanted to underline and remember and hopefully write as well as someday the fact that the author was able to achieve this effect with the book as a whole is astonishing this is what an educated thoughtful deep feelinged artist may gift to the world when he has given it his best years and it is a gift i hope many of us will appreciate though the subject matter is bleak it is beautiful i absolutely recommend this book","3196":" i was a little worried for a while reading this book the seemingly overly precious title which when explained in the book is a pretty effective metaphor the heavy leaning on past masters such as heller and marquez despite the interplay of the text with tolstoy i didn't see much of him in these pages the really awkward pov switches where we suddenly get the future story of an incidental character and the whole baggage of an outsider writing on a conflict that he wasn't personally connected to these concerns disappeared as i read the book though the unbearable tragedy humanity sadness and brutality of this novel were impossible to deny whatever rickety framework the author presented it in and thankfully delivered with enough humor and wonder to ease the sourness and bleakness the ending may attempt a bit of crowd pleasing note and tries to pull off as happy as an ending as possible but for a debut novel this a very impressive work a work that shines light on the dead and departed of a totally ignored conflict a witnessing that alone makes this book worthwhile this book is filled with humanity and humor but be warned it contain horrifying scenes of torture and general bleakness of a cruel war so this is not one for the fainthearted but is beautiful enough to deserve reading","3197":"a beautifully written but tragic story of people living in a rural village in chechnya the characters in this book opened my eyes to the treatment of native chechens by russians","3198":"haunting as messy and beautiful as life itself a constellation of vital phenomena takes the reader on a whirlwind journey through the harsh landscapes and lives of war torn chechnya the historical and cultural references scattered throughout provide the fabric marra deftly weaves together through the lives of his characters more than just a collection of characters these people portray a community a constellation of disparate people that together tell a rich story life as defined in the book as organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation is the theme of this story and hopefully when you finish it you too will have a renewed sense of just how lucky we are to experience these vital phenomena in our own lives","3199":"i struggled to get into this story and with the exception of a few stories found the intermixed timeline to be confusing but i think the ending was sweet and made it all worthwhile especially khasaans","3200":"a powerful haunting story that made me wonder if i could survive such difficult times without losing my own sense of humanity captivating language richly fleshed out characters and unforgettable scenes","3201":"this was boring maybe it would have gotten better but i made it through about 1 3 and decided that was enough","3202":"loved it opened my eyes about all the layers of the chechnyan conflict but was also a very touching story about how people respond to war and what they do when they have nothing left incredibly depressing at times but very worthwhile read","3203":"one of the best novels i've read in a while incredibly sad and populated by memorable characters the most enjoyable part of this book are marra's magical sentences the beauty of his prose reminds me of colum mccann and if marra goes on to write as many beautiful books as mccann has we're witnessing the burgeoning career of a great new novelist","3204":"the best book i read all year it might have said this on the back but it really was like jonathan safran foer meets tolstoy so compassionate and detailed with quirky touches with a strong plot and engaging structure too it illuminates a part of the world i know i didn't know anything about making it human rather than pitiable i think it said this on the back too haha but it truly did make me laugh out loud and cry amazing book","3205":" this book was wonderful and deserving of all the praise this year with a touch of absurd vonnegut esque humor we are emerged in the lives of akhmed sonja haava and khassan as they suffer through day to day life in war torn chechnya the humor is a much needed respite from the cruelties of war and heartbreaking twists of fate the character development in this novel was superb i felt as if they were my friends and honestly i saved the last 70 or so pages until i was ready to say good bye this book is a little challenging to read in that i am not exactly knowledgeable about chechnya the author does a great job blending the particulars of the history through the character","3206":"beautiful and heart wrenching","3207":"lots of amazing reviews but i can't seem to get into this book at all","3208":"the beginning was tedious for me but my real complaint is that i feel the timeline was done sloppily there are other books i've read that have had a similar jumping timeline and succeeded gracefully but i feel this timeline was jarring the characterization was beautiful though and so was the writing i actually later found much of the beauty lied in the details particularly with characterization despite the confusing timeline and character connections this book made me chuckle and cry i am choosing only three stars because it did have a tendency to drone on and i could definitely feel such a hazy plot that even beautiful writing couldn't make up for it plus of course as i've mentioned twice before the messiness of the connections and years","3209":"this is one of the best books i have read in a very long time","3210":"i was spammed this book i wouldn't read spam of any kind it only encourages the low life to this is legitimate marketing","3211":"this story is very thoughtful illustrating the best and worst of humankind well written with layers and layers of meaning i felt convicted to widen my world view after reading any book that evokes that kind of response in me gets five stars","3212":" i think the best way for me to characterize how i felt about this book is to say that i admired it but did not really enjoy it it's beautifully written it really is but sometimes it just felt labored marra rarely let any description go by without a metaphor or simile and some of them were stunning truly but after a while it became a little exhausting i admired also the way that marra was able to move between past and present or what was present in the book 2004 allowing the reader to learn more without making it obvious that he was connecting the dots it was subtle and of course for a novel about war torn chechnya it was also pretty bleak and devastating and marra successfully has you care about the characters so that you feel the sadness and the suffering because of that and because of the way he writes however i just wanted the book to end about 100 pages before it actually did so","3213":"excellent moving book that i thought about long after closing last page","3214":" a beautifully written book that also brings to life a world and history i know so little about gave me much insight about the chechen conflicts and the roots of the current troubles in that region but it was also a very compelling story that kept me interested in what would happen to each of the characters and the language was so evocative and beautiful it's a dark book and it took me a while to finish it because i started it each night before bed and so that made me a little confused at times with the several timelines and milieus that the book takes place in so it would be better read when you had some time to really immerse yourself in it","3215":"i know how i felt while reading this book but why why did i constantly want to do anything else but listen why near the conclusion did i just listen to get to the end this book is set in a small chechen village in 2004 thus during the second chechen war the story is told through numerous flashbacks it is of course about the ravages of war it is grim reading and until the end there is little that inspires any hope although the author does infuse the story with humor it is ironic humor sad humor humor that laughs at the stupidity of man the humor in this book rarely made me laugh there is a glimmer of hope at the end but it is too late and too weak you must know by now that i do not demand jolly books but this one is d e p r e s s i n g you will nod and sigh and shake your heads with utter despair so do you learn much about the two chechen wars not really other than that they were horrible the book is choppy in that you flip back and forth in time it is confusing not so much because of the different time settings but because the author never says anything directly the language is convoluted what is said is implied this is not to my taste i prefer a more direct simple language i remember at one point they had to go around a dangerous spot but what does anthony marra say they circumnavigated the area over and over i muttered just say it straight i felt like i was supposed to be impressed with his clever words i admit the author did occasionally express himself beautifully there were times when he blew me away in his ability to beautifully depict a situation an event or an idea the narration by colette whitaker was not to my taste either much of the time she droned on in a dispassionate manner this was not so bad when the horrors of the war were related but it was almost numbing neither did i like the so very typical eastern european accent attributed to the chechens what did i get from this after reading it have i a more detailed better understanding of the chechen wars scarcely it is mostly about how the people suffered and that i knew did it impart an important message that was new no most people seem to be head over heels in love with this new author not me","3216":"this novel deserves at least 6 or 7 stars out of 5 i can't stop thinking about the horrors of chechnya a country that i probably would have a hard time finding on a map the characters all built of their country's strife are also in some way torn apart by it this new author anthony marra creates new and vivid images which help us see hear feel taste and smell love fear desperation guilt and just about every emotion his finely drawn family of characters have for example she drifted a kelp rope on the tide that washed away her country family and future the rind of buffer states diminished as republics peeled away you will survive she told herself you will turn the holes in your life into storage space for months they'd run their fingers around the hem of their affection without once acknowledging the fabric the circumference of the world tightened to what their arms encompassed haava the youngest character is introduced to the reader on the first page she is precocious adored and the nexus of much of this saga each of the other characters have a significant role in the next few days of her life it is amazing how marra is able to seamlessly create a collage of these characters' lives loves foibles self destructive qualities and the effects of living in a country which is ravaged by desperation and cruelty the refugees who pass through their small town the townspeople who are disappeared are not lost because they are carefully jig sawed into this masterpiece as i think about the war crimes described in detail i like to think that this happened over there in the middle of nowhere by starving peasants the problem is that it is happening in the middle east and africa some of the americans were involved in it in abu grave with the knowledge and permission of at least some senior officers and some of the american statesmen on our soil 2 very bright alienated teens in colorado set traps and picked off as many of their peers as they could before killing themselves how many times do we read about young men gang raping girls or maliciously attacking a suspected gay person merely because they can happily lynchings are now few and far between but we certainly have the same dna as the chechnian rebels and feds when we are hungry hopeless unloved drunk or drunk with power we destroy ourselves by destroying others marra also writes about love familial love fraternal love and romantic love the love that these characters feel keep their deceased siblings parents lovers and friends alive it made me think of my brother parents aunts and uncles and friends who i carry around with me death doesn't really take them away just moves them to another place two of the characters are artists their pictures also resurrect that which has been destroyed two of the characters are doctors who try preserve life too one of the most important characters is a historian again trying record for future generations what has passed the saddest character is the informer who has given up his neighbors friends and his self respect after the rebels have taken away his manhood his chance for posterity i can't think of a more important or more satisfying book don't leave this on your to read list","3217":"every now and then a story comes along that just stays with you this is one maazing and interesting history harsh but not 'bleak' and the author gives you 'hope' along the way by dropping in 'little did they know that in years they would be doing ' i see chechyna through new eyes and just love that moment you read 'how the title came to be' not to be missed","3218":"sadly i don't think i was in the right space to read a book of this nature i would have stopped to start it again another day but it is gripping in the first third of the book and then i got lost just over half way","3219":"this was a beautifully written book that deserves more than two stars but it was just too grim for me it's taken me all summer to read because i've been avoiding it of course i stuck with it because i know that books all seem to pick up speed toward the end i liked piecing the story together at the end but it was a slog","3220":"i absolutely loved this book i didn't know very much about the chechen wars and as i read i kept looking things up and learned a lot i thoroughly enjoyed how the characters were interwoven together and i loved the author's style of writing the best book i've read in a long time","3221":"incredible if you enjoy historical fiction make sure to add this to your list the characters were compelling the story heartbreaking and the writing well done the author splendidly interweaves the years from 1994 to 2004 and his approach to epiloguing the future throughout the book is fresh i hadn't known much about chechnya before this just in passing on the news it was revealing and sad to learn about in this way and i look forward to learning more on my own","3222":"read 126 pages great concept and the first 75 pages are very encouraging and then we start with the war and well i tried but just not for me","3223":"this story was beautifully rendered about a special war torn place in the world that is hardly discussed anymore except for the fact that the boston marathon bombers hailed from chechnya i loved the story and the spot on colorful language that embued the story the only negative was that it was a bit hard to follow the characters as the story was choppy and did not flow smoothly i would definitely read this author's next book","3224":" wow i don't know what to say this book deserves every one of those 5 stars if not more it's not an easy read but it's a book you must read especially in light of what is going on in the world today with our proxy wars with russia which is still run by monsters in my opinion sorry to get political this book touched me deeply and i will think about it long after it goes to my red read shelf in my bedroom it's truly amazing how our lives cross each other's and how small decisions can impact our lives greatly read this book you won't be disappointed","3225":"this was a heavy read beautifully written with complex character but the content was difficult set in chechnya russia it is a true account of the horrors of war as it tears people down to the most basic drive for survival the story is set over 5 days and weaves stories of a doctor and her sister with 4 men and a young girl in a small village its about deception betrayal family anguish and joy","3226":"stunning marra's writing is spare lovely sad and hopeful his story of the brutal war in chechnya can be hard at times but i never wanted to stop marra created fascinating characters with no archetypes and brought their stories together with the grace of kate atkinson i cannot wait to see what he does next","3227":"this was one of those books you read slowly so you can savor the exquisitely written sentences why are so many well crafted stories set in awful war torn settings it's a testament to this guy's writing style that i kept wanting to return to it knowing i'd be jumping back into a post apocalyptic setting of utter misery even cooler there are parts here and there where the dialogue is laugh out loud funny","3228":" it's been a few hours since i finished this book and i'm still dwelling over some of the points of it it's completely self absorbed but i really tied the book's timeline with mine the book's story covers 1999 2003 in chechnya and every chapter had a timeline at the beginning 1998 the war is going on and one of the characters tries to flee but gets trapped in a sex trafficking ring i was graduating high school and moaning about my own personal bullshit 2003 people are being actively disappeared tortured and land mines are everywhere there is one doctor for an entire region and anyone can be informed on for nothing i was going back to undergrad and still bitching about my own personal bullshit i have read many many books on war violence dictatorships genocide and yet this book really drove home how first world i am i am not sure why it got to me but it did it wasn't just the timeline that got me the author does a great job of reeling me in and making me care about the characters everything seems straightforward until you realize that their stories are all overlaid and there is a bit of a mystery about the little girl i also loved how we get peeks into the futures of the characters in other books i tend to wonder what happens to my fave people but marra gives me little insights into the future even those who don't make it in interesting ways i even love the title which is from the definition of life in a medical book definite good read","3229":"truly a remarkable book i'm often a cowardly reader tending to avoid books that i think will be dispiriting or depressing but anthony marra manages to take the horror and tragedy of the wars in chechnya and simply or complexly through beautiful lyric prose turn it into a story you just want to inhale it takes real artistry to take the reader somewhere she otherwise wouldn't want to go by sheer force of language","3230":"the writing is superb and the subject matter is devastating there are perfect gems of sentences among descriptions of unimaginable torture and inhumane living conditions","3231":" i was worried i didn't know enough about the wars in chechnya to fully appreciate this novel but i was happily proved wrong the detail of everyday life marra portrays in a constellation of vital phenomena doesn't require extensive knowledge of the regions despair it did however bloom a desire to learn more about this part of human history the characters in this novel seem like real people to me the situations they are put in are incredibly harsh and almost unbelievable until you remember that the human race can be a beastly thing there's a lot of evil out there but thankfully little pockets of good to lull you to sleep at night all the characters are yearning for something family safety courage to do the right thing knowledge of what that right thing is and their struggle is so real it's historical fiction its a novel about not only a war torn country but the people forced to inhabit what's left who pick up the meager pieces and get on with life the best way they can the loss of family of home of comfort safety power food life it's powerful and disturbing but full of hope amazing read","3232":"an unbelievably moving account of the ravages of war the impact of trauma and the consequences of surviving with integrity powerful compelling and painful to read","3233":"so beautiful so profoundly heart achingly sad","3234":" anyone who's read 100 years of solitude will recognize in this young writer's voice and world view similarities that unacknowledged influence not only gets marra to rely heavily on subjunctives they would remember him he would remember the day move the story along but also imbue his characters especially the ignorant or unworldy with great verbal acuity to understand their own feelings and analyse their standing in the world bordering on magical realism of yesteryear the all knowing voice of the author with overwhelming sympathy for the creatures of this universe was intrusive i for one did not believe one minute that the uk educated female gp in a backwater chechen hospital would have the kind of comical give and take with the orderly their exchanges smacked of thinking and speaking in english to me even though i know nothing of chechen language i could hear in the dialogues a lot of saturday night live much much cultural baggage that to me simply could not be transposed to chechnya of the time the side characters are simply too many and unbelievable as well","3235":"i first saw the title of this book mentioned on twitter and the word \"constellation\" caught my eye i looked up the book on amazon and found out it is about 1994 to 2004 pre post war chechnya a constellation of vital phenomena is the debut novel from anthony marra being of my generation i was very impressed with his writing and how his extensive research and knowledge is demonstrated throughout the book read the full review here http storybyvisualvictoria wordpres","3236":"this book was so well written and so terribly tragic that it was beautiful i loved the way the author weaves the story into it's title i want all my reading friends to read this one","3237":" anthony marra's novel is set in 2004 in the middle of the second chechnyan war when the small republic is caught up in conflicts over its own autonomy in the aftermath of the post soviet era russia rains devastation on chechnya through overwhelming military force some times disappearing entire villages marra's narrative focuses on ordinary chechnyan people caught up in the ongoing brutality and oppression who manage to maintain substantial portions of their own integrity nothing about the way the novel's characters live is normal at least by standards imaginable in more stable places and yet an affirmation of life persists one of the novel's pivotal locations is a pathetic hospital staffed by a surgeon an old nurse and a one armed security guard the surgeon who went to medical school in the uk and could have stayed in london uses black market supplies to treat victims of the violence she uses amphetamines to keep herself going no one employed at the hospital has been paid for years and yet two people who seek refuge in the hospital one who stays and one whose stay is brief change lives there and in the midst of pain and sacrifice carry the business of life forward marra has a deft hand with movement in time episodes involving different characters may be revisited in flashbacks one character's experience adding a new perspective or information critical to the telling of the story after the narrative episode has been opened by the experience of a previously introduced character this interleaving of layers builds lives stories of individuals of nations of the human predicament near the book's end the surgeon recalls being asked whether she would leave london if she could go back 'if you could go back ' there was a time when she had indulged in the hypothetical for hours a day plotting the map that had led her here but no life is a line and hers was an uneven orbit around a dark star a moth circling a dead bulb searching for the light it once held and yet from that uneven orbit emerges a rich and courageous legacy one of strength and hope","3238":"4 5 starsthough not an action packed war novel marra showcases the coarseness of reality and rawness of his characters with expert fluidity the way the story tend to drag drew parallel to how time seem to pass by in situations of high distress and constant hardships full review @ https thebooksconfetti wordpress co","3239":"great writing strong structure thought provoking moving even haunting a time and place i knew little about i suspect most people know little about the history of chechnya i read a lot of books this one is one of those that i won't forget definitely worth reading","3240":"passionate powerful beautiful harrowing poetic brutal intense lyrical a truly memorable book not an easy story to read but so worth the effort this would make a great read for a book club","3241":" i am a well educated and intelligent woman and while i shun network news i read and listen to quality news sources and consider myself reasonably well informed turns out i am a total moron on the subject of the russian checknyan conflict and while not a history per se nor a book on war \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" is another in a distinguished litany of great stories centered in war time i was reminded of the madonnas of leningrad another beautiful novel and occasionally of hemingway without machismo the writing is so good characters unforgettable images haunting sometimes hard to bear but essential to tell the tale we hear alternating voices the neighbor who saves a little girl after her father is taken away and his ailing wife a woman physician struggling to maintain a hospital shades of mash without humor an old man trying to write the history of his culture a long suffering nurse and the little girl herself who binds them all and gives them hope at a time when there seemed few options for hope she is a marvel of optimism and in that way makes it all the more poignant to think about all the children of all the wars who have lost their loved ones but never give up hope of seeing them again i have seen some sorrow in my life and read about lots more but little compares to this and if nothing else reading this book makes you all the more grateful for peace the novel starts before it all began and ends without resolution beyond some personal gratification hard won in such madness the prose is poetry - this writer is a winner and infinitely more sophisticated than a debut novel he is by the way a stegner fellow that speaks volumes beyond the setting and the situation it is just plain good storytelling i only heard about the novel via one of the esoteric writing reading websites i am addicted to and also because amazon named it a book of the month as it might otherwise have been missed take a deep breath and read but prepare to be hammered in the best possible way would be great for a book group discussion but not for escapist entertainment that it is decidedly not","3242":" lord where do i even begin with this book i don't want to be that one lone hater but this novel did not live up to the hype for me anthony marra has an interesting and unique writing style and like a lot of reviewers before me initially i agreed that he was a great writer but as the novel wore on i saw through his writing and it made me change my mind his writing is detailed to the point that descriptions become superfluous near the end of the novel i remembered the word for this kind of thing purple prose i guess it lends to his unique writing style but it doesn't really work out there are numerous short passages with details about people the main characters have barely met and that are insignificant to the plot and details of objects that came into a particular character's possession as readers did we really need to know about the owner of a silver ring or an old marriage license the answer to both questions are no and no marra also has a love for metaphors and by love i mean a passionate burning love affair he compares things and ideas that aren't really comparable at all i know this is part of marra's writing style but it became old and extremely worn out barely even halfway through the novel marra writes in a way that is very nonlinear it reminded me of a jj abrams tv series and as much as i love jj abrams this isn't really a good thing every single main and secondary character has a story and numerous backstories and it can feel overwhelming at times because the stories are so detailed by the end of the novel you know each character personally which i didn't really mind too much actually but the way certain characters' stories are told like natasha's story and khassan's story to name some examples felt more like marra was telling rather than showing the main events take place over five days but with the inclusion of every detail and every character's story it felt like things dragged along for five months so it feels unbelievable that akhmed and sonja or even sonja and havaa became fast friends in less than a week or maybe it's not so unbelievable in marra's world there's actually no point to this novel i found that out way too late i had to drag my eyes through the rest of the story because it just went on and on interesting things do happen and the characters are unique but most of the novel is told through backstories and when you find out how the characters' lives are intertwined hence the title a constellation of vital phenomena sometimes it feels like marra just tacked on the characters' relationships just to say hey this is how they knew each other and while it does seem pretty cool at first because sometimes they don't seem obvious and they're written in a matter of fact kind of way as this goes on it seems more unbelievable and it all feels like a big gimmick a constellation of vital phenomena is a book where bad things happen to neither good nor bad people and these are the emotions they face and the people they meet and this is how they dealt with everything experiencing the human condition even through a fictional novel is such a heavy and tiring thing but it can also be rewarding in this way i think marra achieved something that many authors have tried and failed at and i guess another good thing about this book is learning about soviet and chechen history","3243":"this is a significant book not an easy read on any level ethnic nuances war upon war tragedy that affects every aspect of life every day one reviewer used sweeping to describe this and it truly is excellent characters fully created tell a horrible and sweet story of finding a way to exist when the world makes no sense this is a debut novel that promises a major career for anthony marra it took me a while to read this but i could not walk away","3244":"if you read only one book in your entire life make it this one","3245":"out of all the prominent words i could use to promulgate the compassion i felt during my read of a constellation of vital phenomena nothing can do it justice this novel in all sizes is absolutely fabulous it tells the story of a group of people endurances during the first and second chechen wars how their fates are interlocked together without the slightest awareness about it and as the novel revealed itself to me i found myself again mystified by the tremendous effect war has on people war changes everything it reshapes the immutable crushes the cores of society proliferates its venom similarly to the way a virus protrude itself into a cell causing it abnormal conditions it made the majority of the novel's characters pervaded with cowardice fear egoism hurt fright terror sadness melancholy and all sort of unpleasant sensation one can think of some were less fortunate because war either killed them or caused them severe illnesses both mental and physical but among these people a few understood that war requires sacrifice and were ready to offer it to offer their lives war is the most unhuman thing humans create great book","3246":"very good book but not exactly a light happy read","3247":"this book makes you realize that people's lives can connect in unexpected ways and that anguish and joy can be closest intertwined if you can't know for certain you can hope and when you do know how things turn out you can find solace in the little things","3248":"the book was difficult for me to read because the facts of the story are so depressing but the writing is beautiful and the humanity of the characters so engaging that i kept reading i am glad that i did","3249":"absolutely beautiful heartbreaking and a story about a part of the world i know so little about a truly fantastic book","3250":"this book was beautiful and felt so real and amazing i can't give it enough praise","3251":"heartbreakingly beautiful the ways in which marra interconnects the stories of each character is masterful i was drawn in by his ability to inhabit individual streams of consciousness in one moment and then foretell the future of that character in the next seemingly perhaps to comfort the reader","3252":"this book is an ugly dose of reality about living in russian chechnya","3253":"i know next to nothing about the conflicts in chechnya i'm committed to learning more after reading this book the story is masterfully spun with moments horrific as well as beautiful and the characters are complex and fascinating","3254":"oh my gosh this book you have to read it read for hours under the covers on my iphone last night in order to finish it and could not stop thinking about it all day","3255":"i really enjoyed it it was a great story with wonderful characters cast in horrific times you should read this book the whole book builds to the final scene which is truly wonderful and leaves you smiling","3256":"well written but i have issues with the third person omniscient narrative too much extraneous information is divulged in order to tug at the readers heart strings and it cheapened the overall feel of the book which is otherwise quite sadly beautiful otherwise i appreciated the book and its depiction of the wars in chechnya","3257":"this book is amazing it is dark funny bitter beautiful and informative i have to admit that this isn't the kind of book you can sit down and read on a beautiful sunny day the book tells a story a sad story that blooms into other sad stories but no matter how many deaths and suffering take place in the book and in this world the book inspires you to live to continue on breathing because sometimes that's all that there's left to do","3258":"a haunting grim tale centered on the frailty of the human spirit it took longer than expected to complete this book due to its heavy content that gave me much to digest while reading the lack of familiarity that i have with chechnya distanced me at first from the story and i never gained a complete understanding of the chechen wars by the end however marra does a good job of using the turbulent setting as a rich backdrop for his characters and succeeds in putting a face on the tragedy of a war ravaged country occasionally the prose is convoluted and marra leans on writing style over plot development flipping back and forth in time and changing points of view between chapters makes for a choppy flow and the connection between time periods is not seamless enough to justify a nonlinear narrative i did feel that the storylines and characters were woven together beautifully upon finishing many of the seemingly random character details sprinkled throughout the book were like puzzle pieces falling into place at last although the environment and futures for most were bleak here it was a relief to see that some hope existed however small","3259":"the story was a bit slow at times but the writing in this novel is absolutely fantastic","3260":"would give this 6 stars if i could one of the most amazingly well written books i have ever read","3261":"this is a book that was hard to read it was full of messages about life war humanity and common people and yet at times was hard to put down it is also gut wrenching and brutal it takes place in chechyna in a period of time from the mid 1990's to about 2004 it starts with two major characters and in a small village near a bombed out hospital from there it keeps adding characters that surround them and their stories i would recommend it as a a read but it is not easy if you believe in the basic goodness of man this book will put your belief to a real test i also found the repeated switching of scenes from the 1990's to 2004 hard to follow the ending was done in a slightly unusual way it drew the pieces past present and future together in a satisfactory way","3262":"my oh my fabulous book","3263":"so well written and interesting very heavy emotionally","3264":" 3 5 from me this book which follows the lives of interlinked characters from 1994 2004 in war torn chechnya is fantastically well researched and often beautifully written however i found the structure a little confusing at times as there are lots of flashbacks and some of the characterisations were a bit trite sonja the doctor's incredible talents didn't ring true for me the worst thing though was i didn't like any of the characters in the book not one i found sonja and havaa a young girl central to the story who eventually is brought up by sonja after her father disappears incredibly irritating shame as it could have been a great book i would recommend to others but will not be revisiting it myself","3265":" it took me a while to get fully into this book but once i got ahold of who each character was and how they sat in the plot i couldn't stop reading the unstructured plot slowly revealing new morsels of information about each character in relation to each other works splendidly at building tension and connection to characters some of the most haunting war prison scenes that i will never forget interesting reflections on how the smallest actions or emotions can effect those around us and those we love","3266":"fantastic read and definitely recommend","3267":"this book is fabulous absolutely the best book i've read all year in a year of heavy reading my insides are all a jumbled and this story these characters pretty sure they will be with me for quite some time","3268":"this is one outstanding novel i found it beautifully written with great skill and an obvious tenderness for the subject i was moved beyond words all through the book if feel honored to have come to know the characters even if it was only through the imagination of the author please don't miss this one for an appreciation that this has all happened before read the cellist of sarejevo it is a beautiful testament the survival of the human spirit","3269":"this is one of the best books i've read in a long time the story was interesting and real and the writing is spectacular","3270":"this book will make you cry a hundred times over but the ending is worth so much more than the numerous heartbreaks that its pages contain magical writing and a truly brilliant heart wrenching style and storyline","3271":"one day i looked up the definition of life in a medical dictionary and found a surprisingly poetic entry \"a constellation of vital phenomena--organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation \" as biological life is structured as a constellation of six phenomena the narrative life of this novel is structured as a constellation of six point of view characters anthony marra authora beautiful searing novel that takes place in chechnya during the 10 years between the two chechen wars it's not an easy read but there is a payoff in the end when you suddenly realize how much you care about the characters marra has crafted its not a novel about war but about how war transforms people in different ways the novel is not exploitative but it is harrowing at times","3272":"i feel bad giving this only 2 stars because it was well written my problem was that i am not familiar enough with chechnya's history to truly follow some of the plot it would have helped me tremendously to have a little more explanation in the first few chapters","3273":"anthony marra has written an uncompromising complex surprising and at times darkly humorous novel the characters are multidimensional and the story though sometimes hard to read because of the unimaginable violence is so well written that you force yourself through the difficult parts for the sheer joy of the writing","3274":"an excellent fictional depiction of life in war torn chechnya haunting absorbing and moving","3275":" for anthony marra's debut novel a constellation of vital phenomena is certainly not a light read but a very well written and thoroughly researched read set in chechnya between 1994 2004 it is a heartbreaking tale of loss and war the narrative centers on three people eight year old havaa whose father has been taken by russian forces her neighbor akhmed a failed doctor who tries to hide her in the nearly abandoned hospital he knows and sonja the last remaining surgeon in that area who is desperately trying to find her missing sister the author takes us back and forth in time and at times i found it difficult to follow however he paints a very vivid picture of how volatile and treacherous chechnya was during this time and how it effects the characters in this captivating book","3276":"tough war story beautifully and intelligently written i was into it at first as the relationships were fascinating but the heaviness of the story bogged me down and though i finished it i had difficulty doing so","3277":"review to come soon i hope just because snotchocheez","3278":"all the while reading this book i kept asking myself isn't there a plot here somewhere halfway through i had to concede that there wasn't the author introduces characters who certainly have the potential to create a compelling story instead the book meanders along in the author's overwrought style without really going anywhere","3279":" i give this one a 4 75 which i realize wouldn't even work on a 10 star scale i thought the book was exceptionally well written and plotted out with great prose it felt like you were right there with the characters trying to survive alongside them in a war torn corner of the world the story was good throughout and the ending was satisfying as well the reason i'm deducting 0 25 stars is because of the epiloguish way some of the fates of the characters are revealed it was done in a very subtle way throughout the book and not in a big section titled epilogue at the end of the book so at least that was good but i usually like to be left wondering about how the lives of some the characters turn out that's usually how a book will stick with me anyway a great debut novel and i'll make sure to read his follow up whenever he gets around to writing it","3280":"one of the most devastating and beautiful books i've ever read and probably ever will for a while i felt voyeuristic reading about a conflict a people and a region i know so little about chechnya guilty that i should have an emotional experience rooted in a fictional account of such incredible recent and real pain but then i realized that this is one of those rare books about catastrophic human tragedy and endless misery that can genuinely change the way you feel or see the world this book stays with you in big and small ways forever and it's not that this book challenges our sense that conflict in some parts of the world is inevitable to the point of justifying our ignorance of it this book isn't about us it doesn't say to the reader you should have known better you should have done something to avoid this disaster it simply achingly portrays the full breadth of humanity that exists even under conditions most of us can barely fathom avoidable unavoidable to a great extent it doesn't matter the point is it happened and has happened and will continue to happen there's a million other things i could say about this book but the most important one is this everyone everyone should read it","3281":"an incredibly beautifully written story about the intersecting lives of people living in some of the most difficult situations i would read more of anthony marra in a heartbeat","3282":" anthony marra's first novel \"a constellation of vital phenomena \" is a flash in the heavens that makes you look up and believe in miracles go ahead and sneer at the thin atmosphere of america's mfa programs but this washington born graduate of the iowa writers' workshop is a testament to the vibrancy of contemporary fiction here in fresh graceful prose is a profound story that dares to be as tender as it is ghastly a story about desperate lives in a remote land that will quickly seem impossibly close and important \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" opens in a tiny blood soaked village of chechnya that part of the world that drifts into our consciousness only briefly -- when say the russians crush it again or more recently when young zealots detonate pressure cookers in boston but the unforgettable characters in this novel are not federalists or rebels or terrorists they aren't particularly religious or political we see only glimpses of loyal russian officers or fanatical muslims instead these are just fathers and mothers and children -- neighbors snagged in the claws of history the book begins with a sentence that forecasts both the horror and the whimsy ahead \"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones \" havaa we learn is 8 and now almost certainly orphaned \"she had the pale waxen skin of an unripe pear \" marra writes her father who nurtured her curiosity with extravagant affection was an arborist who had lost his fingers in a previous encounter with the feds and a pair of bolt cutters when he was gagged with duct tape and bundled away for good havaa avoided assassination by sneaking out of the house and hiding in the snow but those thugs will be back fulfilling a new order to murder the family members of anyone suspected of sympathizing with rebel forces the complicated moral hero of this tale is an incompetent peasant doctor named akhmed who lives across the street more comfortable drawing portraits than blood he is determined to save his old friend's daughter though \"she seemed an immense and overwhelming creature whom he was destined to fail \" his only choice is to spirit havaa out of the village where the sole remaining career choices are running guns for the rebels or informing for the russians acting on a rumor from a refugee who passed through months earlier he takes havaa to an all but abandoned hospital in a nearby town that looks \"like a city made of shoeboxes and stamped into the ground by a petulant child \"on one level \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" covers just five days in 2004 but these are people shaken from the linear progress of time their experiences come to us in pungent flashbacks of trauma and joy -- meals and games marriages and affairs offenses small and shocking that knit their lives together each chapter begins with the date highlighted on a timeline that runs from 1994 to 2004 jumping forward and backward sometimes creating new mysteries sometimes solving old ones other references draw us outside that 10 year range a scholar in the village toils his whole life on a history of \"this sliver of humanity the world seemed determined to forget \" at more than 50 000 pages the old man's manuscript flows from a kind of mania reaching further and further back to avoid the ire of russian censors but then too there are moments of mercy in this tale grace notes when marra casually alludes to what certain characters will be doing far in the future yes he assures us some of these people you care about -- or loathe -- will live deep into the 21st century marra who has traveled through chechnya re creates akhmed and havaa's village in the hard spare elements of wood and snow and blood for all the bizarre images and incidents he describes he stays rooted in the concrete insanity of this conflict this unstanchable wound on europe's eastern side we see unexploded bombs lying in the street covered with toilet bowls a clown crying in a basement during an aerial assault a soldier insisting his prisoners wear seat belts on their way to a death camp but these aren't the quirky ornaments that floated through \"the tiger's wife \" tea obreht's dreamy first novel about a doctor in the war torn balkans in \"a constellation \" the surreal has been stamped into flesh and bone marra was guided by among other books the work of assassinated russian journalist anna politkovskaya this is a land once forcibly emptied by the u s s r then officially repopulated and now being savaged by guerrilla attacks and merciless retaliations two years before the novel opens 41 villagers were \"disappeared\" in a single day shot in the forest or trucked off to be tortured to death in a place only hieronymus bosch or the godchildren of stalin could imagine be warned there's a section of \"a constellation\" splattered with viscera that will scar your conscience and remind you what the united states risks by blurring the hard won moral and legal prohibitions against torture driving this intense tragedy is an ordinary man ramzan a young neighbor who was poisoned by pain driven to accept his role as village rat in pages of almost unreadably creative abuse marra takes us into the crucible where bodies and minds are crushed and the elixir of betrayal is purified \"we are the children of wolves \" ramzan says \"i recognize you \" his father thinks \"we twist our souls around each other's miseries \"the almost empty hospital where akhmed hides havaa provides a weird alternative world to the grim village staffed by a single nurse a one armed guard and a russian surgeon searching for her sister it's a madhouse but also a sanctuary where strands of absurdity and realism mingle without clashing from the infinite black space of despair emerges \"a constellation of vital phenomena \" an arresting definition of \"life\" found in an old medical textbook marra isn't above offering snatches of comic banter among this ragtag staff too foolish or compassionate to flee the surgeon who assumes she has cauterized her affections spars with akhmed in a way that tempts us to anticipate some romantic engagement maybe even a little happiness as the elements of this complicated plot begin to align in ways too tragic and moving to anticipate the past resolves into focus the future is freighted with anguish but flecked with hope i haven't been so overwhelmed by a novel in years at the risk of raising your expectations too high i have to say you simply must read this book","3283":"fantastic debut if this is the first book by mr marra i can't wait to read the stories that he will write in the future","3284":"wow incredible characters and a compelling plot this one will stay with me a long time","3285":"this book was very difficult to get through and i struggled to finish what is it with my need to finish a book i start no matter what so why did i rate this book a 3 star when throughout it was at best a 2 star the chechnyan setting gave me an insight into the horrible struggle of her people and a new appreciation for my life as an american and the ending i was glad i persevered to the end as it salvaged the story for me however those things alone would not make me recommend this long read","3286":"if anyone knows where the first mention of the one hundred and three year old woman is i want to reread that part again my eyes are strained with fatigue at the moment and looking through the last one hundred pages i realized i had a hopeless task just give me a page number if you know thanks review of vital phenomena at books u0026amp bowels","3287":"fairly torn about how to rate this book the beginning just didn't do it for me the jumps in the narrative left me feeling estranged from the characters and the twists reveals were telegraphed early and often with that said by the end i was glad to have read it","3288":"devastating and magnificent one to own rather than just borrow","3289":"so far my opinion is that many sentences in this book are so beautifully written it's unbelievable overall though i'm not connecting with the characters and am a bit disappointed in the story maybe i'll return to it another day","3290":"i read this book and now my life is ruined","3291":"this book snuck up on me in a way that i can't explain marra has an uncanny ability to make the reader feel for the characters to truly and entirely dive into their lives if you'd like to read my entire review it's posted on my blog at www myfavoritebookblog blogspot com","3292":"can war be beautiful anthony marra's novel lets the reader see beauty despite the painful reality of the consequences of war as a web is no more than holes woven together they were bonded by what was no longer there 63 a remarkable journey into war and those who endure it's consequences in the midst of constant turmoil war and trauma we see flawed characters trying to live a life of meaning this book is filled with beautiful language that envelops you with the emotion and depth of character and leaves you feeling as if you are right there with sonja the surgeon who doesn't leave the war torn area because she is searching for her sister havaa the little girl who has lost her family and desperately wants to find her place in the midst of loss and akhmed the doctor artist who suffers the pain of trying to care for an invalid wife and tries to make sense of the destruction around him there is beauty in war when you see it through the eyes of marra's characters i loved reading this book and it kept building in intensity and meaning as it progressed half way though the book i thought it was interesting 3 4 through the book i was amazed with the intricate multi leveled connections and couldn't read fast enough to discover how the characters' stories ended really beautiful a must read a haunting recollection of war i see similarities in plot development interconnectedness of characters' lives between this book and cloud atlas by david mitchell which i also loved both of these definitely are worthy of a second reading and a place on my bookshelf perhaps our deepest love is already inscribed within us so it's object doesn't create a new word but instead allows us to read the one written 354","3293":" way behind so will keep it brief wow a very powerful novel one of the best i've read in years and even if it shows \"the transcendent power of love \" it's relentlessly depressing it is certainly effective as a an \"historical novel \" in giving the reader an intimate feel about life in chechnya during the chechen wars about which most westerners myself included are likely quite ignorant but instead of dealing with the movers and shakers it focuses on common people and what they had to go through eventually making you feel sympathy even for the collaborator you'd come to dislike but not for chechen terrorists who kill innocent civilians whether russian schoolchildren or american marathon fans there were multiple intersecting plots somewhat contrived as to their intersections but necessary as he spun out the characters i guess","3294":" i loved this book i think it's going to go onto my list of all time favorite books and anthony marra is now an author to follow the book was both heartbreaking and uplifting i found the setting chechnya and the conflict there fascinating and i think marra did a good job at introducing us to this place and its history without getting bogged down with boring facts and dates i also really found the moral ambiguity found throughout the book interesting and very truthful it's likely very difficult to be a hero while living through a conflict overall a beautifully written and overall great book strongly recommend","3295":"final 1 4 pretty much redeemed the rest not sure if it was actually good or some safran foer style emotional manipulation","3296":"really 4u0026amp 1 2 intense story telling about the wars in chechnya strong character development and stellar interweaving of the characters through the story's events lend power to this novel depressing and heart wrenching horrific wars where no one wins yet powerfully demonstrates the power of love","3297":" i adored this book and it's as near to perfect as a book set in a war torn nation can be this novel marra's first is set in chechnya and spans several decades we begin in the present day 2004 when a man in war torn chechnya rescues his neighbor's daughter from the forest after the feds government agents kidnap her father and burn down her house the man then takes the girl to the hospital in a nearby city and entrusts her to the care of a russian female doctor over the course of the novel we learn so much more about the man about his neighbor about the girl about the doctor and a cast of other characters as the book dips back into the past the plot unspools masterfully and the connections between the characters are unexpected and intricate characters we are prepared to loathe as evil end up having histories that help us at the very least understand how they got to where they are today the books themes are far reaching and deep and marra's hand is so steady and his writing so precise and beautiful that the novel never feels forced or self conscious i've thought a lot about his being an american writing about chechnya and in many ways i think that distance enables him to write with compassion but without overt personal involvement and that the result is more profound than it would have been had the writer been embroiled in the conflict in a more personal way highly highly recommended","3298":"fabulous in every way","3299":"this book was amazing i learned so much about the tragic history of chechnya through the lives of the many varied characters seen from the perspective of a young girl a doctor an informer who causes the disappearance of several of his fellow villagers and many more whose lives weave in and out of each others over decades it was hard to read in places due to the flawed characters and the non chronological approach to the devastation of war but it was very clever and fascinating to read","3300":"the best book i have read in a while so engaging moving sad and wonderful","3301":"into this complicated depiction of the brutally inhumane reality of chechnya's recent history first time novelist anthony marra weaves the strands of delicate and radiant characters' lives creating people whose essence reflect the title of his book a constellation of vital phenomena true to his aptly chosen title marra's characters spin and dance around each other oblivious to the effect that the smallest action may have on the outcome of others' lives but the gravitational pull of this text lies in a handful of characters who love fiercely and with great sacrifice akhmed and sonja are two doctors of sorts who find themselves strangely connected through the life of a young orphaned girl their lives are layered together through marra's aptly shifting points of view through space and time akhmed's single transgression may catapult his sense of guilt so that he must later sacrifice all that he loves to protect who he loves sonja's desire to pursue her dreams becomes the catalyst for guilt and disproportionate self inflicted penance but despite the agony and cruelty of life the essence of innocence and hope prevail in the life of their young ward marra's cast of characters is diverse and bountiful and the reader would do well to keep track of the ripple effect each one creates here a makara gun is handed off and we are reminded of chekov's pronouncement that it must later go off there a sketch is lovingly designed as the only historic record of lives of a city filled with people who never cease to hope the traces of these lives not lost in vain will haunt the grieved touched reader who makes his or her way through this war torn novel","3302":"i approached this book knowing next to nothing about modern day chechnya i knew it was war torn but i had no idea of how people currently live this book is set in the chechnya of check points land mines and frequent disappearances of people they know akhmed a failed physician after witnessing his friend and neighbor be abducted takes his neighbor's young daughter to a hospital for safe keeping the bombed out hospital is run by the only remaining surgeon in the area a very gruff female doctor who is constantly tasked with delivering babies and amputating legs this is an unusual story with vivid characters the lives of these people are difficult and their outcomes are often bleak but there are some truly magical moments as well as some memorable humor i don't know that i'll ever think of turtles or whales the same way one to look out for","3303":"it started off reminding me of the tiger's wife strong female doctor searching for a loved one in a war torn land but this book is way more depressing don't get me wrong i loved it it's so beautifully written it wrings out every sadness you might house in your body and your heart and as you near the end of it you are or rather i was left weeping with still another 10 per cent of the book to go like tea obreht in the tiger's wife anthony marra does employ a lot of quirk and whimsy in the way he draws his characters here but somehow given the context and the setting they seem perfectly realistic and believable absurdity in times of war is simply the new normal","3304":" based on the stellar reviews for this book especially from reviewers i know personally and whose intellect and literary prowess i hold in great esteem my review should be discounted as a situation of pearls before swine i fully appreciated the novel's breathtakingly beautiful prose anthony marra's talent for crafting metaphors is unparalleled and his description of humanity is achingly potent despite this i did not enjoy the story i persevered because i thought that ultimately i would see and feel what other readers so passionately extol but i just couldn't get past the filth misery and utter hopelessness of the story eight year old motherless havaa loses her father and her home to the feds one evening while she hides in the forest watching her rural chechen home burn to the ground her neighbor akhmed fearing for her safety brings her to the nearest hospital where she becomes the unlikely ward of a brilliant ethnic russian surgeon sonja who runs the hospital single handedly throughout the ravages of the country's second war the story spans a decade from the early 1990s through 2004 jumping back and forth between the years characters and wars detailing with horrific clarity tragedy after tragedy as the cast of characters expands to include more lost family members and friends i know that the story is supposed to be about hope triumphing all but it left me in a state of depression the stories of human depravity and torture were too much to bear the setting in sunless frigid war torn chechnya exacerbated the misery i can recommend this to those with a strong emotional constitution who appreciate magnificent writing but to everyone else beware ~ ms dimmick","3305":"war is hell while the subject was difficult i felt like the author placed us in the very stark gray of it real people life and the real living of it","3306":"really lovely writing and an interesting topic but the plot didn't fully grab me and i confess i'm probably giving it one fewer star than otherwise just for being depressing","3307":" book club in summer 2014 the book chronicles the stories of several people living in a small village in chechnya over a several decade period in the 1990's and 2000's during separate periods of war and shifting loyalties my book club loved reading a book set in a part of the world we knew little about and also seeing war from a different perspective than we were used to either front lines or refugees these people are forced to live their lives in the context of extreme uncertainty and destruction i was worried about it being too depressing which it certainly was but it was also filled with friendship and hope and a black and quirky humor which we read is specifically chechnyan as a byproduct of their difficult conditions really wonderful everyone loved it","3308":"throughout the history of mankind man has committed atrocities in the name of religion or politics and it continues today this book made me lose all faith in humanity my heart was broken over and over again by this beautifully written story of a little known place on this planet we all share","3309":"i had to put this one down because i didn't miss it if i don't even care what is happening with the characters while i m away it's just not worth picking up again gave it over 100 pages too","3310":"i've read a few first novels recently and have been burned this one is finally a first novel that lives up to the hype it comes together beautifully in the end if sonja had flipped to the last page of this book she would have read it","3311":"reading stories set during wartime can be tough and this one didn't sugarcoat it much but it was oh so beautifully written i didn't want to put it down","3312":"complicated and profound read about interconnected lives set during the russian chechen war be prepared to weigh right from wrong and sympathize with victim and perpetrator devastating but hopeful","3313":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a book that i've been aware of for some time it having turned up on many critics' top books of 2013 lists it may have taken me a year to get to it but having received the book as a gift from a goodreads friend i read it and was just as impressed and having finished it on 31 12 14 would rate it among my favourites of this year the narrative follows the fortunes of a number of characters in chechnya during the 'present' 5 days in 2004 and begins with havaa an 8 year old girl who we are introduced to as she watches her father being abducted by russian troops her neighbour akhmed who also watches this the latest in a series of abductions conscious of the feds' desire to find the girl decides to protect her and takes her to the one place where he thinks she may be safe the local hospital in the city 10 miles away where hard hearted surgeon sonia rabina is the only doctor left treating the wounded from the conflict and is herself searching for answers to the reasons for her sister natasha's disappearance a couple of years earlier it is primarily through the developing relationship between sonia and akhmed alongside flashbacks and indeed flashforwards with these three characters and a number of others related in some way to them that the strands of this cleverly written and extremely moving story are pulled together i know nothing bar the basics about the conflict in chechnya but this novel focuses on the human cost of the war so this wasn't a disadvantage the suffering of the people of the region through history is documented some characters having survived stalin's wrath and while the war has cast different characters in different ways resulting in them being seen on the surface as one thing we learn through marra's beautifully written prose that there are few that aren't victims in their own moving way the description may sound bleak and indeed the chechnya described in the novel is nothing other than dystopian reminiscent in some ways to me of the world inhabited by the characters in cormac mccarthy's the road but one of my favourite tools used by the author in the novel is the way he tells of the future of many of the minor as well as major characters we read about showing that while everything seems helpless in the present all is not lost and we are left with a mixture of emotions as the book reaches its conclusion and answers are provided i really was blown away by this book as have so many before me the thought provoking story is one that is created in an extremely well researched setting by an author who i originally thought had his own roots in the area but was actually born in dc an achievement in itself to be so convincing if his future work reaches this standard we have a lot to look forward to believe the hype and read this novel","3314":" publisher's synopsis a resilient doctor risks everything to save the life of a hunted child in this majestic debut about love loss and the unexpected ties that bind us together in his brilliant haunting novel stegner fellow and whiting award winner anthony marra transports us to a snow covered village in chechnya where eight year old havaa watches from the woods as russian soldiers abduct her father in the middle of the night accusing him of aiding chechen rebels across the road their lifelong neighbor and family friend akhmed has also been watching fearing the worst when the soldiers set fire to havaa's house but when he finds her hiding in the forest with a strange blue suitcase he makes a decision that will forever change their lives he will seek refuge at the abandoned hospital where the sole remaining doctor sonja rabina treats the wounded for the talented tough minded sonja the arrival of akhmed and havaa is an unwelcome surprise weary and overburdened she has no desire to take on additional risk and responsibility and she has a deeply personal reason for caution harboring these refugees could easily jeopardize the return of her missing sister but over the course of five extraordinary days sonja's world will shift on its axis and reveal the intricate pattern of connections that weave together the pasts of these three unlikely companions and unexpectedly decides their fate a story of the transcendent power of love in wartime a constellation of vital phenomena is a work of sweeping breadth profound compassion and lasting significance my thoughts this book was absolutely brilliant even the cover art itself was gorgeous a constellation tugged at my heartstrings with its remarkable pathos and prose like writing style the characters were incredibly realistic and had depth it leaves readers with hope humanity and teary eyes certainly recommended to anyone who wants a good heartwarming story i hope to see more from anthony mara in the future i received this book free from the blogging for books program i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have expressed are my own","3315":"this book is beautifully written the characters are well developed the pacing is interesting if a bit challenging the details of the war in chechnya and the confusion and danger of the time come through the writing so clearly it's not a quick read and can be frustrating but overall it's wonderful","3316":"love love love this book the way each character wove around another subtly building complex layers of life was just so marvelous sometimes switching between years and telling a story nonlinearly is confusing but this one got it just right beautifully captured the vividness of living and loving and how that can shine through even the darkest moments","3317":"not a totally engaging read and quite depressing but i learnt a lot about chechen history","3318":"certainly not a light read but definitely worth the time to read it it was also insight to a cultural war i was not familiar with and made me very appreciative that i was born here in the us","3319":"cloying pretentious and precious completely unoriginal gabriel garcia marquez should sue would have given it just one star but gave it another one to reward myself for finishing it","3320":" a splendid and captivating first novel i thought the beginning was slow until the passage discussing khassan's life and background at which point i became hooked the characters and setting are so vivid that i can imagine them and what they look like as i read their story unfolding that film like quality and the structure of the novel make this an ideal choice for a big screen adaptation i understand and appreciate the technique of everything coming together wrapping all the loose ends into one greater narrative but i think that neatness that cleanliness is what made this a four and not five star novel still i enjoyed this novel immensely","3321":"this book had a beautiful heartbreaking complex story i enjoyed it a lot","3322":"book club read","3323":" written by a 28 year old man with no former experience of chechnya until he decided to write about it this book is astonishing in its clarity voice and vision not for the faint of heart it is worth every moment that it takes you to make your way through it even when it's hard to read those who do will emerge with more compassion and understanding of the thin line that separates those who through a simple twist of fate are born in a lucky place and those who are born into lands where suffering and deprivation are the norm god like everything kind and good lived in london this is a truly extraordinary account of a small group of people who lives are intertwined through the unfortunate geography of their homeland and the pain of love as well as stupidity the single abiding law of the universe the constellation of vital phenomena is the perfect metaphor for this unlikely group of characters some brave and some not so brave moral judgements are hard to come by as one character ramzan chillingly explains why he informs on his neighbors to the feds you're thinking you will be as silent to them as you are to me you might believe that you will be brave that you will hew to your convictions but you have never been to the landfill once i was like you and soon you will be like me they are in the business of changing lives akhmed and they are the very best yet even ramzan has depth and complexity and still he believed himself the victim as much as the perpetrator of his crimes he and all the others must face deep moral ambiguity along with the reader all except the child havaa and the mentally feeble ula yet all convey a remarkable depth of human compassion courage and beauty it's hard to imagine how humor even gracefully makes its appearance but it does in many places 'wasn't it ronald mcdonald who told gorbachev to tear down the wall 'you're thinking of ronald reagan ' 'english names all sound the same ' when all the jagged pieces of this puzzle finally fall into place and the shifting nature of time is sorted out i loved the peeks into the future the final lines of this amazing book will leave you breathless and teary your hand to your heart truly","3324":" a constellation of vital phenomena is a great book about love war and a largely unknown history of the chechen conflict with russia it tells the story of two doctors one who is overworked almost single handedly running a hospital in a devastated chechen city who is simultaneously searching for her disappeared sister and the other a village novice who takes care of a dear friend's daughter to try and keep her safe from russian forces searching for punishment the daughter carries an emergency suitcase of treasured items from her father that form part of the weave that will change the lives of the two doctors for good together with a grizzled father who is writing the definitive history of of his people and his informant son whom he can no longer trust the book weaves a compelling framework of the connections and relations that shape the lives of these people and of chechnya and the destructive forced migration and rule of soviet russia the novel weaves back and forth through two chechen russian conflicts and post wwii soviet history as we gradually discover how history circumstance serendipity and tragedy all form a tapestry as rich as any i've read fate and character play a supreme role as the author doesn't spare us from knowing what happens to each and everyone of them upon discovering the meaning of the title of the book one starts to think of one's own life and the possible connections and relationships that shape our lives truly a rich and engaging debut","3325":"the ending was a tearjerker but nevertheless it was an absolutely beautiful ending","3326":"this was a very difficult book to read as the subject matter was heavy but the author did a fantastic job weaving the story lines together and finishing the storylines","3327":"easily one of the best novels i've read in the last few years the author deftly takes us through 10 years and more really of the interconnected lives of residents of chechnya some chechens some russians all struggling to make the right choices in circumstances that don't allow for the right choices the author was a master of showing the effects of wars and resettlements on the lives of his protagonists without ever feeling heavy handed or obvious while there are ongoing references to the first and second wars not wwi and wwii but wars between chechnya and russia no knowledge of the history is actually needed to enjoy the book","3328":"this book touched me and disturbed me more than anything that i have read in a very long time","3329":" i truly enjoyed every aspect every character of this book the author brought every character to life and made you empathize with their plights their quirks and their inner struggles i wondered at how these characters were left with any humanity after what many of them had lived through and were forced to endure having barely survived the author brought all this to life wove a story that pulled me in and made me want to go on reading even as the book was ending i carried this book everywhere with me from the moment i opened the cover until the moment i finished it i hope to see many more books from this author","3330":"an amazing haunting well written book that will stay with you for a long time as with all war books it is not an easy read the main story of the book only covers 5 days and then is filled with all the back stories of the main characters told out of order so you don't really see how it all ties together until the end i particularly liked how the main characters were shown warts and all no larger than life characters they felt like real people trying to live through a horrible situation and dealing with the choices they have made i actually listened to this as an audio book but still would like to get this book to keep in my library the title explained near the end of the book fits so well with this story and is one i will remember for a long time","3331":"heart wrenching book about lives torn apart by war","3332":"depressing but fascinating book about chechnya it doesn't end well but what in chechnya doesu0026gt","3333":"easily the most powerful book i've read in a very long time i'm stunned i loved the jigsaw of characters interconnecting in chechnya during brutal years i will miss them if anthony marra writes another book i will read it","3334":"loved the writing dark story","3335":" wonderful beautiful story of such a difficult time in history the characters and settings come to life in vivid image and the stories of their deeply complex inter woven lives are depicted through elegant prose i was left with this question realization is suffering an inescapable part of the human condition certainly suffering is far greater during war but death pain disappointment aren't these universally experienced and unavoidable and can't the same be said of hope love and joy it's hard to imagine the reality of war and perhaps even more difficult to acknowledge the occasional appearance of joy but to varying degrees i think that this is what it means to be alive i am thankful for this beautiful novel","3336":"one of the best books of my year","3337":"this book started out as a 3 stars but about half way through picked itself up another accommodation i just wish it had picked up sooner as i would have payed more attention to the interconnectedness of the characters imagine if the movies pulp fiction or crash had taken place over a 16 year period and taken place during war time chechnya and you get a brief idea of the plot devices of this novel the glimpses at life in wartime chechnya are both sad and eye opening i wish i could read it again to get a better idea of how the characters met and connected with each other the story jumps around a lot and timelines can get a bit confusing","3338":"one of the best books i've read in a long long time outstanding","3339":"this is the best novel i have read in years this is a 10 year story interwoven between 3 families in a village in chechnya and is told over 5 days if you want to know more about the relationship between russia and chechnya this is a great book beautiful and well crafted writing don't miss this book","3340":"i finally finished this book i so wanted to love it but actually it was a real struggle the setting was fascinating but until well beyond the middle of the book i really found it hard to differentiate between the characters from the village which left me very confused at times the confusion being exacerbated by the constant hopping around in time i didn't feel i had the opportunity to emotionally engage with any of the characters the torture scenes were very grim they felt very authentic which made it even harder to read them i am left knowing that it is a good book but feeling it just wasn't for me","3341":"a beautiful and tragic book that only picked up beauty and tragedy as it went","3342":"one of the best things i read this year and one of the hardest not in terms of language but subject matter i would start to feel weighed down in the book and have to put it aside for a bit","3343":"loved it thought the story and the way it interwove was beautiful","3344":"anthony marra has written another brilliant debut novel to add to the list of brilliant debuts i've read this year so far his work is a beautifully written intricately detailed story of the intersections of lives forever changed by war in modern yet rural chechnya the story is both devastating and inspiring tragic and triumphant and the writing is impressive","3345":"anthony marra's first novel explores with historical precision and admirable compassion an infrequently visited corner of recent history it is well structured cleanly written and admirably paced it also somehow fails as a novel the characters never come alive the prose is mfa run of the mill when something more daring on the level of an individual description is attempted the image often seems inauthentic as one plods through this work one is occasionally distracted by thoughts of what this earnest young writer might be doing wrong is there too much plot not enough moral ambiguity too much it's hard to say it just never for all the breath expended in fanning its potent tinder catches fire","3346":"i read this back to back with the tiger's wife also ostensibly a story of lives caught up in war this is by far the superior of the two the characters in a constellation of vital phenomena feel like real people you care about and can identify with not conveniences to set in a collection of folklore","3347":"phenomenal book my kind of read","3348":"no author not anyone could persuade me for even a moment that i was chechen or so i thought the simple style of this complex and multi layered work is seductive a pool that submerges you in all the pain triumph sacrifice and sheer chaos that was and probably still is chechnya wonderful writing that never misses a beat i would like to read it again really","3349":"this book was hauntingly beautiful another fantastic story of woven narratives about an event of which i knew next to nothing heavy and intense but worth the read","3350":" this is a book with beautiful words strung together to project a very desolate picture a tale of how far people can go for the people they love a testimony of a parent's love even if one is not a parent a proof that even evil people have a story that made them like that and above all a story set in a war torn country and its citizens trying to save each other in times of utter hopelessness read this book for havaa who stands as a pillar of hope urging you to finish the book for sonja and her stubbornness to accept she cares for akhmed who leads the story totally for khassan who tells you what a parent's love can be for natasha who well tell you the plight of women from war torn countries for ramzan to know the story of what makes a man named after a holy month be so evil and for dokka the learned and the living parent that he was read this book for the people of chechnya destroyed and rebuilt after the wars read this for your own learning on how were things in eastern europe in the 90s if nothing read this book for the pure joy of reading","3351":"i did not know what to expect in reading this book since finishing it i've not been able to pick up another including books recommended by the author this book was both hauntingly beautiful and eye opening eye opening in the sense that i realized how little i knew of the after effects of the ussr breakup and even more how little i know of chechnya","3352":"this book was beautiful and complex rich characters stunningly descriptive scenes deeply human portrayals my only hold up was that i couldn't ever completely grasp the political context of the story and i sometimes got the characters confused but i also read this with a newborn so i was sleep deprived and a bit slower in all things my book club girls really loved this book","3353":"4 5 stars this novel made me wish i could have read it in a school course there is so much substance to explore and discuss the characters the country the war the writing one night at book club was not nearly enough","3354":"review to come","3355":"dnf about a 100 pages in and i was picking up all sort of other things oh hey it's this last month's martha stewart rather than open this book","3356":"it took a little while to get into this with all of the jumping around in time but the story is engaging and it is beautifully written","3357":"the ending was so wonderful i cried in public on an airplane reading this","3358":"heavy but a well written captivating story loved getting to know the characters","3359":"ouch this is not an easy read but i did read it in one sitting writing 101 show don't tell anthony marra does allthat and more he manages to write of shocking personal violence without drama revealing a bit at a timehow it shapes both its perpetrators and victims serious talent here","3360":"a dark but really moving story one of the best i read in 2013","3361":"life a constellation of vital phenomena organization development management growth reproduction adaptation beautifully written","3362":" a doctor returns home to chechnya after war breaks out there in order to be with her sister she works in a local hospital treating many war wounds with little help or rest an 8 year old girl who is being sought out by russian forces is brought to her for safe keeping the book jumps back and forth in time over 10 years detailing the lives of those who are connected to this girl's life giving context for her current situation and future i don't want to give too much of the plot away because there's not much to it to begin with that's not necessarily a bad thing there is depth and complexity within this simple story it is seen within the characters their motivations and their interactions with each other it is seen in how it written beautifully and poetic it has passages and sentences that caused me more than once to stop and admire the author's choice of words and structure a slow read no doubt but worth the time if you have it","3363":" i was tempted to give this 3 stars but changed my mind for a couple of reasons 1 i only had time to read it in small chunks each day and am sure i would've liked it more if the reading experience hadn't been broken up and 2 it was one of those books that stays with you long after you finish i learned so much about chechnya the characters were incredibly well developed and the writing was amazing it felt a bit plodding at times but it's certainly not a throwaway read like so many others i've plowed through in the past months","3364":" i continue to love my experience as a book blogger i received a copy of this book free in exchange for an honest review let's get started i won't lie this was not my favorite book have you ever seen a book that had a gazillion positive reviews and then you were excited to read it but then when you read it you couldn't figure out why everyone loved it so much this is one of those books i'm not saying it was terrible because it wasn't the writing was very good it just didn't keep my attention i really struggled to get through it and that's saying something because i will read anything cereal boxes sports magazines even in a pinch and while this book was way better than reading football stats it's not likely to end up on my all time favorite books in the world list it's possible that my own ignorance on the subject led to my lackluster response the book is set in chechnya and opens with a young girl named havaa hiding in the woods when soldiers come to her father's house and kill him searching for her to do the same as well but fortunately they do not find her now this beginning was poignant and drew me in i felt like i was in for a great read for the first several chapters her neighbor finds her hiding in the woods with nothing but a blue suitcase he decides to take her to a nearby hospital run by one doctor a woman named sonja and a smart alecky nurse the doctor deals with her own demons which become more alive to her when havaa shows up in her hospital the neighbor who brought her there akhmed turns out to be a medical student albeit a poor one who offers his services to the doctor provided she agree to take in the girl there are a few side stories and subplots between these two adult characters which are nice and add to the story but that being said here's where the story lost me somewhat the author tells a rich story but also infuses a great deal of history into the book i love historical novels but there is a bit of overkill in this story maybe it's just that i prefer ancient history to more modern history maybe it's just that i didn't understand all of the details of which there were many threads to follow whatever the case this well written story could have used less historical detail to support its characters the interplay between these characters is what makes the story great the overabundance of historical detail did not support these relationships but detracted from them in my opinion i would welcome a discussion about this book maybe someone has other insights that would have made it more enjoyable for me have you read it do you have any comments to add you can find more of my reviews at www mermaidsandmayhem blogspot com","3365":"beautiful heart wrenching occasionally very funny in between the horrors of war bits hopeful depressing and gorgeously crafted","3366":"this was really well written and was an interesting story but i found it a challenging read with a lot of historical detail","3367":"this book surprised me it had a great start but then i got a bit lost in the middle with the constant introduction and departure of various characters while developing our core group that said i get why marra did it and reflecting back i enjoyed each of those characters the use of omniscient narration to bring closure to so many smaller stories as well as the main story was fantastic the ending really made this book enjoyable i was starting to get the same feeling i got towards the end of cormac mccarthy's the road but was happy to not feel the full weight of those particular emotions again i read somewhere that marra wrote this primarily using research as his only frame of reference and i think that helped as he was able to interweave themes that are relevant to everyone within the context of an unfamiliar world at least unfamiliar to me","3368":"just magnificent loved the way the individual stories wove together it was a sobering look at the cost of war on the people forced to live with it characters were richly drawn and the ending was fantastic i highly recommend","3369":" i received a free copy of this book from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review to me a perfect book is something written in breath taking language with a plot that drives the reader onward a constellation of vital phenomena is one of those books the unusual title comes from a medical textbook's definition of life and that what this novel is an examination of life across the years in the war torn chechnya amid people scarred both on and beneath the flesh these characters broke my heart with their sacrifices and betrayals plumbing the heights and depths of the soul's struggle to survive and still remain honorable at the beginning of the novel i wondered if the author could maintain the novel's countless plot threads and interconnections but he wove together them in a web as delicate yet every bit as strong as a spider's web even the minor mentions of a frozen wolf carcass at the beginning figure in the end i would heartily recommend this novel for its literary merit and as an epic journey through chechen history and the human spirit i am eager for the next anthony marra novel","3370":"about chechnya 1994 2004 i loved the poetry of this book and some of the characters it had some great examples of how people respond and sometimes even find healing in the midst of terrible trauma a woman living temporarily in london a respite wanted to hold foreign syllables like mints on her tongue until they dissolved into fluency the same woman when cleaning a home that had been trashed by the military asked how could a teacup shatter when padded in so many layers of memory when 41 people from the town went missing a favorite character a doctor who was a terrible doctor but a decent portrait artist created portraits of the 41 dead and posted them around the town as memorials to the violence i liked the relationship between 2 sisters who handled war in their own ways and 2 men who loved the same woman each other and most importantly a child","3371":"i really didn't care for the first half of this book as it switched alot from past to present and there were so many characters it was hard to follow but the second half everything pulled together and it was pretty good this was about a group of villagers and how they survive during the chechnya wars the title of the book is based upon the definition of life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaptation the desparation of the characters in this war torn area cling to the things that mean most to them in life courage honor forgiveness betrayal and family it is a book to read slowly and savor all of the beautiful language written by the author","3372":" a constellation of vital phenomena takes place in chechnya during the chechen wars of late 1990s and early 2000s it jumps back in forth in time and tells the stories of several characters whose lives gradually become intertwined the book is incredibly well written and the characters are well developed and lovable in the way that tears come to my eyes just thinking about them the book deals with the horrible things people do to one another as well as the lengths that people will go to for those they love the book graphically depicts some of the human rights violations that occurred during the chechen wars and it was hard to read at times marra wrote about these horrific topics with such grace eloquence and humanity it was really beautiful","3373":" against an apocalyptic landscape backdrops war torn by the chechen wars between 1994 and 2004 this literary novel provides the poignant interrelated lives of five characters akhmed a neighbor who rescues a friend's 8 year old daughter havaa after russian troops seize her father sonya an ethnic russian the only doctor in a nearby hospital who receives havaa natasha sonya's younger heroin addicted sister who disappears from her apartment she shares with sonya in an attempt to escape her personal hell ramzan former muslim arms smuggler turned russian informer shunned by his neighbors and khassan ramzan's father wwii sharpshooter who is trying to reconcile with son although marra's debut novel is not a feel good novel it is beautifully written the characters are so well developed that you easily touched their attempts to survive in a world disrupted by a decade of war and to find what little joys they can eke out of their spartan existence i believe that anthony marra will join the literary giants with this and future works","3374":"this book was incredible the writing style drew me in and left me wanting more i hope to see more from anthony marra","3375":"i'm so sorry that i put off reading this remarkable book for so long i bought it for kindle 1 1 2 years ago and i should have known that when my husband and daughter in law both gave it 5 stars i should have read it sooner i liked the style of present day and flashbacks and how everything connected i liked when marra would tell us what happens to the characters in the future sadly this was a topic i knew nothing about and i'm very glad that i read it it's a beautifully written book","3376":"slow to start working for me but ultimately a hard hitting and touching look at wartime survival and the theme of sacrifice set over 5 days in the post second war guerrilla phase of fighting in the chechen republic in a small corner of chechnya this first novel is hardly epic in scope yet does range over the preceding decade and draws for the reader an outline of the brutal wars that took place there the question of sacrifice permeates the novel when the story opens the russians are raiding a small village and taking away a man dokka whom we understand immediately will not be left living much longer his 8 year old daughter havaa escaped but the russians want her too shared familial guilt is also a chechen concept as is illustrated elsewhere their neighbor akhmed kind and compassionate and self acknowledged worst doctor in chechnya will take her to a place where she will not be found and in a few days an informer will turn him in for it and that will do for akhmed our noble though not exactly ethically scrupulous hero a more interesting character though is ramzan the informer at the start we feel the scorn one naturally feels for the informer who turns in his neighbors for execution handsomely benefiting materially from his crimes later we learn that ramzan has a much more complex and painful story than first appears and if we can't forgive we might at least comprehend ramzan's father khassan struggles deep in his soul with what his son has done though they must share a house in the village he has not spoken to his son since the informing began almost two years previous he endures guilt for the death ramzan has brought to their neighbors and for his own failings as a father he wonders if like abraham he is called to sacrifice his son and if he can kill his child by his own hand and there's sonja ethnically russian but born and raised in chechnya a surgeon in london when the first war breaks out she leaves her life and breaks off her pending marriage to return home and find her sister natasha when the russians withdraw after two years that have left chechnya in ruins and natasha missing while for the first 150 pages or so i found this to be an average book interesting but afflicted with an obvious case of first time itis the book really comes together beautifully and powerfully the plot threads are unwound nearly perfectly and the characters gain richness and depth and fragility which ultimately i think leaves me with a 4 star rating for a book that felt like it was a 5 by the time i turned the last page","3377":"this is a beautiful but difficult book this was not a happy book and awful things happen to everyone in it but it had well drawn characters a great story and wonderful writing","3378":"the april 2014 selection for the greater baltimore university of chicago alumni book club this is one of those books i enjoyed reading but i'm not sure i could recommend to anyone i don't think i'm spoiling anything to say that it takes place in chechnya and involves a lot of untimely death but this does mean that this one is the best fiction selection i've read for the university of chicago alumni book club by a long shot","3379":"i hardly ever rate a book five stars but i absolutely loved this book","3380":"an outstanding beautiful tragic novel about war beautiful prose intertwining stories some level of almost fantasy all to show the horrors of war every president leader should read this book before going to war","3381":"wow complex sometimes difficult always beautiful","3382":"wow just wow war in chechnya is not a setting i normally read fiction about but this book was so beautifully written the horrors the joys all of it was so engrossing best book i've read in quite a while","3383":"this was a well written heartbreaking and educational novel i knew next to nothing about chechnya or that part of the world and learned a lot despite this being a novel it was very descriptive with well developed characters at times i did have trouble keeping the characters straight but i think that's my own fault i love how the characters stories interwove and there were surprising revelations throughout the book it's not a happy book or one that is upbeat but it was very beautiful","3384":"beautifully written painful story i don't know what to say other than phenomenal","3385":"the writing is terrific and the insight into chechen life is wonderful the story centers around a 7 year old chechen girl who is wanted by the russians during the chechen civil war the story is told from several different points of view at first the reader does not how all these points of view are connected but marra does a great job of weaving them altogether","3386":" from the very first sentence of anthony marra's debut novel \"a constellation of vital phenomena\" one can glean that a complicated story is about to unfold \"on the morning after the feds burned down her house and took her father havaa woke from dreams of sea anemones \" one can also glean the power and beauty of marra's prose which has already awarded him a pushcart prize a whiting award the atlantic's student writing contest and it is rumored that this novel was a contender for the pulitzer prize to say that \"acovp\" is complicated is an understatement it is a book about war and sibling relationships and how far one is willing to go or not go to survive those issues are always complicated to tackle all of them at once in a single book especially for a debut novel seems crazy but marra manages to pull it off well he also adds the extra complication of having it set during the second chechen war this is a complication mainly because very few authors have tackled the subject in fiction add to that that very few people in the united states know or even care about chechnya and the horrendous bloodshed and devastation there maybe because it so eerily mirrors to some degree our own situation in the iraq war the russian government in response to an invasion of the russian republic of dagestan by a chechen led islamist militia sent troops into chechnya on oct 1 1999 russian victory happened within a year establishing a pro russian chechen government mission accomplished right unfortunately the war also resulted in a long and bloody insurgency phase that lasted until 2009 technically a low level insurgency is still going on there today one does not need to know the details of the hows and whys of this war though and readers looking to find such details in \"acovp\" will most likely be disappointed the war in this novel could technically be any war in history actually that's a true statement for any war isn't it all war is brutal ugly and mean within war people play many different roles and nobody knows what role they are destined to play until they are in it but the constant in any war is that with cruelty there is also compassion with hate there is also love with inhumanity there is also humanity in \"acovp\" we are given glimpses into the lives of a small group of people each given a specific role there is akhmed the protector he has been entrusted with the life of a little girl and he is terrified about his prospects his brother is a russian informant and he knows that it is only a matter of time before the russians torture his brother again for more names any names real or fictional of chechen rebels he knows that \"akhmed\" will surely spill out of his brother's lips at some point despite the fact that all akhmed has ever wanted to be in life was an artist and has never hurt anyone there is havaa the innocent she is the young girl that akhmed has vowed to protect she doesn't know why the russians want her and the adults around her are not speaking there is sonja the healer she is the only surgeon left at the hospital and now she with a loyal nurse and a crippled security guard runs the hospital with an iron fist she acts like she has a heart of stone but secretly she just wants to find her younger sister natasha who disappeared shortly after sonja left to go to medical school in london and towards the beginning of the war there are of course many other characters many other roles the regretful father the dying wife the shamed son the long lost sister the villain it is a nation of characters as the title suggests marra's brilliance is in how he intertwines the lives of the characters their lives intersecting and connecting in history to reach a certain point and a certain outcome and oh what an amazing outcome be forewarned this is a book that is best read with a box of tissues nearby as it is a tearjerker especially the ending but they won't necessarily be tears of sorrow","3387":"beautifully written and one of the most moving books i recall reading highly recommend","3388":"it is a beautifully written book but it moves slowly i almost stopped reading it but since it got such great reviews i did finish it i'm glad i did","3389":"this is one of the most beautifully written books i have ever read and the story is captivating this is a wonderful heartbreaking book i will not be able to do it justice in my review there were so many sentences he wrote that i went back and re read them even sometimes out loud to my girls because they were so well structured i read the books as slowly as possible because the sense of foreboding throughout kept me from wanting to reach the end i thought i had read great books in the past but now that i've read this one i don't want to pick up another book it is tragic complex this will be a book i re read","3390":"a beautiful though tragic novel that delivers a heart wrenching narrative about civilians caught in the crossfire of chechen russian wars above all it points readers towards the core of what makes us human and how far we will go to protect what we love not a fast read but one that is well worth the time","3391":"eloquent passages describing experiences of absolute despair characters forced to make the worst choices and unimaginable consequences all while maintaining small glimmers of hope absolutely beautiful and haunting i look forward to more of the authors work an incredible debut","3392":"one of the best books i have ever read and will read over and over again","3393":" this is not a book for the faint of heart this book describes in detail many horrific acts it is hard to get through at times the characters faced cruelty that is probably based on real life events it tells the story of several different characters and their stories at different years the author did a great job of describing each character and i could completely visualize them as i was reading havaa sees her father being hauled away and her house burned so the story of havaa and what happens to her takes place over 4 days with the stories of others weaved in and how they all relate at the end i did not know a lot about chechnya or the wars after reading more about it it seems like chechnya has not had many prolonged periods of calm i read the author based several stories from a couple of books including one of the surgeons in one of the hospitals i thought the author told the stories well and the characters were well developed it is sad not a happy book by any means but a well told story","3394":"not until chapter 24 do we learn the origin of this novel's title taken from a 19th century tome of 4 000 pages in a russian medical dictionary life a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation it seems at first a rather sad description utterly failing to register the complete human condition one is reminded that irritability as a sign of life is cannily true but also debilitating then we recall that pearls are made in an oyster's irritability its inability to dislodge a grain of sand and isn't that telling of the human condition without noting taxonomic ranks of species genus family and class we understand our inexorable connection to the rest of life in that single word irritability anthony marra's first work is a masterpiece it describes chechen life after the fall of the soviet empire and the two wars chechnya endured in its aftermath many books describe the horrors of war this one forces the reader to live it the language is brutal and poetic sharp as razors and subtle as the wax in a rose petal the novel time travels effortlessly between 2004 and a decade earlier as broken as the lives of the people whose stories it tells and as the shards of their memories held together by the glue of constant irritability this is a book best reviewed in its own moments s he examined the glass of ice each cube was surrounded by room temperature dissolving in its own remains and belatedly she understood that this was how a loved one disappeared despite the shock of walking into an empty flat the absence isn't immediate more a fade from the present tense you shared a melting into the past not an erasure but a conversion in form from presence to memory from solid to liquid and the person you once touched now runs over your skin now in sheets down your back and you may bathe may sink may drown in the memory but your fingers cannot hold it she raised the glass to her lips the water was clean i've always thought marx's view on religion was the one thing he got right faith is a crutch if you step on a land mine akhmed said the crutch becomes the leg the pearl of faith had dissolved and at its core was a sand grain of doubt and he held onto it knowing that doubt like longing could sustain him when he felt like a criminal he reminded himself that a land without law is a land without crime inured in chechnya's not so distant past noting coincidentally that the boston bomber currently on trial for his life was named after a once idealistic prime minister of a briefly free republic of chechnya this reader sensed this is not merely a history of a war torn distant little country one couldn't quickly finger on a map but also the very near future of the united states itself a young empire drowning in just two centuries of life with less than 30 years of peace threaded in between in pieced shards irritability this book is a must read","3395":" a stunning first novel set in the context of the chechen rebellion against the russians 1994 2004 caught in the middle is a village doctor who rescues a young neighbor from execution after her father is killed for helping the rebels he takes her to a local hospital where he trades his minimal medical skills for her refuge making a deal with the russian woman who runs the hospital in the middle of this is another neighbor who has turned collaborator and his father who has written the authoritative history of chechnya the russian doctor while troubled by the dangerous presence of the little girl searches for news of her own sister who is missing in the war torn country through changes in point of view and time shifts marra slowly builds connections between the characters and gives them psychological continuity one grows quite attached to these characters a rare experience in much mainstream fiction nowadays","3396":"set during a 10 year period of the chechen wars this novel provides a haunting and desperate portrait of human resilience when eight year old havaa's father is taken away she is secreted by her neighbor akhmed in a nearby hospital where he persuades the one remaining doctor to provide refuge for the girl as various characters tell their stories in a series of flashbacks we see families unraveled by loss regret and betrayal just as there seems to be no hope marra fashions all the broken threads together in a tapestry that is imperfect yet glowing with redemption the chechen wars were horrific making this a difficult read at times but for the patient reader the rewards are great","3397":" i am glad that i finished the year with this book as it is one of the best i read this year and i think the most affecting it is almost unfathomable that the author is 28 as the artistry scope and command of both the horrible and the beautiful as well as the wisdom and poignancy with which marra treats love jealously despair all speak of a much greater maturity for some reason the author i kept recalling as i read this was marquez there is great erudition about the history of chechnya in this book and you will learn from it i hazard a guess that you will i had to look up chechnya on a map when i started but the book will never seem didactic it wears its burden to tell you something about a place you probably would rather not know about lightly indeed despite the horrible background endless war the break down of basic civilization sex trafficking torture neighbor against neighbor etc there is a great deal of humor and comedy in the book i caught myself laughing at loud more than once but i also found myself crying sometimes in public as i read this book some of the things depicted are very horrible indeed as they must be though marra mostly treats the after effects of trauma he doesn't wallow in details that can be prurient or numbing but lets the horror penetrate you more subtly but there are also really beautiful and heartwrenching treatments of all the kinds of familial love between siblings partners parents and children biological and not it is a book that is pleasurable to read and yet haunting i think it probably bears re reading a lot of great reviews have been written praising this book i won't go on and on i haven't even touched on the brilliant treatment of time and the way again very wise for a 28 year old marra shows us that despite how the characters feel these are not the end times just another in an age old series of historical catastrophes just read it","3398":"first time to submit a review i stepped into anthony marra's world from some hidden vantage point that allowed me the safety withheld from all my new literary friends and neighbors i will miss their thoughts and brave actions triumph is always possible even in the worst circumstances really an amazing read looking forward to more by this author","3399":"my thoughtsthis is a story that is going to stay with me for a very long time it was so beautifully written and i ended up with such mixed emotions sad angry hopeful this is one of those books that you really want to devote time to it is not faced paced nor should it been read that way the author truly has this amazing way of putting words together and much of this would be missed if a reader tried to skim while fiction this is based on a true time period in chechnya history i am always amazed that people actually survive times like those outlined in this story the strength of character the determination to survive to be honorable when times are desperate unfortunately we must also read about the opposite taking advantage of the weak profiting off people who have nothing and even betrayal at times this was difficult to read due to the harshness of the realities of war and it's aftermath oh how i wished this could have been a story that was neatly wrapped in a bow at the end but this would not have held true to the rest of the story and i am glad the author chose not to do that honestly when i read a book like this i am humbled do we really understand what it is to live under the light of freedom this book will make me thankful everyday for all that i sometimes take for granted and i hope i never forget a first novel by mr marra that should not be missed certainly an author to watch i am so grateful that i was given permission by crown publishing group via netgalley to read this in exchange for an unbiased review","3400":"i read listen to a lot of books and i have learned usually the hard way that some books are better read than listened to this is one of those books that should definitely be read the good old fashioned way a constellation of vital phenomena was no doubt well written and thoroughly researched but i just found myself losing interest far too many times to be fair i have little interest in books about war and torture or books that take place in a war torn environment these kind of books just leave me with a sense of hopelessness and i don't like that when i read for pleasure and to escape with that said i just found it too difficult to keep up with the where when and who when i couldn't just flip back through the pages while the stories for havaa and sonja and her sister natasha were compelling i found the stories of akmed ramsan and kasan complicated and hard to follow there were several beautifully written scenes that did gain my attention but these moments were far and few between i got the overall gist of this story but i found myself just waiting for it to be over it was not what i expected when i initially read the title and summary","3401":"life in war times in the republic of chechyna the story spreads over many years but unravels over about 5 days in 2004 complex flawed characters but with deep reserves of goodness the place is desolute the life these people lead is grinding violent uncertain and for little bits of time filled with joy humor and compassion the ending is satisfying but not pat","3402":"i would have given this book a 4 5 but marra's style of write and remarkable story telling suggests i should lean more to the 5 rather than the 4 i have a fascination with the history of russia and eastern europe the titles listed in marra's author's note at the end of the book just made my must read list even longer","3403":"super jealous this is a first novel really well done super jealous","3404":"4 5 stars i may change this to 5 stars it was amazing i can't describe this without resorting to cliche but so beautifully written and satisfyingly plotted i also appreciated the inside look at the chechen war wars something i was vaguely aware of but really knew nothing about","3405":"this book was so good that even though i wanted to know what happened i didn't want to finish it the story takes place in chechnya which is a place i know very little about and now having read it i feel both ignorant and ungrateful for all i didn't know and for all i have when you read a sentence in a story that takes place in 2004 that says \"we haven't had reliable electricity in nine years\" you realize how very lucky you are i really don't want to say more about this book it was incredibly beautiful to read -- the author's words are truly poetry and yet the story was gripping and the characters realistically crafted just read it you won't forget it","3406":"beautifully written not a light read i had to stop reading it at night because it gave me bad dreams i considered giving it less than five stars because it disturbed me so much but then decided that a book that stirs up so much emotion and that you can't stop thinking about deserves 5 stars a very emotional story","3407":" this was a fantastic book with complex characters i always enjoy reading a book that teaches me something new in this case i learned about the chechen wars and how they affected the people involved there were many times that i just couldn't help noticing the beautiful writing for example the smoke of three daily packs blew through his sentences he spoke with a velvety menace i have a difficult time reading about the brutal treatment of my fellow human beings however the writing pulled me through a story that must be told","3408":" what a remarkable beautiful book it is set in war weary rural chechnya over five days with extensive flashbacks over a ten year period as well as brief but deeply satisfying flash forwards over nearly seventy years life says one character's dictionary is a constellation of six vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction and adaption marra's story weaves these themes through the lives a russian surgeon and her sister a veteran of the second world war a trio of lifelong friends who find themselves at odds and a young girl it is a heart rending read one that left me frequently in tears one of the best books i've read in a long time","3409":" set in chechnya with characters still struggling with fighting forces in their town sonja the doctor holding together the hospital nearly alone grieves for her missing sister and their imperfect relationship akhmed cares for havaa whose father was taken to the landfill place of torture that very few return from akhmed struggles to continue to care for his wife who is bedridden with undiagnosable aches khassan is ashamed of his son ramzan who has become an informant against impossible demands","3410":"beautiful and horrifying at the same time my one regret is that i didn't make a cheat sheet of the names from the beginning between the russian names and the time hops i kept getting the characters confused","3411":"chechnya wartime is a difficult setting for sensitive readers to visit so be forewarned the prose however is darkly startlingly powerful characters are stripped raw an arresting read","3412":" i am writing my review on july 4 as a reminder to myself how incredibly fortunate i am to live in the united states what i take for granted is simply a miracle to others as i found out by reading this novel and learning about war torn chechnya and russian history while other reviewers found this book hopeful it made me incredibly sad almost all the characters in this book die and not a peaceful fall in your sleep death but one filled with pain torture and remorse for a life they could have lived if born into different circumstances however that is not to say there aren't moments of beauty compassion love and bravery my favorite character in the book is sonja who insists on spelling her name with a y when she studies medicine in london as a way to honor her heritage she abandons london leaving behind her fiance medical career and the promise of a comfortable life in order to find her sister natasha in chechnya after the end of the first war this is a love that is more powerful than words can express the title comes from a description of life in a sonya's medical book circled in red ink by her sister because it is the only thing she finds relevant in the enormous tome life is a constellation of vital phenomena organization irritability movement growth reproduction adaptation this is just an example of the stunningly beautiful prose that the author writes again and again throughout the novel even if one doesn't particularly enjoy the story no one can deny that the author is a phenomenally pun intended gifted writer after writing this review i am changing my rating to 4 stars","3413":"i didn't know much of anything about the two recent wars in chechnya before picking up this book i am now haunted by images of suffering tenacity and sacrifice at times the novel felt shakesperean and it held both christian and muslim religion close to its heart i loved this book i cried i smile cried too thankful for its beauty and generous grant of awareness","3414":"this book is remarkable so beautifully written and well paced i devoured it in a day and cried happy tears for a sad sad ending","3415":"probably well written but very depressing a bad situation where there are few winners","3416":"i loved this book at first i wasn't sure about coming to care about the characters they start sort of flat existing in a crushing and bleak situation but the book was beautiful despite the horrific circumstances","3417":" a powerful book is one that tells of tragedy and loss but still makes the reader keep hoping that maybe this time it won't happen it is a story that every once in a while causes the reader to look up from the pages and stare into space to absorb what just happened it is book that forces us to reread the most heartbreaking passages for a second time as much as we don't want to this book does all that telling a story about region many people don't know a lot about chechnya and a few of its citizens have a spotlight shone on them in this incredible novel about survival of both human life and dignity its story about a people that has been brutalized by russia in about every way imaginable the character development and how they intersect is also done incredibly well","3418":"dark but lovely book","3419":"really good highly recommended","3420":" this book was for a book club and i found it difficult to read first i thought it was translated into english because the wording was so choppy the author seems to skip around a lot he would go into detail about something and then trail off to another subject perhaps it was my lack of knowledge of the history of that area i wanted to continue to read and hope it would all come together for me i was in chapter 13 and still didn't understand this story the flow of the story was difficult and confusing i would not recommend this book","3421":"this book came highly recommended and i can see tremendous craft in the writing but i found the setting so bleak and the narrative so disjointed that i failed to connect with the book it was only about 3 4 of the way through that i had any sense of who the characters were and then the bleakness of their fates was hard to bear even more distressing to have read this right now as nearby areas are experiencing terrible oppression","3422":"i am so happy to be ending my 2014 reading year with this remarkable novel everything is perfect the characters the pace the writing and the story i wish i had not waited so long to finally read it it's amazing","3423":"i had to study up as i was reading this book as my knowledge about chechnya was pretty weak marra tempers the horrorsof war with humor as difficult as life is the characters embrace life a skillfully written book incredibly timely considering what is happening in the ukraine right now","3424":"i'm the only person i know who didn't much care for this book although the second half picked up it wasn't enough to make me a fan","3425":"overall i liked but some parts were sooo slow very nice ending though","3426":"this is one of those can't put down books the author weaved together the characters in a brilliant way well written and fascinating","3427":"beautiful in the saddest of ways captivating and well threaded loved the writing's at times prophetic tone by all means this book is a must read","3428":"one of the best books i've read in a long time definitely recommend reading it","3429":"the best book of 2013","3430":"i loved how the storyline unfolded and how the author combined a character's past present and future excellent thought provoking read reminds me of colum mccann's let the great world spin","3431":"i really wanted to like this book not because it was highly acclaimed by literary critics and general readers but mainly because it dealt with a topic that fascinates me however i found this book to be disjointed with too many interruptions to the flow of the story i found it disconcerting the way the story continuously flipped back and forth between a ten year period although i didn't mind that there were spoilers throughout the story i think this made the book less suspenseful the best part of the book was the insight it provided on the conflict in chechnya between 1994 and 2004 there are parts of the story that are disturbing and heart wrenching but that is what gives the reader an understanding of the devastating losses that occurred during these 2 wars this book poignantly puts in context how the war tore apart both families and communities it truly gives the reader an idea of the effects of war on the common people overall i can say i didn't hate the book but i didn't love it either it's not a keeper for me","3432":"this is a phenomenal book please read","3433":"people war is hell on everybody but most especially on civilians anthony marra focuses his story on the survival of the citizens of chechnya in particular 1 village in particular 1 little girl and the man who tries to save her the author grabs a hold of me and never lets go and let me tell you i wanted to look away even as he's telling the story of havaa akhmed and sonja he's giving us a detailed picture of the desolation the isolation the ravages and the savages of the war each chapter opens upon a year between 1994 and 2004 told from one character's perspective but the entire book is cohesive and culminates in showing how they have touched each touched each others lives without knowing it a constellation of vital phenomena is truly a beautifully written unforgettable book the characters will stay with me for a long time i'm sure and a large part of that is due to the narration of the audiobook by colette whitaker it is almost impossible to believe that she alone is responsible for voices

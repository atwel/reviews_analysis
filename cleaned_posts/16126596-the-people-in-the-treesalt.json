understand his motivations or character at any rate for probably the first third of the book i wasn't really that interested in it but someone whose recommendations i always find compelling called this her book of the year so i preserved and i am glad i did it ties up the search for eternal life exotic unknown peoples and how quickly western civilization can ruin or irrevocably change a native

and discovers a lost tribe of people some of who have immortality but early onset senility but then the story takes a dark turn when although revealed early on the scientist is accused of molesting his adopted children from this island i don't want to say more but i was sucked in by the writing and horrified by what i read","7":" this book was very different it is obvious that ms yanagihara has

taking me out of the story since they were in the editor's voice rather than the narrator's i loved the premise maybe i'll give it another try when i'm more in the mood for this type of book","11":"this was really not my kind of book it was written in the first person which provided quite the hiccup for the story because the narrator was a bit of a trip it was interesting particularly if you like medical stuff but it tried to bring a little too much swiss family robinson into the mix","12":" please note that the one star rating denotes i didn't like it not it wasn't good in point of fact i hated it but i'm in the position of wondering whether the book caused my bad mood or my bad mood poisoned my reception of the book i always maintain that i don't require a likable protagonist to admire a book so i don't think that was it really my gut reaction is most boring book on possible immortality ever everything seemed bloated drawn out and devoid of any kind of freshness from norton's recollection of his parents to his recounting of his scientific discovery i just didn't care about any of it well the part about victor at the end did start to draw me in but at that point it felt like too little too late","13":"norton perina is white colonialism personified he's oblivious and grotesque and yet he's the narrator of one of the most remarkable books i've ever laid my hands on this is quite a debut novel pretty freakin' amazing","14":"a very unpleasant and repulsive story in every aspect yet strangely fascinating","15":"so good i actully had to google some of the content to be sure it actually was fiction it's written so well","16":"a hard one to rate in a way but i was completely taken in by this story i hardly want to apply the necessary adjectives while both raising endless questions and culminating in devastation it's hard to articulate without divulging something of the story well written and beautifully executed this is one that will stay with me a longtime","17":"this is the most riveting book i've encountered in a long time it would take me hours to unpack all my thoughts on this nabakovian phantasmagoria as a blurb on the back of the book so aptly labels it so the basic idea is that the people in the trees is a work of fiction representing the memoirs of a scientist much of it set on the tropical micronesian island of ivu'ivu he's an unreliable sociopathic narrator and his memoirs are presented with edits by an unreliable editor who idolizes the narrator this is the first book i've ever read with double layers of unreliable narrators i think and it's a brilliant conceit and yanagihara completely pulls it off the book is as much subtext as it is text in the sense of both the narrator's personal story and the broader contexts and themes of the book it's about the sociopathy of a person yes and as is always the case with well written unreliable narrators i kept marveling that i was hanging with this reprehensible person and yet there i was but it's also about the sociopathy of science and the imperialism of both industry and the academy it's a book about most everything that interests me geography ecology anthropology colonialism epistemologies ideologies of domination psychology scientific reductionism ethics etc at its core i read it as a book about intersecting oppressions of indigenous people of women of children of animals of ecosystems told from the perspective of one who willingly oppresses it's a book about power i kept thinking that deconstructs power by forcing us to enter the mind of a person with power read with care it works against the grain of power by appearing to move along it but for all this thematic density the language of the book remains vibrant lush sometimes so descriptively tropical i felt humidly dizzy dazzling prose perfectly evoked moodiness of setting and my new favorite adverb roachily and there are these compelling mysteries at the heart of the story so prose and readability are not sacrificed in the name of theme which is not to say that it is always an enjoyable read in all the ways that matter most it's a horror story and it does not let the reader rest and don't go looking for a book about redemption here","18":"a very interesting book about immortality and its ramifications a good character study which poses many moral questions one of which is if a great man does unspeakable things is he still great characters are well drawn the first 2 3 or so of the book takes place in the jungles of a micronesian island the author's descriptions are so clear you feel like you are there i recommend","19":"one of the most disturbing books that i have read in a long time fascinating disquieting nauseating at points it lingers long in the memory it raises some really interesting questions about moral relativism anthropology science and research ethics and the reliability of narratives","20":" yanagihara has crafted a frighteningly believable and an incredibly strange story with this novel maybe more than any other novel i've read it truly reads as the piece of nonfiction memoir it is meant to represent what i mean by this is that you'll have to remind yourself over and over again that you are reading fiction as such the reading is sometimes dry and it might not come together in the fashion you'd expect of a novel but it is a strange journey in and of itself questions of ethics of personal and professional responsibility and of health and science are interwoven into nearly every page of the novel creating a web of situations which are as difficult for the reader to approach objectively as they are for the scientist narrator to approach from a more public subjectivity in the end readers read about his actions through a film of horrified fascination finding his beliefs and actions all too possible all too reminiscent of how a scientist might move in an unknown world is this horrifying and uncomfortable and strange yes are the descriptions and built worlds as beautiful as they are foreign as believable as they are new yes does this piece of fiction read like nonfiction built true to life yes is it hard to read hard to accept and frightening to contemplate expertly crafted and carefully considered absolutely and that's why it's just so terrible as it is wonderful recommended for anyone interested this one won't be for everyone but it is worth the journey oddly enough and it certainly won't be easily forgotten","21":"holy hell my mind is whirling i have a lot to say about this one","22":"i really wish i had read some of the reviews for this book before i had started it i think it would have made a better impression and i would have been better prepared i am often enamored by unreliable narrators exploring what it means to tell the truth a truth in a work of fiction the people in the trees pushed me so far out of my comfort zone that it made it difficult to appreciate the skill with which it was written maybe i should have seen it coming but it's books like these that make me wish they came with trigger warnings","23":" i received an electronic advanced reading copy of this from the publishers via netgalley yanagihara's the people in the trees is a captivatingly rich novel that delves into both large scale cultural conflicts and intimate psychology behind human relationships and family the novel is written a an edited compilation of memoir like letters from the protagonist dr a norton perina a nobel prize winning scientist who discovered a source for vastly extended life span while on an anthropological expedition to an isolated micronesian tribe and who is now serving a sentence in his advanced years after conviction for sexual assault on children from the tribe who he has adopted through the years perina's obviously biased epistolary recollections are edited by his only remaining friend and support following the conviction and thus also biased dr ronald kubodera yanagihara begins with perina recounting his childhood and relationship with his twin brother and their parents and then moves onto his schooling and events the lead up to his participation in the life changing expedition these early chapters at first seem quite separate from the story of cultural conflict that dominates the central portion of the book and i initially questioned the choice of this extended 'introduction' part of that reaction came from the descriptions provided with the novel and the focus of comparisons to themes found in something like the poisonwood bible highlighting cultural clashes between isolated tribes and the 'civilized' west in reality this is only one half of the book's import and these early 'introduction' chapters leading to the anthropological expedition nicely set up the psychology of perina the disfunction of his familial relationships and the notable absences of sexual encounters or apparent interests during his schooling all these become immensely important in the final third of the book following the impacts of the expedition on perina's career and private life ultimately leading to the cause of his conviction the central third of the book with perina travelling with an anthropologist to the fictional micronesian island his encounters and responses to the alien culture of the isolated tribe and his gradual discovery of the islander's profound life spans and the cause are clearly the most exotic and succulent portions of the novel where yanagihara's skilled use of language and colorful description shines beyond making the text enjoyable to read this fact ironically highlights norton perina's inherent unreliability as a narrator of his internal self norton frequently comments how he is the scientist with little artistic capability while his twin a renowned poet is the literary talent yet the words we read in this letter declare to the reader otherwise perina's inability to truly understand himself joined with his extreme arrogance and the results of the announcement of his medical discovery of prolonging life on the micronesian island and its people lead to the events of the final third of the novel perina's adoption of dozens of children from the tribe over a span of decades their possible betrayal and his possible guilt completed with a powerful ending that unites the two major themes of the novel yanagihara manages to keep the reader invested even beyond the closing lines the novel is described as being based upon true events and the obvious source for perina is dr daniel carleton gajdusek an nih scientist and nobel prize winner who investigated the cause of the kuru disease in papua new guinea and thereby helped establish the existence of prions infectious misfolded proteins in contrast to the living infectious agents known bacteria parasites and arguably 'alive' viruses like his fictional counterpart gajdusek adopted many children from the island nation gave them western educations and ultimately was convicted to their sexual abuse marring his scientific career and this brings us to the only flaw i see in this book the science is poorly rendered and unrealistic kuru like mad cow disease and all prion diseases are neurodegenerative they target the mind and involve protein aggregations and effects much like seen with something like alzheimers rather than staying with prions yanagihara chooses to go with the more cliched concept of seeking eternal life this does allow display in the novel of scientific and economic greed more than a cure for prion disease might but yanagihara still includes the neurodegeneration and subsequent slowing of the mind as a side effect of the longevity seen in the island tribe despite the perfect health of their body and the lack of its aging their minds do slowly go until they become not unlike 'vegetables' or dreamers as perina dubs them their longevity as described in the novel is related to telomeres the ends of chromosomes and here is where the novel for me a biologist failed miserably while telomeres and aging are speculated to be related it is hard to imagine how preventing aging in most of the body through alteration of telomere maintenance would somehow just not work in the brain leading to the more prion like side effects in fact it is more likely that a substance that extends overall life span by acting on telomeres would lead to a side effect of cancer as telomere maintenance has a role in preventing cancer development the copy i read is an uncorrected proof so i also can only hope that the novel's explanation of telomerase the enzyme that maintains telomeres not degrades them is corrected the description as it stands in the novel is backwards and the inhibition of telomerase the text claims would rapidly shorten life not extend it even with that correction the overall 'explanation' is more of a macguffin than i would hope for from such an otherwise richly constructed novel despite that flaw i obviously enjoyed this novel immensely and it is one that would be amenable to rereading one day highly recommended for its beauty and the subtle undercurrents beneath the visible cultural reflections","24":" this book turned into something entirely different than i anticipated what i thought would be a biological adventure story turned into a bizarre account of one man's extraordinary life norton perina is the epitome of an unreliable narrator writing his memoir from prison he recounts his remarkable career which led to a nobel prize as a new doctor in the 1950's he accompanied a team to an isolated village on an even more remote island in micronesia where he discovered the source for the tribe's longevity norton's recollections of his time on the island are detailed and atmospheric and he conveys his awe and wonder of his circumstances quite eloquently but there is so much more to norton's narrative than what he encountered on the island huge medical phenomenon he unleashed he is a deeply flawed individual and though he is quick to admit his own shortcomings there is so much more beneath the surface that he is careful not to reveal his life after his initial trip to the island is just as complex and curious as the strange things he encountered in the jungle though i was not entirely trustful of norton his story delivered something i was not expecting and the way it was structured and paced kept me engaged i received a complimentary copy of this book via the amazon vine program","25":"deeply disturbing to me not sure i would recommend it although the anthropological thriller aspects were fascinating and really kept me reading","26":"lolita meets state of wonder meets the weirdest episode of law and order ever perfect book club discussion fodder and totally gripping disturbing haunting","27":"i cannot wait to discuss this with my book club the book is admittedly a bit slow to start and it wasn't until the very end that i was ever gripped by the story but it is sure going to lead to some great discussion","28":" this is indeed an interesting book i really enjoyed the middle of the book with the exploration of the island and its people it was a multi layered novel that certainly demonstrates point of view a colleague retelling the adventures of norton the scientist trying to discover the secrets of immortality however the beginning dragged as well as the end it was a bit disturbing to be manipulated by the author but well done upon reflection i changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars because i keep thinking about the story i can't let my initial revulsion take away from the craft of the novel and the realistic portrayal of this imaginary island and it's people","29":"this book was a surprise albeit not always pleasant but i'm incredibly impressed that it's a debut novel presented so cleverly and with really tough subject matter that's handled with nuance and intelligence i found myself caught up in the world of u'ivu even though the tone is dry and clinical throughout most of the book and i love how it addresses the question of separating one's personal life from their work or if that's even possible looking forward to whatever yanagihara will write next","30":" from paradise to desolate tropical island yanagihara offers an allegory of the anthropologists' colonial approach to an untouched world with some long lived natives surprisingly the missionaries weren't the cause of the decline the descriptions of her imaginary world are magnificent her characters oddly believable their academic lives sadly plausible even with an unreliable editor narrator and the journal's author this novel provides delightful and thoughtful hours yanagihara's ability to stay in the narrator's voice was inspiring reviewed from an arc","31":"sort of a cross between heart of darkness and lolita very good but if you're a judgmental reader you probably won't make it through this novel","32":"astounding that this book was a debut novel the author presents so much material so well realized with characters that are more conflicted than usual and a premise that is wholly original factually based this book explores the nature of civilization in which scientists attempt to gain understanding from the primitive and then capitalize on that knowledge q","33":" other people in these reviews have expressed my feelings totally and since the most disturbing part is left to the last two pages i have to recommend it with warnings lots of very important stuff about the unencumbered lives of academics is covered by this young woman's first book can't believe that but today's academics live better than potentates of earlier eras and their behaviour is totally uncensored by the rest of the world norton the main character is not an evil person just one society lets totally do his own thing for most of his life","34":"interesting story and well written with a little bit of a twist reveal at the end that by that point i wasn't really expecting the story also raises some questions about morality in science exploration that will be interesting to think more about i kind of wish i had read this for a class i think i'd benefit from some group discussion on the topic","35":"i'll use what i read in another review because it perfectly describes my experience i found this book fascinating and disturbing","36":"once again i had a hard time with one of the themes of the book and the casual way the author wrote about it","37":"ehhh not sure if i want to revisit this or not pace is super slow exotic but not riveting like an alan brennert for example","38":"disappointing and far different than i expected though the premise is interesting the main character is completely self absorbed and without empathy this is one i probably should have abandoned but didn't continuing to hope it would take a turn for the better","39":"as if more reminders were needed not to read highly touted contemporary literary fiction maybe it'd give bored house spouses a thrill but it just struck me as a bad story or at least somehow less interesting than the real one its based one maybe if it were told as a 200 page bernhardian rant it'd be better but as it is it's 200 pages too long the language isn't worth the readerly investment it asks for there are plenty of plot holes new elements are introduced at random the interiority of the main character isn't really revealed or at least as anything more than boilerplate subsumed lust the science is sketchy no one wins a nobel for being in the right place at the right time and then running a control group test a college student could come up with and then literally going on to do nothing else of note the discovered tribe is 50% convincing and 50% fetishized there's an attempt at creating suspense over the discovery which is too long because we know what's discovered from the book's opening and which would be too long in any case because it's so obvious the frame narrative is underutilized the power dynamics during the first island visit bizarre the idea of the dreamers not rigorous how do they get tired by simply id exercises but then can launch into a long monologue about their pasts there's a lot i did like the domestic life sketched out at the end however and i laughed along with his approach to parenting and probably it'd be a fine book at 300 pages","40":"i have no idea how to review this book fascinating and appalling at once accomplished writing and entirely unenjoyable","41":"tough 4 stars mean really liked it according to goodreads' prefab verdicts but how do i rate a book with horrifying subject matter an atrocious narrator and footnotes so many they were boggling even my still sharp eyes unlike anything i've read before and stupefyingly well written","42":"complex and disturbing book about a difficult subject wonderful writer not a feel good book for sure makes you think","43":"wow just wow i have not read a novel so weird and wonderful in a long time really great language although the author used the word secreted a lot as in secret not secrete great descriptions of nature and natural phenomena a highly imaginative plot some awkward moments and a pretty major lesson on the western world minding its own business this book had me intrigued from the start although it is a work of fiction the people in the trees is so well researched that it reads like an anthropological paper and makes one want to go find this lost tribe themselves some subject matter is not for the faint of heart but still a really good read to quote my friend colleen this book is beautifully written and unfolds like a nightmare very well said","44":" an unreliable sociopathic narrator plus a sycophantic editor who adds unintentionally revealing footnotes on many pages makes for a challenging read until the very end when many questions are answered hanya yanagihara is an incredibly gifted first time novelist my one wish though is that i hadn't read the book jacket summary before reading the book my enjoyment was dimmed because so much of the plot was just given away for that reason i deduct one star for the lost element of surprise","45":"400 page fictional memoir from the point of the view of a sociopath pedophile augmented by his awestruck lover well written absolutely but reading it was like getting stuck next to a narcissistic self indulgent condescending intelligent scientist on a 10 hour flight as such i didn't buy his story or the substory of anthropology and the consequences of invasive culture","46":"fascinating disturbing and thought provoking in its moral complexity a great book for a book club discussion but i can't give 5 stars to a book and a main character i was happy to be done with","47":" this book pulled me in by its weird exotic cover art i picked it up a few times in the bookstore pondering it eventually i downloaded the audio book and listened to this bleak dark account the book is an ominous piece of fruit i wouldn't really say i enjoyed reading it but it manages to wield a strange hook into the mind of an egotistical sociopath i think hanya yanagihara is a brave and provocative writer who doesn't pull any punches in letting her characters come to life on the page would i recommend it yes for everyone no it'll stick with me though for its plunge into the murky jungles of ethics and morality","48":" an entirely fictitious first person biography the people in the trees narrates the life of a renowned scientist who discovered a long hidden race of people who hold a secret a secret to absurd culture society and immortality this book adequately describes the selfishness of scientists whom many on the basis of improving mankind conduct research that could be potentially deemed as inhumane unethical even cruel while it makes an interesting read being a 'budding' scientist myself i was constantly disgusted by the protagonist himself who carried his self righteousness without a sense of guilt it is first not a book for anthropologists although it could provide them some perspectives on how scientists may behave when faced with a possibility to a ground breaking discovery it is certainly not a book for the homophobic for while it is not explicit the content very strongly suggests a inclination as such overall this is the lowest rated book i have read but it could not be justified objectively as it is simply not a style that suit me still it makes for an intriguing read if you have the time for it could get really wearisome","49":"well written but extremely disturbing not for the faint of heart","50":"deeply disturbing but fascinating and fantastically written","51":"heart breaking frustrating depressing incredibly detailed with characters and motives that i'm still struggling to understand reliable narrator that i want to be unreliable secondary narrator that i suspect is unreliable this one's gonna stay with me for awhile i'll still be thinking about it several other books from now","52":"one should not have to like something to find worth or even simple entertainment in it but in the case of the people in the trees this principle is stretched a bit too far for me","53":"hello to all i am getting the idea that footnotes are all the rage in contemporary literary fiction might as well coin a new term academic fiction cause it makes me feel like i'm reading a text book or work of non fiction so not going to read this one i bow wayne ren cheng","54":"i thought the author took some risks with the format of the story and how she presented some of the concepts and points some of it worked for me and some did not * the strongest parts of this book for me are the beginning and the ending * the beginning sets up the story and as the protagonist starts off his memoirs you get the feeling that not only is he ar this was a 3 read for because of the character development issues raised and the uniqueness of the way the story unfolded my thoughts *ti thought the author took some risks with the format of the story and how she presented some of the concepts and points some of it worked for me and some did not *tthe strongest parts of this book for me are the beginning and the ending *tthe beginning sets up the story and as the protagonist starts off his memoirs you get the feeling that not only is he arrogant but also something is a little off with him - but i was still intrigued to keep reading and the writing was strong in its use of words and phrasing so the reader feels like one with the story *tas the book progresses and the narrator sets off on his journey to the south pacific the story at times dragged a little for me with the often painful details of the expedition and how he comes to want to figure out what causes some of the people to live much longer lives than normal this clashes with the expedition leader who is an anthropologist who wants to record and not necessarily probe the people but the narrator is along because of his medical education and finding the anthropologic purpose of the trip not to his liking *tthere is no doubt some interesting questions concepts to be explored - preservation of a specific culture vs becoming modern and or having something that may help others or at least be of interest in the scientific or business world *tas we learn about the tribe and their customs and the conflict between the expedition members - the narrator's personality starts to reveal and show itself to the reader - racist misogynistic pedophilic - but the narrator does not see himself that way *tyes the narrator made some interesting discoveries and maybe there was genius in his work and his approach to it but in the end was it worth the lives and culture that he disrupted *tthe ending was an even better than the beginning - but just confirms what the reader thought all along that the narrator is a despicable unlikable slimy person *twhile i did not like norton - the author's way of presenting him and unraveling his personality to himself to the world and to the reader was very well done *ti think the author is talented and has written a uniquely different story using a format that often times you have to remind yourself this is not non fiction but fiction","55":" i initially wanted to read this book because i was intrigued by the anthropological and medical aspects but this book does what every autobiography memoir genre book does even though it is fictional includes too many extraneous irrelevant details i prefer a plot by page 25 i was saying ugh i hope this gets going soon the book is basically bookended by 2 tedious accounts at the beginning and near the end going on and on i guess to show the character of the narrator the middle was interesting i liked the ethnographic account even the narrator professed to hate anthropology and what happens when cultures collide or are overwhelmed by the profit motive that is why this is a 3 and not a 1","56":"i have one word to describe this book mesmerising the fictional memoirs of a young scientist who travels to a remote and primitive pacific island and discovers the secret to long life is evocative morally challenging and riveting the moral relativism is what makes the book so intriguing the memoirs pass little judgement and are actually scant in the detail of some of the more challenging issues but it nevertheless raises many matters and leaves you pondering well after the book is put down the style of writing is quite beautiful the descriptions of the environment and the people are rich and memorable it's a long book but is very rewarding recommended","57":"it took me 8 days to finish this book longer by far than anything i've read in years a split reason protagonist norton's monstrous lack of self awareness was so repellent that i could not stomach him for long yanagihara's writing was so incredible that i couldn't stay away an apocalypse narrative unlike any i've ever read one that nearly took me down with it","58":"the writing was compelling the plot line well developed but the approach to child sexual abuse was appalling and ruined whatever redeeming qualities it may otherwise have had this was not a burning moral question worthy of deep introspection to treat it as such is reprehensible simply put in answer to the author's question no you cannot be a great man and do horrible things a monster is a monster no matter his successes in public realms","59":"very strange book and hard to read at times","60":"while well written i found the end disturbing","61":" the people in the trees is the fictional memoir of norton perina as edited by one of his acolytes and apologists the first pages let the reader know that perina a nobel prize winning scientist is serving out a prison sentence after being convicted of sexually abusing one of his 50 odd adopted children all the children are originally from a small micronesian island group one of which perina helped \"discovered\" in the late 50's the book is really impressive for a few reasons one is how yanagihara creates a fictional people culture language etc that seemed completely realistic and plausible to me another is how she makes reading about an insensitive repressed and self deluded asshole page turning it is also a disturbing book for a variety of reasons but in particular the book challenges the reader to think about their own ideas regarding acceptable cultural mores if the reader condemns perina does she also condemn the uvians my one quibble is that norton states early on that he eschews poetry but that isn't how he writes eventually i forgot about that and just read but at first it was a little jarring because the writing is very evocative and descriptive a reminder that the book wasn't actually written by a real life nobel winner but by a novelist","62":"be prepared this book's main character the narrator of the story is despicable","63":" after several reading sessions and getting through less than 50 pages i gave up on this verbose nightmare the premise of the book sounded fantastic a man who discovers a remote island where the people live forever he brings the secret back to america and it then begins to unravel the book starts with the protagonist being in prison for something to do with his discovery and his family his research partner decides his boss needs to write his memoirs from prison the book begins with this gentleman's recollection of his childhood his bizarre mother his twin brother all footnoted by his research assistant what a mess and a bore","64":"i received the book for free through goodreads first reads finally finished 'the people in the trees' it has never taken me this long to finish a book often times slow and boring i found myself putting it down over and over i was excited to read it because of the synopsis i read there are two voices in this story one of which is unnecessary and distracting i did like the overall plot finding a civilization that has a longer than expected lifespan and whether or not the discovery of this was worth the destruction it caused in the name of science there are a couple of questionable moments that can be rationalized away due to its reference in time but this one is not one of my favorites i recommend getting it from the library rather than buying it","65":"a little dry and a little disturbing but interesting","66":"this is one of those books which you are not really supposed to like but the less you like it the better it is interesting thought provoking aggravating at times beautiful at times horrifying well worth the read especially if you love science and psychology","67":" wow what a thought provoking read the number one takeaway that really hit home for me in this novel was the concept that all morality is culturally relative yanagihara will push you to the edge of that concept and even a bit beyond until you are hanging by your fingertips off the cliff of moral relativity your mind will be stretched beyond your comfort zone i promise you that if that is something that excites the mind and pulses the blood definitely pick up the people in the treesthe format of the book itself is written in scientific travel log style this is central to the premise of the book as the device has the effect of bolstering its believability and causing the reader to actually forget this book is a work of fiction i found it incredibly effective while it does take a while to get into once you do it is an riveting adventure into the jungles of the heart and the mind think life of pi meets island of doctor moreau so good","68":"4 5 out of 5 trees","69":" i only gave it the second star for the writing skill this is not a book i would recommend to read despite its prose quality that is almost mystic in portions and the only book i have read in 3 or 4 years that just turned my stomach way before the 1 2 way point and so i quit it by the 2 3rds portion and that is because i do not condone the types of relativism that are assumed as normal human throughout the 368 pages and that people reading for the intriguing plots or cultural inquiry will not fully see the shifting of their own relative values by delving so far into this kind of voice personality disorders' perceptions that are supported as valid that is very murky territory even within psychologists' practices and i believe the headers on this book are seriously misleading to the actual subject matter and the voice that has been given the central stage in this book if it is a tome length statement of supposed hyperbole a kind of huge extended exercise in facetious exclamation well then even double on passing this one up evil doesn't get to brag this long hopefully this author's example of subject matter will not become a fad in fiction writing to me that would be like the equivalent in supporting ethic core values in society to the assigning of john wayne gacy's or charles grabaer's detailed memoirs to a grade school class","70":" 4 1 2 stars this is really quite an amazing book complex and disturbing yet compelling the author channels a nobel prize winning scientist with some um issues as he tells his side of his life's story yet this monologue is framed and footnoted by one of his acolytes and through this additional narrative layer though it's not intended to be critical the reader gets a deeper picture of the unreliability of the narrator much of the book takes place on a fictional remote south pacific island and yanagihara does a great job creating the ecosystem and the culture of the tribesmen readers who enjoyed ann patchett's state of wonder will most definitely enjoy this book if enjoy is even the right word for such characters plot and actions definitely one of the best contemporary novels i've read this year it leaves a reader with a lot to think about","71":"tedious","72":"yanagihara somehow writes in a tone that is both unceasingly stiff and formal and yet also addictive i love hate this book i love hate norton perina but after the ending i don't want to think about this book for a very very long time not for the faint of heart","73":"this was a dense book it was beautifully written but it wasn't something i could pick up and get lost in there is a lot of digestion necessary here it is also one i think you should read with a group as there is plenty that i want to talk about with someone definitely give it a whirl but don't use it as your next fluffy stress release","74":" equal parts fascinating and disturbing this is the memoir of fictional dr norton perina loosely based on the true story of dr carlton gadjusek nobel prize winner and convicted pedophile after completing his studies at harvard norton is invited to accompany two anthropologists as the resident scientist together they travel to the micronesian islands in search of the mythical people of ivu'ivu his detailed descriptions of their trek through the dense jungle their discovery of the \"dreamers\" his complacency acceptance vs my shock horror of some of the tribe's rituals was what drew me in when he decides to bring certain specimens home to study in his lab the callousness of his scientific manner growing ever more apparent i begin to doubt whether this is going to be the wrongful conviction story i originally anticipated when he later goes back to the islands and begins what can only be described as collecting children that doubt continues to grow is this man a sociopath definitely a high functioning one if so the further into this book i got the more unsure i became about whether or not i liked it in the end undecided","75":"so disturbingly good","76":" good very good writing but i just didn't care about the protagonist he's supposed to be unlikeable but he's also boring from time to time i've worked with brilliant people who are arrogant as hell and could easily slide into sociopathy perina is also so closely patterned on the real life person that it felt a bit re hashed interesting thoughts ideas on western interference with newly discovered lost tribes that could have been expanded more it's very limited given that we only get perina's viewpoint and those of his sycophantic editor","77":"did not finish this book","78":" to be fair i would try this book again it was beautifully written but for me there was a spark missing to make me want to keep reading written in memoir style you know the end early on and i was not compelled to find out what the means to that end were i didn't care to know the details of the u'ivu people and how the achieved immortality or what the good doctor did or didn't do to land himself in prison i'm sure i deserves the accolades it received all the pieces for a wonderful book seemed to be present but i just couldn't put them together","79":"a beautiful knockout with as unreliable a narrator as i've ever met i'll be thinking about and bothered by this book in a good way for a long time","80":"i've never read anything quite like it i had to google the main character and the book to find out if i was indeed reading a novel yes it's a novel with footnotes the story is a bit fantastic but loosely based on a real person the writing is magnificent not just for the images created by the author but her use of phrase and the way language flows from her pen read for my mexican book group can't wait for our meeting","81":"i can't say i get the hype around this book it was interesting the framing device having the main character's colleague u0026amp friend present and annotate the main character's autobiography memoir i appreciated that the footnotes were included in the audio u0026amp thought the dual narrators was particularly effective given the framing the main character was insufferable and that definitely influenced my inability to appreciate the book u0026amp find what others liked","82":"beautifully written and thought provoking i was torn on how i felt about norton until the very last page","83":"very twisted tale that it is based on a true story however loosely is rather disturbing if you take yours dark and gripping i highly recommend it also further evidence that you don't need a likable character to love a book can't wait to chat with my bicoastal book buddies about this one in a few weeks","84":"an astounding debut a novel in the guise of the memoirs of a disaffected directionless doctor who embarks on a journey to a tiny island in micronesia with an accomplished anthropologist together they discover that the meat of a particular turtle prolongs life indefinitely while the body is preserved however the mind decays into an eventual irreversible senility that premise is but a stage on which the unscrupulous selfish and detestable doctor struts he is as captivating as iago as he explores this wild terrain uses it to serve his needs and then engages in the mental and ethical gymnastics needed to rationalize his behavior he is a marvelous character to use to question the limits of science and knowledge the extent to which ethics and moral are relative to cultures and societies where and if a line exists between civilization and the primitive and the biases pre conceived notions and lenses of the colonist's mind a highly unsettling and amazing book","85":"interesting style with full page footnotes very detailed on research self centered protagonist with dark ending","86":"i'm glad i read this this novel is going to haunt me for awhile the author lets the cat out of the bag early in the novel and then builds a story and she is a marvelous storyteller with you trying to see how and where the conflict at the beginning is going to play out when it does at the very end she has woven the story so well that it still comes as a very dramatic and painful shock her storytelling itself has taught me a thing or two but wow it is the story of a researcher who is part of an expedition among an unknown peoples the practices of those people and the extended lifespan of some of them lead to some pretty dramatic discoveries and some drastic changes to the people there as the modern world injects itself into it but it is also a story about human beings and the evil we do and are often able to keep masked","87":" i gave this book a much longer chance than i would have normally given it due to the fact that i'm reading it to see how it comes out in the morning news tournament of books i eventually decided however that i just need to put it down and move on i'm having a baby in the next week or so and there are still a number of books i need to read if i want to stay caught up wishful thinking i know so i'm recording my thoughts and reasons for setting this one aside the book is written as the memoirs of a nobel prize winning scientist who is sent to jail in his seventies for sexual crimes against the children he adopted throughout his life he begins at the beginning of his childhood telling the story of his medical school experiences and leading up to the discovery that won him the nobel prize first off i immediately didn't like the main character the narrator of the story i saw another review that said if you are uncomfortable with moral ambiguity you will have problems with this story i am fine with things not being black and white even moral ambiguity in most cases however this man seemed to me to be practically sociopathic in his disdain for any sort of morality at all he was an incredibly interesting narrator to read because he was very good at making me dislike him intensely which was not the goal of his memoirs he's just trying to tell his side of the story but his complete arrogance makes him almost incapable of being the sympathetic figure i thought he might be i also sort of hate his sycophantic narrator the man who is editing these memoirs sometimes reading an entire book where you feel this way about the characters is not an issue and adds to the interest of the book but in that case the story needs to carry you through this story was not doing that for me","88":"the two star rating i'm giving this seems a little harsh but i just didn't like much of the story and i didn't like the protagonist at all he came across as ineffectual and weak for the most part the writing was very accomplished however this definitely didn't feel like a debut novel i enjoyed the early story and the story that took place on the island but i found the last 1 3 of the book really lacking the author used a lot of detail to describe the island inhabitants and their way of life that was very interesting but i didn't much care for the footnotes overall a very well written novel interesting at times but just not one i cared for i'm giving it an ok by gr standards","89":" in jonathan franzen's freedom there is a scene where one character reads a novel by ian mcewan in which she laboriously negotiates detailed descriptions of rooms now i love ian mcewan and haven't noticed excessive description of rooms in his novels but i kept thinking about this while reading the people in the trees early in the book perina goes to have dinner with an older professor we get a description of nearly every room in the house down to the wallpaper and carpeting i wanted to tear my eyeballs out why not write i walked into the room and sat down on the couch done my major gripe about this book is that the first half was a slog and it was a slog because extraneous details like the aforementioned professor's house were over described the first 150 pages could easily have been edited down to 50 without all the david copperfield crap past page 200 however the book picks up and i found it a pretty enjoyable read through to the end leaving aside the writing style for the moment the central character perina was wonderfully drawn in all his evil narcissistic pedophiliac glory i couldn't help but make comparisons with humbert humbert the central premise of magic turtles that permit immortality required some suspension of disbelief but the details of peer reviewed journals and the alternate history of 20th century science hastened by perina's discoveries made it real enough the premise was fun perhaps not too dissimilar from a michael crichton thriller but i also found myself reading it as a parable of colonialism the inevitable corruption and westernization of colonized peoples still there were many minor moments of implausibility one scene where norton is locked outside of his house all night and falls asleep in the freezing cold rather than breaking a window or attempting to climb the fence or pounding until someone else lets him in or one scene where a group of crows congregate on the roof of a car in a prison parking lot small details that i didn't buy","90":"a strange story that includes insight into anthropology and science in general a good reminder that scientists are not above using their research to primarily advance their own status and goals in life well written and memorable","91":"this book is very well written but due to all of the scientific details and disturbing subject i did not enjoy reading it i must say this is an author with a great imagination i felt like i had visited this world","92":"i am trying to enjoy this book but so far it is just tedious in two days i have only managed to get through 77 pages i am doing my best not to give up on this story but the description and reviews on the jacket are a bit misleading i have changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars the book does become slightly more interesting near the mid point but the pace does not change overall i would not recommend this book to anyone but i do not feel like it was a complete waste of time","93":" i will stand by my mid update that i thought this book was written so well i had to remind myself it was fiction end of review might be considered a spoiler it's interesting to watch how norton matures and changes through the segments of his life he reacts how you assume someone would in his situation not that his situation is at all common yet it is infinitely interesting but the end pissed me off truly ughh i would recommend this book to anyone with the caveat that while its not exactly a twist as you could sorta see it coming i wished so bad it wasn't true and then it was","94":"what an incredible first novel i could not put this down from the outset it is a beautifully written disturbing story about science hubris 'cultural relativism ' mystery and the other in ourselves...and others read it","95":"this is a hard book to review it certainly dips into the darker side of life it was a bit slow in some parts for me but it certainly left me with a lot to think over","96":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here after closing this book i don't really know what to say all of the implications and heartache raised within is staggering the main character norton perina is a constellation of imperfection his over inflated sense of self his palpable hatred of women his sociopathic tendencies his disregard for ivu'ivu while maintaining his love and respect for the island and its people and his misplaced magnanimity to save the children of u'ivu ultimately this book is about the rape and pillage of n after closing this book i don't really know what to say all of the implications and heartache raised within is staggering the main character norton perina is a constellation of imperfection his over inflated sense of self his palpable hatred of women his sociopathic tendencies his disregard for ivu'ivu while maintaining his love and respect for the island and its people and his misplaced magnanimity to save the children of u'ivu ultimately this book is about the rape and pillage of native peoples throughout the world by so called caring white people it's truly a tour de force that has left me speechless bravo more","97":" it isn't about the disturbing material that this book has in it that i give it one star much of the scientific content and imagination behind the writing in this book is very interesting but i could not get over how utterly bored i was while reading it the story is very disjointed and often times it took me a moment to remember what book i was reading and what happened previously the writing is very descriptive to the point where i don't understand why half of the material was even added to the final book i didn't really like a single character in the book and just found myself picking it up for the sake of finishing it and being done with it","98":"i really enjoyed her writing style it was very intelligent and completely felt like i was reading a british professor's memoir the story itself was vividly described it was like travelling to the island further the story itself though completely impossible sounded plausible it got a bit tedious during the first island expedition but the story picked up the pace once the protagonist returned to britain","99":"i had high expectations for this book but it just wasn't all that exciting","100":"this beautifully written complex well structured book is written as the memoirs of a fictional narrator who discovers a tribe that has the secret of immortality a prize which comes at a terrible cost the unreliable narrator slowly emerges as an arrogant self centered scientist physician who betrays all who have the misfortune to encounter him well worth reading for the quality of the descriptions particularly of the tropical jungles and for the depth and complexity of characterization","101":"curious captivating and chilling the best book i've read all year","102":"this seemed interesting but the long introduction making excuses for a potential child molester made me give up there's enough skeptics of victims irl i don't need it in my fiction","103":"i simply don't know what to say i'm going to think about it for a while and come back to it","104":" 4 1 2 stars this is an amazing book i am fully in love with it and in awe of the writing it's beautiful but i'm only giving it four and a half stars because after letting it sink in overnight there is something that feels missing it's a difficult issue because i believe what i love about norton perina and by love i do not mean like but what makes him wholly unique is also what i hate despite some serious self reflection this whole book is written in retrospect there is never a time when norton seems to confront his morality and inner demons even though we as readers see he is a very flawed man from the beginning this is a book i was hoping would rock me to my core the way frankenstein did when confronting the horrors of man's destruction and the double edged sword of scientific progress no matter how well intentioned or important or the way heart of darkness exposed a deplorable viciousness of human nature against a backdrop of a deep disorienting jungle and while people of the trees has all of these elements norton was never once swayed from his selfish one track agenda never once paused to consider the implications of his actions and even in the end felt his punishment entirely unfair again this is who perina is and i love how deeply unlikable he is but i suppose i was hoping for a moment of something resembling remorse or at least internal struggle with such heavy moral issues","105":"not my cup of tea laborious i was hoping for something more like ann patchett's state of wonder which i just loved","106":" i hated this book it is essentially a horror story and i am not a particular fan of horror there is nothing attractive about the narrator who whines and moans and doesn't seem to have any real positive qualities except for his intelligence about which he is extremely arrogant the author can certainly write and her descriptions are exceptionally vivid but they describe scenes that fill one with dread rather than delight after reading about the natives teaching boys of the tribe about sexual intimacy by essentially staging a ritual in which the adult males sodomize him one after another while the parents watch i put down the book in disgust maybe norton demonstrates his alleged greatness in the 2nd half of the book but i couldn't stand to read any further","107":"a little too long winded at times but worth the shocking ending although relatively disturbing","108":"brilliant disturbing sometimes i nearly quit because it is such hard going but","109":"well written and deeply disturbing unsettling 4 5 stars for the writing the style the way the story unfolds and the hint of science meditation on science u0026amp academic process and possible consequences 2 3 stars for the casual horrors","110":"read my full review of this book on my blog summer reading project at the people in the trees by hanya yanagihara","111":"a little slow in pacing but well worth the jungle trudge really liked the theme s of how we judge a person's life and life's work","112":"i can not think of one person to whom i would recommend this book it was a plodding fictional memoir of a pretty disgusting man and scientist who was so self absorbed and shallow to not see the destruction and havoc he wrecked in pretty much all he touched if the book elicited something besides just plain fatigue on my part perhaps i could at least feign some intellectual interest but honestly this book left me cold","113":"this book is heavy by that i mean the subject matter is extremely disturbing however this book is also very thought provoking and affecting i recommend it but only to those who have read a synopsis and a few reviews first","114":"there are lots of reasons not to take on this book if you purely focus on the content and yet the literary reasons to read it completely overwhelm them which leaves the reader in a weird complicated quandary this is the second book this winter break i have read like this tampa being the other if you see one of the goals of art to as providing a challenge to the reader this is a must read","115":"sort of up and then waaaaay down the beginning is very much like state of wonder unprepared person heads to remote land in search of a lost tribe that was the up part the down part no likable characters at all and a downright odious narrator you know at the beginning that he's done something bad but really he's done nothing but bad his scientific work basically ruins the lives of thousands and in his personal life ugh","116":" interesting book i picked this up b c it's in the 2014 tournament of books initially i read half of this book got frustrated and put it down to read something else the beginning was filled with pages and pages of lengthy anthropological descriptions of this lost tribe and about the flora and fauna that surrounded them on this remote island snoozefest where was the ethical quandaries promised by all the descriptions i read prior to picking this up so eventually i felt guilty and picked it up again and i am happy to say the book vastly improved this book is not for the faint of heart it made me very uncomfortable and the subject matter is hard to stomach but it's an interesting read if only for all the questions it raises about science unreliable narrators etc i have a lot of questions though and hoping for some answers once the tournament of books begin i'm not sure how far it will make it in the tournament but i applaud it for its originality","117":"very weird but could not stop reading","118":" first of all the cover of this book is absolutely remarkable covers rarely impress me and never get the credit they deserve so i will say that the artist who made it deserves recognition the description on the back of the book coupled with that stunning cover made me want to read it i expected to find an adventure inside about science foreign countries and immortal life i am sad to say that i was deeply disappointed and found myself coming out of this book feeling deeply depressed this book is macabre and disturbing and even as an incredibly open minded person i cannot give this more than 2 stars 1 star is for the cover and 1 is for the unique and often immaculate writing style of the author who i feel has a lot of potential the footnotes in the book are an interesting addition that i have not seen before in a memoir type of novel and i rather enjoyed the extra viewpoint that she introduced in this way that being said it wasn't enough to gain more than 1 star due to the story that she chose to tell with her talent here's my take on this book the main character is a cruel man and is highly unlikeable he is a brilliant scientist but seems to have no conscience at all i was unable to relate to him at all even though though i was a science major in college the first part of the book was by far the worst part for me as i am incredibly sensitive about animal cruelty from norton's point of view we see inside of an uncaring mind a boy who enjoyed confusing and making fun of his ill mother and a child who liked to torture frogs and other small animals as an adult his nature really comes to light as he goes into detail too much detail about how he enjoys killing the mice in his lab animals there are treated like nothing more than inanimate objects and i fell apart when i had to read about the dogs being tortured and operated on then thrown out like garbage once they died as the world's hugest animal lover that aspect of the book made me want to close it forever and never look at it again i still don't know why i was drawn in to try and give it another chance it reminded me of the plague dogs by richard adams but unlike that book which is difficult to read but has an incredible message that makes it worth it in the end there was no happy ending no redeeming quality no moral to be learned i feel like this book should have been taken in one of two directions the first option would be to give it a moral a light at the end of the tunnel some sort of happy ending that makes it worth reading the other direction would be to go to a darker place and make this a full blown horror novel for people who enjoy being terrified and depressed i think she could have gotten away with that quite easily as i was already horrified by what i was reading the main character who also is a child molester and rapist oops did i spoil the plot later goes on to describe in detail how he hacks a turtle's limbs off of its body while it is still alive and how he has to saw to sever its head off so he can consume it for his own selfish reasons unable to scream the turtle just squeaks and looks at him while the light slowly fades from its eyes this image has haunted my nightmares the book is a horror story just not in an obvious way there is no hero of this book only villains there is no love in this book only hatred and greed there is nothing at the end of this book that makes me feel uplifted nothing that makes this a book i would ever recommend to another person most importantly i define a book's greatness by whether or not i will go back to re read it again and again as i have done with many books over the years some to the point where they begin to fall apart i will never re read this book again i am half tempted to burn it final notes i cannot help but wonder why the author who has an obvious talent for writing in a literary sense would write such a depressing story was she trying to rebel by giving the book an unlikeable character or maybe she was trying to teach readers that science is evil either way human beings destroying a species for their own gain isn't about science being evil it's about humanity being evil maybe the craziness inflicted upon the people who ate the turtle meat is nature's way of getting back at us for destroying it yet without a glimmer of hope that message is also lost the fact that there is no redemption offered in this book no happy ending no moral makes it one of the most regrettable reading experiences i have ever had","119":" thanks to edelweiss and doubleday for early access to this title this is a difficult book to critique its told primarily by dr norton perina a nobel prize winner who in his later years is convicted of child molestation its based on the real dr daniel carleton gajdusek who won the nobel prize for his work on the disease kuru among the native new guineans and was also convicted of child molestation in his later years the book is an attempt to examine the mind of a brilliant but deeply flawed man a man who is arrogant misogynistic self absorbed and almost pathologically blind to the sufferings of animals and people around him through the twisted voice of dr perina the author also is questioning whether certain scientific discoveries are worth the price paid by those who are most innocent the native peoples and their environment of native flora and fauna while all of this is interesting for me at least i couldn't get past the truly reprehensible mindset of this brilliant scientist his genius is undeniable which makes his crimes to the native peoples and their world as well as to the many children he took into his care that much more disturbing i do not believe that genius allows a person to live outside of the norms of society this is a brave book for bringing this story and topics to light and is very well written however is is also deeply disturbing and not one i can in good conscious recommend","120":"this was an excellent creative book disturbing in some ways but really quite good","121":"remember that tv show lost in space if you do then you'll appreciate my saying warning will robinson danger warning this incredible tale should have some kind of caveat before you start although i will say that once i started reading i'm glad i wasn't warned ahead of time this is some tale let me tell you it's not for the faint of heart yanagihara writes beautifully and treacherously and i loved it i will say there could have been some tightening during certain points of this tale but really read it it has a colonel kurtz heart of darkness feel it's a got a sci fi tone an almost lovecraftian examination of events that just propelled me onward with a sense of foreboding and then yes horror jeez i think i scared the heck out of you but everyone else has said it much better despite all these warnings it really is worth a look i look forward to whatever comes next from this author","122":" 3 5 stars although possibly more yanagihara's novel is an impressive work of self exculpatory fiction about a scientist who cares very little about those around them or really about the effects he will have on the world except insofar as they would benefit him the language his protagonist norton perina uses could easily find their way into a trading banker's mouth as he explains why the recent bubbles and economic collapses weren't his fault and even though he profited immensely well it was simply something that happened because he was clever and the rest of us aren't or a torturer convinced that what he was doing was in the national interest while enjoying every sadistic moment perina's discussion of the ivu'ivuans of their primitiveness etc resemble those of other anthropologists of his time period in its racism its superior tone the seductive lure of aspects of its culture that conform to the observer's interests and its confirmation of both the developed world's dominance and its depravity likewise perina's efforts to repudiate the evil he commits and not simply the child abuse which is horrific but also the knowing undermining of a culture and its traditions and the complete unwillingness to accept any fault or even to recognise vocalise what he is place in sharp relief one's own attempts at self exculpatory behaviour finding both to be simply what they are lies we tell ourselves so we can occasionally look into the mirror without feeling ill while i feel absolutely no sympathy with perina as a character i do feel with great horror that i can relate to him which is a great achievement by yanagihara","123":" it was the tournament of books that made me finally pick up this book i'd heard about from ann at books on the nightstand several times and it was also a publishers weekly best of 2013 selection if you're an audio listener i recommend this as a listen there are many non words or foreign words that if reading would be words i would likely skip over but on audio they sound exotic the main character is narrating from prison and we know why as the book opens but we don't know his guilt or innocence until the end he's a nobel winning medical doctor who won for his research and anthropological endeavors he also adopted 43 children interesting huh read or listen on this would be a good book club book as there are many scientific and moral issues to talk about","124":"hanya yanigihara is an excellent writer i sometimes forgot that this book took place in america so english was the tone and timbre her imagery was beautiful detailing each little point in the land before his eyes he was the one who was describing the lay of the land an unkindness of ravens was one of the quotes that i liked the cover is so beautiful and it has terrific reviews mostly by folks who find the book incredible i enjoyed the book the people in the trees is about an island paradise which is ruined by the fact that there is a turtle that lives on this island at a ceremony when the people of this one village are about 60 they eat this turtle this makes them immortal however after about 150 years they start to lose their minds when they start to lose their minds they join a group called the dreamers and wander about the island foraging eating the fruits of the island by the time they are 500 they are completely brain dead losing all abilities altho their lungs are in perfect condition fascinating book it's also about his adoption of about 50 of the children who were orphaned there and about how he related with them it's also about his views throughout the book only seeing things through his own eyes and not really understanding the effects he has on the characters and events surrounding him it's a well traveled book and a dense read","125":"wow what a tough book to describe or review much less assign a star rating to it's one of the most ambitious novels i've read in a while especially for a debut and it's packed full of inventive wonders but it's also worth acknowledging that it's a hard book to read and often an ugly one in fact i would go so far as to warn people about the book in spite of the fact that it massively impressed me the protagonist is one of the most morally repugnant characters you will ever encounter and you get a seriously detailed and gross look at everything going on inside of his mind taking the form of an epistolary memoir composed by the protagonist from his prison cell and compiled by his sycophantic nearly equally disgusting assistant the book itself is not what you might think from the summary on the jacket well it is that an academically described account of an encounter with an imagined micronesian culture filled with elements of the magical and fantastic but it's also much more and it's the much more that you might not be bargaining for it's easy to be horrified at perina's thoughts and actions but you must also acknowledge that his tendencies to ignore taboo break boundaries and generally be a trampling colonialist prick all in the name of science and knowledge of course to some extent represent the reader's curiosity as well as our own society's tendencies just as much as you find yourself judging and shaking your head at his behavior some part of you will have to admit that you were hoping he would be just as intrusive as he was so that you the reader could learn the answer to the same question he is searching for the answer to i find this aspect of the book--its indictment of the western idea that curiosity and knowledge are intrinsically good and that pursuing them outweighs any possible cost --to be very interesting while this all might make the book sound very grave and accusatory and it's not worth lying--it is a very unflinching book that goes very dark places i feel like it's easy to forget by the end of the book how it's also full of wonders of imagination perina's account of the first visit to ivu'ivu is engrossing and lush i found the beginning of the book a bit difficult to get through but was very glad to have stuck with it by the time this part of the narrative got underway i recommend this book highly but not unreservedly it's decidedly not a book that everyone will enjoy or appreciate but i encourage you to push forward at least until the first third of the book or so is complete if you are having trouble with it for my part i found it engrossing and troubling and i'm hugely excited now for yanagihara's next book","126":" not at all what i expected i guess this was an interesting enough anthropological fiction that made you feel that everything was real the methodical recounting of events makes the story very easy to follow and you know pretty much from the start where it's going i suppose i just wasn't really interested by the whole pedophile aspect of the story i feel that it was put there for the sensation side of it it is clear throughout the story that the main character is shady and the efforts made to hide that fact until the end are either mistakenly too obvious or purposefully so but to what aim i am not sure i really appreciated the overall construction of the story and development but i can't say it awed me","127":" lauren perez publicity intern for me the first weeks of the new year are dedicated to furiously reading all the books i didn't get to in the year prior a fug of guilt reading and i'm glad i do this because otherwise i might have missed yanagihara's debut novel the people in the trees eclipsed by my excitement for the new lorrie moore yanagihara's novel is loosely based on the life of nobel prize winner dr d carleton gajdusek a brilliant scientist and convicted child molester who adopted 56 children from the south pacific and went to prison for raping one of his sons yanagihara's dr norton perina while hewing fairly close to those basic biographical facts is far more than the sum of his parts styled as a memoir confession written by perina in prison as a series of letters to his mentee and sycophant dr ronald kubodera the voice she creates is captivating and obliviously cruel he narrates the discovery and inevitable exploitation of the fictional micronesian nation of u'ivu probably an even greater creation than the character of norton himself yanagihara has an amazing imagination and sense of detail and the discovery of the selene disease spread by eating a specific endangered turtle that can prolong human life for centuries--at the cost of the mind everything that happens in the book blends the inevitable with surprise like a line of falling dominoes colonialism exploitation moral relativism glory and the cost of discovery","128":"don't quite know what to say about it but it was somehow enthralling and i had no idea where it was going but the end was quite disturbing major points for originality and creating a good story that was not predictable and held my interest to the end but then for some reason an odd piece was added on that almost negated all that went before it would be better without the very last section and leave it to the reader to fill in the blanks this is a debut novel so i would read another one by her and hope for no spoiler","129":" i wound up liking this book in spite of myself if you can get past the fact that this is told from the point of view of a monster who apparently lacks any sort of moral compass it is a fascinating read and frankly part of the point of the book at least to me is that it challenges the reader to examine their own moral compass and where our fundamental beliefs in right and wrong come from the voice of norman piera is chilling and makes you want to run and hide he is cold without empathy and without remorse he seems incapable of real emotions for others and dismisses any such emotions as sentimentality and yet this is a story at some level about his search for true connections and a link to the souls of others he just goes about finding it in a disturbing unsettling way both the jungle adventure part of the book and the later part where he returns home and settles into his notariaty and his domestic life with the multiple children he adopts are well written and hold the reader's anticipation of what is coming next it isn't perfect there is a bit of repetition here and there that seems unnecessary but the language is sharp to the point and the story and the characters are for the most part very compelling in some sense this is like getting inside the mind of a hannibal lecter although not quite as sickening it is not someplace you want to spend a lot of time visiting because it will make you question your own sanity but it is interesting to visit for a few hours and wonder at what is going on","130":" i have to hand it to yanagihara here for writerly discipline perhaps writing in the voice of an unsympathetic elderly man comes naturally to her but crafting this into something convincing or at least artfully contrived is an impressive feat and resisting the temptation to intervene in author voice wouldn't have been possible for me i suppose with whatever i'm reading i ask myself is this literature critical yanagihara's book traverses difficult territory the dangerous grounds of child abuse and colonisation and i wondered what she wanted me to think what her angle was behind perina and ron and whether it was safe the sharp unravelling in the postscript of the text's meticulously constructed ambiguity should have made her intentions easier to read but certainly i felt left open many avenues of reflection i'd been wandering down on the implications of aging populations and the ethics of big pharma i wish i knew more about anthropology since its representatives here paul and esme are weirdly humourously distorted through the highly unreliable prism of the narrator's perceptions yanagihara certainly does not romanticise 'primitive' culture here but perina's clinical even sociopathic descriptions are suspect alternative views are hinted at and though i itched for more of them i respected the decison to leave well alone perhaps a deliberately exemplary gesture ultimately the book was as uncomfortable as say lolita and raised toothsome questions without pushing answers the setting provided strange unsettling pleasures a good read for me","131":"i'm glad i don't have to review this book professionally this book was very well written the research is so good so convincing that it seems like an authentic memoir of a nobel winning scientist you feel like the island of ivu'ivu exists as it is described and that it contained the almost secret to immortality and yet this story is hard to like it's a story about ruination the ruination of ivu'ivu of the people on the island of the country of u'ivu it's also about the ruination of dr norton perina and his dozens of adopted children from u'ivu at times you question your beliefs in human morality and scientific progress then maybe you're slapped in the face with the reality of what has happened it's not a book i would heartily recommend but it's also a book that i'm thoroughly glad i read","132":" i can really understand why so many people hated this book it dealt with many unsavoury themes ranging from colonialism paedophilia rape to the inevitable evils and destruction that science can often bring for me this book was beautifully written so much so that i found it hard to be distracted by the gruesome events and even the ethically challenged protagonist himself yanagihara's colourful prose and vivid descriptions made this novel hard to put down particularly during her masterful depictions of the jungle during the first half of the book the use of fictional newspaper cuttings and references to fictional journal papers in the footnotes hauntingly reinforced the story's elements of magical realism although the protagonist norton was never a likeable character i could in some ways sympathise with him the quote i did what any scientist in my situation would have done is although no excuse a reflection of his perceived duty to the progression of science and a justification for norton's actions of course yanagihara's decision to employ a sociopathic unreliable narrator presented with edits by an sympathetic editor makes this story an even more complicated piece of moral relativism much like nabokov's lolita and many have drawn parallels the narrator's romanticisation of such deplorable behaviour reinforced by remarkably exquisite passages of writing is both captivating and extremely disconcerting i was impressed by this book and the level of knowledge and research that went into creating an island culture people and even language as real as that found in the micronesian island of ivu'ivu it is definitely not a book for the light hearted or weak stomached but it is a rewarding one for those who persevere","133":"wow hard to believe this is a first novel if you can't tolerate a thoroughly despicable narrator stay away i was glued to this story of a young doctor's journey to an unexplored island and his no holds barred search for both literal and scientific immortality","134":" i'm having a very hard time thinking of how to review this book because my feelings about it are very tied up in how it ends and i don't want to spoil something the author lays out brilliantly i find myself in the position of acknowledging that this is a very well written interesting thought provoking morally complicated debut which i will not easily recommend to anyone why not there are scenes of brutal violence against both animals and children which are frankly hard to take i came away from reading last night feeling confused and angry and a little dity but i definitely came away from this book feeling moved random thoughts brilliant construction memoir style creates and unreliable narrator key to the moral dilemma read alike for patchett's state of wonder same lush jungle descriptions similar question of what to do with the power of science and discovery similar insanity i was unable to put this book down once into the second half which picks up tempo dramatically","135":"such a loaded and thought provoking book loved in particular the commentary on science and the environment","136":"rarely does a book unnerve me in the way that heart of darkness once did with its siren song of savagery coiled in each of our hearts the people in the trees does just that set in the 1950s a lost tribe is discovered the secret of immortality beckons and one dr norton perina future nobel laureate will travel too far from the safety of the known to ever come home again unchanged a brilliant and totally unsettling debut","137":"well written fascinating story of a native people i did not enjoy the main character and had a hard time understanding him overall though i did enjoy the book but i need to find less depressing stories for a change","138":"wow you've got to read this one as i age and watch older relatives deteriorate and finally pass away i often think which is worse to have a failing in health body but a sound mind or to have a relatively healthy body and a failing mind this thought kept coming to me as i read this book the young author of this book has a remarkable way with words and a remarkable story to tell one i will continue to think about for days after i return this book to the library","139":" i'd give this 3 5 stars if i could i enjoyed this book but i definitely have mixed feelings about it there's our humbert humbert like memoirist norton with copious footnotes by his colleague editor and lover and newspaper articles bookending the plot i loved the structure even although the footnotes weren't easy to read on my ipad mini i guess i thought the story would be more about the overall science and its ramifications instead it was a personal account of norton's rise and fall beautifully written but nonetheless disturbing and yes he's a total misanthrope who shouldn't be allowed near children and a complete misogynist albeit i found his dislike of esme to be hilariously irrational in short norton's a jerk and yet somehow the story itself remains readable captivating fascinating i can't explain it","140":" my rating is somewhere between 2 5 and 3 stars i gave it 3 stars to be generous it's well written and researched to a fault with so many convoluted references and footnotes that the author detracts from the story in her efforts to present what appears to be a true memoir historical scientific account also although the story is fascinating it borrows from every anthropologic scientific cliche' regarding aging and primitive societies i knew how it would end about halfway through and recognized that it would not be a happy ending potentially great this turned out to be an unsatisfying read for me","141":" the people in the trees is a gorgeously drawn out book that takes you from the sterile boredom of a laboratory to the cloying press of the ivu'ivuian jungle then deep into a man's inner darkness on a remote island containing a true lost tribe perina inadvertently stumbles onto the promise of immortality in the form of a turtle alas such marvels are often double edged blades and the turtle is no exception immortality comes with an inversion of intelligence it explores the cultural relativity of morality the utterly destructive futility of corporate greed and a man's relinquishment to an internal struggle despite the central premises being about immortality it is really about perina's journey in life of the small transformations that make a man you struggle between admiring perina and reviling him for many of the same traits that made him admirable you realize a man's action shows the truth regardless of the words he says the jungle is ever present in the people of the trees as much a physical presence on ivu'ivu as an imbroglio of the narrator's pride regret denial and complete lack of remorse i keep seeing the sprawl of stars and the sad wise eyes of the doomed turtle as it comes up the water to greet the visitor","142":" i enjoyed this--it hit a lot of good points for me unreliable narrator anthropology and a kind of iterative moral relativism now there's a mouthful that is fun to read when done right and she did a great job with it too never sensationalist or milking for drama and i very much liked her writing especially--this is an odd thing to say but i'll stand by it--her adjectives i'm not 100% sure about that epilogue though maybe it was the only way to wrap up the story and affirm what the reader suspects but it felt a touch heavy handed that's a small quibble though even for a major plot point mainly it was a good and entertaining read discomforting in a highly interesting way and i thought yanagihara did some great world building","143":"this is a difficult book to review so the book is in general though with a few clunky exceptions well written it has an interesting narrative style that's very engrossing as a reader you're definitely caught up in the story however the main character is really repugnant and as the plot unfolds things just get worse in this regard so as a reader i'm left thinking what makes a good book can one still enjoy a book if the main character and the plot are actually disturbing and i don't mean disturbing in a thought provoking way i mean just unpleasant to read about and think about at the end of the day i'm just not glad i read this book i almost but not quite wish i hadn't i can admire the author as a writer but i can't say i enjoyed the book","144":"i almost didn't want to admit how much i liked this book considering the ending but i did it was so interesting a concept and so well written that it immediately brought to mind cloud atlas by david mitchell or we the drowned by by carsten jensen","145":"weirdest book of the year","146":"marvelous book beautiful vivid writing and a troubling story a narrator that is at once unreliable and frightening and charming a story that stays with you an unexpected discovery and one i'd recommend highly","147":"lolita meets deplorably inhumane 1950s era science occasionally revolting entirely riveting","148":"really good book until the creepy end","149":"although i was an english literature major i almost minored in sociology i just needed one class time has made me forget why i didn't just take it and i loved all of my social science classes it was so interesting to contemplate different people groups and why people do the things that they do i remember really enjoying my anthropology class reading all of the articles didn't even seem like work since they were so fascinating one interesting thing about anthropology was the discussion about moral relativism for example the topic of female circumcision reading the people in the trees is like reading a cross between a sociological study which the book is a fictitious version of and the poisonwood bible although it was in many ways a difficult even painful book to read it was really fascinating and made me think hard about the subject matter people often ask me how i find books to read and being a librarian definitely facilitates my discoveries whether that's patrons inquiring after a book or as in this case doing the order sheets at my old branch i did both the adult and children's order sheets so i always knew about the new books that were coming out or had just been released i like to be thorough i research every single book on the order sheet anyway the people in the trees sounded really fascinating so i promptly put a hold on it another perk of being a librarian knowing about the book from the order sheet and being one of the first to put a hold on it the book is interesting in that you already know about the fate well except for one thing of the main character and most of what led him to that point but the book is him telling the whole story from his side from the very beginning we know that dr norton perina had as a young man traveled to a remote island in micronesia with an anthropologist who had discovered to white civilization anyway a new tribe the ivu'ivuans he needs a doctor to help him take blood samples do physicals etc so he invites perina along perina accepts since he doesn't have much else planned after his medical school graduation and when he arrives on ivu'ivu he realizes that there's more to the story tallent the anthropologist he's traveling with has learned of the existence of a group of people called the dreamers for their senility despite their lack of intellectual ability they are in excellent physical condition and the evidence suggests that they are much older than the typical ivu'ivuan's life expectancy or in fact any human even six times a normal human's age it's almost comical how easy it is to point to the reason behind the lack of aging the opa'ivueke a rare turtle that ivu'ivuans eat upon reaching the age of sixty a rare feat for them tallent warns perina against publishing his findings and prefers to concentrate on the everyday habits of the people but perina kills one of the turtles smuggles it back to america with him and begins experimenting on mice when he publishes his findings neglecting to mention the debilitating senility that comes along with the immortality tallent's prediction comes true the tiny island becomes overrun by pharmaceutical companies and others seeking immortality the beautiful island is ruined and the ivu'ivuans have been turned on to alcohol meanwhile he adopts dozens of ivu'ivuans who have been abandoned by their parents until he is accused by one of his adoptees of child molestation and sentenced to prison the location from where he writes this autobiography at first i gave this a three star rating because perina is not a likable narrator at all but yanagihara's writing is simply dazzling she really draws you into this story and it's not like you all of a sudden sympathize with perina there are moments that seem difficult or unfair for him but it's truly stunning how unapologetic he is about his behavior he's racist misogynistic and tries to thinly veil his sexual abuse as a callback to an ivu'ivu coming of age ceremony but yanagihara's description of the lush jungle is really beautiful writing it stuck with me the line about all the different colors of green \"so many shades and tones of green -- serpent aphid pear emerald sea grass jade spinach bile pine caterpillar cucumber steeped tea raw tea if you want a feel good book do not read this but yanagihara's writing was really stunning and i look forward to seeing what she comes up with next oh i just learned while writing this behemoth of a goodreads review that the story is loosely based on a read one that of dr daniel carleton gajdusek http en wikipedia org wiki daniel_c creepy","150":" starts out in the vein of a more accessible pale fire with a newspaper crime story about child abuse as a preface a commentary by the accused child abuser's work colleague and then the accused's memoir regularly footnoted and explicated by the same commentator promising it's even better than that because the accused is a nobel prize-winning scientist and his memoir relays how he came to discover the secret of immortality among a tribe of people on a remote pacific island fascinating but just when things ought to start getting messy and force the reader to keep all the strands of the book straight instead they start to simplify the commentary gets less and less intrusive and as a result the experience of reading the people in the trees flattened for me without much intertextual depth the story of the scientific discovery didn't seem to have as much at stake as the question of the scientist's future guilt and there wasn't enough accomplishment in the scientist's telling of his research--or tension about whether he would discover the island people's secret since that's spilled in the first few pages--to compel me not surprisingly it took nearly a month before i finally reached the end","151":" strange and disturbing as it was there is no other book i can remember ever reading that was more original or beautifully written there was one glaring flaw and i wonder if anyone else noticed it ronald kubodera--the character who edited dr perina's memoir and describes himself as perina's lab employee and intimate friend for thirty years--is not mentioned once in the text of the memoir we hear ron's voice in his annotations throughout the story but never has dr perina included him in the main narrative doesn't it seem that there would be times that such a close friend and colleague would figure into the account this seems to me like a mistake in the crafting of the story one i find surprising considering the author's extraordinary proficiency am i missing something","152":" this book is is about the arrogance of science and i loved it normally i am too gullible to properly read untrustworthy narrations i tend to accept everything at face value but perinna and his acolyte editor are so creepy smug and megalomaniacal that reading their narration raises neck hairs of apprehension throughout the setting and formal structure of this book are meticulously and vibrantly detailed the island and the lost tribe are set down in a botanical anthropological detail that totally belies their origin as fiction not only is the descriptive prose excellent but the poetry of the setting the ideas which it nurtures and abets in the the minds of the characters is captured beautifullly as well making the world lived in and natural as well as fantasticthe interconnecting themes of patriarchy science and the devastation of innocence are all reflected in the action of the novel without being too cutsy or metaphorical the autobiographical framing helped keep it chilling and meditative throughout read this for the dark humour the incredible setting and the gutting attack on scientific imperialism","153":"ehhh this book is well written and has thought provoking elements which made me debate rating it at 3 stars but unfortunately the plot was dull and i never connected with any of the characters it's disappointing to me that the most shocking part of the book is revealed in the postscript i'm glad at least that there is a shocking element because it gives the story more depth i hope i am right when i assume that there is much more to unravel about this book on a side note remind me to avoid reading memoirs of people that don't exist the memoir format became very annoying","154":"discomfiting to the extreme cringed my way through much of the book which was clearly what the author had in mind why else would she write such creepy characters u0026amp scenes held my interest but those last few pages were so disturbing i'll never read it again","155":"what a ride this book gave me i was ready to put it down about a quarter through but had heard that people who read this book were crazy about it now i understand why it isn't an easy book to read it slows you down by presenting all kind of moral and ethical dilemmas in your path especially relating to where is genius and science subject to morals and ethics what is also disturbing is knowing this book is loosely based on a real scientist who was eventually sentenced to jail the writing is outstanding and brings this story to an uncomfortable reality this is the kind of boom that would be ideal for a boom club because there is much to discuss the question is how many will stay with the topic if you are looking for a book that puts you through the paces really makes you think framed in great writing then don't hesitate to pick this up","156":"i feel duped i mean i have a degree in literature i should be able to identify an unreliable narrator from miles away right but the way yanaghira began the people in the trees with those press releases i mean it was like i was predestined to take the side of norton perina and you will know what i mean when you begin the book and also deal with the same overwhelming evidence that is presented read the rest of this review at the lost entwife","157":"such a thought provoking novel i really enjoyed it but wish i was in a book club again so we could discuss this book","158":"this was a truly disturbing book i don't want to give away the plot here i will say that the first person narrator does some pretty disgusting things that he doesn't seem to find so disgusting this puts the reader in an uncomfortable position -- one that i found interesting to occupy during the time it took to finish this book i am in awe of the author's descriptive ability the plot takes the protagonist on a journey deep into a jungle and forest filled with wondrous things but those things seen through the eyes of the protagonist are twisted and dark everything the leaves the trees the fruit is a little obscene i appreciate being unsettled it's one of the reasons i read but i would not recommend this book to the faint of heart the squeamish or those not in the mood to be disturbed","159":"do not waste your time with this book it should not be titled the people in the trees because it is not about them at all there might be 10% of the story dedicated to the discovery of the people and the rest of the book is about an egotistical professor who turns out to be what i would consider a horrible person i should have followed my instinct to put this down after about 2 chapters but i really like to give a story time to unfold because sometimes there is redemption at the end of the book that is not the case here so please don't even attempt it","160":"weird twisted good wish i could give it 3 5","161":" this is the best book i've read in several years i know that sounds crazy but this one really impressed me the book examines difficult questions of scientific ethics human exploitation and sexuality while wrapping it all up in a suspenseful story of the scientific discovery of the secret of human immortality the story is told as a first person memoir of a scientist who makes a miraculous discovery on a remote micronesian island the writing is absolutely stunning and at the same time horrifying be prepared for some gruesome scenes and some offensive acts if you can handle lolita then try this","162":" pretty unpleasant character to spend 500 pages with and not in a so evil they're good way i'm very confused by the reviews praising this book for its moral ambiguity how do you figure yanagihara goes out of her way to consistently depict norton perina as a sadistic arrogant petty misogynistic misanthropic asshole from first page to last he's never a sympathetic figure and never in the least bit credible there is never any implication of a positive benefit from his negative unethical ways i mean he never even denies that he is a pedophile equally confounding is the pacing of the novel the reader spends the first 300pp laboriously waiting for the main character to make the discovery that they had explained to them in the first two lines of the jacket copy then we speed through 50 years in about 150pp picking up fascinating characters genres ideas and symbols that are just as quickly discarded with no further explanation can't say this is recommended and not because of the supposedly taboo and ambiguous subject matter the truth is it's just not that well written and not that enjoyable a reading experience","163":"hanya yanagihara's accomplished debut is the disturbing tale of a scientist's relationship with a micronesian tribe the novel presents the edited confessions of dr abraham norton perina who joined a research team on the fictional island of ivu'ivu in 1950 there were rumours of a forest tribe whose habit of eating the opa'ivu'eke turtle led to immortality and indeed when norton encounters these half wild \"dreamers \" their historical memory suggests some are approaching 200 years old while on ivu'ivu norton witnesses a number of unsettling events including ritualized sodomizing of young boys \"my tidy theories about the simplicity of life here...might after all be mistaken \" he concludes on his return to america he tests the effect of turtle flesh on mice with comparable results life span is extended threefold but madness ensues pharmaceutical companies soon scramble for the endangered turtles beginning ivu'ivu's inevitable process of westernization on subsequent research trips norton adopts native children - 43 in total he wins a nobel prize but his personal life grows stranger in 1997 he is jailed for sexually abusing some of his sons the novel's framing device has norton writing these confessions from prison like nabokov's humbert humbert is he a genius or just a pervert inspired by the true story of researcher daniel carleton gajdusek the novel is an impressive mixture of medical mystery anthropological treatise and character study along with lolita it may remind readers of ann patchett's state of wonder another clever exploration of savagery versus civilization originally published at we love this book","164":"wow this was completely absorbing and creepy and not quite like anything else i've read a pretty amazing remarkably daring unique debut","165":"strange sort of book many times wondered if this was fiction or non very detailed footnotes u0026amp publication citations kept you guessing got very wordy u0026amp slow in parts kept waiting for the payoff u0026amp when it came it kinda wasn't worth the wait not sure i'd recommend this one","166":"wow what a powerfully depressing and moving book i'd give it ten stars if i could a","167":"this was man booker eligible so i just assumed it was going to get better the writings good but the protagonist is another stry i enjoy this setting we've been here before in poisonwood bible and state of wonder and signature of all things but all those books do it better","168":"it's hard to like a book with no likable characters but this is a compelling story of an anthropologically minded medical doctor on a tiny island in micronesia who with two colleagues finds and studies a lost tribe it's based on a true story and rife with cultural bias questions of moral ambiguity thought provoking issues of relativism vs absolutism hard to read and disturbing yet ultimately rewarding","169":"i rarely write reviews but this book oh my i don't quite know what to say i would not say i liked this book but it is powerful and certainly memorable the last section will stick with me forever the bulk of this book is beautifully written and unfolds like a nightmare i do not recommend it but if you are brave enough to read this be warned it will haunt you","170":"what a creative and original story i loved how the author made this fictional story so real by the use of footnotes this story would be great for a book club as i feel like debating the character of norton with his friend kubodera","171":"tedious and creepy not the good kind of creepy","172":" this is dr norton perina's memoir he is a scientist whose discovery wins him a nobel prize which forever changes medicine and destroys a culture in the process while working in a lab unexceptional and ambiguous about his future and career norton jumps at a chance to go with anthropologist paul tallent on an expedition to find an unknown tribe on a remote micronesian island he has no information as to what tallent is really looking for \"the people in the trees a novel\" is hanya yanagihara's debut novel about perina's life and the subsequent consequences of the choices he makes the people tallent is desperate to find are rumored to live on the remote island of ivu'ivu the team succeeds the people are exceptionally long lived although while their physical bodies do not seem to age past a certain point their condition is accompanied by severe mental decline they designate the affected elders the \"dreamers \" perina suspects their physical 'immortality' comes from the meat of an exceedingly rare turtle he kills and smuggles one out of the country along with four of the \"dreamers\" to prove through science what he already suspects his decision and subsequent discovery wins him a nobel prize but comes at the price of a people and culture he had come to love and ultimately results in his own undoing yanagihara's novel is beautifully written she is an incredible storyteller norton perina is distinctly human and far from faultless this is a novel of what actions and the subsequent consequences are really worth the question of what makes a man good versus evil whether one can outweigh the other whose right it is to make that judgment and whether one peoples way of life is truly worth more then another this novel is thought provoking exceptionally detailed and a remarkably worthwhile read it has become one of my many favorites i received this book free from goodreads first reads this has in no way influenced this review","173":"i received a bound galley via first reads i really enjoyed this book which i think is saying something considering how much disdain i felt for dr perina the book is beautifully written the concept too is interesting certainly there have been other novels written in the form of a memoir but i think what made this unique was that the reader has to receive the narrative via an intermediary and it is very obvious early on that this person will prove unable to overcome his own devotion to dr perina to truly give the reader an accurate portrayal of events i didn't find the character of norton perina at all sympathetic and perhaps we aren't meant to though certainly he views himself as a victim of circumstance and is enabled in that viewpoint by his devoted underling faithfully and not at all unbiasedly footnoting the memoir i know there are those who think a sophisticated reader shouldn't care whether the main character is likable or not but personally i find myself more driven to finish a book if i don't find myself filled with revulsion every time i read a character's thoughts despite that i found myself unable to put this book down at times i think dr perina's character is definitely reflective of the type of doctor prevalent through much of the 20th century though i think the breed of physicians who believe themselves to be omnipotent and omniscient is going by the wayside in this day and age you know except surgeons i think it's a requirement to have that sort of unrealistic confidence in the end i was left with some really interesting concepts to ponder does the potential for something hugely beneficial to humanity as a whole justify the destruction of a few and do the great deeds a person has accomplished in his or her lifetime outweigh the bad things he or she has done in a bit of a postscript to a previous comment i posted prior to reading this i am still interested to know whether anyone can provide details regarding the true story this is supposedly based on i saw another review that mentioned the inspiration for the character of victor being that of victor of aveyron i'm not sure if that is the entirety of the basis for the true story claim as i think victor is a relatively small aspect of the overall narrative though certainly victor is of utmost importance to perina's character arc","174":" if i could read faster and didn't need to sleep i could have read this book in one sitting the book opens with a news story about doctor norton perina's arrest for sexually molesting one of his 43 adopted children most of the rest of the tale is perina's autobiography written from his prison cell complete with fussy footnotes by his sycophantic editor dr kubodera the author did an amazing job because i thought the voice of dr perina was completely believable he is a complex compelling and thoroughly creepy character i found out after reading that this was based loosely on the story of dr gajdusek if you like stories with an unreliable narrator you have to read \"we need to talk about kevin\" by lionel shriver","175":"finally got interesting but it still feels like i'm wading through mud to get it finished finished this book but i feel like there is a lot to process some things that drove me crazy about it were the footnotes what is up with novels that have footnotes i find it very distracting and the long hard march to the end the first hundred pages were so horrible that i almost didn't read the rest of the book","176":"one sentence summary a nobel prize winning scientist recounts the story of his life including his discovery of a pacific island where people found the secret to immortality and his eventual arrest and imprisonment for sexual abuse flashlights5 5 this book has one of the most devious twisted and brilliant narrators i've ever encountered norton perina is dislikable from the start and only gets worse but his discovery and the implications of it were beautifully rendered and perfectly realistic would i want to live in this universe yes despite all the horrors of it because it so accurately reflects our world and i believe we can still learn from our mistakes also i'd really like to travel to ivu'ivu favorite characterit's a tie between the inscrutable and tragic u'ivuan guide fa'a and the ethnographer tallent both doomed from the beginning both simply trying to do what they believe is right why this book made my week better1 it proved that you can know everything about the narrative before going into it and still be enthralled 2 it proved that geniuses can also be terrible and that nothing is black and white 3 awesome cover art and that's important when you're reading in the subway reminds me ofsort of like margaret mead's coming of age in samoa but perhaps more closely resembling the yanomami controversy between napoleon chagnon and patrick tierney -- it's like the inverse perspective of that offered by tierney in darkness in el dorado bookdrunkardreviews tumblr com","177":"i really struggled with rating this book in part because of how disturbing i found this novel and in part because i loved parts of it and struggled with others however in the end i think i have to go with 4 stars this book is a pretty wild ride i still can't quite believe that this is a first novel this is such a large story well written and interesting the author does a fantastic job of making the world in this novel come alive the descriptions of place really made me feel like i was there which was fantastic the descriptions were so lush and she was able to make the people and places come alive which is part of the joy of this novel the intersection of science and anthropology in this novel was so well done that i was captivated by both aspects of the novel but quite a bit of this novel is disturbing there are things that are best described as creepy there are sections that made me very uncomfortable and felt icky the novel seems to me to be very much about disturbing the reader with certain aspects which give the reader much to think about and mull over that was at least my experience of the novel the characters in the novel are well drawn and come alive in the pages of the book the characters are multi faceted and well drawn some are drawn so effectively that i'm still a bit taken aback the character development is so well done at times disturbingly well this isn't a book for everyone if you aren't interested in disturbing or creepy aspects of a novel you might want to pass on this one but personally i'm very glad that i read it it definitely gave me a lot to think about","178":"strange not in a good way","179":"intricately written beautiful execution riveting horrible compelling and sickening read this if you like unreliable narrators acute moral questioning and pushing boundaries of comfort do not read this if you dislike animal violence sexual brutality and painful truths about white privilege this is not a pleasurable read but it will probably make you a better person if you read this book i would love to discuss it with you","180":"culture clash a

garden the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the discovery of fire the splitting of the atom test tube genetics information technology what will those humans do next i happen to like the story of man's perilous road to scientific knowledge i would not for a moment dream of seeking to halt it my world view is comprised of what i call optimistic anarchy meaning that i have a slender but sturdy belief that mankind can work out its destiny into eternity but we need such tales of caution as ms yanagihara presents in the people in the trees ann patchett told hers in state of wonder barbara kingsolver tells hers in almost every book she writes margaret atwood's maddaddam trilogy is another example the people in the trees has as its mad scientist norton perina a suitably complex character he goes too far though he wins a nobel prize and his attempts to make amends are foiled by his own troubled nature the author chose to have perina's story told by a worshipful associate a man who is blind to perina's faults and whose certainty that genius trumps even excuses behavioral lapses is clearly stated the brilliant writing in the novel enables us to see through this hagiography actually she creates a double veil for us to peer through since the associate is the transcriber and editor of perina's memoirs not for the squeamish the people in the trees reveals tribal custom jungle living and the scientific method in full living color and detail it raises just about every conceivable question about the fine lines between science and spirituality ceremony and abuse sanity and madness progress and destruction of all the tournament of books contenders this year i found this one the hardest to read in terms of horrific scenes and yet the most rewarding for it provocative nature","181":"one of the best books i have read in a very long time","182":"the people in the trees is a beautifully written and yet disturbing and difficult account of the consequences of one scientist's actions on a remote micronesian island beginning in the 1950s it is told in a memoir style the narrator being the scientist dr norton perina but with a second narrator providing footnotes a dr ronald kubodera one of perina's associates from the outset norton portrays himself as a misogynistic sociopath with zero regard for the feelings and well being of those around him whether they be his mother or the animals he works with in a laboratory he does terrible things to the people in his life well before he sets foot on ivu'ivu and so the reader can only expect the worst when he finally locates a remote civilization as part of an anthropological research team when he figures out that eating the rare opa'ivu'eke turtle is allowing the ivu'ivuans to live unnaturally long lives perina sets off a tragic chain of events that is predictable by anyone who ever paid attention in history class about half way through however i realized that yanagihara was building up to something far worse and yet no less believable hints are dropped methodically and because the books seeks to answer the questions did he or didn't he the author's brilliance becomes fully apparent at the conclusion the end left me thoroughly gutted as i'm sure was yanigahara's intention if you perceive norton as a symbol for white invaders of all types then it all makes perfect painful sense but ultimately no one is without blame the colonialist themes are present but the truth is that the people of u'ivu and ivu'ivu have much to answer for as well yanigahara wants the reader to see that cultures should not be romanticized simply because they are exotic and that power can be a corruptive force anywhere the last quarter of the book drags on somewhat and gets repetitive and while we do get some answers there are many more questions that are never resolved making the book feel simultaneously too long and not long enough however this is a result of the narrative style and is authentic when you consider that the memoir is the work of an old man probably losing his mental clarity this is not a feel good novel but it is a layered and fascinating one just remember to prepare yourself mentally before diving in yanagihara will soothe you with passages about the wonder and beauty and mystery of ivu'ivu so that when a passage suddenly leaves you feeling nauseous it really gets under your skin there's a lot to discuss and analyze about this book but it is not for everyone","183":" this novel is based loosely on the life of an explorer who was thought to have abused a newly discovered group of natives perina joins an anthropological expedition to an unknown island in micronesia with a lost tribe where some people seem to live many many years longer than most but whose minds deteriorate with advanced age is this caused by the turtle they worship and fear the news of his discovery causes pharmaceutical companies to ruin the environment and culture perina tries to make amends but his personal demons emerge and his world falls apart","184":"despite my one star review hanya yanagihara's the people in the trees deserves every five star reviews it gets i can understand why others love it the language is lush the story masterful and the messages haunting the book however left me uncomfortable and i had trouble finishing itthe people in the trees is fiction yet its contents seems so real it's the fictional memoir of a norton perina a fictional nobel laureate who discovered immortality or rather something mimicking it in a forgotten tribe in the fictional micronesian island of ivu'ivu perina is also a convicted child molester as we learn from two fictional associated press clippings before the memoir even begins we also learn that perina's discovery brought doom upon the indigenous way of life in ivu'ivu and the fictional small nation it belongs to perina's memoir written from prison is edited and extensively footnoted by his loyal protege ronald kubodera who makes frequent references to fictional scientific literature both perina and kubodera are fascinating flawed characters perina is unlikeable kubodera is blinded by his reverence of perina this was a book that began bewitching and gradually became profoundly disturbing i was entranced at first and tore through its pages then the book began threatening me with nightmares by the time i was about 80% of the way through the book i no longer wanted to read it the fact that i was so disturbed by the book is testament to author hanya yanagihara's storytelling ability the details weave together so realistically that i could believe everything in the memoir actually happened in fact the story is rooted in real stories most notably the real life nobel laureate and convicted child molester d carleton gajdusek as a review from the new york times states \"'the people in the trees ' is based loosely on this true story with a number of horrifying twists \"for me the horrifying twists on the backdrop of the book's incredible realism were just too horrifying yet i would still recommend this book to others it's a story that echoes our horrifying real world--an intriguing allegorical tale that compels us to ponder perina's actions","185":"i'm about 1 3 finished and though it was off to a slow start the book is starting to pick up the author does a great job writing from a nerdy scientist perspective but this means the narrative is a bit dry i probably would have rated this higher but the main character is so deeply flawed that i just couldn't bring myself to like the book that much bruce chatwin he is not","186":" why did i persist in finishing this horrible horrible message horrible horrible details i'm sure the intent is to create a piece such that any attempt to decry it can be reduced to a lack of courage or desire for all that is neat and tidy but the writer in this case is guilty of the same self aggrandizement and cushioning that his narrator is it should probably be noted that all novels i have read about anthropologists seem to depict field anthropologists as the people with the absolute worst moral constitution","187":"this book has the feel of a chuck palahniuk novel where you're put in the mind of a morally vacant narrator the story struggled to hold my attention at points the pacing left me uninterested in picking the book up over the last week if you could cut 100 pages i would probably add an extra star if you enjoy uncomfortable fiction with disturbing themes i would certainly recommend","188":" you want to talk unlikeable narrators i think this is the worst one i've come across also i don't think the extra scene in the epilogue worked well it wasn't anything i didn't see coming it also was revealed only about 40 pages after where it would have fallen in the narrative so i wasn't going through the entire novel wondering what had gone on kind of pointless also i take issue with the blurb on the back of the novel calling this nabokovian it's derivative of lolita sure but without the masterful use of language it's lolita if humbert were a scientist into boys an average writer at best and completely unwilling to discuss his personal flaws as evidenced by my need to come back and keep adding criticisms to my review i really didn't like this book","189":"4 stars for being well written 2 for being quite possibly one of the weirdest books i've ever read","190":"i need some time to process this one awesome as a first novel so complete yanagihara is so aware of her intention like a sculptor molding an entire world out of a piece of wood or stone","191":"oohh wee mama what a read","192":"ugh i am so sorry that suggested this one for our book club norton is an utterly repugnant narrator who never changes throughout the book i couldn't even enjoy hating him he is just a pathetic excuse for a human being the book was well written but its contents were not interesting or engaging in any way normally i enjoy the unreliable narrator but this was just too much i don't really understand all the praise this book is getting","193":" i finished this book last night and am still trying to process my opinions on it it's beautifully and densely written i'm really impressed that this is the author's first published work the main character is not a very likable person but you come to know him pity him and appreciate him there are some things happening that i find repulsive but yet that's what makes the book so memorable and though i hesitate to use this word compelling this is not your typical novel but if you have an open mind i recommend it","194":" this is such an amazing book i truly hope my book group reads it so i can have i a full on serious hours long talk about it first off the writing is superb second plus this is an ideas book big ideas like medical ethics mortality or lack therof what it means to be human and how far you are willing to push cultural relativism the book is also about sex in fact this may be the most repellently sexual book i have ever read lolita being the other candidate it is not however very graphic where sex is concerned so don't let that put you off it i was making a bit of a game of counting the number of non sex things described in sexual terms most of them on the icky side and i quit at 50 you pretty much know where this story is going finally the other thing i loved about this book was the interesting narrative trick employed i always think of faulkner as the best at the unreliable narrator but this book gives the sound and the fury a run for its money on that front as you could think of the book as layering two unreliable narrators given the footnotes this book is really worth reading","195":" i picked up the people in the trees from the amazon vine program because the pitch made it sound like a magical realism tale about an anthropologist who finds the fountain of youth in the form of a turtle with alarming side effects instead what we get is a a novel written in the form of the prisoner's memoir the anthropologist is self absorbed arrogant and unlikable despite his assistant touting his awesomeness in the beginning i tried to force myself to read this book i acknowledge that it's a feat to write as if you're an anthropologist detailing your life but the disturbing fact that the protagonist is a convicted child molester coupled with the dry prose left me feeling who cares","196":"an interesting story with some pacing issues in the middle the story starts to really drag a bit during norton's first visit to the island and sometimes the story read so much like a memoir non fiction that it got a bit dry but still enjoyable and impressive for a debut","197":" overall really a great read this is definitely storytelling at its best stays with you and makes you think about the book long after finishing which leads me to my question please don't read further if you haven't read the people in the trees and don't want anything spoiled but if you have read it i would appreciate an answer the author hanya yanagihara doesn't seem to have a facebook page or twitter so i can't just ask her here is the question if the dreamers progressed without outside intervention or contact do they eventually become vuanas are the vuanas the people in the trees are the vuanas in the final stage of life for the dreamers i'm dying to know anyone's take on this thanks","198":"i don't even know how many stars to give this it's good but very dark and disturbing i would not be likely to recommend it to everyone i am going with 3","199":" i'm a sucker for unreliable narrators this book has two while not up to the standard of nabakov this is an impressive book all the same i was surprised how long it took for me to read this book since it always seemed to move along at a decent pace there are some disturbing parts but they are not wrought in over the top detail as they were in the wind up bird chronicles but in a matter of fact manner the disturbing parts are still quite disquieting but they aren't graphic with that caveat i highly recommend the people in the trees","200":"i'm torn between 3 and 4 stars the writing was really good and the story was interesting and really kept me reading but i feel like i was expecting more i read too many reviews before i started maybe i was expecting this really twisted disturbing tale but i felt like it just wasn't either of those things i was expecting to be blown away but i wasn't or maybe i have a higher tolerance for twisted and disturbing than some it started slow interesting slow but slow like there was 180 pages of build up before the story really started happening then i was expecting some wholly fucked up twist at the end but it was just more of the same and not surprising in the least plus it's based loosely on a true story so i don't even feel like the story plot was all that innovative to begin with so yeah three stars because it didn't live up to the hype but the writing was great and i would try something else by this author for sure","201":"hough there is an element of white man enters foreign culture and destruction ensues in yanagi remember when \"avatar\" came out 20th century fox 2009 and everyone was all \"it's the same plot as 'dances with wolves ' orion pictures 1990 but with blue aliens \" or for the younger crowd \"it's just like 'ferngully ' 20th century fox 1992 but in outer space \" well hanya yanagihara's debut novel the people in the trees suffers from the same plot redundancy but with a nabokovian twist tthough there is an element of white man enters foreign culture and destruction ensues in yanagihara's novel this impressive new author calls upon literary tradition in the form of nabokov's content and style to beef up the tired conquistador plot therefore the novel begins with a foreword meant to validate the authenticity of dr a norton perina's memoir that follows signed by dr ronald kubodera a friend of perina in the same way nabokov has john ray jr ph d introduce the manuscript of humbert humbert the preface of this particular work both prepares the reader for the lewd nature of the trial around which the plot pivots and acclimates the reader to this loyal editor's affection for perina a devotion which surely blurs the line between what is fact and what is fiction kubodera shares the basics of perina's life with the reader perina is an infamous doctor whose researched the opa'ivu'eke people on the micronesian island of ivu'ivu he documented their secret diet his research could be the key to science's never ending search for immortality research for which he won the nobel prize in 1974 and years later he was imprisoned for what kubodera calls \"accusations of perversity that are easy to sell\" kubodera claims to give us the 'facts ' why then is this notable scientist in prison and why is the ever loyal kubodera so convinced of his innocence furthermore how much should a person's personal life overshadow his lifetime accomplishments perina's memoirs are written vividly descriptively and are yet somehow sterile as if directly out of a doctor's notepad - a delectable pastiche of scientific notes objective observations and naked human passion though the beginning of the memoir is somewhat mundane relating perina's childhood and introduction to performing lab experiments the pace quickens as perina graduates medical school and finds himself on an expedition to the illusive island of ivu'ivu with a team of anthropologists dr paul tallent and his insufferable research assistant esme duff tallent's funding and fame came from 'discovering' a tribe living on the small island of ivu'ivu which is off the coast of u'ivu and its inhabitants are considered barbarians by the mainlanders as anthropologists tallent and duff simply hope to observe and document the lifestyle of these curious natives without disrupting their livelihood though these intentions are clear to perina at the onset of their voyage when he and his crew discover sloth like creatures whom they later identify as exiled ivu'ivu tribe members who live alone in the wilderness eat only the fruit of the land and appear to be decades even centuries older than the other villagers perina can't help but hope that somewhere on this island lays the secret to immortality and he a burgeoning scientist is going to find it perina smuggles meat from one of the sacred opa'ivu'eke turtles back to the states conducts experiments and discovers that yes given one dose of opa'ivu'eke meat in a lifetime lab mice will live up to 300% longer than those without the opa'ivu'eke meat perina quickly publishes his findings which opens a floodgate of researchers doctors and pharmaceutical companies who flee to ivu'ivu in hopes of patenting a miracle drug before another company can when the detrimental effects of the opa'ivu'eke meat loss of speech memory and all else which separates humans from animals come to the attention of the researchers who have ravished the island of ivu'ivu they quickly abandon their posts and leave the islanders devastated the island bare of its natural resources and the sacred pool of opa'ivu'eke turtles nearly empty perina can't help but blame his ambitious naivete for the island's demise and as a kind of penance for his part in the island's wretched state he begins adopting children from the island tens dozens so many that he doesn't even know all their names but he has the means and temperament to raise them in his comfortable victorian home and so he does though he offers them more than they would ever receive on the island of u'ivu and though many of the children he raised go on to finish college and begin families and careers of their own after many years one child accuses perina of sexual abuse perina in his sixties is arrested and life as he knows it ends the children are taken from his care and he is sentenced to time in prison when he is released his reputation his colleagues even his own brother have forsaken him dr a norton perina once a nobel prize winning scientist is left with nothing at least this is the pitiable picture perina's close friend dr kobudera offers us perina was a young doctor who tried to do the right thing loved his work and his children and was a victim of one child's ungratefulness exacerbated by society's desire to see a great man fall does it matter to you if the accusation is true would this misguided attempt to connect with another human being discredit perina's contributions to science would it negate the good he did in bringing the orphaned children to america will you be able to see dr a norton perina through kubodera's devoted lens after reading the story of his life one thing's for certain you will not be able to put this book down until you've gotten to the bottom of it","202":"this story is what i like to call anthropological speculative fiction similar to ann patchett's state of wonder scientists exploring primitive civilizations","203":" the meat of a very rare turtle called opa'ivu'eke which can only be found on the fictional south pacific island of ivu'ivu becomes the catalyst of immortality in hanya yanagihara's powerhouse debut novel the people in the trees apparently yanagihara an editor at large at conde nast traveler has spent much of the last two decades at work completing this tale of a nobel laureate who discovers more about the customs of a certain undiscovered tribe than he bargains for in fact her main protagonist dr norton perina is based on real life nobelist d carleton gajdusek the text is presented technically as perina's memoir autobiography written from his prison cell it is prefaced edited and footnoted by dr ronald kubodera his good friend and colleague through this format we are treated to classic unreliable narration but this time with a nabokovian twist the addition of an unreliable editor the veracity of whose explanatory footnotes and editorial intrusion comes into question as well who do we believe it's just this sort of ambiguity which distinguishes this work from what some might consider pandering pulp from the beginning the titanic theme of immortality pervades yanagihara's story but it soon becomes apparent that what she means to convey to her readers is something more complex at the start of his career in medical research dr perina seizes on the opportunity to leave the boredom of laboratory mice behind to join the eminent anthropologist paul tallent and his assistant esme duff on an excursion to the remote south pacific islands of u'ivu a fictional location based according to the author on the hawaiian islands where their ultimate destination is the forbidden island of ivu'ivu once there they discover a singular specimen of human female a feral speechless being whom they quickly dub eve eve's discovery is just the first of a series of revelations they uncover concerning the aberrant rituals not the least of which involves the opa'ivu'eke of the only indigenous tribe on the island a tribe they have befriended and of whose village they now respectfully camp at the perimeter as the mystery unfolds for the three scientists even as it seems a foregone conclusion to the reader jealousy sprays its fetid odor over their camp perina as if in consolation channels his energy into one purpose to obtain the flesh of the enchanted turtle for use in experimentation back in the states but it is not the obvious draw immortality which tantalizes the doctor sustained life proves to be more of a curse than a blessing it's the discovery of the condition which he calls selene syndrome a degenerative disease which retards the bodies aging process but not the brain's caused by the ingestion of the opa'ivu'eke it is in fact perina's corrupt act of removing the indigenous species from its sacred ground which precipitates the series of events that will not only decimate the lives of the u'ivuans but also poison the nobelist dooming him to a predatory and unfulfilled life ms yanigihara has taken a big risk with this debut work but it is evident she has dedicated much of her careful time and energy to it although many readers may become offended because of some of its subject matter it is a book that is starkly honest true to its form and authentic in its divergence that is considerably more than you can expect from a novice writer of fiction","204":"bizarre not at all my cup of tea","205":"i found the premise to be more interesting than the actual book","206":"the writing is excellent the way yanagihara arranged the book the newspaper snippets in the beginning the footnotes that interject ronald's voice into norton's memoir the omitted entry was brilliant i take away one star only for this lingering creepy feeling i'm left with i will have nightmares tonight many passages throughout the novel caused me to have to take a break and steel myself before continuing some things written in this book i wish i had never read i admire that the author did not shy away from writing a disturbing book she could have watered it down but norton was a monster and she gave us the full brunt of it","207":"not recommended for all like reading the first person narrative of a psychopath","208":"loved it the author truly amazed me with her ability to write as two people through memoir and footnotes and to weave a story of anthropology science and loneliness a great read that captivated me and kept me binge reading the last 200 pages","209":"kobobooksreviewed by the independent 21 dec 2013 the guardian 10 jan 2014","210":" this is a book that draws you into its world while making you recoil from its protagonist right off the bat you know that the subject of this fictional memoir a norton perina loosely based on d carleton gadjusek is an unreliable narrator the reader is informed in the opening pages that perina is a convicted child molester if that didn't make him unlikable enough he's also an arrogant self serving chauvinistic racist egomaniac to add another layer to this story perina's memoir is edited and presented to us by an unapologetic fanboy--a colleague and close friend ronald kubodera kubodera is an all too familiar figure in the rape culture we live in to him perina's achievements outweigh any crimes he commits rape--even that of a child--just isn't a big deal because the man has produced such great work so imagine my surprise and dismay when--after despising perina throughout the book--i actually doubted his guilt for a split second this is how well yanagihara pulled me into the story it starts out slowly but once norton reaches u'ivu the lush details of the mythology and geography of the islands is so convincing that there were moments when i almost thought u'ivu was a real place that it could be plausible there once was a species of turtle that could grant a sort of immortality when consumed that an awfully unlikable man may not have done this one particular horrible thing it shows how easily we can be manipulated even when we're aware of the manipulation taking place 'the people in the trees' might be compared to 'lolita' in that they're both narratives of pedophiles but this is a lighter read for the most part focusing much more on the adventures of exploring an isolated country and discovering a disease while the language isn't as beautiful as nabokov's it's well written and the imagery is so lovely that the tiny flaws i did find were quickly forgotten the book touches on a lot of serious topics without delving too deeply neo colonialism white privilege medical ethics sexual repression cultural relativism rape apologism etc addressing them more thoroughly in the book would've rang false considering who the narrators are and i think yanagihara has done a good job in introducing these issues just enough to leave the reader to consider them","211":"i enjoyed this book very much but the surprise ending was unnecessary and unsurprising","212":"based on a true story this novel presents the consequences of unchecked exotic medical research and its disturbing maniacal hero gone rampant the ending gave me chills an eye opening read","213":" i was so upset by and unable to put down this book the narrator's story telling is completely formed of a convincing voice and horrible to the core even after knowing what was going to happen as told in the book's meta intro the tragic and unbearably painful story unfolds in an overwhelming way the footnotes add complexity to the narration stripping away any sense of a single person's timeframe and making it seem like too many people are damaged beyond repair hurt way beyond too many times abused through too many generations this books is exactly what you think it is once you begin reading it and is also nothing like what you thought it was recommended for readers who like kazuo ishiguro's works like never let me go and the remains of the day because of the narrator's observational clarity and obliviousness however this work features first person callousness too for that reason it's also recommended for people who want to like joseph conrad's heart of darkness but never quite found the evil inside the journey yahagihara's work presents the evil inside the journey the wincing darkness of an individual as told in a narrator's voice that is too easy to read and too gut wrenching to pull away from bonus points for the cover art becoming more disgusting the further along i got into the story worms exploding out from a falling fruit are such a yucky metaphor for a this obliterating story","214":"the audio was excellent u0026amp i enjoyed listening to the book but this story was not what i expected i had been looking forward to a story with focus on the discovery immortality u0026amp the consequences of it before reading the ending i would have given this book 4 stars since i thought it was really well done now i feel like the ending has overshadowed everything i just read i'm just disgusted with the character and his vagueness about the situation throughout http en wikipedia org wiki daniel_c","215":"i don't even know how to rate or review this the writing was compelling and brilliant the protagonist perfectly inhabited as a narrative about destruction of innocence and abuse of power it succeeded as something i'd recommend to anyone else nope i'm still harrowed disturbed and disgusted by it which was completely its intent","216":"an original thought provoking prickly poetic and beautifully written book about a misanthropic scientist norton perina who joins an anthropological study to a remote island in the south pacific he's eager to make his mark on the scientific world and unethically takes advantage of his situation to promote the discovery of a turtle that gives people physical immortality but neglects to maintain mental function so basically the immortals turn into vegetables as a result of his publicity the island is stripped of it's isolation vegetation immortal turtle meat and innocence norton was enamored of the anthropologist who took him to the island in turn norton is worshipped by another scientist who tells the story along with footnotes that describe fictional academic references within the story this is a story of cultural perception and how we make meaning of our lives norton is a social outlier and not only does he take magical turtle meat from the island he also adopts scores of children and raises them in his home in the us as a single dad he adopts the sexual practices of the island which are illegal immoral and predatory and winds up in jail while these sexual events are an integral part of the story they are not graphical but they deserve a trigger alert","217":"i was initially very intrigued by this book however the more i got into it the more bored i was and the longer it took me to finish it i didn't like any of the characters except for a few of the guides on the island tallent esme norton and most other main characters were insufferable the ending was also highly disappointing i read through the entire book hoping that the thing norton was accused for in the beginning wasn't true not so additionally the book was fiction but written as non fiction which personally made it less enjoyable this book had potential unfortunately i think it fell a bit short","218":"did remind me of anne padgett's latest book state of wonder simply because of the setting this is one of those books that makes you think even though you actually don't find the book very satisfying because of its bizarre subject matter","219":"i am amazed by this story the author is a first rate story teller it made me uncomfortable several times but i kept at it and have to say again hanya is one terrific story teller i would not however recommend this book to everyone i meet but that can be said about any book","220":"unique concept tragic and a touch pathetic good writing but i'm glad it's over","221":"enthralling totally disturbing and believable a great read a bit slow in the beginning but the rest of the book was somewhat mesmerizing for me after i finished i had to go back and re read the beginning excellent debut novel the discovery and subsequent destruction of this hidden village is so realistic it almost felt like it really happened i'm looking forward to this author's next book","222":"there is a french horror movie called martyrs that reminds me a lot of this book not in actual events or anything but solely based on emotions the film is about a young girl who was tortured by a family for years and then escaped one day she sees a picture of them in a newspaper and goes to their family home and kills the entire family then shoots herself her friend is shocked and somewhat dubious that this family could have done such a thing did they really how could they they seem like a normal happy family there is a feeling of horror yes because you realize that this girl just killed the entire family for no reason at all and then her friend finds the secret door leading to the basement and suddenly you are instead filled with a dread so heavy that it almost makes you dizzy i felt this exact same way during the people in the trees i had heard about its controversy and was prepared i thought for the feelings i might feel but those last few pages of the book are so heartbreaking on so many levels which is interesting seeing as i hated the main character and his stupid 'friend' who narrates a good portion of things a lot even still i so wanted it all to be some kind of weird misunderstanding who wouldn't this one will stay with you for a long long time","223":"i don't know how to even respond to this book yanagihara meticulously creates an entire culture and place but her narrator is so repulsive and awful and inhuman that it's not really a book you can enjoy","224":"did not grab me at all when i was still not interested at 25% i decided it was time to move on","225":"well written but very disturbing","226":"i hated this book so much that i couldn't finish it it had potential because of the fantasy about eating turtles making one live forever but mostly i felt like the base story was just creepy the old demented people were creepy the elders having sex with children was creepy i couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel on this book and gave up","227":" i admit that i've been wanting to read this book only because the cover art is so appealing it turned out to be a fascinating brutal and impressive book it should be 5 stars but i just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars and i feel confident anyone that has read this book will know why it is so very hard to separate my feelings for the quality of the writing from my absolute loathing of the main character like many other reviewers i think that this story would do very well with the right kind of book group however proceed with caution as it could be traumatic for some readers","228":"disturbing story with no characters i found likable and a narrator who was reprehensible the point apparently is that science does harm even as it does good","229":"i can't really say that i finished this book i got to page 97 and realized there just isn't enough time to spend reading a bad story i never got into it i tried but i really didn't like the writing style a convicted child abusers memoir written in the first person waste of my time if you read it i hope you enjoy it next","230":"extremely disturbing fascinating book spoiler alert http www nytimes com 2013 09 29 boo","231":"i couldn't get into this book for some reason i was up to page 100 and then had to decide if i wanted to slog thru the rest of it an additional 250 pages and the answer was no end of story","232":"with the high ratings and reviews maybe i expected more or something different then it was not a bad read really just not what i hoped for","233":"an amazingly inventive intricately detailed masterfully constructed work of storytelling","234":" this book has such great elements an interesting plot complex characters well written but it all just fizzles out about 3 4 of the way through and i found myself regretting that i'd read it at all mysteries and inconsistencies in the plot that i expected to be solved were not the main character who is basically an arrogant and pathetic man has no epiphany receives no karmic price and in the end is mostly rewarded for his hubris my advice don't bother with this book all its promise withers away it makes me wonder why this writer didn't have better editing advice and why someone didn't tell him or her that part of basic good storytelling is planning an ending that fits the rest of the work","235":"couldn't put it down had a love hate relationship with this book","236":"this is a book that shook me to the core parts of it are about anthropology and cultural relativism and other parts are about morality and pedophilia in many ways it is not an easy book to read however it is well worth the effort and the writing is near brilliant in scope and ability hanya yanagihhara is a born writer and this her debut novel puts her on the map of new literary fiction authors to watch closely the novel starts off with a press release about dr abraham norton perina a nobel laureate who has been arrested for sexual abuse of a minor on more than one count perina maintains his innocence he is renowned for his identification of selene syndrome a condition that retards aging the condition in which the victim's body remains preserved in relative youth even as his mind degrades was found among the opa'ivu'eke people of ivu'ivu one of the three islands of the micronesian country of u'ivu this condition is caused by the consumption of a turtle called opa'ivu'eke a god to the ivu'ivu people people consuming this turtle can live for centuries but they become mo'okua'ans or dreamers as they grow very old and demented perina is found guilty and given a sentence of 24 months one i felt was rather light for the crimes the story takes us from perina's youth at harvard where he was less than a stellar student to his advancement to medical school he is assigned to an anthropological investigation on u'ivu with a dr tallent an anthropologist perina serves as the medical officer for this trip the novel takes us to the three islands of u'ivu focusing on the time spent on ivu'ivu where perina makes his discoveries he finds a lost tribe of people mo'okua'ans dreamers who live long lives sometimes over two hundred years but are severely compromised cognitively and neurologically the usual lifespan for an u'ivan is less than 60 in fact if one of them reaches sixty years old there is a big celebration perina finds out that the turtle indigenous to the island is thought of as a god and that consumption of this turtle's meat causes the longevity of the dreamers he finds out where the turtles are located and kills one managing to sneak some turtle meat off the island he also takes two mo'okua'ans dreamers back to his lab at stanford there he studies the people and gives the turtle meat to mice the mice who consume the turtle meat live a long time but suffer from dementia and neurological deficits these studies lead to the identification of selene syndrome for which perina gets the nobel prize along with his fascination with ivu'ivu people perina has an obsession with adopting children from u'iva all told he adopts 43 children over more than three decades he raises them sends them to college and treats them like his own when he can remember their names what causes him to adopt so many children is unknown even to him at one point he describes it as a personal tic because towards the end of the adoption process he is not happy raising children and has one child who is particularly difficult the story is told by ronald kubodera to whom perina writes while he is in prison kubodera edits perina's writing and this becomes the novel how reliable is each narrator and what should the reader believe or doubt parts of the novel are a wonderful anthropological adventure with the study of different cultures never before written about other parts of the story deal with reprehensible moral acts that are difficult to read about but are integral to the story i worked as a psychotherapist for many years and never had children in my practice because stories of abuse are very difficult for me to process for that reason i found this book very difficult to read however personal reasons aside this is a marvelous novel filled to the brim with information character studies and psychological mystique i highly recommend this book but be prepared to travel outside your comfort zone on many occasions","237":"i loved the first part of this book the story and the descriptions were really imaginative and fun to read it was about scientists exploring an island where a 'hidden' tribe of indigenous people lived sadly the second part was so disturbing and depressing that it ruined the book for me so i can't say i would recommend it","238":"creepy and brilliant i can't recommend this book to a single friend due to the difficult nature of the subject matter i am impressed i could not stop reading once i started","239":" you quickly come to loathe the narrator of this skillfully written novel as he is corrupt vain and without scruples he continues throughout the book to justify his actions which makes this a great read starting in the 1950's the story is about a man who goes into medicine without any of the desires to help his fellow man and then becomes a part of a research team in a remote micronesian island his team discovers a group of island inhabitants who apparently live for perhaps hundreds of years without giving anything away this story details the life of this man as he goes on to fame and glory but then eventually into ruin the ending was both expected and shocking to hear him describe his actions over the years great read i will expect further good stuff from this young author","240":"i found the first 1 3 of this book a bit slow once the book moves to the new locale it becomes a fast paced great read definitely recommended for it's great premise of longevity and greed","241":"3 5 starsa dark book and ambitious book the most horrific traits of mankind are explored in this story of a young brilliant scientist who uncovers the secret to immortality i enjoy the majority of the story however there were sections that were weak and a little hard to believe regardless the story was captivating and i would recommend to other readers","242":"this was a toughie definitely propels one forward but sometimes i'm just not down with the unlikeable first person narrators especially since in this case it's not like i'm not particularly tortured with the great questions the book jacket would like me to be basically f'ed up unpleasant smart person who makes a very important discovery i read that it was based on a real person which is fine and all but i just don't feel like i got anything out of this not clear to me what it is i was supposed to receive so low marks","243":"you hope you enter as an immersion and after a certain point it becomes getting out of it as an exorcismhttp www publishersweekly com pw by","244":"very well written i kept thinking i was reading an actual biography the story spans a lifetime and reminded me a little of shantaram in it's scope and in the way cultures clash norton is a very complicated character and is as easily admired as he is repulsive love is a dark and complicated thing in this book and the undercurrent of violence is always present both in the lab and on the isolated micronesian island at it's root this story is deeply tragic and a very real and unromantic view of the scientific community colonialism corporate greed and child abuse it is also a great adventure and celebrates the inquiring exploring mind it's not a light read but it's very satisfying if you're willing to explore the dark nature of humanity","245":"i have never read a book like the people in the trees except maybe lolita the reader gets drawn deeply into the moral relativism of the first person narrator a racist misogynist pedophile and acclaimed scientist creepy intriguing and beautifully written the people in the trees tells the unique and interesting story of a micronesian tribe discovered to contain the secret to immortality there is a lot going on in this book the island world has elements of magical realism and the collision of two societies offers plenty of post colonial commentary you will end this read with a lot of questions and a great perspective of a time period when anthropologists were out in the field making first contact with unknown people review published on the denver public library website","246":"fantastic highly recommended","247":" okay this book is seriously disturbing but also thought provoking the narrators both are so unlikeable and untrustworthy that you get led astray in your thinking it took a long time to get to the narrative and i'm not sure what value the backstory of the narrator's early life had to the main story however once they hit the island it is bizarrely compelling to read about despite the irritating footnotes the premise the fictional islanders and the scientific descriptions are fascinating however the book dragged badly once the narrator had returned to the us and the descriptions of research and his adoptions could have been much more heavily and effectively edited the story hook has you turning the page to find out if it is true and what the real story is even if you had to skim quite a bit to keep with it and the end is truly horrifying and while not totally surprising kind of makes you do a sixth sense rethink of much of the book the story idea of the immortal islanders would have been enough so that i almost could have preferred to avoid the child sexuality topic but it would not have been as powerful without it all in all i gave the book a 3 star because while i didn't always enjoy reading it it ended up being a book i thought a lot about and it was well crafted","248":" a creepy anthropological novel about a young doctor in the 1950s who goes to a remote micronesian island and discovers the secret of immortality the book is told as his memoir introduced and edited by his old friend the doctor and this is on the first page of the book so i don't believe it's a spoiler is on trial for the sexual abuse of one or more of the many children he adopted from the island this book is an interesting story about anthropology and uncontacted peoples narrated by someone creepy who is deliberately presenting his actions in the best light the details of the jungle and the people he encounters are unsettling in a way that isn't supernatural just disturbing like a squishy pink jungle fruit that appears somehow alive because it's filled with writhing grubs prized as a food source","249":" oh man this book i don't know whether to give it five stars or one can you love a book while despising its main character and hating almost everything that happens if so this might be the book for you if you're looking for a lighthearted happy read run screaming in the other direction if you want to think really hard about big questions this book will help you do it what damage is done when westerners discover a truly untouched new group of people and is it inevitable what price must be paid for the promise of extreme longevity is a cultural rite morally reprehensible universally or does the line move depending on the context should you be given any leeway for rescuing a child from desperate circumstances and providing them a materially comfortable life what are the responsibilities of researchers and do they vary by discipline i could go on and on this book is not for the faint of heart and i almost abandoned it several times but ultimately gave it five stars just because it really forced me to go deep particularly the anthropological questions and i won't soon forget it","250":"with some time to process my emotions it turns out that i really liked this book enjoyed maybe not but it is a really great work of fiction that is going on my to be read again someday pile read more","251":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here another book i debated what to rate and another good book that i felt got derailed towards the end it was a fascinating journey though about ethics about the scientific community and their lack of respect about crossing the line between discovery and profit the basic premise is that of an anthropologist following what could have been an old wives tale and discovering a people no one had ever encountered a trained doctor among the party discovers that the people live abnormally long and t another book i debated what to rate and another good book that i felt got derailed towards the end it was a fascinating journey though about ethics about the scientific community and their lack of respect about crossing the line between discovery and profit the basic premise is that of an anthropologist following what could have been an old wives tale and discovering a people no one had ever encountered a trained doctor among the party discovers that the people live abnormally long and the secret to this seeming immortality happens to be the meat of a turtle only found in that habitat the discovery is made public the doctor wins the nobel the pharma companies go apeshit and descend and trample on everything the island has to offer writing like an editor to a memoir yanagihara makes a fantastic case in documenting this indigenous micronesian people it's almost equivalent to reading a gripping piece of non fiction especially in that it gives no answers the longevity is discovered to be a disease which leads to the degeneration of the brain but not the body to which no cure can be found because the turtles are all gone by the time anything can realistically be studied the anthropologist who had started his quest for a new people vanishes into thin air and hide nor hair can be found of him this is all very well done as well as the description of the society the quirks the cultural relativism of people purporting to be scientists had the book been just this it would have been fascinating however and as other reviewers unhappy with the book have noted the memoir such as it is is written by a perina who is in prison locked up there for two counts of rape against one of the forty or so children he chose to adopt the child was a minor perina whose pedophilia the author skirts till the very end is definitely an ambiguous character he's selfish he's arrogant he's a genius and in some cases shows genuine empathy and then there is his pedophilia but it's not that that bothered me i can handle the idea that the main character is horribly flawed but it is the direction the book took about 85% into the story suddenly there are children and suddenly there is the one child he is said to have raped it had as far as i'm concerned nothing to do with the people of i'vui'vu the disease they had and the turtle they consumed the sociology and the science which was the focus of the rest of the book it jumped so abruptly from the professional to the personal the change was jarring i can't explain it any better than that but i wish the book had just concentrated on the people in the trees they were more interesting in any case 3 stars more","252":"i can't tell if this book was excellently crafted or if it was actually just terrible the story line is interesting but the main character is reprehensible throughout the narrative in spite of any truth about the accusations against him furthermore the editor narrator kubodera has a creepy adoration of him that left me feeling uncomfortable i honestly can't tell if the author created norton perina to be a complex character who you both like and revile or if he meant be telling a story from a terrible person's point of view if it is the latter great job if it is the former i'm not buying it","253":"the book started out very slowly for me i got bogged down in the tedious boredom of norton's growing up years in fact this book almost seemed like two separate stories intertwined there was the story of norton's life and the story of the opa'ivu'eke and the ivu'ivuans the latter i really enjoyed the other not so much the author does a really tremendous job with the book however because she takes a boorish dysfunctional individual and weaves a very interesting tale out of his life the writing style with all of the footnotes and references makes it seem like one is reading an auto biography it is so done so meticulously that i would forget and slip into thinking that it was fact my favorite parts were the trips into the jungle the author's descriptions of the flora and fauna were wonderful and i felt transported along with the characters she made me want to see the beauty and smell the flowers","254":"another recommendation from the tournament of books i may just use this list to choose all my books a dark self portrait of a sociopath brilliant","255":"i don't know how to rate this one it certainly made me think and was gripping especially in the second half but somehow rating it high feels like condoning the behavior","256":"the people in the trees is the fictional memoir of a norton perina a renowned scientist and train wreck of a man who manages to be both extremely unlikable and compelling in telling his story there is quite a lot i don't like about this book which i'll get to later but almost none of it is due to the way it's written perina's voice is clear and well developed but because it's also racist sexist and misanthropic after a while it's more tiring than anything perina's attitude towards his colleagues his research subjects his brother even his children is obnoxiously derisive and dismissive his constant disdain for the people and things around him often unreasonable and always detailed explicitly reminds me a little of holden caulfield but not in any of the ways that make the catcher in the rye's narrator a good character ostensibly the people in the trees is about the fallout caused by perina's discovery of immortality among a remote micronesian society the time perina spends on ivu'ivu unraveling the mystery of the dreamers is interesting enough that i didn't mind the narrator's exasperating narcissism the inevitable decline of the island and the fate of the dreamers is emotional though only briefly detailed this part of the book is probably eighty percent of the reason i'm giving it three stars after perina's discoveries on the island force it into the western world's spotlight the book moves away from ivu'ivu the dreamers and their immortality the themes of discovery and scientific ethics are abandoned but the theme of moral ambiguity remains yanagihara explores the idea a little bit with the a'ina'ina ceremony on the island and in that context it's thought provoking and basically anthropological in nature in the interest of not giving away spoilers i'm not going to do into much detail but the moral ambiguity in questions concerns perina allegedly raping at least one of his 43 children both perina and his friend kubodera who narrates the introduction and epilogue are extremely lax about the issue even trying to pass it off as okay kubodera especially remarking that whether or not perina is guilty shouldn't matter because of his contributions to science and even going so far as to propose that perina raping his son was an act of pure untainted love perina himself is unapologetic and even acts as if he's the one who's being victimized honestly it just gets sickening towards the end exploring the idea of moral relativism with the ivu'ivuan culture was provocative and poignant but yanagihara takes the idea much much too far most people like me would probably pick up the people in the trees expecting an adventure story complete with science a mysterious disease an unkown people and terrible consqeuences but instead they'll find the rather ugly and disquieting confessions of perina the people in the trees is engaging mostly because of its portrayal of the lives perina ruins or damages whether they're his children's the ivu'ivuans' or the dreamers' the only people i would feel comfortable recommending this book to would be budding anthropologists and psychologists and i strongly urge anyone who reads this book to make sure they know what they're getting into","257":" part borges part nabokov part conrad--a faux autobiography of a medical investigator who helps to discover a tribe whose elders consume turtle meat and gain a limited and diseased immortality the narration and editing of the autobiography are exceptionally well done the fictional tribe at the center of the story is plausible as is the tribe's exploitation and decline at the hands of a rapacious western science the character of norton the investigator is like nabokov's hh memorable in his brilliance and in his loathsomeness view spoiler like hh norton is also a pedophile a serial pedophile in fact but unlike lolita in which the subject of pedophilia is approached gently for lack of a better word in the people in the trees the subject is grossly and graphically represented this is done in a sudden and i think unfair way to the reader as a postscript in which a child's rape is detailed over a couple of pages something i had no desire whatsoever to read until that point whether norton was a pedophile as accused was somewhat up in the air and i think that uncertainty was a much more interesting and satisfying ending rather than a rape scene that served no real purpose other than as a tired complement to the fictional tribe's ritual sodomizing of boys with the question perhaps being the supposed collapse of universal morality and reader assumptions in the face of cultural relativism a boring and sophomoric question hide spoiler in short the book is excellent but unnecessarily grotesque some readers may not be quite as reactive as i am to fictional accounts of abuse of children women and animals and there are many sad lab animals in the book so how grotesque the book might be to others i can't really judge edit despite the repulsive ending i can't shake off the brilliance and beauty of this book so i'm upping my rating to five stars i also voted for it for a goodreads award","258":" this book has a story within a story from my perspective first there's the story of a group of scientists who discover a tribe of people with unusual longevity and how one of the scientists tries to discover how the long life is possible then there's also the story of that same scientist and his conflicted personal life i found myself experiencing quite a range of emotions about the protagonist and i think that's the author's intent the story is intriguing when one considers whether the protagonist could have made better choices in his life","259":"i have no idea how i feel about this book","260":" a fascinating premise using speculative anthropology much in the way that state of wonder does this book takes a more scientific approach though telling the story from the point of view of the scientist who made the discovery the book is made up of his memoirs that he writes from a jail cell arranged and footnoted by an old colleague who exercises his own discretion regarding what sections of the story to include part of the wonder of the book is understanding the relationship between the two scientists the protagonist and narrator is unlikable at his best and yet his voice is strong and keeps the reader interesting the book is a little slow to start however once the story picked up i had a hard time putting it down but until that point which was about 100 pages in my mind kept wandering","261":"i received this book as part of a goodreads promotion and given that i am very glad that i did i don't necessarily want to summarized the book because it a pretty heafty read which i have no problem with but i will admit that my reading muscles are a bit weak as i have gotten used to novellas short reads that sort of thing there is a lot in the story to keep the reader engaged as a writer i certainly commend the structure the creation of realistic believable characters and the nice little twist and turns of the story structure i will give away that it begins at the end a technique that is common but we must as writers do our best to make everything to that point interesting and surprising i use the example of anikan skywalker in the respect that we know he's darth vader but we have to sit through 3 awful movies to find out how he got that way once again i'm only using that example because it's a similar implementation of that technique to yanagihara's credit the technique was used a million times better and was successful in telling a wonderful story i strongly recommend the book and look forward to future titles from yanagihara","262":"not needing to be disabused of any notion that i may live more than the average lifetime i am happy to say i have reached the age where i'm totally comfortable saying that i'd rather have the hours back that i spent on reading this than trying to convince myself that absorbing a story about a child rapist was a challenging outlet for my intellectual growth or a worthwhile experience for me in any other respect","263":"a cerebral exploration of morality and cultural relativism","264":"a very eclectic collection of shorts written in a very refreshing style very enjoyable","265":"the people in the trees is one of the most powerful novels that i have read in years superficially it is the tale of a scientist who discovers a micronesian civilization where some members live for centuries by consuming a turtle endemic to their island the scientist is later incarcerated for molesting one of his adopted children however just below the surface lies the true story a blistering critique of how the civilized west interacts with a developing nation that possesses a unique and invaluable natural resource","266":"terrific read if you enjoyed ann patchetts' state of wonder you will like this one beautifully narrated captivating from the beginning straight to the end","267":"this is first off a very entertaining story that sets up the situation and then embarks on the back story through a pseudo memoir complete with footnotes because it is fictional and well written it reads very smoothly this is a book about culture clashes but more so than that ethics really lies at the heart of the story as well as an individualized 'manifest destiny ' norton makes a discovery about human longevity that results in a nobel prize he withholds some vital information that makes it a double edged sword to pursuit his own advancement achievement strangely this unlikeable character adopts many children over the years from the remote island at best this may arise from a sense of guilt over what he's set in motion or simply it's just an attempt at connection granted norton is a strange bird who's ambition eclipses any human interaction still there are those rare relationships he seems to crave that expose his human side this is an impressive first novel i rate this at 4 stars simply for the desire to have more questions answered since it is a fictional work tallent remains a character of mystery and i would have loved to seen more resolution there inside of primarily being used as a plot device","268":"although the narrator is unconvincing the plot begs the pages to keep turning a novel that is frustratingly coy in what it alternately conceals and reveals","269":"i simultaneously wanted to give this book one star because it is so disturbing and so vile and five stars because that is also what its purpose was i'm going to have to think about this book a little more","270":"4 5 stars review to follow","271":"straight up gutted unbelievable writing and an unbelievable ability to keep me reading even as the characters become more and more flawed and dark the last few pages shocked and disturbed me but were so powerful and profound that it felt like that was the only way it could end it's not for the faint of heart a lot of difficult and potentially triggering moments but a really deep and complex look into human thought action and reaction amazing narrative voices and gorgeous descriptions highly recommend","272":" hanya yanagihara's the people in the trees reads so much like a non fiction memoir that it's difficult to review it as a story the themes of the book--the conflict between anthropology and science the destruction of indigenous culture the impact of media on scientific investigation and finally childhood sexuality and pedophilia--are bravely explored through the very believable voice of dr norton perina during the second half of the twentieth century but the story aside from his recounting of his adult life up until his release from prison at age 73 seems to hang on two questions that are answered in the preface will norton discover an actual way of extending human life to ages in excess of several centuries and will he be found guilty of the sexual assault of a minor while trees reads like a heroic adventure since dr perina sees his life in that light the novel's punch lies in the irony of stasis in isolation anthropology and science both fail to adequately deal with the clash of cultures without popular support science doesn't go very far with it science is often expropriated or manipulated for interests that wind up being destructive it is not just possible but probable that people who are smart and generous about some things can be foolish and criminal about others this was an intriguing read an exceptional example of how prose from a learned voice can be both beautiful and moving","273":"am i the only one who was bored to tears with the first half of the book could not finish the thing","274":"between 2 5 and 3 stars might change my mind after book club discussion","275":" i literally just finished reading i don't really know what to say maybe that's what's good about the people in the trees i feel like my mind is working so hard to come up with something what i think or feel about this book and i just can't decide the writing is exquisite most of the time i forgot i was reading a work of fiction and was quite convinced i was reading a true auto biography this is also though what makes the book slow and hard to push through at times i had to give it 3 stars because to me a 5 star book is one you can't put down that you're always thinking of and almost living in until it's finished this book was not that way many times it felt more like a task than a pleasure to read i do however recommend reading it it's a view into a mind frame i had never considered it's alarmingly realistic and leaves me feeling a little sheltered actually while i did not care for the way some of the book made me feel or some of the images i was forced to imagine i am glad i read the book i feel like i've learned a sliver more about humanity","276":"this book was immensely readable but was chilling and disturbing i couldn't stop talking about it when i was reading it but needed a palate cleanser immediately following it","277":" this is a very creepy but compelling read \"the people in the trees \" is inspired by a true story of a nobel prize winner who had discovered a fatal disease of a remote tribe of island people but then later was convicted of sexually abusing some of the island children he had adopted this story is similarly creepy written as a memoir by the fictional scientist dr norton perina it tells his story from the height of scientific greatness resulting from his unethical actions to the resulting scandal s the story is so well written and the reader is quite drawn in to the story despite the amoral central character there is little to like about dr perina who seems likely to be a sociopath he is part of a research project that seeks out a primitive ivu'ivuan tribe and then discovers a group of forest dwellers called \"the dreamers\" who live for hundreds of years while suffering progressive brain deterioration these dreamers derive this amazing longevity from their consumption of the meat of a sacred giant turtle the rest of the research team studies the people and their daily habits from afar as anthropological research subjects but dr perina immediately sees the potential rewards for discovering the much sought secret of long life he kills one of the sacred turtles to take samples back to the lab and kidnaps some of the dreamer people and takes them back to his lab to study as lab rats this cruel act leads as expected to fame and to his ruin as well as the ruin of the island the novel examines ideas of colonization and anthropological bias and condescension as well as ecological disruption and exploitation of native cultures and environments in the name of progress and science the story is bleak but well told despite the i don't think this is really a spoiler lack of a happy ending or redemption of any kind","278":" actually closer to 2 5 stars than 3 this book had its moments with some great writing but there were way too many holes in it for me and i didn't particularly like the story outside of the 'adventure' story of the 'lost tribe' and their longevity of norton perina a totally self centered person who is ostensibly some kind of scientific genius though nothing i read about him in the book required genius of any kind i found the science parts of the book weak and unconvincing his genius leads him to an experiment with mice where he makes use of a control group and feeds the others some native meat from the island of the lost tribe i'm a financial industry professional and even i know enough about science to have come up with that pretty disappointing read i'll be curious to hear what others in my reading group think about it when we meet to discuss","279":"very unexpected ending","280":"easily one of the best books i've read this year an imprisoned physician dictates his fictional memoir to his fanatically devoted colleague recounting the publication of his research on a micronesian turtle whose flesh grants physical immortality to those who ingest it at the cost of progressive mental deterioration the ease in which this story portrays arrogant violence and instinctive cruelty provides a fresh perspective on human nature and how we perceive life in and of itself","281":"spoilerishi would really like to give this book like a 4 5 i've been thinking about it for a day and i can't decide how i feel about it i think that the writing is fantastic i love the way the author is able to maintain and make believable the narrative voices involved as well as the chain of events that might lead a burgeoning scientist to his downfall within a societal context that refuses to address tough moral questions but instead does everything in its power to squash uncomfortable truths and realities however i do feel that the book could have gone further i think that the format of making the novel appear as an edited and footnoted autobiography was interesting and compelling at the start but by the end i found the editor almost a placebo against the horrific nature of the narrator i feel as if the author or editors of the novel thought that the editor was necessary in order to make norton more likable but he's factually not likable i wish that some issues were dealt with more graphically and courageously because i feel almost as if the narrator editor and author shy away when they could have taken it farther or gone into more detail and i can't decide if it's been done in an effort to create tension or if it's really just a patronizing effort to make the experience more palatable either way a well written book that brings up a lot of interesting questions and potential discussion","282":"very different book for me demanding plot line sad ending as others have said there is a bit of ann patchett's state of wonder in this book also the classic green mansions","283":"read it all the way through then you'll understand the rating definitely a life lesson in there","284":"i had a hard time getting into this novel and an even harder time sticking to it not on my favorite's shelf although it received critical acclaim guess it just goes to show that my taste is not the same as the critics","285":" disturbing there are very graphic accounts of violence to animals and deplorable behavior toward children this book is loosely based on dr d carleton gajdusek the book also chronicles scientific research and discoveries in anthropology if you want to read this anyway skip the parts regarding the ritual performed by the chief involving young boys and the postscript i wish i could erase those parts from my mind i was very glad to learn that the character of dr perina is not real i initially gave this 1 star due to my disgust before learning that the story is an autobiography of a fictional character considering the amount of emotion this book evokes it is clearly very well written","286":"this is a beautifully written book however i was struck with the similarity in theme with joseph conrad's heart of darkness thus it fell flat for as i believe it simply a well written copy cat","287":"can't decide what i think of this novel it was a slow read because of the unusual format a memoir with footnotes but i did not want to give up on it because i needed to know what was up with the narrator it was worth the effort","288":"extraordinary view spoiler yanagihara gives the reader every clue she needs implicit and explicit to draw the inevitable conclusion from the outset yet the ending will i bet still hit you with a wallop hide spoiler this novel is remarkable in any number of ways but in particular in the way it plays with the reader at least this reader who can intellectually embrace the notion of moral relativism yet for whom moral absolutism on some issues prevails the people in the trees is a triumph of narrative voice and structure the development and writing of the central character norton perina is positively masterful the imagery visceral grotesque perfectly chosen a novel about even one of the huge thorny themes raised scientific method human subjects research colonialism racism sociopathy sexual taboos parenting pedophilia destruction of the environment aging and death and more can be powerful when these themes are wound together dense as a jungle and as tightly as dna and laced within a story and with writing this precise and compelling the result is transcendent so powerful and provocative the questions it's raised and discomfort it's provoked will i feel sure linger","289":"unsettling for a long time after reading not sure i would recommend","290":"fascinating story but a little draggy toward the end if this ends early shortly after the trip to the island focusing only on the discovery and ramification this would be a solid 4 stars for me","291":"i got about halfway through this book and gave up i felt like i was slogging through a lot of unnecessary descriptions and backgrounds without ever really getting to the meat of the story","292":"i was intrigued by this fictional memoir by a nobel prize winning scientist imprisoned for sexual assault i found him to a man longing for truth and connection but ultimately creepy the created anthropology with footnotes by an editor was very well done hard to believe it was fiction the section added at the end explaining his imprisonment was really disturbing apparently loosely based on the story of nobel laureate dr d carleton gaydusek somewhere on the island is a place where we belong where we will lie down next to each other and know we will never have to look again but until we find it we are searchers two figures moving through a landscape while outside and around us the world is born and lives and dies and the stars burn themselves slowly into darkness","293":"it started off slow action wise but with much depth in the writing and character development norton is not likeable he is awkward nerdy in a bad way and self absorbed the story premise is fascinating so that holds interest along with his beautiful use of words the way it made you think about cultural norms and taboos was rich the way at the end describing child rearing mistakes and children's behaviors that are so universal it is almost disappointing as you thought you were unique the ending was well played as both norton and his editor show that each persons perspective can seem totally correct to them and totally wrong to the rest of society as each can only see from where they have witnessed","294":"i have to say it was pretty much all i could do to keep pushing forward and not consign this to the dnf pile i set rewards treats for myself if i could just finish this many more pages or that many and it's not like this is a long or complex book perina unfortunately is just completely insufferable as a narrator and i'm beyond tired of the unreliable memoir as a trope in modern fiction when it's done well it can still kick ass but this novel was 80% boring blowhard autobiography and 20% attempts to get a rise out of the reader unfortunately in order to achieve such raised hackles the book has to interest me seeing as it didn't at all due to being pretty bloody boring the attempts to prod me with shocking things were risible at best and unworthy at worst more at rb http ragingbiblioholism com 2014 03","295":" this is a debut novel based on a true story which i found both fascinating and disturbing as i began reading i was so intrigued with the writing and the story it seemed so intelligently written and i went on this anthropological expedition to a remote micronesian island i was glued to each page i could not put the book down then there were moments where things just got uncomfortable for me and i wondered if i was going to end up hating this book this did not happen and that to me proves that this author handled the uncomfortable in such a way so that it was just another part of the story and i continued to devour the book yes there were times when i asked myself is that really possible how could a person even back in the 50's when the rules were either not in place yet or at least more lenient go to a remote island and bring children back with him to adopt to the grand total of 41 over the years does a nobel winner make that much money that money was never an issue in the raising and educating of all those children did they just raise themselves when he was away or so busy in his lab there were many questions for me but is it fiction or loosely based on a true story i don't know that was a little confusing to me despite all that i was fascinated with the time on the island with the natives and the prospect of immortality the fountain of youth even was riveting and the dreamers oh my goodness another case of how things were done back then it was reminiscent of the insane asylums of the 50's of course as stated on the book jacket at what price scientific progress if a great man does unspeakable things is he still a great man how do we reconcile a person's failings with his genius life is not simple it never will be","296":"just read the other reviews those who rate it highly talk about the writing those who rate it low talk about the morality of a fictional character take your pick","297":"this story started as a fictionalized ethnography and while somewhat interesting and thought provoking it trudged it was the book's epilogue that left me haunted and un nerved and disoriented if a mark of a good book is to linger and cause discussion it was indeed successful but it did not bring pleasure","298":"you should get an inkling right from the cover and spine art that this book is not for the faint hearted i was attracted to it because of the gross cover embossed vividly colored fungi that rise off the page grubs and worms that jump off the spine it gets much worse from there animal cruelty colonialism raping children misogyny and racism but my goodness is this book fascinating yanagihara relates the memoirs of esteemed scientist dr norton perina as he writes them from prison they are compiled and annotated by his longtime colleague and more we can assume dr ronald kubodera we watch norton grow from a budding scientist to a field researcher finding the key to immortality and its terrible side effects we see him racked by guilt of what happened to the lost tribe and land he helped find and then destroy and we watch him funnel his guilt into adopting and supporting children of the culture that was sold off to the highest bidder while norton's actions are both honorable and awful yanagihara does a superb job of writing both journalistic nonfiction and a stirring memoir while creating a cast of complicated characters this book is a mix of cannibal holocaust heart of darkness lolita and classic science writing like the double helix and the selfless gene prepare to be disgusted awed and questioning morality humanity","299":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here oh but for the epilogue i actually loved this book until this part and not because i found it shocking or was disturbed but because i found it completely not needed i felt that it was there only for the shock value the book was much more disturbing to me before that part","300":"i listened to the people in the trees in audiobook format though the premise of the story is very compelling its execution is a bit too predictable the main failing of the book i think is its narrative strategy due to its format a memoir compiled and edited by norton's companion we already know the outcome of the book there is no great revelation no great shock i'm all about unreliable narrators but this story doesn't really earn it instead the ending feels like a bit of a gimmick","301":"just don't get it what is interesting or readable in a fiction book with footnotes pretentious ridiculous pretense and did i mention about an amazing aren't they always doctor accused child molester not interested at all ugh","302":" this book should begin with a caution those who are uncomfortable with moral relativism and who prefer to view the world in black and white should not take one step further the people of the trees is rife with moral ambiguity throughout which makes it a particularly mesmerizing and mind challenging debut a short google search reveals that the book was inspired on real nobel laureate carleton gajdusek the book purports to be the memoir of celebrated scientist norton perina edited by his colleague and admirer ronald kubodera after dr perina is jailed for the molestation of one of his many adopted children what we get is the compelling back story as told by an unreliable narrator norton perina travels to a micronesian island called ivu'ivu where an amazing discovery is made this primitive culture contains humans who have been alive for hundreds of years far exceeding the natural lifespan although their bodies are preserved their minds deteriorate the import of this discovery - dubbed selene syndrome - has vast implications for perina's career and reputation the questions that arise are vastly titillating what happens when man aspires to be a god when we encroach on the world of the gods when we see what we are not meant to see how can anything but disaster follow or to be even more direct what price do we place on progress what are we willing to sacrifice and forgive there is more to contemplate how do we view a man with a great mind who is not so great in his personal life is he a legend or a monster should one like faust sell his very soul for immortality does the very quest for the forbidden turn us into something less than human in creating a realistic novel hanya yanagihara drives readers from their comfort zones there are some very disturbing scenes of man's inhumanity to man...and man's inhumanity to the animal kingdom that trusts him there are hints of misogyny and outright examples of colonialism the book is meant to shake us out of complacency and is not meant for readers who are seeking \"feel good\" narratives if there is one problem with the book it's the shift in tone as the book progresses there's a bit of a disconnect between the professional perina and the increasingly personal glimpses into perina's amorality that being said there is bridge that connects and solidly addresses the discrepancy between scientific progress and ethics this is a far more transformative and fully realized novel than say anne patchett's state of wonder which tackles some of the same themes it's a devastating look into depravity and darkness in the name of science...for those courageous readers who are willing to take that rewarding journey","303":"maybe closer to a 3 75 this is another of the 2014 tournament of books novels good but disturbing read had some similarities to state of wonder story centers on doctor and his discoveries of a island civilization and a potential ability to live well beyond the normal life expectancy interesting look at the impact of scientific research on the people being studied and on those doing the studying debut novel by hanya yanagihara i will be interested in seeing what she does next","304":"i understand why people loved this book so much the writing is lovely and the characters and setting are all so fully realized it is the kind of book i found troubling to read because there is so much of the dark side of human nature throughout it and yet i often really like books that are troubling and dark like the devil all the time and ruby a novel it'll take me a while to figure out what it is that keeps me from loving this one","305":"seeking answers causes ruin wonderfully written","306":"yuck no idea why i stuck with it to the end weird disturbing depressing story","307":"while heart rending at times this book is an accurate portrayal of what happens when one attempts to bridge a gap between an ancient untouched culture and the modern world yanagihara travels seamlessly between the worlds of remote ivu'ivu and 1950's and onward academia you feel as though you are looking through a spyglass from just inside the jungle as yanagihara takes you to ivu'ivu and shows you the remarkableness of its people its flora and fauna its twofold timelessness in that it will forever be a place of enchantment of legend of mystery and that it is actually a place without time","308":"i liked this a lot better than i thought i would although i was wary it wasn't too graphic although definitely creepy norton is an extremely unlikable character not even because of the accusations but because he thinks he is better than everyone from the beginning of his memoir he is arrogant and he looks down on his mentally ill mother aimless father town's doctor neighbor lestor and his own brother he likes his aunt sybille bc she gives him science gifts but he feels pity for her too during college he thought he was smarter and more ambitious than his peers that he is the only one who wants adventure and something different he doesn't want to end up pathetic like smythe really creepy how he took pleasure in killing the lab mice that scene makes him like a masochist bc he liked cutting them up etc he continues to show his arrogant ways by hating esme jealousy p 101 about her menstrual blood such an angry insulting and misogynistic paragraph tallent was the only one he didn't dislike everything about the small disappointments seemed more typical things that one finds annoying but he seemed like he liked him i wasn't sure because of the he is beautiful paragraph he is fascinated by him wants to be the smartest of the group to be the most trusted p 106 oh god can nothing is this jungle behave as it ought must fruits move and trees breathe and freshwater rivers taste of the ocean why must nothing obey the laws of nature why must everything point so heavily toward the existence of enchantment first time he is humbled love this part feel the frustration of hiking through the jungle towards what he becomes more humbled the longer he is in the forest but he goes back to being conceited when he discovers about the turtles he wants to show the world he did become adventures and different and is doing something new i can understand why tallent distanced himself from norton but it's sad that he just disappeared i can understand why it's groundbreaking but i think norton feels he is blameless soooo sad about fa'a dying suicide and what happened to the island and all the changes to the village why was norton so naive that it wouldn't change once news got out sad that dreamers kept deteriorating in the lab and he worked with them less and less it's like he wanted to wash his hands of them and their deterioration mua delegating them to his assistant they are not his responsibility it's not his fault they are like this he was the one who brought them to the us and now he neglects them p 282 and note 74 did he really do all he could do no he didn't physically destroy the island like the pharma companies did but what else did he expect narcissistic and the editor ronald is blind to it why does he admire norton so much his idea of who he is continues with the adoptions he saved the kids gave them food and shelter they should be grateful etc he thinks he is a god but then he doesn't want the kids why does he keep adopting them what he is looking for what will they be to him the situation with victor was terrible and probably with the other kids rather than try to understand why they are having difficulty understanding during adolescence he berates them that he saved them how can he discipline them like that when he admits he is in the lab all the time traveling etc leaving things to the maid etc creepy when he keeps thinking about the boy whose a'ina he witnessed seems predatory is it just the innocence he admires if the prologue articles were not in the book would we think he was a pedophile already he never mentions liking his own children until the very end shocking end because he is completely unreliable he considers this love is this what all pedophiles think it's love he is giving of course his own memoir makes him appear to be a wonderful person i don't understand ronald's loyalty to him that part i am confused about why would he protect him want to be with him when he obviously is a predator he rapes the boys for love for what was lost in the jungle i don't understand why it was all revealed in the end was it suppose to have the reader guessing throughout did he or didn't he is that why they made victor so bad that he deserves it he brought it upon himself he asked for it obviously this is from norton's pov so i can't believe it but why make it so shocking the things i liked least footnotes the shall i section ugh got too repetitive unless it was suppose to make us not like norton because he brushes it off as it's all something we should already know and he doesn't need to bother the confusion with ronald the editor colleague weird jump between anthropological adventure and then creepy life of norton positives very good writing interesting storyline","309":"really good story and adventure","310":"great yarn could have been a bit shorter","311":"i absolutely was entranced by this book","312":"a beautifully written fictional memoir of a scientist who explores an island culture wound around a story of accusations of abuse and rape by the children from that culture who he adopted eery odd but told in a matter of fact scientist voice i've stopped giving stars to novels it seems an odd way to judge a book i'm not sure if i'd recommend this to friends or not i'll have to mull over it for a while but perhaps that its a good indication to some that its worth reading","313":" this is a well written and well imagined story that is horrible in several ways first it is about the despoilment of an undiscovered micronesian island by scientists who rape the land and its inhabitants for little or no benefit to 'science' second it's about the literal rape of children by a pedophile third it's about the tragic and useless exploitation of human and animal subjects in modern scientific research these are all subjects i am sympathetic with but they might be better served through non fiction the story boils down to the portrait of a psychopathic personality and this is the creepiest but least meaningful and universal aspect of this novel so although i liked it and it was well done i think it failed in some essential way as good literature ps when i picked it up i thought it was a fantasy novel about eternal life but it wasn't really so i was disappointed there as well","314":"a book in two parts the first one of exploration and the second one of the fallout from a discovery very difficult to put down and worth the time investment after finishing i needed a good hour or so to figure out what i thought of it the mark of a good book in my book","315":"extremely well written account of a primitive civilization and a scientist who is involved with it written in a scholarly voice it is a very interesting account of a meeting between civilizations it went in a slightly different direction than i expected but was excellent reading all the same","316":"this book tells two stories an adventure in a lost jungle world where a team of researchers find a tribe of stone age natives and an apparent key to unheard of human longevity tied to a rare turtle species indigenous to the island unsurprisingly with the discovery comes an onslaught of civilization big pharma missionaries alcoholism habitat destruction and a predictable loss of innocence but that's not all we also get the story of one of the original researchers a conflicted young doctor who is not quite as noble as he thinks he is the book had an aha moment at the very end that was somewhat unsatisfying although in retrospect it was not a complete surprise i enjoyed the adventure aspect of this novel but the underlying theme of moral relativism was more thought provoking than i expected","317":"abandoned couldn't get into it maybe another time","318":"this was not an uplifting book it was uncomfortable","319":" what to say that hasn't already been said it is a disturbing book but the author's handling of the subject is solid because many of the conflicts within the book relate to one another in ways that necessitate discussion the pedophilia is the most overtly disturbing element but there is equal starkness to the conflict between pure science in the interest of solving a puzzle versus science for profit and the ways that the two are handled was well worth the read mostly i liked that the author didn't make the morality heavy handed as a reader i appreciate the opportunity to decide what horrifies me a vast majority of the book succeeded in doing this i also appreciated the inclusion of actual historic information combined with events that were realistic enough within the context of fiction to feel authentic from my experience there is a romanticism associated with anthropology first contact and isolated tribal societies a romanticism that falls apart under evidence that humans are humans and i felt that this specifically is what yanagihara succeeds in demonstrating","320":"this novel is beautiful shocking messy mysterious haunting and very well written certainly not for everyone but a read that will stay with me for a while my interest was piqued when my good friend wrote a 5 star review saying it would not be recommended for book club i had to find out why","321":"another book that starts well but has content that is of only so so interest so have no idea if when i will get back to","322":" i didn't add this audio until i knew i would finish because it was borrowed from the library and frequently they expire before i can get them read i especially wanted to read this because i missed it when it was being buzzed and yanagihara's new book is due to be released in a few weeks so i wanted to see what kind of writer she is before deciding on whether to read her new book i have to say i loved this story for the first 95% of the book other readers will know what i mean without me spoiling it i have a fascination with anthropology that dates back to my college years and in many ways this story reminded me of another favorite euphoria both books deal with primitive societies and have huge elements of suspense add to that scientific inquiry into eternal life and what's not to like more to the point however is the quality of yanagihara's writing which just seems to flow effortlessly seamlessly and was a pleasure to read i know i will read her new book and given the subject matter i look forward to the inevitable comparisons to donna tartt","323":"wish i could do half star excellent writing style horrid story main character is smug selfish absolutely unable to empathize with anyone and he doesn't change with age","324":"one of the best writers i've encountered in a long time one of the worst main characters i've had the misfortune of spending time with","325":"i felt that this book was beautifully written and there was even moments where i turned to my husband and read lines to him from the book i found them so compelling i really liked the style of this book with all of the footnotes in it it added an extra dimension to the story while the ending was a bombshell i kind of had the feeling it was going to drop anyway the entire time but the most wonderful thing about this book was the writing especially for a first time writer and the world that she so lusciously described","326":"a very challenging and in places unpleasant book however having said that the author is to be commended for some truly excellent writing the story is told through the eyes of a rather unpleasant scientist and the characterisation is such that you can really picture the man's entire personality and thought process not just that which is explicitly described for us the trip through the island is told with a great vividity is that a word and the tragic events that follow are almost jaw droppingly sad it really is a well written book but again it is not a nice or fun book it already had enough challenging material to sour a thousand novels i didn't really need the extra confrontation of ritualistic child abuse maybe im not courageous enough but for me that was just a bit too much it felt like it was added to the novel just to add another layer of antagonism toward the unassuming reader personally i think the book could have been done without it and still been completely fascinating so overall a mixed bag some very good writing but the story was so sad and depressing it was hard to read at times and then the topic of child abuse almost enough to make me put it down i will be very interested to see the authors next efforts hopefully she caters a little more to a more 'mainstream' taste anyway that was my annual foray into proper modern literature i'll go back to genre novels now","327":"this was so good to start out smart creative interesting unique i could have done without the last section it left me feeling awful","328":"someone once told me not to feel guilty about quitting a book if after 100 pages you're not hooked it's really ok to stop i took that advice for the first time with this book i simply hated it it felt like a chore to read i despised the main character he's arrogant judgmental and condescending the story characters and the writing style did nothing to draw me in or make me want to turn another page","329":"one of my front runners for best novel of 2013 and even more so for being a debut the people in the trees is an unsettling read in the way it makes you follow a thoroughly despicable lead narrator all the way through leaving no aspects of his lurid nature obscured from the reader he's a vaguely sociopathic closeted pervert with an elevated sense of entitlement and a yen for killing lab mice but the writing is stellar throughout nearly gothic in its descriptions of first time encounters with island dwellers in micronesia you are completely drawn into the suffocation of the world this novel creates anyone who likes dark tales about dark characters will love this","330":"all i can say in the positive is that the author certainly captures the voice of a pompous imperious blowhard","331":"ewww what a creepy scary and unpleasant book well done not fun","332":"creative but don't like being left with creepy feelings after reading something","333":"the first third of the book was hard for me to get through the main character is arrogant full of his own intellectualism and thoroughly unlikable however the story becomes fascinating after it begins to focus on his time on the island","334":" i think this is the highest rating i've ever given a book that i detested so much i wanted to use the word hate but as my mother said often to me as a child 'hate is a strong word tamsen 'and i don't hate this i feel dirty though i feel saddened by the world i don't understand people like norton or ronald i don't like that people can shrug their shoulders and say 'ah well all in the name of science ' i don't like that norton used science and discovery to justify his view spoiler pedophilia hide spoiler i wanted to cry for the opa'ivu'eke for the villagers for the dreamers norton is the worst character i've ever encountered he's probably the most real villain i've ever read he's cruel and self serving and condescending and disgusting and still this gets 3 stars from me i don't understand it either really i guess it's mainly because yanagihara succeeds with her hateful despicable narrator he's horrible and i hated him it's a strong word and it's appropriate and i still kept reading i was supposed to not like him but still want to know the story view spoiler and i think to wonder if those accusations were true again she succeeds hide spoiler and it's a story you want to hear even though really we greedy americans know how it all will end the book within a book the footnotes the references to other biographies and scientific works the news articles it puts together a thorough story to illustrate yanagihara's goal to have us see a full picture of norton and to not necessarily enjoy it eta after reading a few reviews this book was apparently inspired by carleton gajdusek crazy that my most hated fictional character is actually real if you don't know who he is i wouldn't google him before reading the people in the trees","335":"despite a bent perspective from the narrator i found this book enthralling it is all the more fascinating because apparently it is based on a real scientist dr c gadjusek he too won the nobel prize thanks to elaine for her thorough review and personal views on the background for this book","336":"another 5 star book reminds one a little of state of wonder by ann patchett and also a little of the evolution of bruno littlemore if you have read both and liked them you will like this book others have described the complicated plot in great details so i will add the comments i feel compelled to add after reading through the reviews and now upon finally finishing the book yes tediously i must admit that about 5% of the text has to do with innappropriate sexual conduct between minor and adult if that fact makes a book unreadable for you then by all means avoid it of course the passages are uncomfortable to read but the rest of the book is so remarkable that it really becomes insignificant i have read books like tiger tiger by margaux fragoso a disturbing actual memoir and the end of alice by a m homes where i was infinitely more disturbed about the subject matter therefore if you could handle either of those books you can handle this one clear as mud well i don't want to be coy and give too much away but i notice that for a lot of readers they just plain don't want to read a book about anything they find unpleasant even if they are to learn something be amazed be enlightened or sit back at the end and say damn that's good writing some readers full grown adults are put off an entire novel due to a few four letter words to these people i say you may be more comfortable reading children or ya books however with the fairy tale endings hollywood love scenes and starry eyed neatly wrapped endings in those books i feel they would do you a disservice to the rest of you people who look for the quality of the writing the solid plot that unravels smoothly before you as you fly through it the cleanly sketched characters the new information and imaginative journey between the pages you will enjoy this book for those of you who start to like the character of norton but are disturbed if he is a bad guy please skip the last chapter of this book","337":"inspired by the true story about gajdusek the author has written a frightening twisted and thought provoking tale filled with moral ambiguity on many levels and in many aspects in an intelligent interesting and fascinating narrative if you can handle stark realities in life this is a worthy read","338":" here i go again apparently i'm in a minority i found this book to be a waste of time the description of everything was way beyond boring for me but i kept reading to try to find out why many folks thought it was so good both the main character and the devoted narrator were loathsome and the subject matter about molestation made this unworthy of my time the only interesting part was his effect this man had on the culture he destroyed on the island i can't recommend this to anyone and wouldn't even waste my time on any further discussion in a book club i don't understand why all the hype on this book is so good","339":" the only reason i gave this book four stars was for my utter and complete hatred of norton perina i was constantly having to remind myself that this book is fiction although i realize its basis in truth one of those few novels that intrigues and disgusts you at the same time perina's arrogance ethnocentrism xenophobia and utter lack of respect condescension for those around him is abhorrent and reprehensible what bothered me the most is that there is no one voice which serves as a conscious to him within the entire novel there is no one refuting his behavior rather the editor leaves gleaming kiss ass foot notes which only serve to further disgust this book serves to highlight moral absolutism in its purest form excellent novel haunting and completely convincing i nearly cried when fa'a died and was even more angered by the narrators complete dismissal of his being you really really need to prepare yourself to read this or else face the urge to scream into the pages and hurl the book across the room excellent provoking read","340":"amazing astonishing terrifying book i absolutely recommend to anyone interested in either science adventure island life sociology philosophy and psychology i got absolutely lost in the best way in her descriptions of the island itself and would like to return her writing is just rich and detailed and so perfectly executed you can tell a lot of thought and time has gone into this book","341":"this is one book that just could not live up to the preview chapter i was given in advance the disturbing subject matter didn't bother me but the fact that a lot of the plot could be ascertained from a wikipedia page for daniel carleton gajdusek is really disappointing those complaints aside this writer may yet have a long career her creation and detailed delivery of a whole micronesian culture was really neat to read about","342":"i really enjoyed the story of norton and it was very interesting it wasn't exactly a page turner it took me a while to read the book and the only time i really wanted to read more and more was toward the end","343":"heady stuff about immortality science and magical turtles","344":" this book bothered me it's story held potential but ultimately i felt its plot and it's characters or really character as this is the story of one man were left hanging on the tree never to ripen more so though yanagihara has chosen to tell the story through a wholly unlikeable unpitiable and unsympathetic narrator i get it but also i hate this guy i hated him for some 350 pages i hated him far more after the plot reveal of the postscript that had loomed over the whole of the story i think it strange given the rich story the author laid the groundwork for that she went the route she did and wishing that i hadn't followed her there","345":"weird mind numbingly boring drivel i abandoned this book after reading 50 pages and skimming a few more","346":"the author did a very good job creating a believable culture and allows us to see changes that take place as the modern world intervenes the story also explores the life triumphs flaws of the main character who in the story wins a nobel for his discoveries the writing is first class and in some ways difficult to believe it is the authors first novel","347":"an inventively funny unreliable narrator and coverups and science and know it all ism and holier than thou ism and such disdain for esme whose pov i would have preferred to visit in the end instead of norton's i mean obviously it was norton's story but gah i spent the first part enjoying how yanagihara was making tongue in cheek fun of the white men and going bonkers with the natural world descriptions and taking care not to paint the noble savages as being all pure and worthy as well i mean it continued that way but i stopped being able to giggle at it and that's powerful u0026amp good but it still means i closed the book with an unpleasant taste in my mouth","348":" i read a review of this book and thought it sounded different and interesting but did not pick it up right away a co worker read it and could not stop talking about it intrigued i picked it up and the length made me put it right back down my mistake i finally had a nice gap of time to read and felt i could start to tackle this i didn't tackle it it tackled me even though it is thick and the type is smaller it reads really smoothly and quickly not necessarily an on the edge of your seat read but it is hard to put down nonetheless so what is this about in a nutshell it describes the exploits of this apathetic med student named norton perina the novel begins with a letter from his friend explaining how norton has been wrongly accused of child molestation and sentenced to prison the friends then goes on to say that he is going to present norton's memoirs with only small editorial changes norton goes through harvard med school not caring but doing very well not wanting to go the traditional route he accepts an appointment to assist an anthropologist on a remote island as they explore the island they find something very strange people who can live forever but with great mental degradation this discovery and their actions change their lives and the life of the island irrevocably i am the type of reader that craves a jazzy ending some surprise some shock but with this book i did not even think about how it might end or even care because the experience of reading it was so wonderful there is a satisfying little twist the editor puts in at the end but even without that the book is a beautiful and engaging read to me it was like reading proust even though it is lengthy and tangled you become totally submerged in the world where colors and sounds become almost real it is a story for the dead of night","349":"4 stars because i'm still thinking about it this is an emotionally u0026amp ethically difficult read one with few no safe likeable characters to take shelter in","350":"i liked the research biology angle on this one the whole child abuse undertone might take it out of the running for some readers but it was interesting until the end","351":"brilliant and basically theory think a critique of cultural anthropology the novel it's like durkheim mauss levi strauss put into a tightly and complexly organized narrative that is part bildungsroman part travel account and part family drama haunting and unpredictable right up to the last page","352":" scanning previous reviews at the goodreads website i noted a common thread being expressed about the true story that is supposed to have inspired hanya yanagihara's debut novel although i cannot identify one \"true story\" as the source of the depiction of the forest dwelling \"lost tribe\" of the people in the trees i did recognize history's influence in part vi of this novel when asked to explain the significance behind the name he has chosen for one of his adopted u'iuvian children the novel's protagonist norton perina claims to have chosen the name almost randomly it happened to be the name of the man piloting the plane that took them away from the micronesian country i do not believe that yanagihara would have chosen this particular name if it did not hold historical significance even before the boy demands an explanation of his name from his adoptive father i suspected the connection between this fictional boy and the eighteenth century feral child known as victor of aveyron yanagihara's narrator says that \"the greater problem with victor was his almost complete lack of socialization his fundamental--and the word is intentional--savagery for very shortly after i acquired victor i realized that i was going to have to teach him how to be a human\" 304 now i cannot go into too much detail on the methods employed in the behavioral training of yanagihara's victor without revealing too much of the novel's plot however i will say that the psychological maladaption of this child whom perina describes as unusually \"difficult \" is consistent with the psychosocial dwarfism that afflicts abused children who have been deprived of parental attention some of the punitive measures that perina adopts are reminiscent of those taken by the physician jean marc gaspard itard when he attempted to socialize the historical feral child i suspect that scholars will be able to identify many other anthropological traces in yanagihara's novel which is convincing in the density of its detail the author does not shy from unpleasant truths though i suspect that some readers will be as uncomfortable with certain scenes as i was curiously i found myself identifying with the character that the narrator most despises esme duff like her i am a middle aged white woman--and i suspect that perina would accuse me of \"intellectual hypocrisy\" as he does duff i also suspect that i would be every bit as horrified as duff is if i were to witness the behaviors that she and the other americans witness in the remote tribal village yanagihara's novel fits into that genre of anticolonial narratives that explore the various ways in which exploiters of \"primitive\" cultures may be said to \"go native \" i could certainly see this book being taught in a graduate course that includes h g well's the island of dr moreau and joseph conrad's heart of darkness that the people in the trees is set in the mid to late twentieth century may force us to recognize that we are not so post imperial as we may like to think especially where our economic in this case pharmaceutical interests are concerned i much appreciate the opportunity to read this book prior to its release in hardback thanks to a first reads giveaway i recommend this novel to readers who are unlikely to shy away at density or difficulty both of style and substance","353":" please explain to me why so few of my friends have read this book it's a triumph of style not 'voice ' not 'authentic expression ' but style pt is for the most part the 'memoirs' of a medical anthropologist norton perina he is one of the great characters of this young century and yanagihara's ability to write in his slightly ludicrous way is an absolutely astonishing feat of literary irony the book's plot is glorious as well a little slow at the beginning which i think is true for most well plotted books but ultimately perfectly balanced consider for a moment how rare it is to find even a moderately well written book that is also a well plotted book please buy a copy of pt and read it and it deals intelligently and without condescending at all with some of the most important ideas of our time environmentalism neo colonialism scientism naturalism the craving for roots and most of all the difficulty of reconciling two things most of us know feel to be true i e i that we live in an historically changing world which is also home to many many cultures all of them adhering to different ethical codes and ii that there are some moral truths but mostly i can't get over the formal perfection of the book we know norton from his first sentences he affects tolerance objectivity and wisdom but is actually self deluded as the text unwinds we see the delusion wind its way through the story he is no ordinary unreliable narrator norton is the unreliable narrator as scientist presenting us with facts and the results of experiments proving his perceptions with every paragraph but we know it is all false the novel doesn't ask us to question the narrator's truthfulness it asks us to question the truthfulness of the world that produces men like the narrator you can get at very important truths with the scientific method you can also get at some very important truths using art distance and most importantly irony and i can't do justice to how well yanagihara does it in this review try as i might","354":" this book is too impressive to not get a real review from those who read it in researching the book for my book group discussion i happened upon an article about a nobel prize winning scientist late '70s who studied a native people adopted a gaggle of kids and was accused and convicted in very much the same vein '90s that is not to diminish the author's accomplishment of creating a completely fictional but seemingly authentic academic account that effectively paints the loneliness that can be a research scientist's life i can't say i liked where it went i wondered why i was along for the ride but i certainly admired the world and the detail in which it was painted and the conceit is fun the story is not","355":"ok it was hard to get through the preface but really picked up u0026amp was such good reading in the middle but then the story seemed to drag u0026amp way too much unnecessary info towards the end it ended up beingnot my type of info i was skimming the end i was disappointed by some of the topic i try not to tell too much","356":" very well written especially as a fictional autobiography what i found most interesting was how consistently the main character relates to his world but as the reader my understanding of the depth of his narcissism wavered until the end he was so committed to his perspective but there were a lot of clues in how people around him acted i didn't like him as a character and i had a hard time sympathizing with him throughout but then again is the author asking us to i don't think so i just like to it's my habit as a reader to want to sympathize with the main character i think the author knows this about people and manipulated that to build suspense he did a great job of bringing us readers into the mind of a narcissist and i never want to go there again the author wrote beautifully created a compelling provoking novel but i wish i hadn't read it spoiler alert there are child rape scenes and other forms of cruelty towards people i didn't expect that and now those images are burned into my mind i'm not convinced that the cruelty and selfish abuse of authority portrayed is just some inability on the readers part to understand or accept cultural relativism","357":" wow this is an incredible debut novel the writing in the guise of a memoir by dr norton perina is lush and precise the rendering of the ivu'ivu people is believable and the colonialist practices and destruction of the native culture is a familiar story yanagihara does not give easy answers to the questions of the merits of scientific discovery versus the preservation of native cultures perina is certainly an unlikeable narrator and a generally abhorrent person but his motives towards science are genuine even if his morality is twisted this book made me feel cold and empty it does not provide solace for the reader or a satisfactory solution to perina's future but i wonder if any outcome could have sufficed amazing writer and an amazing debut worth the read even if the subject matter is morally ambiguous","358":"derivative but good","359":" hanya yanigahara's the people in the trees is the most disturbing novel i've read in years and simultaneously one of the most beautiful the people in the treesseeing the look on my face when i was most of the way through the novel my husband asked \"are you reading horror \"\"no \" i said \"but it's pretty frightening \"\"well the title is creepy \"and so it went the epigraph to the people in the trees comes from the tempest 4 1 when prospero inveighs against what he sees as caliban's fundamental intractability his resistance to civilization that is both civilization itself and being civilized none too humanely by prospero it's an apt choice for ms yanagihara's narrative of science immortality destruction ethics and exploration itself the novel is composed of the memoirs of norton perina framed by a preface and epilogue penned by his colleague and friend ronald kubodera who provides insight and explication with academic footnotes throughout the text perina a doctor is part of a small group that discovers a \"lost\" tribe on the fictional island of ivu'ivu with disastrous consequences for the islanders and ultimately for perina himself by the way i suggest that you do not read the jacket copy before you begin reading the novel itself -- spoilers abound perina's voice is compelling -- both suave and vicious aware of his personal shortcomings and willfully blind to his greatest moral failings kubodera though trying to protect his mentor and justify his life's work and his own consistently undercuts perina's attempt to appear as if he is withholding nothing giving the reader the unvarnished truth and maybe in some sick way perina thinks he is delivering his own truth the horrors the novel presents are juxtaposed with the lush there's no other word descriptions of the fantastical plants and creatures of ms yanagihara's invention even the few words of the u'ivuan language that perina shares are musical and perfectly suited to the environment of the story as a child i remember learning in school that the rainforest ought to be protected so that it would remain available for future study when i read this novel it occurred to me after all these years that perhaps we should be protecting it and all the other wild places of the world from study after all wouldn't caliban have been better off without prospero","360":"interesting read but at times slow i enjoyed the science aspect that this book introduced to me and loved all all adventures that took place on the island when the book changed to norton having 43 children that he adopted it just got strange","361":"when i'm going to review a book i don't read other reviews so that they don't color my opinion i do read what the publisher or editor sends out and what the book cover synopsis states about the author and story but in this case i wish i had read something more so that i could have been cautioned about what this story was really about i thought i was getting an adventure story about a young doctor and an anthropologist who discover a lost tribe in the jungles of an island based on a true story and similar to some books i've read my first clue that something ugly might be inside was in the first few pages before the preface where there were some quotes supposedly from the associated press and reuters stating that the doctor in later years was arrested for rape statutory rape and endangering a minor but after reading the preface by another doctor i thought maybe it was a false accusation the second inkling i had that this was going to a dark disturbing place happened in part 2 where he is starting medical school experimenting on animals and conveying a complete lack of empathy in the suffering of the mice dogs and monkeys again i excused his behavior given the time period and the context of \"all for the greater good of medical discoveries\" that medical students and lab workers are exempt from but this lack of empathy was a revealing look into his moral character then in the middle of the book when they were finally in the jungle and made contact with the tribe a child is raped in a ceremony as the doctor watches observing detached and justifying it as part of their culture enough already this was sickening and it makes me wonder about what publishers and editors consider \"fresh new voices\" and the best book of 2013 and why author's who have choices in the retelling of a \"based on a true stories\" have to go to this depth of graphic detail i'm doing something i hate doing because i love books but this one is going to the dump it gets 1 star because i have to give it something","362":"loved the concept of a fawning unreliable editor reviewing the autobiography of an egomaniacal maybe despicable unreliable scientist author writing about his experiences as part of a scientific mission to an uncharted polynesian island in the 1950s convincingly captures the mythical world of the island and the moral ambiguities that follow the scientist author's return home docking it a star because it literally gave me weird dreams about boars turtles and creepy jungle encounters","363":"kind of just started has an uncanny resemblance with state of wonder by ann patchett looked interesting but lacks beauty in language","364":"i really enjoyed the ending although it was disturbing throughout the book though there was evidence that something like that could happen the thing that i really did not like about the character norton was the effect that his research had on that tiny community of islands it was like he brought threw the chickens to the wolves all in all i would recommend this book","365":"i struggle to remember when i've last read anything half as troubling and disconcerting and repulsive as this book the prose is brilliant the idea original and the characters scarily believable my mind just cannot accept that it is based on a true story i just can't this will haunt me for weeks","366":" wow that wasn't quite what i was expecting slow and gorgeous lovely imagery once i got into the story it felt incredibly real and beautiful i wanted this island to be real ultimately though i totally hated the protagonist an awful human being realizations i like black and white i don't like moral relativism i liked algebra i disliked calculus i like knowing how to feel about someone and while this book is supposed to be about the question is a great man still great when he does terrible things the answer is no if a great man does terrible things he should fucking burn in fucking hell i totally feel rage y right now","367":" i ordered the people in the trees based on a positive review of it in the express newspaper some time ago when it arrived i popped it in my book pile and forgot all about it i picked it up to read soon after christmas with some apprehension based on other reviews i had read on the us amazon site and the goodreads website however the book turned out to be surprisingly good if somewhat troubling read in the book we follow the life of acclaimed scientist norton perina from his humble beginnings living on a farm as a young boy through to a stunning discover he makes wholly by chance to his ultimate downfall for sexually abusing one of the children he eventually adopts in droves some time in his mid twenties disillusioned and disliked by most of his laboratory colleagues perina is offered the chance to spend a number of months on the isolated islets of u'ivu and ivu'ivu searching for a lost tribe of hunter gatherers soon he and his companions meet up with the intended lost peoples but their existence is soon eclipsed by their apparent longevity perina links the tribe's long livedness to the consumption of a previously unknown turtle species the opa'ivu'eke he smuggles some of the turtle flesh back to the us and earns his fame winning a nobel prize whilst at the same time dooming the island's unique culture as time passes and the population of the prized turtle is eradicated by ravenous pharmaceutical companies and the island's existence is irrevocably altered for the worse norton resorts to adopting the native children as a way of penance for his actions his treatment of the wards in his care is the eventual reason he finds himself in prison and writing the memoires that make up the book i will state now that people who are easily offended should probably steer clear of this book it deals with some very emotive subjects most notably the sexual abuse of children the novel is based loosely around the actual events of real life scientist carleton gajdusek which makes it all the more shocking and i have read of people who have given up on it early on in complete disgust however if you can look beyond some of the horrible subject matter you will find a very engaging and thought provoking tale the book is told through the words of perina himself edited by his close friend ronald kubodera both men are at their cores reprehensible people and you will likely end up finding your dislike for them growing as the novel progresses although perina through yanagihara obviously is an accomplished writer you will find his take on events often frustrating and shocking his voice is condescending arrogant and self important he is unfeeling and takes great pleasure in executing the mice in his laboratory in inventive and cruel ways his compassion non existent despite flashes of regret for what his actions did to the indigenous people of ivu'ivu he is mostly unrepentant he might be a brilliant scientist in his own mind but he is a strange and deeply unpleasant man he describes the u'ivuan people as backwards and mocks them on many separate occasions yet lauds their promiscuity towards children as acceptable in an effort to give credence to his questionable desires perina mentions having to teach victor the child who eventually brings him to his knees how to be human and is it any wonder that he is the most damaged and troublesome of all the wretches he chooses to adopt for how can a man who can barely be described as human himself teach anyone else to be normal a man who garners more pleasure in identifying the ailments of his sickly adoptees than actually being a father to them is never going to give worthwhile life advice while i had an extremely strong dislike of perina based on his actions and personality i found myself absolutely detesting kubodera this is surprising as he only really asserts himself on the novel in the prologue and epilogue and in the often over long fictional footnotes kubodera takes every opportunity to fawn over the odious perina doting on him like an infatuated lover what makes kubodera more insufferable than perina is the fact that he is aware of perina's shocking predilections and yet dismisses them under the guise of the man having superior intellect and once making an almost earth shattering discovery he is made all the more unpleasant for knowing about what perina did as is made clear in a shocking excerpt near the end of the book and yet still complying with and defending the man as if he had a clear conscience his footnotes as well as being sickeningly biased also serve only to break up the flow of the story some of them cover entire pages i'm a firm believer that footnotes should be kept out of novels entirely and used solely for scientific or historical journals or documents and their use in this book did nothing to make me change my opinion on this front despite the negatives of the tellers of this tale there is still a lot to enjoy within the novel i found myself devouring its improbable science in much the same way i did journey to the centre of the earth by jules verne although both focus on scenarios that are very much impossible the worlds they create are fascinating in the people in the trees yanagihara paints a vivid mythology of a strange and unknown people much in the same way as verne produced his unlikely world within a world she has given the ivu'ivuans their own language social structures and legends perhaps some of these are even true is part of perina's affliction down to the turtle's supposed curse she has also given them their own unusual yet believable ways of life and rituals some of which again will disturb certain readers the jungle covered island of ivu'ivu and its fauna and animal inhabitants are all given life by her vivid and creative prose yanagihara's novel is essentially a character study of a very troubled and unpleasant individual however she also manages to highlight man's ignorance and inherent nastiness through a number of different avenues be it the wilful pollution and destruction of an island ecosystem for financial or scientific gain to the carelessness and selfishness displayed by people to their peers the ugly side of mankind is not only shown through perina and kubodera but also by the scientists who destroy the island and even through the actions of the adopted children perina brings back to the united states for the most part as i read through this book it was going to be a five star review towards the end however when we had left the jungles of ivu'ivu for the last time and turned instead to perina's incessant adoptions the pace slackened somewhat and my interest waned slightly the story is essentially split into three distinct sections perina's early life his time on the island and his discovery and the time spent raising his adopted kids the intrigue of the story drooped once we arrive at the adopted children section and it is easily the weakest of the three parts although there are moments that will shock you and have you marvel at the human condition within this section they are unfortunately scant also as we near the end of the story we can find whole years or important parts of perina's life surmised in a matter of sentences which i found disappointing despite these flaws towards the conclusion of the book i would still recommend it to most readers it is quite a unique tale in many ways told by a despicable voice yet still eminently readable although not for the faint of heart owing to some of its content yanagihara has crafted a rich and believable culture in the fictional micronesian islets of u'ivu and ivu'ivu her writing style and prose belie the fact that this is her debut novel if her follow up efforts are only half as good as the people in the trees they will still be well worth reading","368":" this is a very good book with an interesting set up and several sections that were impossible to stop reading the descriptions are rich and the main character so thoroughly drawn despite his own unreliable narration the very end the section that the in story narrator excises from the main document is devastating to read even though it was quite predictable the only thing i didn't like was how abruptly the story changed from inu inu to his life in bethesda with his dozens of children it made the last third of the novel feel like a different book still a great read","369":"someone who has read this and is smart please please let me know because i would like to talk to you about this book","370":"this is not an easy book to read in many respects the writing by a first time author is amazing this is writerly writing if you're looking for a light read look elsewhere the book begins with a salacious news report about the main character norton perina is it true or is one of his children just an angry young man you won't know until you read the entire book you will however form opinions based on the memoir of dr perina as transcribed by his friend ronald kubodera what are dr kubodera's motives and why does he remain committed to perina who is aloof we learn about perina's early life and go on adventures with him to uncharted islands in the south pacific where we meet uncivilized natives be advised savage behavior is the norm including acts involving children and animals back in the united states there are details about lab animals that might offend some readers i recommend this book with the caution that it is not for the squeamish","371":"fascinating and disturbing could barely put this book down i wish i had read it with my book club so we could discuss it after i finished the book i googled a review from the n y times which revealed that it is loosely based on true events i feel a little naive that i did not pick up on a number of clues running through the book about the protagonists but i will say no more so nothing is ruined","372":"captivating lively and quietly unsettling with an ending utterly predictable and utterly shocking i couldn't put it down and thought about it constantly when i wasn't reading the beasts are never where you think they'll be i think is the most frightening thing","373":" very disturbing read hanya yanagihara is a very talented author and at times i was convinced what i was reading was a non fiction book it was all those footnotes that convinced me but even though this book is based on a true story the novel itself was fiction dr norton perina travels as a university student and a poor one at that to ivu'ivu a micronesian island to help an anthropologist search for a lost tribe of people who have a longer than normal life expectancy dr perina's discovery of what causes these dreamers to live exceptionally long lives and what he does about it is ultimately what causes the demise of the ivu'ivuan culture island and its peoples but even more disturbing than the ruination of this beautiful jungle home is dr perina's adoption of over 40 lost children and his treatment of them fantastic writing but i found dr perina to be a totally selfish egotistical arrogant character and i just could not get past his personality","374":"writing was very good but the subject was not very unappealing","375":" loosely inspired by a true story this debut novel has received a lot of early acclaim and it certainly rings with a polish that belies its author's career the main character dr norton perina a nobel prize winner writes his memoirs from prison filtered through the editorial and admiring eyes of his protege neither man however is very sympathetic ronald kubodera's worshipful attitude towards norton incites its own distaste along with norton's own matter of fact displays of his own dark inclinations even the childhood scenes show an odd glee in this dark side norton enjoys frying ants with his magnifying glass with as much pleasure as he later uses to kill the mice he must autopsy in med school but despite the difficulty in truly connecting with any of the characters described the book is oddly intriguing unfortunately the pacing never really picks up and the book leaves many loose ends dangling in its wake in some ways this adds to the book's overall authenticity but it also prevents it from being a truly enjoyable read norton remains distasteful throughout the book's entirety both in his actions as well as his views on other people the book has a very authentic quality but the lack of redemption for its characters really makes it an overwhelmingly depressing novel it is immaculately written but the overwhelming negativity negates any pleasure to be found in reading it the book needs more balance as it stands it is remarkable grim and downright disgusting in places the plot takes no unsurprising turns and the amount of mysteries left at the end make it hard to feel satisfied upon its conclusion","376":"first of all i have to start by saying i simply cannot believe this is hanya yanagihara's first novel holy crap the people in the trees is an imaginative work to say the very least to say the most it's the best debut novel i think i've ever read talk about coming out of the gate strong yanagihara has not only created a complex and fully realized protagonist but also an entire fictional culture read my full review here http www thewhynottblog com book re","377":"this book was pretty amazing the main character was loathsome to say the least its a story about how a culture can be destroyed in the name of science it was not an easy read and somewhat boring at times with a little too much description","378":"this was an interesting story but more so a profile of a scientist who seems to have lost track of his moral compass exploration and discovery trump other considerations when intruding on a newly discovered culture when the possibility of some ostracized members of this culture having attained a physical but not mental immortality or at least a long life arises norton the scientist narrator pulls out all the stops in an attempt to figure out how they've attained such a state once word gets out and the pharmaceutical companies descend on the island paradise it is reduced to combed over rubble norton wins the nobel while adopting a great many of the island's waifs how he fares as a father and why he is imprisoned for going astray conclude the book while clearly able to apply analysis in the scientific world norton lacks such perspicacity when examining his own actions","379":"compelling disturbing and well done","380":"i greatly enjoyed this book but kept thinking how much more i would enjoy it if it were non fiction the anthropology parts not the child abuse accusations or otherwise the idea that unconventional scientific findings particularly in anthropology force us to question our ethical norms is an concept that has intrigued me all my life i look forward to discussing this book in one or more of the book clubs i attend","381":"complex in every way and unputdownable when i wasn't reading it i was thinking about it all the time","382":" sixty pages in and i'm throwing in the towel neither the tantalizing promise of meditations on western imperialism and scientific ethics nor my curiosity over a surprise ending could carry me past the suffocating details of the banal the prosaic and the purposelessness the story's told using the conceit of a memoir written from prison by the protagonist a nobel winning doctor whose illustrious career is tainted by his conviction for sexual abuse but the dryness stops me cold even before this dr norton perina can make it to the island where he's to make his big scientific discovery and adopt those kids he's convicted of abusing the level of specificity about things like the front yard and house of one of the protagonist's early professors and the personalities of minor lab mates drives me bananas i'm not convinced that such details about every little boring thing are going to be relevant to the rest of the story banality is fine if it's the point of the story but i don't believe that's the point here yanagihara is just over writing and if she starts as she means to go then there's no hope that i'll find the rest of the story any more compelling","383":"excellent writing with very dark subject matter would make an excellent book club read raises lots of questions related to science anthropology and morality will be thinking about this one for a while","384":"it's an impressive novel but disturbing when i finished reading it i felt similar to how i did when the credits started rolling after black swan the stories are not necessarily alike but it the story is compelling especially because of how skillful and precise the author's word choice is","385":"singularly intense unsettling and unlike almost any other contemporary novel despite its minor shortcomings the unique voice tone and unfailing gaze onto a depraved character makes it linger in your head","386":"carmela ciuraru said of the people in the trees that it may be 'less a novel to love than to admire for its sheer audacity ' i did not 'love' or love reading this book which i found utterly disturbing and squirm inducing but i can't help admiring hanya yanagihara for her exquisite writing and the unbelievable scope of her book i won't stop thinking about this one for a long time","387":"clever","388":"i found this book extremely unpleasant to read the only reason i kept reading was i really wanted to see what happened but so many of the supposed revelations were telegraphed early and then unfortunately turned out as i'd expected that i basically just feel like i wasted my time","389":"all sorts of ethical questions come to the forefront while reading this unique story that is entertaining even while having a very unlikable narrator great writing for a debut novel","390":"one sentence summary the novel follows the life of a scientist who makes a nobel prize winning discovery while exploring a lost micronesian culture recounts the events that lead eventually to his arrest for sexual abuse short review told from the brilliant and multi layered perspective of the scientist the novel is part beautifully told adventure part a look at an anthropological examination of a fascinating culture and ideas of moral relativism and equal parts a look inside a disturbed and sociopathic mind the tribe and island is created so realistically as is our narrator that the book was almost impossible to put down this book was disturbing and difficult to read at times but it rocked my world favorite parts the depiction of the dreamers on the island the maniacal footnotes by norton's colleague and friend the tension between norton and victor the cover and the masterful story telling","391":"i really enjoyed reading this book but was dissatisfied with the ending if this book is really a study of a great man who does something awful then i'm not sure that it made its argument that perina was actually a great man maybe it's a generational bias and an understanding of current research ethics but he never showed a respect for human life this may have enabled an amazing scientific discovery but does that justify what he found he was very naive not to anticipate the destruction of the island and the culture the storytelling here though i found amazing it read with such detail and richness that i kept forgetting it was fiction how does one make this story up","392":"i would not have read this if i knew what the subject matter was it was very hard to read objectively and how else could you relate to the main character i hope that the book was a character study and not what is seemed like at time something from a genre of soft porn i would rather think didn't exist","393":"beautifully written and fascinating account of a life lived in the pursuit of science but also a sad and deeply disturbing book when i finished the last page i felt like i wanted to get up and drive to the library and throw the book away into the drop box as quickly as possible but yet i had been totally engrossed in the story and enjoyed reading it complex questions here about scientific and anthropological research in an age of global economy mankind's never ending quest for immortality cultural boundaries of normal sexual activity and the degree to which scientific genius will excuse otherwise inexcusable and sociopathic behavior","394":"this is a disturbing and complex novel tinged with history and fantasy the central character is brilliant twisted and arrogant yet something about the story was very compelling hanya yanagihara writes well and i suspect her future books will be even better","395":"a challenging read that i struggled with at times ultimately interesting more than enjoyable","396":"i knew within the first pages that this book was going to end up on the favorites list told thru a colleague of the main character sharing that scientist's memoirs sent in installments while serving the prison sentence for the crimes described within the prologue heavy use of footnotes remind you that you're hearing this second hand through a narrator due to the incarceration of the memoirist far from being distracting they drive and frame the story perfectly then there is the whole story itself a biologist an undiscovered tribe a little bit of fantasy presented as completely believeable science a fall from grace a little bit of commentary on the western tendency to take everything to the extreme and in the process destroy it just an amazing engrossing story truly fantastic","397":"absolutely incredible a fascinating read with a rather shocking ending highly recommended","398":"i don't think it's probably fair to rate it since i didn't finish it but suffice it to say that it deserved this new shelf creation boring","399":" i'm fine with having no likable characters in a novel i'm fine with drawn out scientific processes i'm fine with morally reprehensible acts as a part of a plot i just could not make myself care about this book and it's characters though the intro tells you exactly what will happen and then it takes another 325 pages to get all of that accomplished the final closure piece sums it all up and there's really no reason to read anything in the middle the main character is so slow in his 'genius' that's its painful to wait for him to get around to figuring things out his process of retelling them there were aspects of the story i felt that could have been much more interesting or engaging that we're barely mentioned although i understand it's meant to be written by a dry aloof scientist so i understand their being omitted in that regard i feel like the base ideas of plot and setting had potential but could have been better or more interestingly conveyed","400":"fascinating read","401":"i am really surprised that this is a debut novel this book was so hard to rate and i really had to think about it it is an excellent book but i despised the main narrator so i had to watch myself from not rating it a 1 or 2 star i can not wait to see what this author has in store for future books i would definitely read another book from this author","402":" so hum 99% of the plot is on the hardcover flap if you don't have a hardcover it's all spelled out in the first 10 pages so forget about anything as pedestrian as suspense norton perrina our protag is of a sort that deserves a label like humbert humbert you're never going to like him unless you're a perv and actually identify with him so what shall we call these sorts of characters i'm leaning toward uurp unlikeable unfeeling repulsive protagonists which if you're wondering should be pronounced like someone ralphing after a long night's drinking in norton's case we need to add borderline sociopath also so ya i doubt seriously you're going to like the guy so now we have removed two of the crucial things to a really good story a character you can in some way empathize with and suspense the third thing one might read a book like this for is some illumination of the times in which he lived norton's lifespan is 1924 to at least 1998 but this story might have occurred in a vacuum as far as that goes nothing of the times is even much shown or hinted at we see the islands and we see norton's labs and that's really pretty much it well then are there some interesting relationships explored throughout the book no not really norton and his brother owen threaten early on to show something worth exploring but this plotline is dropped rather expeditiously norton and tallent the anthropologist then no only norton's rather puerile and unobservant view of he who must not be removed from his pedestal norton's view of pretty much all women is degraded and he never has an adult relationship with one so no no relationships people are objects to norton so why read this book what else is there i haven't an answer for you unless you like spending hours crawling around in the fantastically whitewashed rotting memory palace of a creep","403":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was such a beautifully written book part of me wishes the story wasn't such an ugly topic after finishing it i read that it was loosely based on a true story which was even more upsetting the narrative was so engrossing and perina was such a strange character i really had no idea what would happen at the end i wish that this wasn't the author's first book so i could read more by her that said i look forward to what she writes next","404":" yet another case where the star rating system is flawed i wouldn't really say i liked this book but i thought it was really good it's the story of a fictional scientist who travels to a fictional island in micronesia in the 1950's it's written as a fake memoir edited by a friend of the scientists it explores themes of moral relativism sociopathy misogyny and colonialism from the start it is pretty clear that the book covers some really dark shit and i wouldn't read it if you want any kind of feel good story in lots of ways this is really a horror story about a monster the descriptions of simple things like fruit falling from a tree are brilliant and grotesque the heat is oppressive the smells the egos all brimming off the page the narrator is unreliable and unlikeable but very readable at times i was really uncomfortable but i still wanted to finish it i don't know if i would recommend this i don't want people to think i condone the fucking awful behaviour but on the other hand it is truly thought provoking and very well done","405":"ok i seldom bail out of a book past the halfway point but i was just never really caught up in this one and then i looked over at the new dave eggers and malcolm gladwell books on my nightstand and decided life's just too short to slog through something i'm not enjoying","406":" this was an interesting and disturbing story bekka in her review brought up the back story on the real nobel prize winner dr daniel carleton gajdusek and the very close parallels to norton's situation and as in the case of many fictional accounts this novel builds to a climax that allows a possible understanding of a difficult to accept personality early in norton's account he describes his childhood practice of torturing his mother by his pretence with his twin owen of waving to her and then subsequently denying seeing her in a chillingly mean way taking advantage of his mother's lack of focus and mental acuity and norton is horrifyingly unconscious of the pathology of his incredible actions presaging the rest of the book norton's disdain for the thoughts and feelings of others his detachment from the pain he casually inflicts on his laboratory animals and his acquaintances his monumental ego is remarkably illustrated by his comment later in the story after he contaminates the native u'ivuian fa'a with contact with the most significant taboo in their culture condemning fa'a to a horrifying fate that leads fa'a to painful suicide had i been a less sensitive person i surely would have succumbed to laughter many of the reviews here find it very distasteful to accept the story of 'genius' granting license to an individual to live outside the norms of society but in fact history is replete with actual cases like this including the titillating lives of the rich and famous that occupy so much of our popular culture and the story certainly raises this issue an aside on this situation norton's accomplishment is almost trivial there is no evidence of genius in his actions before or after his insight that the eating of the flesh of the sacred turtle leads to dramatic life extension his singular accomplishment is to violate the sensibilities and specific strictures of his native hosts the leader of the anthropological expedition he is a part of and the singular native guide who is most kind and solicitous of his welfare to steal the flesh of the turtle and feed it to lab animals and note their subsequent remarkable longevity the questions raised by the preface are addressed obliquely throughout and finally resolved in a way that make this story a psychological mystery well disguised by a very effective immersion in a totally foreign and exotic culture and location and narrated by totally foreign and disturbing but convincing personality","407":"excellent book word of warning the narrator is an absolutely appalling individual a narcissistic sociopath who just tries to sounds so eminently reasonable and ugh he's just terrible but if you like unreliable narrators and terrible people as the 'hero' of the story and in the faux editor's mind he is a hero which just adds an extra layer of disturbing to the whole thing then this is a book and a half","408":"bizarre story about norton perina a young doctor who joins an anthropological group looking on a remote pacific island for a people who seem to live forever he becomes famous because of this winning the nobel prize he adopts children from the island and later is accused of sexually abusing them odd book parts morally upsetting to me but great writing","409":"this could be the pulitzer this year in the land of vomit that i consider the current 'mommy chronicles or blogs' online there is nothing more refreshing than a narcissist's parenting perspectives i actually found myself laughing out loud during some of these passages a very well done story of the true damage this type of personality can do in all situations from their own living room to the faraway jungle where one little turtle allowed for 'the shot to be heard around the world '","410":" an unsettling and excellent book a doctor and an anthropologist descend upon an undiscovered pacific island in the 1950s where a medical miracle waits deep in the jungle you can probably already tell this is going to end badly for everyone involved my only complaint involves the pacing some middle chapters are far too long in leading up to the scientific discovery especially considering we know exactly what it is from page 1 then later dramatic events are compressed and glossed in what was for me unsatisfying fashion this later part of the book is where most of the unsettling comes in it seems as if the author herself did not want to dwell in these realms for too long all the big themes are here evil moral relativism scientific rapacity for the natural world power control it's the full mfa checklist if that's not enough or if that's too much there is always not one but two unreliable narrators one tucked inside the other attention must be paid final warning avoid at all costs if you need your main characters likable","411":" i ended up not liking this very much at all unlike others the shortcomings of the main character were not the fatal flaw i also kind of liked the notes the assistant added the book summary suggests that the story deals with discovery of the lost tribe and the ethical questions this raises truthfully this is only the first half of the book which was quite good the travel to the island and the initial discovery along with all of the personal interplay was a great start to what could have been an interesting book i will say that it did not raise any ethical pondering a for me as the author comes down clearly on one side of the debate the second half was quite boring and predictable for me the truth is not slowly revealed it was obvious from the beginning and almost a complete waste of time","412":" this book kept me reading i can't say that it was anything in particular no character i loved no shocking circumstance no stunning use of language no crazy hook the thing is the secondary narrator the book is a narrative plopped within a narrative at the start reveals what this book is about and as you read you're just reading the story that was promised until you get to the omitted footnote in the latter half of the book that deals with the kids norton adopted there are many footnotes in this book the omitted footnote is submitted finally at the very end and the secondary narrator warns us that it is a detail of a thing that shouldn't make a difference at all to the supposed vindication he's trying to give norton by publishing his life's story except it does matter which is the truly bizarre thing about this book the omitted piece of story affects how other pieces of it should have been voiced by our real world author so to me this plot twist just seems cheap which is sad because i can see that it's meant to be profound hmm anyway 3 5 if the footnote just wouldn't have been a footnote if it had been included in the regular narrative this book would have had a much higher rating for me if it had been there and then affected the rest of norton's testimony as i believe the fictional norton was clearly truly affected it would have been so much better more powerful vulnerable and a better exploration alas so frustrating a let down","413":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i didn't really know anything about this book going in i know this book is not for everyone but i liked it i can't say that i enjoyed it because the subject matter is so disturbing but it was a great read at first what annoyed me the most about this book is that it was unbelievable that a doctor would write a memoir with this kind of language it was extremely well written towards the end i changed my mind and i realized that was the whole point of this book you're going along and yo i didn't really know anything about this book going in i know this book is not for everyone but i liked it i can't say that i enjoyed it because the subject matter is so disturbing but it was a great read at first what annoyed me the most about this book is that it was unbelievable that a doctor would write a memoir with this kind of language it was extremely well written towards the end i changed my mind and i realized that was the whole point of this book you're going along and you're lost in an adventure you're lost in flowery prose you're lost in this mystery and before you know it a sociopath has his hands around your throat i didn't realize how crazy perina was at first when i realized how horrible he was i started highlighting phrases that were just not right that showed how horrible a person he was you almost wouldn't know it there's something off about everything and because it's told from his point of view the true events are hidden underneath there are words and phrases that reveal the true nature of the narrator and it's terrifying i thought this was an amazing piece of writing the closest comparison i can make is to lolita by nabokov here you are sucked into this adventure mystery and you are on the side of the narrator if you're not careful you could possibly believe the narrator until the end i'm sure the ending is controversial i'm surprised that it was actually included since it revealed the truth about the mystery the narrator molested his adopted son in many ways i'm grateful for this because then you definitively know what happened also i think this helps the reader go back and see the narrator for who he is the author used very specific word choices throughout showing much restraint but also showing the true nature of the narrator the novel may have been more powerful as a mystery if the mystery was never revealed however i feel it was necessary to show the strength of the writing however the confession at the end didn't totally make sense on one hand i can't believe the narrator would ever confess to this crime however since the narrator is clearly a psychopath i'm sure he thought what he was doing was right the entire time my biggest complaint with this book was that the first half was a bit of a slog and the writing was a bit too writerly i felt the author was showing off a bit also because of the style of the book a memoir the book was quite dense especially with all the heavy prose i wish there would have been more dialogue to break up the long dense descriptions since dialogue doesn't work in a memoir i wish the book would have been a bit shorter however once i got to the middle of the book i couldn't stop reading i can't wait to discuss this at book club i think we'll have a great discussion i also think it's crazy that this based on a true story more","414":"i loved reading this book but was disappointed by the ending i felt it took an unnecessary turn which put into question the entire narration perhaps the author was going for shock value but the book would have been better without it","415":"one of the only books i've finished where i despised the main character narrator throughout you just love to hate him","416":" shelfnotes com reviewdear reader every now and then you read a book and after you've finished you sit there wondering if you liked it or not this was one of those books the people in the trees is very well written has all the makings of a good novel including adventure science culture even a little bit of mystery the book is essentially about this scientist who is invited to join an anthropologist to an island rumored to contain a lost tribe before we even get to this plot line we're introduced to the scientist's associate who is the narrator of the book even before that we're introduced to the scientist through a scandal involving him and some children yes he was accused of inappropriate relationships with some of his children who've been adopted by him this is all within the first few chapters after that the narrator his associate wants to clear his name and tell the story of a great scientist who did wonderful things and adopted children from this mysterious island children who would have become destitute what i loved about this book was the vivid way the hana yanagihara describes this tribe the people the language the customs the novelty of it clearly this is a book that involves so many controversial topics if we come upon a hidden society tribe should it be kept a secret when first introduced to the tribe you notice that the people have it together more than we do even they hunt gather trade live love all the things that satiate our needs in life can technology bring them easier ways of doing things un complicating tasks that take time and effort yes should we bring this technology them to better their lives this is a question that gets answered in the book and they results are rather interesting technology can be a dangerous thing especially when brought into the wrong hands it brought this question to my mind are morals and ethics culturally relative i'd be inclined to say they aren't but this is a question that could create week long discussions click here for the rest of the review","417":"another one i couldn't finish unlikable characters i just wasn't interested","418":"i felt a nonspecific cultural pressure to like it but i really didn't enjoyed reading it","419":"maybe more like a 4 5 the description got a bit tedious at times though i mostly enjoyed the language deeply disturbing deeply moving","420":" this was an amazing writing at the beginning i felt there was a bit too much explanation but after wading through i couldn't put it down i went on an astonishing mind boggling journey throughout these pages i loved it and there were parts i hated i loved the way in which the words danced in a smooth waltz into my mind and heart and how discovery of a new land and people induced a curiosity and desire to know more about the unknown with a desire to be part of it all i hated the action of one man who we came to realize failed those who trusted him most the children he of such brilliance known as a genius won a noble prize and yet failed at being an honorable man his idea of loving them in his mind was a great gift yet to the world and i it was sinister and the worse of the worse the characters played their part so well i found i hated those i hated with a vengeance and the ones i loved i felt enlightened by there were characters that stood out that i felt compassion for and wanted to help and understand their own unique plight and some i wished i had not met at all this was an unusual read finding that i loved such an iniquitous tale could not put it down and harbored such hatred for one man and yet the desire to understand what caused his demise this is a book that touched emotions deep within my spirit and heart and not one i shall forget anytime soon i won this book via goodreads frist reads and i appreciate the opportunity to read such an awe inspiring writing","421":" this book encompasses everything a novel should be and it is done so flawlessly and exquisitely i don't even know how to express how perfectly written this novel is the atmosphere yanagihara created for this newly explored island and the tone of our main protagonist norton is exactly what it should be she is able to portray norton's condescending attitude while portraying his level of curiosity and his perspective of the world he is obviously not supposed to be a likeable character and his intelligence definitely alters his opinions to what may be considered 'normal' and understandable so if it's so perfect why not 5 stars i was creeped out by a lot of what happened it's not a bad creepy okay it actually kind of is but not like horror creepy but more like an eerie creepy the indigenous people particularly the dreamers were odd and weird and kind of scary certain aspects of the culture were just plain disturbing i tried my best to not be judgmental about their rituals and whatnot as i know that is falling exactly into the trap that yanagihara is vaguely referring to as part of the whole premise of the book the notion that outsiders should not come in and trample already existing societies and ruin their lifestyle perhaps it was her method of testing us to see how messed up things could be in the eyes of civilized society but ultimately stepping in to change their culture leads to devastation of all that could be beautiful i'm talking about the actual scenery here like the lush jungles filled with gross sounding fruit this then ties into norton himself there are constant references to how going to a new place would change the person norton embodies that he who had no motivation and no dreams explored this new land and lived in a completely new world for 4 whole months by the time he returned to the states he was a changed man he had something to do and an interest regardless of how controversial it was it makes sense that he was stuck in such a position where anything he did would turn out 'bad ' as he did bring back a part of a this alternate world to his own world which simply should never have been allowed to have happened this isn't even speaking in the religious sense that is highlighted in the novel but attempting to dissect a culture and figure out all logistics of it can only lead to the demise of said culture being presented the beauty of something new and unknown as well as the culture he so carefully observed ultimately changed norton into a kind of man who still patronizing and condescending started to lose touch with what was expected of a human in a civilized society i think it's highly plausible to think that he himself no longer fit in society just like the mo'o kua'aus","422":"the author is absolutely masterful at what she does but that does not make it any more pleasant to read i found it cleansing to read interviews with the author after i finished this book","423":"i'm just in a mood right now where if a book doesn't grab me in the first 30 pages i put it down and don't pick it back up and this book fell victim to that mood i thought the writing was fantastic in its consistency and unique the story seemed like it would be really interesting but i just wasn't hooked maybe i'll pick it up again when i'm in a different mood","424":"i suppose it's a personal fault but i just can't enjoy a book whose protagonist however much we are meant to hate him is a pederast i want to scrub my brain","425":" 2 1 2 stars norton perina is a young doctor who accompanies a group of anthropologists to the tiny micronesian island of ivu'ivu in the 1950's while on the island they discover a lost tribe whose members lived much longer than a normal lifespan norton is able to deduce that the cause for their excessively long life spans is the eating of a rare turtle opa'ivu'eke while the members of the tribe live long lives with good physical health they all experience dementia norton smuggling a turtle home conducts lab research to prove his theory publishes his research and sets off a storm of research and destruction on the island initially i found the people in the trees written as if it is the autobiography of norton and edited by a colleague with helpful footnotes fascinating hanya yanagihara writes with talent and brilliance the descriptions of the jungles and wildlife of ivu'ivu are saturated with stunning richness vivid colors and sounds the discovery of the unique tribe of people was enthralling once norton returns to the united states and begins his research the novel begins to lag but i was still interested in the scientific discovery and the aftermath however towards the end of the book the story shifts to norton's personal life and the 40 some children that he adopted from ivu'ivu and its neighboring island u'ivu while there had been earlier foreshadowing in the previous sections and i read with trepidation and dread at the eventual conclusion i was still overwhelmed by the descriptions and justification of norton as a pedophile for me the novel was ruined by this it lost the earlier magic that had been achieved during the time in the jungles and with the people of ivu'ivu","426":"ultimately engaging highly disturbing","427":"around the world in 52 books micronesian island of ivu'ivu","428":" really a 4 5 this was a very difficult book to read in that it is an extremely well constructed meditation on moral and cultural relativism and ambiguity in a way this book was a perfect companion to euphoria by lily king addressing many of the ethical questions about historical anthropology in a way that king's volume did not not to its detriment euphoria was an extremely well written character driven story the structure the plotting the delivery i had basically no complaints about the way this book was put together challenging unsettling and at times horrifying certainly worth the emotional struggle definitely hard to believe this is a debut novel yanagihara writes as though she's been putting out books for years","429":"really good finished it in a 3 day binge the last chapter is a chilling but the twist was perhaps to be expected definitely a great vacation read esp for those who are a fan of moral relativism","430":" for the most part not so much science fiction as social science fiction that then turns more science fiction y margaret mead meets h p lovecraft in a nutshell having read my fair share of anthropological texts and watched my fair share of grindhouse movies about euro americans getting their post imperialist come uppance at the hands of remote tribes i'd say yanagihara gets both modes spot on if occasionally doing the former too well and erring on the side of long winded anthropological narration the unreliability of the narration is pretty fiendish","431":"exceptionally creative and beautifully written an engrossing and sobering story of moral hubris and the quest for immortality very much recommended","432":"this book is incredible it is magical thought provoking challenging and relevant to the times the best book i've read in a long time it is what happens when culture collides when science disrupts nature beautiful story of the tribes of a remote island and what happens when scientists set out to discover their secret rituals behind eternal life the book will hit the shelves in august make sure you are at your local bookstore when it does","433":"this really was one of the best books i've read in a while it was very detailed and very anthropological but because it was written and then revised by two very unreliable biased narrators there was always a creepy and provocative undertone i can't believe this was her debut novel","434":"at least wow so much is still going on in my brain some reflection on this one is required","435":"interesting premise but 384 pages is far too many to slog through when none of the characters have any redeeming qualities","436":" fresh out of medical school in 1950 dr norton perina longs to study disease over working with patients when given the opportunity to accompany anthropologist paul tallent on an expedition to ivu'ivu an unexplored island in micronesia dr perina gladly accepts over time the americans discover a group of islanders that live much longer than average humans but with progressively declining mental health believing the long lifespan of the ivu'ivu is caused by a turtle native to the island dr perina brings one back to the states setting off a chain of events that eventually lead to both a nobel prize and his imprisonment hanya yanagihara's first novel is framed by narration from dr ronald kubodera dr perina's protege who has received a manuscript of the dr 's autobiography which he wrote from prison the majority of the people in the trees is made up of dr perina's autobiography with clarifying footnotes from dr kubodera detailing his childhood schooling and study of the people of ivu'ivu yanagihara's creative framework allows the novel to read more like a lyrical diary than a piece of fiction make no mistake peeking inside that diary is not always pleasant it's clear from the start of the the people in the trees that dr perina is an unreliable narrator he's in prison for heinous crimes some of which he's willing to claim while he sidesteps others beginning with his time among the people of ivu'ivu and particularly more so after dr perina's moral compass is constantly skewed making many of his decisions quite unsettling to read but the novel's difficult subjects make it possible for yanagihara to highlight themes like discovery morality and humanity in complicated questions that beg to be turned over and discussed the amount of research and careful planning that went into this debut is remarkable and yanagihara should prepare for the mountains of praise she is sure to receive blog www rivercityreading com","437":"hanya yanagihara's descriptions of norton perina's journey to an isolated island mirrors barbara kingsolver's description of the price family's journey to the congo both authors transport you to a lush and uncharted world with mystery and danger around every turn perina learns of an island rumored to be inhabited by people living many decades longer than the average human due to eating a particular type of turtle he journeys to this island with two fellow scientists a male which pleases him and a female which does not as his journey begins memories of norton's childhood and interest in becoming a scientist unfold upon arrival on the island they learn of strange fruits and the separation of the villagers from the dreamers when tribe members reach the age of sixty they are allowed to eat some of the sacred turtle meat and their lives are extended however they are turned away from the settlement and are sent to live in the wilds of the island the customs of the tribe are viewed and recorded by the scientists while these rituals are shocking to the reader it raises the topic of post colonialism and the conversion of multitudes throughout history to acceptable behaviors read my full review here http www ivoryowlreviews blogspot c","438":"couldn't finish very dark pedophiliac narrator with no empathy who experiments on animals and humans the writing is amazing but still i had to quit reading i never make it through lolita either so that is the kind of reader i am i guess","439":"i really enjoyed this book and would like to read the visual version because i never absorb books that well aurally","440":"the people in the trees was on the publishers weekly top ten books of 2013 list and it's on the tournament of books list for 2014 it's written like an annotated memoir based on letters from jail about a scientist who does research on immortality on a newly discovered micronesian tribe so the style is cool you would almost think it was real non fiction but its all fiction and therefore a novel i even got tricked a few times into looking up books that are mentioned they don't exist nothing is real but throughout the reading of the book i would forget the scientist is really unlikeable you know at the beginning that he is in jail for abusing his children but you don't know the story or if it's true until the end along the way though view spoiler along with imaginative jungle descriptions and tribal culture are pretty explicit rape scenes of boys not frequent but more than one the author made them central to the plot i ended the novel feeling like i'd witnessed something awful something that since it didn't even happen i never needed to have read so unnecessary so okay my question is this is this brilliance if i'm shaken to the core or was i just manipulated could it have had the same emotional impact without those scenes or if she'd implied them either way the author willingly put it there i think i hated it yet feel like i was supposed to i'm having a hard time deciding if this is good writing or lazy writing kind of like ya where the worst possible scenario has happened only instead of the story being about the victim it is about the perpetrator hide spoiler this book was also discussed on the reading envy podcast episode 01","441":"all i can say is if you are easily disturbed don't read this those with a strong constitution will enjoy it it is not an easy story to like but it is beautifully written and thought provoking likely to start fist fights at book clubs","442":"i loved it but it's definitely not for everyone review to follow","443":"i was fairly traumatized by this book the narrator is perhaps the least likeable fictional character i have ever come across and yet though thoroughly shocking nothing in the narrative felt superfluous the questions it raises are as important as they are difficult to answer what happens when the capacity for greatness coincides with the capacity for grave wrong how much are we willing to forgive in our heroes where does one draw the line between maintaining respect for different cultures and asserting objective standards of right and wrong easy reading this is not but it is intricately written and in it's own weird way beautiful","444":"i only made it halfway through this book i just could not stand anymore of the endless descriptions of this boring imaginary jungle tried i'm sure there was a point to it all but i will never know it","445":"the only reason i'm refraining from saying that i hated this book is that the writing was good however the narrator was lacking in any insight smug horrible and entirely unlikeable it's hard to spend 300 pages completely unable to stand the narrator the only reason i kept going was the good writing and the hope of some redemption at the end which never came","446":" this is a strange book but not as strange as i had anticipated it being the fictional story of a young man norton perina who tags along with an anthropological research group into the jungles of the island of ivu'ivu in search of a lost tribe is unique add to that the discovery of \"the fountain of youth\" through the consumption of a local turtle and you've got a story teeming with magical possibilities though the tribe has its share of strange customs and the turtle itself particularly stands out the story is a fairly straight forward narrative a biography about the man who went on to win a nobel and subsequently was jailed for molestation charges in the case of the people in the trees the novel's best quality is also its one downfall i love that the entire story is told as a memoir it works exceptionally well it allows a minor character editor and friend of perina to pepper perina's memoir with what could be unreliable narration at the same time it makes the whole story feel more credible footnotes abound providing ample information both real and fictional yanagihara made a very wise decision choosing this format for the book at the same time the structure was not always true to itself especially toward the end the true biographical nature of the book was sacrificed for the story the tone of the memoir no longer matches the media in order to forward the story the once professional perina becomes overly confessional and sentimental would perina include such elaborate scenes of dialogue from his personal life in a book he intends on releasing to the public what friend of perina's would allow such personal details though it would've taken some work i think the author could've sacrificed some of the clearer story and stayed true to the biographical format of the work yes it would've forced her readers to make their own conjectures possibly misunderstanding the novel or disliking it because of its unclear intent but it would've fit i think yanagihara is a talented enough author to have pulled it off in spite of and because of its challenging form the people in the trees is an exceptional debut it elicits questions about morality from its readers on many different levels certainly not a book for the casual reader seeking a riveting story the people in the trees is a slow build up of \"what if\"s and \"what about\"s and if you're \"fortunate\" enough to find perina's opa'ivu'eke turtle you'll have hundreds of years of think these questions over","447":" semi spoiler alert this was a strange and sometimes wondrous book it had one of my favorite literary devices an unreliable narrator and in fact it takes that construct one level further and used that device well to make the reader squirm as with lolita it is a very uncomfortable read where you are pulled into the worldview of a pedophile who is shockingly amoral in his actions unlike lolita it is set in a mystical setting deep in the jungles of uivu a fictional island among a previously undiscovered tribe the novel is at its best when it follows the protagonist on his original journey immersing you in the menace and wonder of exploring a place and culture for which you have not reference point","448":"as with the dinner this is a difficult novel to say i liked it was at turns fascinating and disturbing and i kept having to remind myself it was fiction though based loosely on a true story it will stay with me and the author is definitely a talented writer and her voice made the book difficult to put away from though certainly not enjoyable the nytimes review said many readers many finish feeling conflicted and that is how i feel","449":"an intense at times uncomfortable read i loved it for the anthropological aspects and the way yanagihara develops the main character a person i really disliked but wanted to keep reading about","450":" it is very difficult to rate and review this book i'm somewhere between 2 and 3 stars i liked i but have some real criticism of its subject matter this novel is styled as the heavily footnoted memoir of a fictional and controversial nobel prize winning scientist the footnotes were added by his loyal assistant before publication the scientist norton perina is credited with discovering immortality among a population of people on an island in the south pacific their immortality is created by their ingestion of the meat of a specific turtle but is accompanied by a steadily declining mental state thus these individuals can live for 100s of years but end up barely human as they lose their memories and most cognitive abilities that we consider to make us human at the center of the story though is perina who seems barely human himself he has almost no capacity to feel empathy or sympathy for others it's not that he feels no emotion but he feels inappropriate emotions almost all the time and he has no ability to look inward and self assess his lack of self awareness causes much pain and suffering for those around him both on and off the island the hard part about this book is the underlying pedophilia with which the novel opens and that persists throughout the story in the first few pages we learn that perina is convicted and sentenced to prison for molesting children he adopted from the island the thing is that the book would have raised important ethical moral issues without the pedophilia for some people those passages will be extremely difficult to read and i think that story line is unnecessary to making this novel satisfying and thought provoking this was a compelling read and i had no trouble finishing it but i'm not sure i can recommend it because of the sensitive subject matter","451":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i have been pondering this book for several days since finishing and i'm still not sure what my final thoughts are i thought this was a very well done book but i'm not sure that i liked it the audio version includes footnotes from the text that break up the narrative in a way that disturbs the experience of hearing perina's letters i don't quite find the moral ambiguity that others have mentioned i believe perina is a bad man even in his youth the cruelty to his mother in college hearing i have been pondering this book for several days since finishing and i'm still not sure what my final thoughts are i thought this was a very well done book but i'm not sure that i liked it the audio version includes footnotes from the text that break up the narrative in a way that disturbs the experience of hearing perina's letters i don't quite find the moral ambiguity that others have mentioned i believe perina is a bad man even in his youth the cruelty to his mother in college hearing the joy he took breaking the necks of the mice in the lab his scientific work and discovery were only a means to bring him power and prestige he didn't have any concerns about the lives of the islanders or thought about the impact on the world the final chapter of the book was truly disturbing and horrifying ultimately the book leaves me with a lot of questions about not just perina and his adopted children but also tallent and definitely kubodera this would make an interesting book discussion as you are left with questions and thoughts about progress what it means to be alive and to be human colonialism etc more","452":"recommended by cheryle who says it is an amazing debut novel check our catalog https encore cooklib org iii encore","453":" wow something new this is original and weird and good and gross and creepy and good did i say great in this genre bender a nobel winning scientist goes along on a trip to learn about a little micronesian i think island with its own indigenous people with their unique culture ecology traditions etc a turtle is discovered that the people eat and it makes them essentially live forever while gradually completely destroying their cognitive functions lots of science anthropology ethnology biology botany zoology biochemistry genetics etc our protagonist is a bad guy even though most of the time his bad nature is sorta kept under wraps but he is definitely a bad guy something i really liked about this book is the subtle attacks made on science in academia including the whole lameness of journals articles who gets credit etc and the subtle and not so subtle attacks on how animals are treated in labs reviewed on book talk podcast http bit ly 1xv7gvx","454":"from slate's summer reading list 2014","455":"i found this novel to be absolutely captivating the tale's anti hero is both sympathetic and repulsive the metaphor yanagihara spins is one that is quite relevant to the modern age and a dead on illustration of the west's traditional ways of interacting with less developed societies the novel is this author's first i hope that she will write many more simply outstanding","456":" there are seventeen books in the tournament of books tobx this year at this point i have read four and i have started two more it is clear that i am not going to get them all read by the time the contest actually starts but i am doing better this year than last i will continue to try and get them all read since the four i have finished have really set my brain whirling yanagihara's book is one that i might have picked up without tobx my book group only discusses women authors and i am always trying to find something to stretch our sphere of reading i am not convinced that i could talk our book group into reading this one but i am glad i read it apparently nobel prize winner daniel carleton gajdusek was accused of sexually molesting a minor back in the 1990's that is fact i don't remember the news story but hanya yanagihara did her family had known gajdusek and yanagihara says that i always thought he was far too good of a character to squander to time pw interview august 2013 yanagihara spent two decades working on this novel i found this novel very disturbing but also compelling norton perina's memoir is the view of a world that never existed but a place all anthropologists would have liked to have found perina is on the expedition to do medical testing but he does so much more the straight forward telling of his tale is incredibly imaginative and well written there are a few slow parts in the middle but as i look back i wouldn't change how this book unfolds readers who are willing to be left with lots of questions should pick this novel up perina's life his encounters with a lost people his research on longevity and most important his interactions with other humans are fascinating yanagihara's creates a protagonist that i would not want to meet but norton perina will haunt my life for awhile he seems very real very possible","457":"whew tough but compellingly readable this story of a scientific expedition for both sociological and medical research to a remote pacific island in the 1950s details the damage done to an isolated and therefore untouched innocent place and people by arrogant westerners who mean no harm but cause it anyway the narrator is one of the scientists who recounts the story of the expedition as a memoir of justification decades later he is unlikable to say the least detached and egocentric to the point of sociopathy the writing is masterful the descriptions of the jungle and the people the doctor encounters are precise beautiful and astoundingly negative since it is told in the first person by someone whose judgment is called into doubt early and who is writing from prison the compulsion for the reader to find out what happened to sift through the narrator's self justification and arrive at our own conclusions is overwhelming","458":"an extraordinary novel maybe maybe a real review later on","459":" i won this book in a giveaway thank you publishers \"the people in the trees\" is highly creative dense and intellectual writing definitely not an easy read descriptions are immensely vivid create graphic scenes in the reader's mind to the point of smelling them at times too graphic i even wondered how the editing process worked the story manipulates the reader's anxiety level as it challenges with depictions of seemingly mundane routines of the newly found culture with provocative ethics and rituals the writer starts with the appalling accusations against the main character essentially an anti hero but puts them aside for sharing his diary immersed in the tribe's environment its detailed account conveying the main character's sincere and blunt emotions that draw disconcert and sometimes take the reader aback the end completes the circle slapping with indignation and empathy the book will question your beliefs raise your brow and butterflies in the stomach powerful audacious and provoking","460":"shocking and shockingly good","461":"i don't know how i am giving this highly disturbing and fascinating novel less than five stars but i am maybe it's for the disturbing part of the book narrator and misanthrope norton perina who tells you the story of his life damning himself with virtually every word norman and his brother owen grown up in a tiny midwestern town while both are determined to break away from their small lives they choose different paths owen becomes a professor and poet while norton hews to his first love science becoming a doctor having no interest in treating patients norton is offered a position with an anthropological expedition to a tropical island where many of the natives are said to live incredibly long lives norton becomes inextricably wound up in the destiny of the island itself as well as the islanders his key discovery that consumption of a special turtle meat will lead to near immortality ruins the rainforest island results in the eradication of these turtles and leads to the decay of the native culture possibly as an appeasement and possibly because he has very little understanding of his own character norton ends up adopting some 40 island children to raise as his own in the beginning of the book we meet norton as he has been arrested for molesting his own children and is thrown in jail for the crime the man responsible for encouraging norton to write his life story is a friendly former research assistant who annotates norton's biography with pithy footnotes relative to scientific publications other biographies and notes the reader does not learn until the end whether or not norton is guilty of the crime he was charged with certainly he was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to two years in prison the mild sentence a result of his advanced age by then the reader has had the chance to make up his her mind many times over this is a truly fascinating book and is possibly one of the best first novels i've ever read norton intrigues even as he repels and i put the book down wondering whether his devotion to science justified all the havoc he had wreaked should some mysteries be left alone or should scientific exploration shine a light over the world and what obligation do you have to a society that has been disturbed by more modern men finally is a brilliant mind reason enough for tolerating extraordinary behavior i still don't have the answers and clearly neither does norton perina","462":"started out as a great story i just could not completely relate to the main character i think the book being from the character perspective ruinted the whole idea behind what was an otherwise great story idea","463":"note to self read this after you finish the book http www publishersweekly com 8080","464":"fascinating disturbing not for everyone overall an impressive debut still thinking about it","465":"it's difficult to write a review of this book suffice it to say that it's a multi layered self portrait smoothly told of an egomaniac whose selfishness and myopia devastate not only the individuals he touches directly but also an entire society if you can bear the challenge of that premise then you can also enjoy for a while an ethnographic adventure story his journey into the remote south pacific i won't forget this any time soon","466":"this is what great anthropological fiction is all about i was completely surprised by the sheer scope of this book a colonial horror story if there ever was one","467":"except for the ending i adored this book it's masterfully written with great characters and an excellent plot the research done in preparation for writing this book must have been impressive the story is about a previously unknown group of people who live endless lives it's slightly reminiscent of the poisonwood bible and as well done as that","468":"truly odd you will have to suspend a lot of disbelief and i am not sure that i believe the denouement at all you have to begin by believing that it is possible for people on the south sea island of ivu ivu to prolong their lives by eating the flesh of a particular turtle on their sixtieth birthday and subsequently at the sixtieth birthdays of other inhabitants of the island and you have to accept that their consequences of this act that affect the lives of the whole community for hundreds and hundreds of years if you can get passed this then the story becomes a kind of modern morality tale where the consequences of people's actions reverberate in all kinds of ways the action that is devastating is that of a group of anthropologists who take a medical scientist to the island with the intention of accurately recording life and behaviour on the island the scientist smuggles ome turtle meat from the island conducts some experiments and publishes the results there then follows a cataclysm of change affecting the lives of the islanders the anthropologists and the islanders in all kinds of unforeseen ways and the native society is transformed destroyed acculturated as has happened to so many when they come into contact with a more aggressive and powerful culture the centre of the book however is the question about whether the scientist is an objective accurate and trustworthy witness of what he has seen if yes then there is an irony to the story which leads to tragedy and if no then the irony and the tragedy take on a completely different form","469":"i really really have issues with child pornography no matter how it is presented i didn't finish this book it was written masterfully not rating","470":"this book was many things enthralling disgusting frustrating moving that the same book could bring together so many disparate emotions says something about its inherent power the principle character was in many ways a thoroughly unlikeable man yet by the end of the book i couldn't help but feel profound sadness on his behalf even as his most disgusting acts were at last revealed i've never read anything quite like it","471":"i do not like norton perina not because he is a misogynist not because he is condescending or hubristic not because he is obviously capable of sympathy yet unreasonably selective as to whom to honor it to not because of the harm he's done 'in the pursuit of knowledge' willful or incidental not because he destroyed the lives of an entire civilization but i don't hate him either and i think i was supposed to i don't like perina because he bores me and i don't care enough to hate him i'm sorry i love hanya yanagihara conde nast traveler but this was forgettable i was expecting intense psychoanalysis adventure and action packed confrontations with a small lost tribe what i got were extended sentences that could have been well structured paragraphs had they been given enough time for editing it's just irksome when every sentence is like this it's almost like degressing when you don't have enough guts to admit that you have a short attention span see what i did there it's like that in the whole book a hasty hurried unsatisfactory downfall of an entire island group constantly nonchalant voices from both perina and his autobiography editor a supposedly shocking ending and 300 pages of vain expectation 3 stars","472":"there are material in this book which would greatly offend a reader's sensibilities so it needs to be taken in the context that the main protagonist is an anthropologist and what happens in the book is filtered through his mind as a social scientist","473":"i have to gather my thoughts before i review this i thought i disliked the book but that ended up not being the case","474":"i really struggled with this books picked it up put it down and picked it up again and ultimately just gave up i found the main character not to be a very nice person and did not care for the writting style","475":"this book was difficult for me to plow thru it was interesting but a bit tedious for me loved the premise","476":" loved the beginning but quickly found myself losing interest after he left the island after the rich full descriptions of the jungle the people the ceremonies the sparse account of the aftermath seemed quite dull not to mention you realize more and more that the main character is not a great person even though the beginning stated what he was in prison for i had hoped he'd been falsely accused just about killed me to see him fall apart the whole end of the book was depressing and sadly realistic to anyone considering reading this yes i think it was a great book but if you are uncomfortable with harsh topics then steer clear the synopsis skims over his own demons tak ing hold but those demons are pretty repulsive all in all not exactly the book i thought i'd be reading based on the description but good nonetheless","477":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i finished this book just before thanksgiving and it is still vivid in my mind the author hanya yanagihara writes so well that you would never guess this is a debut effort as others have pointed out she basically outlines the plot of

story they will understand his actions the author creates a ch i finished this book just before thanksgiving and it is still vivid in my mind the author hanya yanagihara writes so well that you would never guess this is a debut effort as others have pointed out she basically outlines the plot of her book from the beginning as the protagonist norton perina is writing a letter from prison where he is serving a sentence for child molestation he is certain if the public hears his side of the story they will understand his actions the author creates a character that the reader immediately knows is slightly off and narcissistic definitely self serving her description of norton perina's odd childhood the abusive games he plays with his twin on their mentally impaired mother his technique for killing lab mice during medical school all set the atmosphere and expectation that this is a person of questionable ethics and motivations despite this the author is able to make this dubious character sympathetic once he is taken out of his academic environment he is shrugged off by his medical professors onto a project led by a well known anthropologist paul tallent tallent is taking a team to a small micronesian island of ivu'ivu and he needs a medical member for the mission the island is completely the author's invention and her writing is most inspired and vivid during this portion of the book it is however based loosley the actual island of new guinea the expedition takes place during 1950 and tallent is looking for a rumored people called 'the dreamers' the author's description of the island and the way she allows the new and unseen to render all of the characters unsavory qualities mute because they are overwhelmed by awe fear and suspense is what is still resonates with me i am not sure if this is what will stick with others there is much fodder of the moral sort up for discussion in this book while on the island perina's team does find the 'dreamers' who turn out to be natives of the island who have ingested turtle meat that is particular to the island by eating the meat a person is given extended longevity many of the dreamers turn out to be 150 - 200 years old the team takes some of the dreamers home with them where they are kept secretly in a lock academic lab the dreamers do not seem entirely cognizant of what or where they are but they are still living beings for me this brought to mind the ethics of caring for our elders and extending life beyond memory tough questions the moral question that may overshadow the entire work is that in fact perina turns out to be a child predator due to his eventual fame for 'discovering' the turtle meat perina returns to ivu'ivu multiple times in his capacity as research professor he witnesses the eventual demise of the island due to the sudden influx of interest from the west in the turtle meat and its prospects for the pharmaceutical industry this interest and the amount of outsiders it brings to the island causes the eventual poverty and decimation of the island's natives as a result there are many orphaned children perina begins to adopt them he adopts 32 in total some of whom it turns out he molests while this is a heinous crime by western minds and most minds the author does an excellent set up which brings some nebulousness to his crime while on the island during the initial mission he and tallent's team witnesses a coming of age ceremony which by our standards would qualify as rape of a minor however the initiates do not see it as such is this cultural relativism or is it a crime if there is no shame attached to the act then does the child suffer tough tough questions it may be of interest that this aspect of the novel has some basis in actual events i personally remember my brother telling me about the real nobel laureate carleton gajdusek who also did something similar and ended up in prison my brother mentioned that the discussion of his crime and the professor's point of cultural relativism in a class caused some backlash from students indeed complaints to the university adminstration it is a story that has also stuck with me and clearly it also stuck with this author she brings to light many of the complexities and disturbing issues related to it in an entertaining thoughtful and in my mind brilliant novel more","478":"i found this book very unique and inventive it seemed slow but yet i couldn't put it down i agree with some of the other reviews the main character is difficult to identify with and at times morally repulsive but it difficult subjects don't spoil books for me especially when they are written so well","479":"slow not enough about the people in the trees and did i mention slow","480":"i did not enjoy this book the writing was tedious and dull i felt nothing for the characters the story was implausible take a pass on this one","481":"this is an incredibly difficult book to rate the narrator is so unreliable and so repugnant from the very beginning that i wasn't sure i wanted to keep reading on the other hand the story was so compelling i couldn't stop reading and i must admit i was fascinated by the author's craft in writing this book because while dr norton perina never became a sympathetic character for me and i don't think he's meant to hello humbert humbert anyone this book was a fascinating glimpse into so many things i think carmela ciuraru gets it exactly right in her nyt review the novel examines issues of moral relativism western hubris colonization and ecological disruption in the name of science as it charts the disappearance of the wondrous flora and fauna and the grievous harm done to the indigenous people pharmaceutical companies pillage the island creating turtle breeding farms in their quest to bottle the secret to longevity but perina is unrepentant about his role \"i did what any scientist would have done \" he insists provocative and bleak \"the people in the trees\" might leave readers conflicted it is exhaustingly inventive and almost defiant in its refusal to offer redemption or solace -- but that is arguably one of its virtues this is perhaps less a novel to love than to admire for its sheer audacity this is a book to be discussed for sure i began it on a road trip and fifty pages in i told my husband to check it out whenever i took the wheel we passed it back and forth for a few days and i'm so glad to have someone to process it with","482":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2013 08","483":" so i was intrigued when i saw a blurb on the cover of this book describing it as nabokovian but i eventually had to resign myself to the fact that the most nabokovian element of the book was the author's cold attitude toward some widely held notions of morality yanagihara is heartless in ways that nabokov also was but not as artistically talented which makes this novel a less rewarding read than say laughter in the dark much of the plot seems ploddingly mechanical and key emotional elements are thrust upon the reader without much justification in the story show don't tell the general premise is an interesting one and could be fertile ground for some deep philosophical exploration what does it mean to be human is mortality a gift what does it do to enrich our lives et cetera that didn't happen though why take such a great idea and let it rot on the shelf why anyway it still gets three stars because the prose is decent even beautiful for fleeting moments and despite being mishandled by yanagihara the story is interesting enough that i felt the novel was worth the time i spent reading it","484":"i had looked forward to reading this lavishly praised novel but after three tries i just couldn't get into it sufficiently to see it through though i admire its ambition and invention ultimately it left me indifferent and bereft of the time i'd lost in trying to see what others found so captivating i find this sort of outcome much more annoying than if the novel had simply been unrelentingly bad","485":"little point in trying to explain why many strongly like and others strongly dislike this book brilliant writing richly imagined as reviewers often say loosely based on a true story it's not merely a matter of disliking the main character though i do i have no sympathies with anyone in the story as of page 117 i appreciate the quality of the writing and i'm a big fan of science so why don't know the subject matter is unappealing to me and a lot of the description that is the first person narrator's way of describing things is often ugly or disgusting","486":"ok this is another tournament of books entry that i liked more than i expected to yes it was gross yes there is immorality however i knew of it going in and it casts a spell an icky spell this book took down three of my favorite contenders in the 2014 tournament of books life after life the goldfinch and the son ultimately life after life rose from the dead in the zombie round to topple it which is good because i wouldn't want a tongue in cheek book tournament's results to make me start hating this book what is it about people in the trees that captured the vote of three consecutive judges i mean they really were on fire for it i don't think its conceit was as innovative as life after life i don't think it was as well executed as the son i don't think it entertained as well as the goldfinch still the people and the trees ranked up there for me among the 17 books this year there was something about it that just drew me in you know from the first page that the main protagonist norton perina stands accused the narrative is told from his point of view which is inherently biased but then his sycophant follower kubodera takes it a step further by adding his own ass kissing spin like the signature of all things people's pacing was uneven norton's retelling of his first visit to ivu'ivu is recounted in excruciating detail and then the adoption of scores sic of children is glossed over this is by design but it still left me wanting more norton is both an unlikeable and unreliable narrator people is an engrossing read also because so much of importance is left out it certainly drew me in and helped me survive the fourth fifth and sixth snow days of the winter yangihara seems to enjoy grossing her readers out for a while it seemed like a faithful way to render an unknown and primitive culture by a derisive protagonist but when the moon's light was described as \"seeping a thin yellow light like pus \" i gave up on that theory in conclusion icky but engrossing","487":"this book started off slow for me but then as soon as they started traveling pow i couldn't put it down there's a lot of disturbing stuff here it's not for everyone but there's also a lot of disturbing stuff that has happened throughout history and sometimes it's important to face that head on i found this book to be utterly compelling thought provoking and extremely well written there aren't a lot of or really any likeable characters and it forces you to confront a lot of difficult themes but i found it totally worth it in the end despite feeling kind of depressed there's so much to think and talk about here and there aren't any easy answers it will take me some time to process it but suffice it to say considering this is the authors debut novel i can't wait to see what comes next","488":"this novel deals with multiple big themes cultural relativism destruction of cultures the interplay and juxtaposition of science and anthropology morality and immorality and others and presents them in a readable but often difficult package i truly disliked the narrator throughout his story increasingly so but found the whole story really compelling the writing was fantastic and while i thought the pacing was off at times i will definitely be looking for more from yanagihara in the future","489":"i've never thought so poorly of the narrator as a character been simultaneously so engrossed in a book it's not all pleasant but the all of the complications are compelling","490":"first book for the author very similar to state of wonder by ann patchett excellent writing i'll look forward to more books from yanagihara","491":"really a 4 5 and only loses that last half star because of the epilogue about which i have mixed feelings very depressing that this is the author's first novel pretty complex stuff","492":"a bit of a bizarre read very heavy on pastiche which reminded me of the luminaries","493":"i just finished this one and i did not like it at all i finished for the sake of finishing only and did some serious page skimming just to do that i thought this book was going to be about a story of a man who found himself while on a scientific exploration of a tribe in a remote jungle i suppose he did find himself but i was not impressed with his discovery i try to be open minded but this time i just could not pry it open as a mother of boys this was especially disturbing as the entire book was the hint of molestation of young boys the destruction of the tribe the flagrant mistreatment of animals and humans why would you need a committee to be created to stop such activity just shameful and then the very last passage well it ruined it for me completely the good part to this was my own discovery of myself that i haven't lost the ability to hope for the best in everyone i'm not sa cynical as i thought i was yet again i was wrong this was just a story and although i'm not convinced to give up that hope i'm also not convinced to hold on to it for much longer time will tell","494":"a chilling look into human nature an incredible literary work an awesome author this reads both like a dream and like a thriller","495":"pretty writing weak characterization weak plotting","496":"a good read discovery of an unknown tribe with a mysterious knack for living long lives exploration for the sake of anthropology and science at the expense of an indigenous people i liked the flawed protagonist you know he is flawed as he narrates his story from his prison cell the book doesn't go there but i say the good doctor is on the autism spectrum asperger's anyone","497":" unfortunately you cannot rate books on goodreads zero stars or i would have done so i mean this book is the same as the signature of all things except it is much more boring how that's possible i don't know i mean two books on the same topic this year in the tournament of books no less i understand elizabeth gilbert's agent being like crap oh well i'll just put the words eat pray love on there and it'll sell fine but i don't understand why anyone published the people in the trees which is dry boring unimaginative and super lame i couldn't finish it i stopped when the tribe sodomized and raped a young boy that's pretty much the limit of stuff i can take in a book don't read this book ever","498":" everything is pink and fleshy flesh covered in fleshy pink flesh the audio version is read by an older man who should never say flesh again this book has no likable characters everyone is ugly smart people are lacking motivation dumb people aren't just ignorant they're insane nobody cares about anyone else and the author's deliberate word choices and descriptions make me make faces when i'm listening to this book and driving maybe it would be better as a physical book but i absolutely do not recommend the audio version","499":"so boring","500":"deplorable main character tragic ending loved it","501":"can't finish this one i simply don't like the main character or the narrator","502":" the people in the trees is written as the memoir of norton perina nobel prize winner as a recent medical graduate perina travelled to a remote south pacific island to study a lost tribe the island is the stuff of fantasy lush jungles teeming with exotic animals and bizarre foods and a group of people that don't die through them perina discovers the secret of eternal life and he also discovers that eternal life comes at a terrible price perina is an entertaining narrator he's a keen observer and speaks with eloquence but he's also capable of being nasty petty and politically incorrect i enjoyed reading his words but he's also an unreliable narrator we know early on that he has been sent to prison for abusing the children that he brings back to america from the island he completely avoids this aspect of his life and provides us with excuses for his unsaid crimes so much so that the reader wonders whether they are true are not and even if they are true is it possible to excuse what he's claimed to have done as i read this book i was frequently finding myself facing moral dilemmas perina makes lots of choices that are morally questionable but always has a reason for them and always makes those reasons seem reasonable is he a bad person would he have achieved success if he'd acted differently did the ends justify the means i give this book 5 stars even though the central character wasn't the nicest of men i give it 5 stars even though it took me a month to finish i give it 5 stars even though it contained footnotes that made me turn the page back and forth and lose the flow of the story i give it 5 stars even though a lot of the names were so similar that i sometimes struggled to work out who perina was talking about i give it 5 stars because it was clever and entertaining and because it made me think","503":"sometimes it's hard to stay committed to a story when you don't trust the narrator but boy what an ending","504":" this remarkable novel is the memoir of an antihero dr norton pinera who won a nobel prize for his research into a primitive micronesian tribe's ability to live far beyond normal life expectancy after eating the meat of a rare turtle the memoir edited and footnoted in totally credible detail by one of pinera's colleagues is written while pinera is in jail for sexual assault of one of his many adopted micronesian children there is not much to like about pinera a brilliant scientist with deep character flaws but his strangeness does not detract from the mesmerizing anthropological and ecological details about the mysterious island of ivu'ivu of course once pinera published his findings the little island nation is changed forever - and not for the good this is a complex and fascinating book about the many aspects of human nature highly recommended","505":"parts of this felt utterly interminable but i'm really glad that i finished it i think that the author did a wonderful job with writing perina as presenting his point of view in an utterly believable clearly trying to garner sympathy sort of way and all the while subtly inserting bits that make it clear that we can't trust him and then view spoiler ending the book with proof that our misgivings about him are absolutely correct hide spoiler really beautiful technique all around","506":"after a few hours of reading i simply couldn't find anything in the story to make me want to keep reading the blurbs and jacket copy in my opinion are misleading","507":"how do you rate a book that you absolutely hated every minute of and yet are desperate to discuss two stars","508":"you can find my review of the people in the trees on my book blog","509":"one of the most fascinating novels i've ever read unique plot gorgeous prose symbolism that echoes many great american works hats off","510":" if you are into anthropology like me you will no doubt find much merit and enjoyment within the page of this book there is a lot of depth and interesting characters and so much more going on beneath the surface than one may expect this is definitely a read for those who like to delve into different peoples however if you are not really interested in an anthropological perspective this is most likely not a book for you the writing is a bit dry and slow in places and the story is not a fast pace there is much value to this story but only for the right audience as small as it may be","511":"beautifully written with a story that had the potential to be very interesting i so wanted to like this book but just found it too slow going and i was never fully engaged and gave up about a third of the way through just too ponderous to continue","512":" this is a well written well paced novel narrated by the least sympathetic most loathsome human being i've ever had the dis pleaseure of reading about it's hard to talk about liking this book but it's certainly inventive and rather grotesquely un put downable it is oddly comforting to read a book in which its primary sociopath is an utterly charmless really odious piece of shit recommended with extreme caution seriously if you're at all triggered by casual racism sexism violence to animals children the elderly and the infirm you're probably better off avoiding this one","513":"it took me a while to get into this book but all the other reviews about the moral relativism of the book propelled me to finish in the end the last four pages did repel me but also they fascinated me this book isn't for everyone but i was captured by the questions the book raised about scientific research and greatness","514":"a creative and beautifully written book but in the end not worth the time for this view point the subject matter is too twisted and obscene while the profound questions of the effect of scientific research on innocent peoples not given the serious look it deserves","515":"don't even know where to start in reviewing this book it is definitely not for the faint of heart it deals with some difficult and at times distasteful subject matter the narrator is not a particularly likable character but you are drawn into his story by degrees it is like a train wreck that you cannot look away from the beauty of this story is in the writing the reader is drawn in and held captive i will be thinking of this book for a long time to come","516":"this was beautifully written and i couldn't put this book down the descriptions of the forest fruits and animals were amazingly written the ending omg my mind is blown i didn't want to believe it but the author set it up perfectly this is not a book for sensitive readers i was shocked that i was able to read it given the subject i have a feeling this book will be on my mind for several days","517":"really outstanding look at anthropology ethics work and science rolled up in an intriguing package and narrated by an unreliable narrator the narrator tags along with a scientific expedition in the 1950s finds a remote group of people who can live for centuries does some unethical things to take that discovery to the u s and that act has ramifications on other parts of his life that he regrets forever really great first novel","518":"it seemed as if it went on forever for little or no reason i got it within the first third and kept looking for more i didn't find it worth the search","519":"find this book at kennedy library","520":"i have no idea what i think yet","521":"this review has been hidden

relays that a young doctor goes on a expedition to find a lost tribe that he discovers the tribe's secret that they are fantastically long lived because they eat the flesh of a rare turtle the blurb goes on to mention that the doctors smuggles the meat of a turtle back wins the nobel prize and discovers that the turtle's miraculous property comes at a terrible price as things quickly spiral out of control his own demons begin to take hold with devastating personal consequences first of all nothing spirals quickly in this novel and while that expedition takes place the tribe is found and the turtle meat secret discovered this is not the story of a young doctor going on an adventure and making an scientific discovery instead it is a very slow moving tale about the life the entire life of sociopathic norton perina from his rural childhood through to his expedition to becoming a nobel prize winner the story details how perina lives separate from the rest of the world not feeling not relating it is the story of a sexually repressed man who tries to negate his homosexual interests who eventually adopts over forty children and rapes many of them who eventually goes to jail for his crimes and that's how the book begins the reader is given the personal memoirs of the old doctor written in prison detailing how he wandered through life one slow moving word at a time i don't like being mislead who does this could have been a great adventure novel with brilliant philosophical flourish the questions of aging the ethics of immortality the author clearly had something else in mind if you're up for a dark tale with a lead character who's impossible to relate to then you're in for an interesting well written unusual and at times highly disturbing novel loved the blurb did not enjoy the novel at all more","522":" this is the fictional story of scientist norton perina's adventures in the fictional islands of u'ivu the research that developed from his time there his ethical breaches awkward social relationships and unsettling personal life this book begs the question if a great man does unspeakable things is he still a great man this book is loosely drawn fromt he life of nobel laureate daniel carleton gajdusek who won a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1976 for his work on the infectious brain disease kuru which was prevalent among the south fore people of new guinea and who was later convicted of child molestation in 1996 norton was something of a scientific misfit not respected among his peers young and inexperienced then one day he is sent to the remote micronesian country of u'ivu for what reason he does not know he soon discovers that he is to assist anthropologist paul tallent who is searching for a mysterious tribe that lives on ivu'ivu the most remote of the islands of u'ivu while on the island they discover this forgotten tribe of u'ivuans on the island of ivu'ivu who appear to have abnormally long lifespans that are triple the norm or longer living 200 or 300 years or more and norton theorizes that their long life is connected to their ingestion of a certain turtle however the same individuals who live extraordinarily long lives are also lost to a serious mental degradation that leaves them stumbling around with severe cases of a condition resembling alzheimer's this book follows norton over the decades shifting from his childhood to his professional life and then ending on a more personal note considering that this novel is written in the form of a memoir you have to give the fictional character of norton perina credit for his honesty he is unabashed as a child in his frank exposure of himself his thoughts and motivations he is unapologetic well occasionally he makes excuses blaming everyone but himself other times he accepts responsibility for events but doesn't really apologize for them he is simply stating the way it was later on norton begins adopting children from the islands of u'ivu as things there begin to degrade eventually he adopts a total of something like 40 children offering them a chance at a better life my final word i found this story to be intriguing and it kept me wondering how it would all play out however i found it did read something like the scientific memoir it was presented as none of the characters are especially likable but the story keeps pulling you along dying to know how this will all play out by the end of the story as you are welcomed into norton's personal life you find yourself squirming in your seat sort of uncomfortable in your own skin almost physically cringing was it a fun read no at moments it could be touching or beautiful but often it was awkward uncomfortable disturbing and a little stiff but it was also fascinating peculiar and felt almost profound i really enjoyed it despite being left with a bad aftertaste it's an unsettling story but read it anyway","523":"fascinating beautiful narrative voices rich scenery compelling story gut punch of an ending recommended but not for the faint of heart","524":"the people in the trees by hanya yanagihara simply took my breath away it's disquieting from the beginning and it becomes more and more disturbing as it progresses this novel isn't for everyone it contains pedophilia and strange to our culture sexual practices but to me the most disturbing thing about the novel is the story's exploration and exposure of how the elderly are treated in a given society it is impossible to read about how the fictional u'ivu tribes react to their elderly members when they slip into dementia they call it mo'o kau'au without thinking about what we do in our non fictional society to our elderly and impaired example analogy a spear to a u'ivuan is like a car in our culture it's a big deal when you get your first one and a sad day when you are deemed too old or demented and the car keys spears are taken away for readers like me who appreciate an unreliable narrator this book is a two for one bonus two very unreliable narrators who are also both huge jerks yanagihara's prose is as lush and vivid as the jungles and beaches she describes what a talent and this is her first novel again there are very disturbing scenes and cultural questions in this novel but it's an absolute treat for readers who enjoy being blasted out of their comfort zones and who relish a novel that takes one to unexplored places which is quite literally what this story does","525":" there is so much in this book that is compelling and challenging the author plays with the old trope of the pristine savage south pacific island and with the well worn character of the young doctor full of ambition the novel is provocative ultimately pretty bleak and generally damning of western biomedicine and anthropology institutions the reader may go in to the book holding in high regard in the end there is too much in the book and it ends up being a series of stories strung together end to end with common places and characters but with clearly different aims and sources there's the story of the island a stand in for hawai'i and the south pacific in general the protagonist's individual career arc an allegory for the personal dangers of moral relativism and of a life of motivations poorly examined the rape of the island a story of post colonial extraction and destruction and a story of how we always end up damning our heroes for their moral failings after we excused or refused to see the same failings when they were still our heroes the separate stories blend into each other but the seams show having too much to say is a good and ambitious fault to have and forgivable in a debut novel i look forward to yanagihara's next and this one is certainly worth reading","526":" recently i asked why anyone would want immortality how could one be so arrogant i just finished this book and have no idea how to review it it was not a book that i longed to return to reading in some ways it felt like an assignment on the other hand i am amazed that this is a first novel i cannot wait to see what she does next i often categorize novels by deciding whether i would recommend them to my mother's book club my mother's book club reads challenging books this is not a demeaning category i would not recommend this but it is an impressive book that will continue to make me think","527":"a whirlwind of a novel compulsively readable exquisitely written and impossibly fantastic some disturbing content here but raises questions and brings to light issues that will keep the reader processing for some time afterwards a stunning debut","528":" the book is extremely well written as the fictional memoir of dr a norton perina in 1950 as a young graduate of harvard medical school he accepts a job as part of a scientific expedition to explore uvu'ivu and study its lost tribe there he encounters a strange group of forest dwellers who appear to have attained a form of immortality that preserves the body but not the mind perina uncovers their secret and returns with it to america where he soon finds great success yanagihara uses the history of real life scientist and physician daniel carleton gajdusek to create norton perina like perina gajdusek who won the nobel prize for his scientific work on of new guinea natives he also brought home a number of the island's native children to rear and educate as his own although i didn't love this book i acknowledge the intelligence of the writing and i look forward to the authors next book","529":" this book had one of the most deplorable narrators i've ever encountered yet was wildly engrossing usually hating the main character is a barrier to entry for me but in this novel--which is written as the memoir of a narcissistic arrogant misogynist ruinous medical scientist named norton--the protagonist is not presented as an antihero but as a completely unabashedly horrible person and in his own words it was weirdly refreshing sometimes the true author's attempts to show right off the bat that norton the fictional author was not to be liked were almost ludicrous in their lack of subtlety who in writing their own memoir would so casually mention the enjoyment he got from murdering helpless lab mice who looking back on events of the 50s and 60s from the 90s would so baldly reveal and revel in their hatred for women's bodies and minds who would unabashedly recount their complete lack of shock or dismay when witnessing sexual acts performed on children shouldn't he be at least pretending to think about getting the reader on his side on the other hand this is a consistent part of norton's narcissistic character he seems surprised and full of disbelief whenever it is revealed to him that others do not think and feel exactly as he does that in fact his is usually a minority opinion never seems to cross his mind and neither does the fact though pointed out to him in seemingly uncountable ways that many of his actions are utterly reprehensible what's really astounding is the framing introduction and epilogue written by someone who seems to think norton is the best dude ever the fact that either of these atrocious despicable narrators were at all interesting to me is a testament to the excellence of yanagihara's writing","530":"this book was really hard to hook me after about 100 125 pages i really like it i would recommend it but just be forewarned it has very very slow start","531":"so compellinglyreadable even amidstso much discomfort","532":" outstanding perhaps as shockingly good a first novel as i have ever read on it's face the plot is reminiscent of the poisonwood bible or state of wonder but it take the reader to a place that is far darker and more controversial yanagihara presents a deliciously despicable narrator whose black heart is revealed albeit probably too slowly for some as inextricably linked with his genius it is for this reason that i hesitate to recommend this novel to all but the most steely resolved of readers nabokovian an apt description from one reviewer indeed","533":"i thought the writing was superior and the creativity way up there this author created another world so vividly and an excellent story line and yes there were times when it got a little uncomfortable for me and some moral issues raised but it was written in such a manner that it's up to you to grapple with an excellent read thank you jill thank you jean","534":"amazing so vivid finally a book i didn't want to put down","535":" this review first appeared on http readingtheend comoh my god y'all this book don't let me get your expectations up so high that you can't enjoy it but like oh my god this book there are not an adequate number of words in my brain box to describe my feelings about this book right here the people in the trees is startling not startling in a plot way but startling in the way that was like i had never read a book before and was reading my very first one right now the people in the trees admittedly hits a lot of sweet spots for me a well imagined fictional world the science and the places in this book are all imaginary an audacious premise a micronesian tribe seems to have attained something like immortality though at a terrible cost treated with utmost seriousness an unreliable narrator norton perina the scientist who discovered and published on this immortality phenomenon is writing his memoirs an abundance of footnotes by a staunch admirer of perina also an unreliable narrator who is editing the memoirs and a grand profusion of ethical questions perina who is loosely based on daniel carleton gajdusek is writing his memoirs from a jail cell where he is serving a two year sentence on charges of sexually assaulting one of his adopted micronesian children before his disgrace he was one of the most renowned and respected scientists in america for his discovery of selene syndrome a condition apparently occasioned by the consumption of a particular kind of meat indigenous to the micronesian island of ivu'ivu in which human lifespans are extended to as much as six times their natural length while mental capacity becomes more and more diminished it's quickly though not crudely obvious that perina is a nasty piece of work a man who simply doesn't bother himself much about anyone around him he's not trying to justify himself because he's loftily serene in his righteousness he speaks of having regrets yet says that he wouldn't -- couldn't -- have done anything differently the discovery of selene syndrome as you might expect has massive environmental and social consequences for ivu'ivu as hordes of western scientists and pharmaceutical companies and eventually missionaries descend on the island in his later years perina begins to bring home abandoned ivu'ivuan children hordes of them a total of 43 -- including victor whose accusations of sexual assault lead to perina's eventual fall from grace what can i say about the people in the trees it is a book with presence from the first few pages it forces you to sit up and take notice i think the last time i read a debut novel with this level of assurance and originality was jonathan strange and mr norrell comparisons will inevitably be made to nabokov both to lolita and to pale fire and as high as compliment as that is to the people in the trees it's a not inconsiderable compliment to nabokov as well this book right here you guys it rocked me like a southbound train three days after reading it i still haven't been able to read anything new i just want to sit with the people in the trees and think about it and reread parts of it and talk about it to everyone seriously ask my friends and relations i have not been able to shut up about this book","536":"incredibly well written and horrifying at parts and at other parts beautiful","537":" if i were rating this book on the writing the characterization the sensory descriptions the story telling the cleverness the weaving the driving home of a point i would give it five stars the author crafted this book beautifully and brilliantly exposing themes of destruction as a means to scientific process and of civilized man being more beastly more savage than the people we first worlders would call savages the people in the trees tells the story of a male scientist i mention this because the author is female and given the gender of her protagonist i find his characterization curious arrogant self righteous superior who discovers a modern day fountain of youth in a previously undiscovered tribe on a micronesian island the flesh of an endemic turtle when eaten raw can prolong life to more than triple the normal lifespan the problem is that despite physical heartiness the aged turtle eaters decline mentally until they are nearly unresponsive to any sort of stimuli as a result of his discovery the island is of course pillaged and raped by pharmaceutical companies and the peaceful savages stripped of their native habitat and subsequently tamed by christian missionaries likewise the scientist adopts over many years more than 43 abandoned children from the island brings them back to the us feeds them clothes them educates them and sends them to the best colleges and this is why i give the book four stars instead of five and why i almost gave it three there is an ugly story woven in with the children one that you will be able to predict as you read but that you hope doesn't play out the way you fear when i finished the book i was so revolted i didn't want to touch it any more i wanted it out of my house out of my sight even though it ended the way i suspected it would","538":"a dazzling novel brilliant plot engaging imaginative characters destined to become a classic","539":"read this not long after reading ann patchett's state of wonder and elizabeth gilbert's the signature of all things an interesting juxtaposition both for the treatments of native cultures as seen by outsiders and the moral responsibility of scientists to their subjects","540":"beautifully and horrifically written this novel has a theme that is interesting and uncomfortable to read","541":"very surprised by this book and how much i enjoyed it kept having to remind myself that it was fiction and not a real account of events","542":"dark disturbing fascinating and so well written a great read but be forewarned that it deals with some unpleasant topics","543":" this story opens with an introduction that pretty much lays out the entire plot beforehand if you want the plot to be a surprise you can just start the book but if you don't well the opener identifies the main plot elements 1 a scientist goes to a distant island and discovers near immortality the locals have been eating a turtle that causes them to live an extremely prolonged lifespan 2 the scientist wins a nobel prize and adopts many children 3 the scientist is now in jail for sexually assaulting some of those children this book's twists don't pack any punches because well all the twists are laid out at the beginning but it's really sumptuous writing even without spoilers the story is a page turner the worldbuilding well island building is detailed yet mysterious the protagonist is fun to follow because he's charmingly awful he's arrogant difficult snide cold and possibly a pedophile whether he's actually a pedophile is one of the few twists sort of i've never read anything quite like this book and i enjoyed it very much aside from some slow parts the story loses momentum when the protagonist returns stateside 3 4 of the way in it was engrossing","544":" when literary fiction collides with an anthropological adventure tale you have a book at once disturbing and compelling that you can't put down dr norton perina adrift after finishing medical school is offered a chance to accompany a famous scientist to a tiny micronesian island in search of a lost tribe although he knows nothing about the scientist the study or what his role might be he agrees in micronesia he meets up with two scientists tallent and esme whose relationship like so many in the book is unclear and tramps into a dense jungle led by three guides they come across first one woman then five men who appear to be middle aged they take these with them dubbing them dreamers because some say little and appear to be living in a fog test reveal that these dreamers are much older than they appear when the scientists and their charges arrive in a village little is as it seems naked villagers don't welcome them although they do allow the scientists to live at village edge the dreamers aren't welcome after much experimentation and examination norton unveils the truth about the tribe it has discovered a substance in the form of a unique turtle that extends life until the elders appear to be immortal immortality comes at high costs this tale of the collision of two cultures the exploitation of the one by the other is rendered in dense but lyrical prose this should appeal to lovers of literary fiction and books clubs everywhere","545":"hated the main character which i think is the point i listened to this on audio during a long car trip which was bearable but tried to finish it up reading hated it more with my eyes than with my ears possibly men might find it more appealing but even that's a stretch just don't","546":"if you are fascinated by the idea of scientific discovery and adventures in an unknown mysterious civilization then you will like this book the people in the trees is well written and so believable that i found myself looking up the otherworldly things people and places so convincingly described in its pages to find out if they exist the main character norton perrina is a scientist on the verge of a world changing discovery but he is quite a controversial character as well this book frankly messed with my mind in ways i can't describe here without giving too much away and it will stay with me forever i couldn't put it down but be warned that if you are squeamish about cruelty toward animals and children or if you are in any way homophobic this book will offend you","547":"i was doubtful when the book started with the protagonist convicted of child abuse i was willing to suspend judgement and read on but the fine writing wasn't enough to keep me reading i couldn't find a character that i cared enough about to continue","548":"this book took a while to get into and took a month to read but i liked it the last 2 pages were vile but instigates a moral question posed by the author","549":"this was an interesting book with a highly unlikely narrator the first few pages drew me in so much i missed my subway stop but as i kept reading i grew to like the main character less and less but the gripping info up front kept me reading i guess i'm glad that i did but it was a little unsatisfying by the time i hit the zinger at the end","550":"putting it in the 'my read' category is a stretch it started out strong really fascinating stuff if a bit claustrophobic then the sex with children started i am a sensitive hormonal mother of a young child i couldn't push through and had to put it down i give it 2 stars for it's potential but with the above mentioned huge caveat","551":" when i first read a review of this book i was expecting the tale of a scientific odyssey for the key to eternal life the reviewer made the story seem like it would be more of a cautionary tale of a well meaning scientist discovering a turtle that when eaten could maintain the body's rejuvenating processes indefinitely after his report is published for the world to see the small micronesian island where the turtle lived would be overrun and the existing indigent cultures essentially wiped out how wrong i was while the narrative is essentially similar the actual story is quite different narrated by dr norton a perina a fictional nobel prize winner for his work discovering a form of immortality this story is told in a series of memoir pieces written from his term at a correctional facility he has been convicted of the sexual assault of one of his 43 adopted children several of the short articles before the narrative begins asserts his innocence and subsequent surprise at his conviction for the majority of the book the story is about his work with the magical turtle and the undiscovered micronesian society but the very very end of the book is tricky it leads you to a point where you think oh progress has destroyed another centuries old culture but here is a hero who has selflessly pulled 43 orphans out of squalor then proceeds to turn everything upside down the style of this book is almost a combination between autobiography and scientific nonfiction except that it's completely fictional the prison narrative of dr perina is heavily footnoted by a friend of his these footnotes serve to create a story that is both complete and incomplete at the same time if you completely ignored the footnotes although there is actually a 3 page footnote at one point you would only be getting half of the story from a very biased perspective the additional footnotes help to situate the story in the time period of the 1950s as well as lend it a sense of legitimacy or realism what is only hinted at in the beginning and only fully addressed at the very end is the idea of child abuse although the sexual practices of intiating the children of ivu'ivu to sexual intercourse at a young age are discussed perina views it through a scientific lens which removes any judgement of impropriety or rape its still a difficult subject to address and several of his colleagues are unable to accept these practices as anything other than rape then this whole idea is completely dropped i had a vague feeling when i began this book that it felt an awful lot like the sandusky trial and since its a recent 2013 publication i'm sure that all the media attention that that trial attracted may have influenced ms yanagihara in her writing although what i didn't expect is how she carefully choreographed everything her character does and says leading up to the ending i didn't particularly enjoy this book the writing was superb and really tricked me into thinking i was reading about an actual event but i just didn't care for the subject matter or her character perina is unfortunately an egotistical blunt and chauvinist guy he doesn't actually care about what anyone else thinks and does things to ease his own urges rather than thinking about the people he is interacting with i'm not sure who i would recommend this too but possibly to someone who really enjoys realistic fiction and watches a lot of the news","552":"not for me too many footnotes the whole thing seemed contrived and strange the characters forgettable the names unpronounceable nice dust jacket though","553":"the people in the trees was a very dark very interesting and slightly creepy novel that kept getting better the more that i read similar in feel to ann patchett's state of wonder which i also enjoyed the plot revolves around a scientist who travels to a remote island to study a tribe of people who don't seem to age physically at home in his lab he successfully recreates a controlled experiment with mice and is eventually rewarded with the nobel prize for his research unfulfilled he ends up adopting more than forty native children and raises them at home but it does not end well as one of his children accuses him of sexual abuse and he is found guilty a really fascinating novel with many many moral and ethical questions","554":"has anyone read this it is the sort of book that will provoke a variety of reactions and i am interested in hearing them i just finished and found it exquisitely written insightful remarkable brave and deeply uncomfortable","555":"this book has left me speechless wow what a book not for the faint of heart i'm thinking of you wilhemina and you qiana but to me an undisputed masterpiece","556":"finally this book took me a long time to get into and a long time to read by the end i was just wanting to get through it it deals with interesting questions of morality and cultural relativity specifically around child abuse and the dangers of discovery but the narrator is just such a subtlely awful human that it was hard for me to care i'm glad i read it but i wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others","557":"in terms of craft one of the best books i've read in a long time reminding me of a ton of nabokov on the other hand the story was a little slow and disturbing which is not really to my taste","558":"in this riveting story narrated as a memoir the life of a fictional nobel prize winning scientist is recounted by the man himself a norton perina who is writing from prison and edited by a friend and colleague dr ronald kubodera perina's fame resulted from a 1950 expedition taken to a remote micronesian village just after he finished medical school he went down with anthropologist paul tallent and returned with a turtle purported to be responsible for the long life of the villagers of u'ivu which led to his nobel prize during the many subsequent trips he took there by himself he adopted a total of 43 children he was convicted in 1996 of molesting one of them perina's defense outside the courtroom is told in this page turning account of his life the fictional village of u'ivu is depicted as an almost mythical illusive dreamlike place the dwellers are actually called the dreamers people who seem from a different strata altogether who looked like a man and moved like a man but who flailed and could not speak who shrieked like a monkey and though he seemed strong and healthy was without sense as perina the scientist advances toward professional recognition and tallent continues the obsessive record of the u'ivuian culture and life the tiny village is eventually overrun by big pharma and the lush forests are eventually stripped of vegetation modernity makes a wasteland out of what was pure and primordial but even more fascinating on a microcosmic level is perina the man and his own values and morals in some technical ways it reminded me a little of fieldwork a novel by mischa berlinski because of a strong focus on cultural anthropology and the question of moral relativism and the footnotes and the superb description of a culture that lives outside of time moral relativism may even be the key theme or the underlying examination regarding human values along with questions about science to be a scientist is to learn to live all one's life with questions that will never be answered written in a footnote by kobudera what is acceptable in the name of progress and what is simply self serving these are the questions that will undoubtedly emerge as the reader gets deeper into the novel yanagihara is a gifted novelist and unafraid of probing unsettling and thorny issues it is never gratuitous it is provocative in a deeply human and even animal way","559":"oh i loved this book call it lolita meets pale fire meets the egyptologist arthur phillips given that those are three of my all time favorite books this one was bound to capture my heart and it did disclaimer of course no one really comes close to nabokov's brilliance his allusions his wordplay his adroit use of language but yanagihara pays homage to him in the structure of the book and in the themes and i was engaged from the get go the book isn't for the faint of heart however as there are graphic scenes of animal cruelty as well as detailed descriptions of pedophiliac acts but the way in which the narrator's heart of darkness is revealed and i'm not giving anything away his perversions are laid out on page 1 is truly remarkable and what an engaging story basic gist is that a young doctor heads to the wilds of micronesia as part of an anthropological expedition and discovers a lost people who have themselves discovered the secret to eternal life but a severely compromised one the book succeeds on so many levels including pure adventure yanagihara's writing is strong her descriptions her observations all great i would agree with reviewers who have criticized her sentence formation as clunky and ungracious she does use a lot of parentheticals and subordinate clauses and the effect is ugly and difficult to parse at times well worth untangling though highly recommended","560":"incredibly written incredibly disturbing","561":"wow wow wow this book was written so realistically i had to keep googling people just to check amazing book well written somewhat similar to barbara kingsolver style and with a very thought provoking end must read","562":"gripping until the end","563":" the people in the trees wow what a disturbing book it tells the story of a young doctor who goes on an expedition to a very remote island there he encounters a tribe who seems to be able to live unnaturally long lives by eating the flesh of a certain specific turtle the downside however is that even though their bodies remain young their minds deteriorate so that ultimately they lose all trace of humanity and self awareness the story is told primarily through first person narrative by two narrators dr perina the primary narrator and dr kubodera who provides footnotes and clarifications to dr perina's story dr perina is extremely unlikable as a character and narrator you immediately realize there's something really off about him the indifference with which he treats the lab animals and the glee with which he kills them his awful descriptions of esme and of other people he doesn't like the fact that he's not shocked by certain practices that certainly shocked me as i was reading the book and he is constantly blaming others for the damage which he almost single handedly caused i think dr perina may meet the clinical definition of a psychopath this book was particularly unsettling and disturbing to me in part because i realized i had almost allowed myself to be misled by the narrator first person narration is tricky the narrator is constantly trying to get you to see their side of the story to view things from their perspective and if you allow yourself to get carried away you might catch yourself justifying some terrible things this book is not an easy read it includes many examples of brutality and cruelty both towards people and towards animals ultimately though the author does a great job of exploring questions of colonialism morality and what really makes a great man vs a monster","564":" this book kept popping up on my radar but i hadn't gotten around to it i only knew that it had a beautiful intriguing cover great reviews and was vaguely about anthropology when it came up on the list for the tournament of books it was one of the books i was most excited about the people in the trees is a fascinating bizarre book it is essentially the narrative of norton perina as told to a colleague in a series of manuscripts written from his jail cell the brilliant nobel prize winning doctor was accused of sexual abuse the focus of the story is on perina's multiple visits to ivu'ivu a micronesian island that on which lives a previously uncontacted by foreigners of any kind tribe of people who seemingly live astonishingly long lives upwards of 200 even 300 years the downside to their very long lives is that while in perfect health the very old suffer from extreme dementia leading them to become what the anthropologists refer to as the dreamers the first contact of perina and the anthropologists and the dreamers is like something out of any good sci fi novel the rest of it brings up so many interesting issues ethics medical laboratory anthropological familial imperialism adoption redemption and cultural destruction perina is a largely unlikeable character yet his predicament is fascinating i'm really looking forward to discussing this book and have a feeling that it'll bring up some pretty big disagreements among the participants","565":"i enjoyed the first part of the book which concentrated on the main character's voyage to the interior of the island where people live uncommonly long as long as the author stayed on this story line i found the book appealing without giving away the main secret however i did not enjoy where the book ended to me the author did not have to go down this avenue and it totally spoilt the whole book for me i would not have purchased the book if i knew this was a factor in the book","566":"i wasn't crazy about this book the main character is very unlikable which doesn't make it a bad book but it made it hard for me to enjoy the book i thought it was kind of predictable too","567":" i think i will be thinking about this book for a long time it is an arrestingly well written autobiography of the shamelessly megalomaniacal medical doctor who discovers a long lost tribe in the south pacific bringing them to the world's attention and himself to fame and fortune the author did a stunning job of creating a character who's blind to his own flaws and inadvertently alerts us to them through his judgements of others it's ultimately a novel about trade offs how much are we willing to give up in pursuit of scientific knowledge how many peculiarities are we willing to overlook in the name of genius the author's refusal to offer up easy answers means this book will stick with me for a long long time","568":"this was another novel preloaded on the isps library's kindle i had tried the casual vacancy by j k rowling and quit after 100 pages so it was with great pleasure that i began the people in the trees a novel that swept me up and kept me turning pages which is why i feel disappointed to give it only three stars until the end it would have gotten a five star rating from me and yes i knew from the outset that the protagonist had been accused of terrible crimes but the power of the prose the quirkiness of the protagonist and the adventure of what it would be like to make contact with a tribe about which little is known was compelling until the end i would have likened this book to the sparrow and state of wonder novels that captured the wonder and horrors of what it would be like to be an anthropologist or medical researcher in the field but sadly i have to rate this book lower because of a happy ending that distresses me now i love to read books that are thought provoking even controversial and i don't have to like the protagonists as long as i feel i understand them but in this case i did not i'm still not sure what the message of this book is great people do terrible things i will end this review with two questions you might ask am i sorry i read it no would i read another book by this author only if i read the reviews first","569":"i have to confess that i didn't finish this book i couldn't it drags beyond belief and i just couldn't force myself to slog through any more days in the jungle with no end in sight when there are so many other books on my list that i would rather read i still find it perplexing that there are so many good reviews of the book makes me think i should give it another try down the road but for now... i found it a snoozer","570":"alert i couldn't put this book down but i would not recommend it to others it is a disturbing and each reader must make their own choice though well written the content involves very sensitive subjects do your homework before you buy","571":"clever funny and unsettling and the most unreliable narrator since sara levine's treasure island","572":" very well written hanyaghira did a masterful job of creating a fictional island with a fictional society and a fictional language that all fit perfectly into the real world of 1950s scientific exploration i loved the inclusion of the many footnotes and i typically have no issue with the trick of the unsympathetic narrator protagonist i don't always need to relate to the main character but it ended with too many questions unanswered and ultimately i ended wishing to hear the story from one of the secondary characters' perspective","573":"disturbing story related by a narrator of questionable morals whose scientific research destroys a culture and species filtered through a syncophantic assistant not necessarily an enjoyable read but riveting","574":"i suspected the ending though not quite the way it happened i feel like i've read a lot of books lately where i just don't like the main character at all i much prefer to get emotionally involved in a book and be able to identify in some way with the central character norton is driven and focused in a narcissistic way i also did not like the footnotes they gave the impression that this book is nonfiction while i have read that it's based on actual events to some extent i would have preferred this story be told as fiction rather than fiction loosely based on a real situation carefully disguised as nonfiction and science i just don't think this one worked for me but i'm still processing i think i would have preferred to know more about brining the kids home and trying to assimilate them into his culture and less about edible jungle fruits crawling with bugs and elderly lab rats","575":" writing 5story 3satisfaction 3the writer's voice in this book is superb i was surprised to check the back cover flap and find that the author isn't a 50 year old caucasian male anthropologist just a fantastic portrayal of voice though that does come with a downside since the narrator is arrogant and annoying at times i also enjoyed the framing story premise so this is the fictional autobiography of fictional doctor norton perina as edited and revised by fictional admiring colleague ronald kubodera right out of med school perina joined an anthropological expedition to search for a lost tribe of people they find the tribe and also find that the elders of this tribe live for hundreds of years as a result of eating the meat of a native turtle leading anthropologist paul tallent wants to hide this property of the turtles in order to try to preserve the society but perina smuggles the turtle meat back to the us and wins a nobel prize for his research on eternal life the society is quickly destroyed by governments and pharmaceutical companies wishing to capitalize on the turtles and the turtles are driven to a quick extinction perina shows some regret for his role in these proceedings and begins to adopt children from the destroyed remnants of the society he adopts dozens and years later is convicted of sexually abusing many of them the book begins with a news article on the topic though doesn't reach that point until much further in the book the first half of the book focuses on the expedition and the found society it's an engaging and realistic feeling portrayal the second half focuses on the return to the states the child adopting doesn't occur until the last quarter of the book the editor kubodera adds footnotes and removes distracting sections of the book that by the end are clearly very biased selections the ending revelation view spoiler of the section that kubodera removed changes the tone of the book entirely for the rest of the book the reader is left with a sense of well he could have done it but he also may have not done it but that one section changes everything and is creepily sociopathic in a horrifying way hide spoiler this book resulted in a great discussion and lingers for many members of my book club though i didn't especially enjoy reading it the way it was written and the ending particularly was fantastically well done and for that alone i'd recommend it for any book club discussion on discussion many people disliked the book for the un relate ableness of the narrator and it's true that the narrator has these characteristics but intentionally on the part of the writer which i think is a strength of the book instead of a weakness others may disagree","576":"part anthropologic ecological horror realism part footnoted suspiciously edited memoir all parts piercingly disturbing i can't yet say if i liked it despite the unreliable unlikeable narrator or because of him but i can say that i haven't stopped thinking about this book","577":"the scientist in me loved the first half of the people in the trees it was fascinating and exciting the second half of the book still held its own but i just can't get over the way it ended had to take off a star definitely worth a read though","578":"i have never been so compelled to keep reading a first person narrative from the point of view of a protagonist i found so despicable might need to revise my review upward after my stomach stops turning","579":"fantastic beautifully written and haunting highly recommend","580":"would not recommend to everyone but certainly a good book","581":"whether you like norton or not this story is woven by hanya yanagihara very well although absurdly unbelievable in parts i found myself googling 'ivu'ivu' and 'opa'ivu'eke' just to make sure they didn't truly exist maybe a bit hopefully that they truly did it was delightful that the emphasis wasn't on telomerase but on personal struggles i struggled to get a grasp on the writing style in the beginning but about a hundred pages in i was hooked more ms yanagihara more","582":"this was a difficult one to rate the writing was beautiful and the story was huge surprising for a debut i look forward to reading more by her the story was dark magical creepy with a very unlikeable main character i also found the footnotes distracting although they do add to the plot i'm going to push it to a 3 because of the writing and because it's been on my mind and not every book lingers like that","583":"well written just the most unlikable protagonist and some of the most disturbing subject matter to deal with","584":"moral relativism at its finest do yourself a favor just read the fictional intro and re shelf this one that is unless you feel like spending over 300 pages stuck inside a misogynist pederast up to you free country and all","585":"this is a smart well written book maybe it's an intellectual failing to give only one star based on personal preferences however i truly did not like it while i'm not a huge fan of unsympathetic narratives i cannot abide violence lovingly depicted","586":"i should have written a review closer in time to having read this but it's been nuts i had a particular interest in the book based on a slight personal connection i had a close college friend who was related to dr d carleton gadjusek the nobel prize winning scientist who adopted dozens of children from micronesia and was eventually convicted of child molestation and died in disgraced exile that story provides the precise template for all of this book except the science anyway i have a vivid memory of meeting a couple of dr gadjusek's children when they visited my friend at college the thing that stuck in my mind was how boyish they seemed their chronological ages didn't fit their small stature and young seeming demeanor and i seem to recall that they came out drinking with us and it was hard for me to adjust to since they seemed so young at that time i was fascinated by what seemed like a noble but overwhelming project how does one raise 50 children and i wanted to understand more but really didn't grasp the dynamic when the headlines came several years i was very saddened for my friend but struck again by the mystery of how 50 children make a family and puzzled as to what had actually happened at that house in maryland so i was interested to see what yanagihara made of this unique story unfortunately while she paints a chilling portrait of dr perina the fictional gadjusek a sociopath who enjoys killing mice and who is viscerally repulsed by women and silently gay i felt the book plodded and didn't do justice to the fascination of its source material while the child molestation story frames the book yanigahara seems actually more interested in the scientific parable she tells of immortality innocence and destruction but for me those parts of the book just dragged we have pages upon pages of descriptions of the jungle with little pay off then when the story of the children the adoptions family life accusations etc finally come it is very rushed and seems disconnected from the rest of the book i may be a bit unfair i read this book while traveling and was very distracted","587":"one of the most engrossing disturbing and thought provoking books i've read in a really long time","588":" this book is truly remarkable first the premise is fascinating a substance that can make bodies immortal but not minds then there's the narrator who is a real piece of work a highly unlikable character imprisoned for child abuse then there's the plot element of first contact with a so called primitive tribe and the inevitable changes that civilization bring there's the intriguing story within a story with the supposed editor adding revealing and sometimes very funny footnotes then there's the amazing quality of the writing i could pick almost any paragraph at random to illustrate the stellar prose but here's just one my fingers closed around the first thing they encountered but so lost were my senses that it was another second or so before i was able to identify it as an arm a disembodied arm that i could not see but that had somehow taken shape within my grasp or so it seemed and then i found my voice and screamed and even screamed with me and the arm screamed too and from behind it came other screams all of us so loud that i could hear the forest wake and rearrange itself bird wings bat wings a chorus of flapping or insects' patter of colonies of unknown hidden beasts being roused from their idyll and scuttling from one unseen tree branch to another our noises an insult to the forest's perfect crystalline calm overall a total delight even if you develop an increasing dislike for the narrator","589":" i have been thinking about this book for a few days if i was part of a book club i would insist we read this and discuss it am thinking about starting a book club for that express purpose one of the many astonishing things about this book is that it is a first novel written by a young woman who is obviously well versed in science and anthropology not that that in itself is astonishing i just think it's such a big story so well written and intriguing that how can it be a first novel but the world is full of incredibly gifted writers and hanya yanagihara is one for sure this is the story of a speck of an island in the pacific the fictional u'ivu and particularly of it's nearby island relative ivu'ivu these islands are basically untouched and in 1950 a fresh young doctor norton perina arrives with the gifted anthropologist paul tallent and his team to have an 'adventure' on these remote dots in the deep pacific paul tallent has been there before and he is searching for an undiscovered tribe on the densely jungled seemingly uninhabitated ivu'ivu with permission from the king of u'ivu the team goes with three guides to explore ivu'ivu the reader is poised with the discovery team anxiously awaiting the start of their journey and anxious to know what they will find if anything yanagihara has invented a whole culture of course based on existing micronesian cultures but she has added her own touches of how the tribes developed and why descriptions of the jungle and it's habitation are amazing such is the strange flesh coloured hairy fruit called manama which drops with a thud from the tree which bears it to the ground and wiggles around it wiggles because it is filled with white hunono worms which live in the fruit until such time as they mature and explode into butterflies the story is told by norton who is the protagonist of the story norton tells his tale moving from childhood on a farm with his twin brother owen going to medical school owen going on to major in american literature and later to become a poet norton's life is forever altered by his time on ivu'ivu and he goes on to become a ground breaking scientist who wins the nobel prize for medicine and has his own laboratory for the rest of his career but oh there is so much more norton is telling his story from prison that is not a spoiler the reader learns this very quickly he has the time to look back over this life and relay the events that society already knows through all the sensational articles in major magazines and newspapers in his own words from his own perspective what was most incredible for me is the description and story of the adventure and discoveries made during the 1950 excursion to ivu'ivu yes it doesn't spoil the story to know norton and tallent discover an previously unknown people a very uncurious people who have domesticated huge hairy tusked hogs as pets and trackers for their hunts the descriptions of the people sitting around the fire having their evening meal while the enormous boars eat their meal alongside their masters who occassionally stroke their bristled backs is creepy there are many very creepy scenes in this book descriptions of habitation or culural practises that made me want to turn away but of course i couldn't the people are so 'off' they are 'strange' in a way that is just strange and the habitation is dense so alive so brimming with life that it is almost grotesque yes that sounds odd but i challenge you to disagree with me after you read the book then there are the 'dreamers' speaking of creepy the first encounter with one of these people a woman whom norton and tallent christen eve is disturbing the dreamers are people who don't live with tribe in the village on ivu'ivu but were clearly a part of the tribe at one time what is the reason for their incredible physical health the mythology of u'ivu and ivu'ivu centres around the sun the sea and their good friend the opa'ivu'eke known to us as a huge turtle or tortoise the opa'ivu'eke plays a key role in the eventually very sad story of the people on ivu'ivu he is sacred and revered and later in the story events escalate just the way they have in countless cultures the white race in particular has blundered into another country and decided to take what they want in the name of science and progress and so in a book club discussion the questions such as to what ethics is science held and in particular men of science must be asked what is moral what is criminal we know that our own governments have experimented on people in the name of science and medical progress under the caveat to better humankind society today believes this is torture and we also view experimenting on animals as cruel and unnecessary but years ago this wasn't the case where would laboratories and experiments be without their subjects be they mice rats monkeys dogs or humans personally i found the lengths that norton goes to in the name of science in the quest to learn a secret that could change humankind and make him a world success revolting and his inability to see and understand what everyone around him can is what makes him the man he is his lack of respect combined with his belief of being smarter than everyone else costs him but not nearly enough oh norton is i will say kindly an interesting character well drawn a very unsympathetic driven man with a large ego and a lot of justification for his actions it adds a real edge to the story knowing that norton is in prison for the sexual assault of one of his 40 odd adopted children as he tells his story the reader is keen to learn his side of the sexual abuse accusations and his role in the changes that are brought to the people and environment of ivu'ivu and v'ivu did norton the nobel prize winning scientist and adopted father over 30 years to 40 odd children do what he is sent to prison for did he cause the destruction and demise of a people and a culture read the book and find out","590":" see this review on 1776books net http 1776books blogspot com 2014 05 after reviewing almost 200 books on 1776books hanya yanagihara's debut novel the people in the trees has proven to be the most difficult one to write i try my absolute best to have an open mind and give every book a totally fair review so while many reviewers on goodreads have given this novel poor write ups because of its dark repulsive subject matter i firmly believe that a reviewer should critique the book's writing and story as a whole trying not to let their personal viewpoints affect them so my beef with the people in the trees isn't with the disgusting revelations per se but that they seemed so disjointed with the rest of the book therefore seeming to have no place in it even though the people in the trees is based loosely on a true story yanagihara tries hard to make the reader forget that this particular work is fiction during a brief biased introduction by dr norton perina's colleague editor ronald kubodera we find out that perina has been sent to jail for child molestation he is encouraged to write his memoirs as a world renowned nobel prize winning scientist behind bars and so begins the reader's journey through his life story with footnotes by kubodera as a young man out of medical school perina was asked to go to a far away island to find inhabitants who were rumored to have eternal life this in itself is fascinating and the type of book i thought i was getting based on the synopsis perina ingrained himself with the island villagers but his adventures also bring up many ethical questions again great for discussion throughout his many island visits throughout his life he kept adopting children there and bringing them home it's here where the book gets incredibly disturbing but also very disconnected from the rest of the narrative yanagihara's writing style is filled with beautiful language and if she had just stayed with the question of eternal life that would have made for an enchanting read unfortunately she chose to create something else entirely and this repulsive part did not fit in with the rest of the book my rating 2","591":" i've given the book 5 stars though i would like to take off half a star for the author's relocation of papua new guinea's terrain to the gilbert islands' atolls where the average elevation is 5' and the land un mass is composed of sand on semi sunken coral reefs there were a few other 'huh' moments for me too such as the marigolds used in a ceremony i don't remember seeing any marigolds growing anywhere in polynesia but the writing is excellent the story is well constructed and for the most part believable i doubt very many of his readers have lived on polynesian islands so wouldn't be bothered by these issues","592":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here half a star because i did finish it it's the fictional memoir of a pedophile disguised as something similar to ann patchett's state of wonder which i strongly suggest you read instead the reader isn't certain until the last few pages but there are hints most of the book is about the character's career as a medical researcher and his involvement with an isolated tribe some of whom have achieved eternal life by eating a species of turtle not really and we find that out early on but it' half a star because i did finish it it's the fictional memoir of a pedophile disguised as something similar

premise and i was compelled to keep reading to find out what happens i wish i'd listened to my misgivings this book is not worth the time it takes to read and it's a waste of the author's obvious talent the science anthropology storyline kept me reading but it drags a lot in the last half excruciatingly so near the end the main character is unlikable not in itself a reason to stop reading for me anyway and ultimately not that interesting he's arrogant misogynistic and entitled besides being a pedophile the quality of the writing led me to think there was more to him and his brilliant career than there ultimately is i was hoping there was more i was duped more","593":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here here are some of my random thoughts about the book 1 i wonder if the author has any control on the book summary the summary basically gives away the entire plot of the book which leads to a very slow first half perina does not make the connection between the dreamers state and the turtle until the second half of the novel so we are basically trudging along waiting until he finally makes the discovery leaving out that key portion in the summary soylent green is turtles would have made fo here are some of my random thoughts about the book 1 i wonder if the author has any control on the book summary the summary basically gives away the entire plot of the book which leads to a very slow first half perina does not make the connection between the dreamers state and the turtle until the second half of the novel so we are basically trudging along waiting until he finally makes the discovery leaving out that key portion in the summary soylent green is turtles would have made for a more exciting story line 2 we are supposed to believe that perina is writing his memoirs notes for his colleague to eventually publish i found it disingenuous that he would write in extreme detail about events from his childhood school age and college years supposedly 60 70 years after they happened by extreme detail i mean his thoughts and his thoughts about those thoughts and what he thought those thoughts might mean i kid you not yes i realize this is character development but i found that it detracted from my reading i wonder if it could have been more believable to have this done in journal form written throughout his life rather than remarkably remembering every single detail from his childhood a good 70 years later maybe i'm too much of a realist but i just couldn't let go of this fact and it bothered me that i kept finding the book unbelievable 3 the ending for me made the book i would have given the first half of the novel 3 stars but with the 5 star ending i gave it an even 4 overall i was totally surprised at the ending and surprised at my reaction for someone as horrifyingly narcissistic as perina in the end he basically made no contribution to mankind or even the scientific community and single handedly

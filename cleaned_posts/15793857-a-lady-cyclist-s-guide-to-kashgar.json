lady cyclist's guide to kashgar was a pleasant change and a joy to read evocatively written by the author and true to the period it opens a window to the reader on to the lives of 3 women sent to work as missionaries in a volatile area of the world in 1923 this is mainly evangeline's story recorded in her journal not only is it a record of their journeys but of their lives betrayal love cruelty and fear written alongside the journal is also a tale of today when both stories become intertwined it is an exceptional book although i felt the story wasn't finished i wanted more there were too many whys and wherefores unanswered thrilled to receive this as a goodreads firstread","2":"the story alternates between two time frames 1923 and present day london it follows 3 female missionaries in kashgar even though one of them is there under false pretences having no real interest in saving souls the descriptions are really well written you can almost taste the food feel the heat smell the vast range of scents the mission however turns into something of a nightmare but a collection of letters etc eventually turns up in modern day london i don't know that there's much cycling involved but i think the timeframes were brought together nicely and i do feel as if i 've been on a bit of an adventure this was a first reads giveaway thank you","3":"the usual missionaries run amok but otherwise a very good read","4":"well written and engaging overall i could have used a bit more character development for a few of the characters and the ending was tied up too quickly for my liking however it was an easy and enjoyable read","5":"i enjoyed this book i listened to it and the literary tool of having two parallel storylines come together in an unexpected way was very effective there were four generations of women featured in this novel and it was interesting to see that even though each woman was very different in her personality and perspective in life they had similar experiences desires and strategies for facing dealing with life it brings home the idea that we truly are influenced in powerful ways by the things that happen in our families even generations before we are born vey good book well written and worthy of spending time reading it","6":"i loved the women's quotes and bicycle tips in this book","7":"interesting well written but not really my style of novel so only rated it a 3","8":"i loved this book full of excitement and surprises and beautifully written","9":"so many books too little time couldn't get into this one at all gave up after 100 pgs","10":"i like both stories eva and the ladies in the 20's and frieda in the now there is such a dichotomy about those early travelers to far off lands their curiosity and wonder at the new sights and old cultures always at war with their sense of absolute moral superiority without which missionaries could not exist the places in which they find themselves are wracked with nonstop sectarian violence that hasn't changed eva the agnostic in the group is a quiet contrast to her god besotted sister and millicent the fierce absolutist frieda is not a missionary but there is some of the same assumption that westerners have the answers though she is more open and more self questioning her visit to her mother in the maharishi commune puts her in an environment that is as strange to her as the places she has been on her travels perhaps even stranger","11":"i enjoyed this book more than i thought i would it's sparse writing style adds to the story's richness","12":"creative text i'm didn't love the two stories intertwining i just wanted to stick with the missionaries but it was still interesting and worth the read","13":"i really enjoyed this the characters were truly three dimensional with not all aspects of their personalities particularly admirable but interesting all the same reminded me of an english film a lot happens including quite violent incidents and traumatic events but the general pace is gentle","14":"a beautifully written book telling two stories in parallel of two different women but one takes place in the 1920s and one in the present day the connection between the two stories gradually becomes apparent in a way that kept me in suspense until the end the two stories have some common themes such as the strength of character of the two women and also the challenges of adjusting to life in different cultures i loved the vivid characters and places in the book and i could really visualise being in the places in which the stories took place i found this book really gripping and i will definitely read more by this author incidentally the book had very little to do with cycling which was odd considering the title","15":"the first book i read this summer a story of women missionaries and adventurers a story within a story which always compels me a story of cultures clashing and growing in appreciation there is a harsh beauty in this story about a young woman who decides to join a group of missionary women going to the eastern edge afganistan on the border with china in order to take her bicycle and write a guide for women cycling in far away places what made these women seek out adventure mystery and danger this has begun a summer of wonderful books i am telling everyone i know about it","16":"in 1920s kashgar evangeline finds herself taking care of an adopted newborn baby girl when a local rebellion turns its attention on her fellow missionary she must escape on foot over the mountains in modern day london frieda finds herself responsible for the belongings of a woman she's never heard of before solving the mystery of this unknown next of kin makes frieda find her mother now living on a bizarre commune in sussex and connect with a yemeni street artist who sleeps in her stairwell this would be a 3 5 stars book for me it's full of sad lonely characters and left me feeling moody plus the split narrative wore on me after a while but the writing is interesting slow paced and dreamy poetic and kudos to the author for not giving what i'd expected i expected a lucy honeychurch type of character having adventures figuring out what makes her so english and what makes everyone else so not english lots of tea and friendships and cringeworthy orientalism which the modern frieda would somehow rehabilitate but there's nothing so cozy here this is a complicated kind of dark exploration of mothers and daughters nurturing abandoning rejecting resenting generation after generation everyone roaming and restless my favorite character was tayeb the yemeni man living in london past his visa and he's probably not even necessary for the story the owl was a nice touch too","17":"very much enjoyed this","18":"enjoyed this book though the jumping between eras was quite lumpy and not easy to understand especially as the character of frieia was imperfectly drawn but amazing to think of travelling in the 1920s and dramatically written","19":" i don't know what i was expecting but i don't think this was it i'm not sure that ms joinson really knew what she wanted this to be it has the same problems i find every time i read something literary the details that are omitted render the story much less credible for me and invariably make me think the author was just lazy in not including them further various elements in this case for example tayeb's psoriasis always seem to represent something that i never ever get and if these elements aren't intended to symbolize something else why are they there to fill out the story i'm guessing that's not it because usually such elements are just weird shit that doesn't make any difference one way or the other i'm rambling but i really did want to like this book instead it was just unfulfilling bits that might have been really cool like knowing how much of the journal was really in the final draft of eva's book or more details about the journey home aren't there at all nor are substantive details about lizzie's illness or how the relationship between eva and francis develops or the journey out to kashgar or any background of the region in the 1920s or anything about irene's childhood in england etc instead we get a jumble of hints much like this review and not much else there had been at least 3 people to whom i was looking forward to recommending this now i'm just hoping that if they read it they can explain it to me in the meantime i'm going back to my genre series' which is clearly where i belong","20":"i enjoyed the slow reveal of how thee two plotlines in this novel are connected there are some thematic connections of course but also some links between characters one thing i particularly enjoyed is that the whole thing is shown the connection is never told to the reader so to speak in any direct way i wouldn't say this was a fast paced book but it held my interest and the story flowed along nicely i liked the characters and and found the story very enjoyable if you like stories with strong female characters i'd recommend picking this up","21":"i'm going to have to give this one the it was a flop stamp i was not impressed and i didn't really get the point of the story as in it spanned three generations of women who have oddly similair issues in life with me personal sense of purpose etc but even beyond that the writing just wasn't any good i mean it wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't anything extraordinary i could see spots where the author was clearly trying to be profound but it just fell short for me plus the story line itself was just so odd that it was hard to get what was going on locations and placements and what on earth a lot of these rabbit trail story's had to do with the actual plot yeah i'm left feeling like i kind of wasted my time","22":"disappointing what started off with such promise ended in tedium poorly edited one of those books that's not quite bad enough to stop reading but once you've finished it you can't quite forgive yourself for spending so much time on it","23":"different really enjoyed very evocative of place and time the characters were well drawn with definite personalities one does have to wonder about the logic of sending people in this case missionaries that have no understanding of another culture or the slightest intention of learning about another culture into potential conflict situations and then disowning them once they become embarrassing","24":"at first i was not sure that i liked this book but then at the end i could not put it down as the story started to entwine and take shape hold on for the end it really was good","25":"wow not sure whether it was the terrible atrocious what the hell were they thinking reader or the pretty much random plot that got to me worse but listening to this book became an effort of will i finished it this evening with a sigh of relief decided to pan it i had honestly been thinking quite hard about whether it was good and i had just lost patience or was being short sighted and then cracked up when reading the review below this one which clearly agrees with me about the reader so i'll start there sussssannnnn duerdannnnnnn the readah has an affffffffffffffffected way of speakinggggggggggggggg she is whispery and pretentious over enunciating virtually everything until she reads a man's voice in the modern part of the story and suddenly she is loud and emphatic weird she should never be employed as a reader again ever check out a sample if you don't believe me luckily this was a library download mp3 book so i am not stuck having wasted $20 or so the story well it seems like it was an attempt to ride the tide of spunky ladies who break stereotypes stories blended with a blending time periods story but it is odd unfinished and confusing there seems to be a big theme of hey homosexuality and then a modern theme of unhappy love unfinished business bad parents smoking and birds no joke the heroine inherits an owl does anything happen with it nope it escapes then returns eats hoots nearly gets released and then moves to the sea with the heroine do we know why it's there um no oh there's also a bad skin motif and a mucous motif no joke long descrip of a bad mother coughing mucous onto her hand and not having anything to wipe it off with so spare yourself don't listen to this","26":"well written novel with chapters alternating between 1923 kashibar on the silk road and present day london","27":"i did not finish this book i found it hard to follow both the historical and present day stories at once don' t bother with this one","28":"it was ok i don't know parts were interesting and parts were just a bit ridiculous and millicent was just evil","29":"i was intrigued by this novel and excited about reading it and on the whole it mostly delivered although i agree that it had its moments for me it was probably 3 5 stars there are two stories running through the book from a different time eva in 1920s kashgar and frieda in modern day london and there is a connection between them which becomes clearer as you move through the novel in 1920s kashgar eva is travelling with her sister lizzie and the missionary millicent with the intent of setting up christian missionaries through the middle east i say intent because while lizzie was totally under the influence of millicent eva was using it as an excuse to have an adventure and write a guide book about travelling with her bike they come across a child in labour stop to help but while the baby is safely delivered the young mother dies leaving them with a child to look after and facing a charge of murder in the modern day we have frieda who works as a researcher of islamic countries has a troubled relationship with a married man and an absent hippy mother she strikes up a friendship with a young immigrant who is sleeping rough outside her flat and is then left a property by irene guy although she has no idea who this lady was there were a lot of meaty themes running through the book racial and religious differences finding one's place in the world families relationships i generally found the writing good i liked the way that the two strands came together yet it lacked something for me which prevented it from being an excellent book and i found some of the characters and situations a little trying definitely worth a read though","30":"i read about 40 pages and realized that this book is just not for me the characters didn't resonate with me","31":"i am an inpatient reader so the first half of this book i was frustrated that the story was not coming together if i had rated it then it would have been a 3 in the end however the story did come together and it was a beautiful read and i have given it a 4 a different kind of hf set in kashgar in the 20s the modern part brought the story together but not until about halfway through the book","32":"i recieved this book for free from goodreads an interesting read two lovely stories combined to make for a captivating tale not usually the type of book i would pick up but well worth the read","33":"i just came from kashgar and thought this would be a delightful sequel to my trip but 40% of the way through i was bored and confused and found that i had to force myself to keep reading so i stopped","34":"beautiful insightful and spellbinding a story of two women living at different times 1923 and now a book i couldn't put down and one i will definitely remember and cherish","35":"eh i had to force my way through this it got interesting near the end but not enough to change my opinion on this book i really did want to like it","36":"egalley courtesy of the publisher and netgalley coma lady cyclist's guide to kashgar certainly presents a unique story but fails to fully deliver on its promise in part narrated by eva who is one of three female missionaries head out to a muslim city in western china in the 1920s cyclist's guide also interweaves a modern story of a transient female reporter who inherits the property of a woman she doesn't know while the historic sections are intriguing with their drama and religious conflict the modern story falters at a slow pace joinson's main characters are well developed with the exception of millicent who is presented as the flat antagonist of the novel ultimately the two storylines never coalesce into a satisfying whole joinson's connection of the two plots was obvious to me within the first third of the book i tend to agree with other reviewers who have noted that ai lien's story is potentially the most interesting yet she is all but missing as a character however the plot alone kept me going as i wanted to see how things resolved two and a half stars","37":"it title drew me in such potential for a good adventure didn't get very far into it before i put it down","38":"with the two intertwining stories of lost women trying to find themselves i kept reading though i had anticipated the solution to a central mystery much earlier than it was revealed to the characters the story of eva the missionary from the 1920s was more compelling but with present day frieda i found an amusing affinity having myself grown up wishing for normal food and especially no embarrassing pictures of mom's guru in the living room when i invited friends over i identified strongly with many of frieda's childhood memories of her hippie new age mother the funniest scene in the whole book to me was a young frieda trying to discourage her parents' friend from showing too much interest in her by singing put your hand in the hand since the people in her parents' social circle were allergic to christianity like others i found myself profoundly disappointed with the ending of the book in the ongoing stories of frieda and tayeb a yemeni immigrant with whom she crosses paths there was just enough detail to keep me interested until the end which felt rushed and unfinished as if the author had suddenly become tired just when the reader wants the story to go on and on eva's story is cut off abruptly too though as hers is told through a diary there is a more natural explanation for that i suppose researchers are faced with this sort of thing all the time certain timelines in a living or dead person's life or a family history are well documented while others are only fragmentary still fiction provides more opportunity to fill in the blanks and this author unfortunately has chosen not to","39":"a wonderful book i hope there will be a sequel to discover the life of ms english and the character development of irene guy it was hard to put down the book with so many surprises along the way","40":"an enjoyable read with lots of interesting details and a story that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next i didn't really empathise with any of the main characters though except for tayeb all the female figures seemed a bit prickly maybe that was the point","41":"it started slow and i did not get the connection of the present time and the 1920's this book was a good read once i got into the different times and the book told a good story","42":"looking forward to this one got it for free from good reads provided i write a review sounds good to me i finally had the time to read this novel the cover of this edition really was attractive all that cool blue made me think of the mediterranean perhaps not such a good cover choice as the novel is set in london and kashgar but there is mention of a lake at one point overall i found this a disappointing read it's a split time and place novel you really have to be a good writer to make that work not sure this did work i never felt a connection between the times even though of course the people do link through in a vague way for me i didn't feel the connection nothing like the time travellers wife which performed this trick admirably i began to feel that i didn't know what was going on from one reading session to the next because of the switching and the tenuous connections which only come in towards the end anyway i didn't really care how they linked the london story was vaguely interesting but fizzled out and the india story missed so much opportunity i would not be surprised to hear that the author had never been to india there was no evocation of the sights and smells and sounds she tried but it didn't work in the far pavilions i literally felt as though i was there that didn't happen with this book the relationships in the story fail to go anywhere and there is almost no point to the title of the book as there is precious little cycling done in it and nothing useful in the way of notes to write a guide with all in all nicely worded and moderately interesting but not a great read i had to force myself not to put it aside for something more interesting instead","43":"well the story line was quite confusing but as i went on the story began to developed clearly two different year and yet connected it was about a woman whose trying to figure out about her family history and the death of a mystery old lady led her to a shocking discovery","44":"exotic location interesting time in history all seen from a bike recipe for a good book yet something just did not work in this novel too many unlikeable characters who gradually vanish as the novel progresses leaving an empty unfulfilled feeling","45":"joinson suzanne a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar unabridged 9 cds 10 5 hours tantor audio 2012 this is a review of the audiobook by tantor of a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar a novel by suzanne joinson read by susan durden one wishes one had read the book first and would suggest the same to anyone interested in this project it is very rare one hears an audio book where the narrator has actually ruined the book here though is a classic case the book plot is in fact two stories one about missionaries going to kashgar along silk road in 1923 facing societal discordance of values and freida a woman in present day london and her inheritance from an unknown person whom she is said to be the last living relative the two plot lines intertwine at the end of the book the first third of this audiobook is painful to listen to as the narrator has developed a pausing technique that holds a count after every period this seems deliberate as she is very able to read the characters when they are speaking with complex voice interpretations however the narration portion of the book is in such a non standard reading pattern that it is really irritating i walked away from this audiobook two or three times but actually was intrigued by where the characters were going and discovering the connection between them at the ending though i found myself crying foul it was an insipid end after investing so much time with this painful listening experience i felt both the author suzanne joinson and the narrator susan durden had failed and let me the reader down do not buy","46":"very well written and beautiful themes interwoven but characters were highly irritating","47":"sorry just can't do it too many books too little time as i have gotten older i have decided if i can't wait to get back into the book it's not for me i have plowed my way through 100 pgs in a matter of about 5 weeks it's not happening something else i was on the hold list at the library for weeks came up and i am 325 pgs into it within 3 days so no i am done with this one boring characters are dull and lifeless i read reviews and i would be throughly disappointed if these lives didn't intersect somehow and they apparently really don't onto something more interesting","48":"i can't say i ever imagined i would read a book set in turkestan but this was really good it skipped between the story of evangeline english working with her sister and millicent as missionaries in kashgar in the 1920s and all the political and religious problems they encounter and the present day story of irene's granddaughter frieda as she learns about her family history with the help of tayeb both stories were really interesting but the modern day story was somewhat lacking in detail the link between frieda and irene was not a big surprise but the encounter with frieda's mother was weird and somewhat shocking seriously tongue cutting more a cult than a commune it would have been nice to know a bit more about frieda tayeb and where that owl came from i was never really clear why eva would be interested in accompanying lizzie and millicent on this trip and definitely don't see why anyone want to read a women's guide to cycling through the chinese desert but the novel was very good i really liked the character of eva and how she dealt with all the trials that were put before her raising ai lien the shock of her sister's relationship with millicent the muslim uprising that changes their situation so dramatically and her escape across the desert definitely a worthwhile read","49":"what's strange is that this book is about a woman and her mother to some extent and her great grandmother to a large extent but not her grandmother who appears only as a baby a strange moving story or two stories one set in 1920s in kashgar and one in current day london this veering back and forth in time between two stories is getting to be a bit over done at any rate suzanne joinson does it well if maddeningly the book is about being an outsider an immigrant or an anthropologist or just an artist","50":"not a lot to say about this book i finished it a month or so ago and just saw it in my kindle and remembered i had read it nothing in particular stands out in my memory in either a good or a bad way","51":"i wasn't a fan i cannot relate to characters that are in adulterous relationships no matter how interesting the story or locale","52":"i gave this book a fighting chance but i failed at being able to gain any interest in the plot or characters the overall story was uninteresting void of any enticing sub plots or the like there are too many other books that i am eager to read to waste time on this one","53":"i'm not sure what i expected but this was not it to me it was both far fetched yet predictable an easy and quick read but not a story that stays with you not brilliant writing that you want to read again none of the characters were compelling to me actually i'd like to ask for those few hours reading back i gave it three stars because the author seems to know the area and history and that aspect was interesting","54":"i think the inklings my book club would enjoy reading this book i really found it to be different and fascinating attributes i love in a book","55":"i enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would especially the mystery of the connection between the two protagonists","56":"interesting not really what i expected but worthwhile","57":"alternating chapters between the story of a lady cyclist in kashgar and a contemporary story in great britain there are connections between the two stories that are revealed as the stories proceed no lessons here just entertainment","58":"beautifully written amazing storyline felt left wanting more so sad when the book finished well done clever talented suzy","59":"this was a good book at first i was confused about the way the book jumped between past and present but once i acclimated i really liked that aspect i kept trying to guess what the connection could be sometimes i was more interested in one narrative over the other i found both to be quite compelling overall i liked this book so much i wanted to know what happened but at the same time i didn't want it to end","60":"such an interesting read with parallel stories from 1923 and present day set in the desert on the silk road and modern day britain the story is so odd and wonderful with many themes crossing in and out this is the author's first book she does a great job","61":"what skill it took to reveal the storyline using three voices two from present day london and one from the past in kashgar and other locations i couldn't put this book down","62":"i enjoyed this novel the writing is very lyrical and the metaphors about flight and freedom are well done though perhaps so well done the author sometimes comes across as trying too hard i never felt like i had a true sense of the characters","63":"the story in this book or stories one in the past one in the present were a bit too fragmented for my taste i also felt the characters never really got developed and the story meandered without a lot of meaning or completion in the end nice try but just didn't come together for me","64":"a fun struggle and compromise between tradition and life i absolutely adore this novel and have already passed it on to be loved more","65":"i enjoyed this but the ending was a little flat for me this seems like the kind of book that ladies who lunch would discuss at book clubs inventing all kinds of hidden meaning and metaphors i would be very quiet just waiting for the refreshments to be served","66":"what's going on here may be the initial reaction to a lady's guide all make that most will be revealed as the two seemingly disparate stories slowly and carefully intertwine","67":"there is very little actual bike riding in this story but i will refrain from cries of false advertisement because the book is quite an adventure not exactly a heart breaking novel but it did leave you wondering well what was all that sacrifice for anyway there are numerous themes that tie the past and present story lines from alienation and religious hypocrisy to love and our hurried lives the library journal review is spot on beautifully written in language too taut piercing and smartly observed to be called lyrical there are many lines that grab your attention make you stop to digest them or copy them down on scraps of paper suzie j does an especially amazing job at capturing the bareness of the desert landscape longing to reach an empty place thinking of the peace and stillness that must be inherent in such a desert landscape our proximity through travel gas annihilated any sense of intimacy so that i am left alone but the all time best line is her description of the fatigue of caring for a newborn as being deeper than any travel weariness","68":"the bouncing back and forth between setting and characters just did not work for me it read like a journal entry too","69":"i was so anxious to read this book and enjoyed it but not as much as i hoped still it was a good read and i would probably recommend it might be especially good for book club discussions","70":"this book made me bored there was too much going on and didn't keep my interest","71":"i read this book in a matter of days on my vacation it is a great book although not quite what i was expecting there's the dual historical contemporary timelines both of which were well written and very intriguing i thought it would be more of a journey book detailing the route evangeline takes through the region in the 1920's and it ended up being a much more stationary novel which was fine the literary nerd in me really liked all of the parallels in the various timelines characters very enjoyable and absorbing","72":"the story is not what i expected but that is a good thing i think the two stories worked well together intermixing the past and present delusion and self awareness weakness and stength all played out in a world in transition","73":"as an amazon vine reviewer i try not to read any other reviews before reading a book as to not cloud my own reading experience or judgement but as i was approaching this novel's three quarter mark i just had to stop and check out the other reviews i had gotten to the point where i was leaning towards calling it quits and tossing it in the pile to be taken the used bookstore for trade in credit although i give the author credit and two stars just for the story concept alone which is a creative one i felt the book was simply lacking in substance and story the story is told by two characters that switch from the present to the past at the point where i had to throw in the towel i still had not seen a connection linking the stories together the novel moves at a snail's pace moving so slow it almost doesn't move at all i am not a reader who needs a lot of action or drama to keep my attention but this narrative was painfully boring joinson's character development is very lame neither the couple in the now or the three sisters in the past had any depth to their personalities enough for the reader to either like them or dislike them their characters were flat and lifeless and i found myself simply not caring what happened to any of them in the present we have a young yemeni man basically homeless who finds himself on the doorstep of a young woman who has recently inherited a house from a mysterious woman she never heard of in the past we have three british sisters acting as missionaries in the middle east in the 1800's causing local unrest and trouble when their arrival is unwelcome i found the unique personalities and actions of these three sisters highly unlikely for the era they lived in and for the places they visited the title of this novel is a lady's cyclist's guide to kashgar even though the key sister of the story that takes place in the past the actual narrator for that section of the book is writing a cyclist's guide of her travels that she hopes will be published at their journey's end i came across no cycling happening at all even after reading three quarters of the book i guess it was not all about the bike certainly with this novel i did not get what i expected it was poorly written lacked a little meat to flavor the story had lifeless characters one couldn't relate to and to boot had so many grammatical errors and poor sentence structure that i ended up giving up telling myself that there were hundreds of other books in my stacks to get to instead of wasting anymore time on this one i was not enjoying sorry folks i give any author credit for trying but this was strongly lacking in the key ingredients that make a novel excellent","74":"it just isn't a very well written book the premise is unique but neither story from the past or modern day was made interesting by the author so i quit before i got too far in","75":"if only there were a 'read half way then had to give up' shelf i tried but i just didn't like it i wasn't sure what the author wanted me to learn or know about either situation other than some countries are pretty harsh to live in or that people in general aren't that nice i didn't like any of the characters they all seemed rather selfish and showed no real reason for me to get behind their stories the title promised an interesting tale but i am afraid that for me the book failed to live up to it maybe it's just me","76":"yawn oh i'm sorry was i reading a book i must have drifted off due to the extreme boredom i experienced while reading this","77":"composed of equal parts old school travel adventure story and modern day clash of cultures narrative i started kashgar convinced that i was about to discover a new favorite book the first strand of the parallel narratives following eva a british woman who travels through central asia by bicycle in the 1920s reminded me of the great travelers freya stark and gertrude bell who mapped large swathes of the middle east in the final decades of the british empire unfortunately eva has little to no personality joinson clearly means for her to undergo a dramatic transformation in the course of her journey shedding her old life and beliefs but eva fails to leap off the page even while narrating her own story in a series of journal entries meant to eventually become the guidebook of the title the discovery of new lands and cultures and the conflicts between muslims and chinese take a back seat to the tiresomely repetitive quarrels between eva and her companions after a dramatic opening chapter in which eva witnesses a woman die giving birth and saves the baby the narrative keeps the women trapped in a hot compound after reading what felt like the tenth description of dust sun and sweat i was desperate to hear about anything else fortunately eva's narrative in the 1920s alternates with the story of a woman named frieda living in present day london i was initially drawn in by joinson's sharp portrayal of frieda's modern day dislocation working as a muslim world researcher there are finely observed passages in the beginning perfectly capturing how it feels to be a woman travelling in the muslim world and trying to fit in but that early momentum is lost when frieda catches a homeless yemeni man sleeping on her doorstep their encounter pretty much follows a paint by numbers cultural clash approach complete with the adoption of a poor pet owl who is asked to bear a heavy metaphorical responsibility none of these characters are real people they are the emotionally disconnected western woman and the mystical sensitive middle eastern man the two narratives entwine only in the most obvious way i was able to identify the connection from the first few chapters and had no sense of why past and present interacted in a way that illuminated the other i was also a bit disturbed by the careless parallel the novel was asking me to accept british women meet muslims in central asia is the same as a british woman meeting a muslim yemeni are we really still comparing people of wildly different cultures and geographical backgrounds simply because they happen to share a religion along with more than billion other people this is a tiresome and lazy parallel seemingly designed for a superficial book club discussion joinson does write beautifully i continued reading only because i appreciated her poet's ability to show how landscape can illuminate a character's emotional life because of this i'd be willing to take a look at her next book perhaps her prose used with a stronger grasp of plot and character and a more sophisticated sense of culture and history will result in an engaging novel i received this copy for review from the publisher through netgalley","78":"it's the journey","79":"this first novel by suzanne joinson had some wonderful lines and phrases that alone make it a good read i loved the cover and the two stories but somehow i kept getting lost with too many characters suzanne did a wonderful job of keeping my interest in the plots however if the cyclist was a missionary i didn't see much of it the women were strong and fascinating i might even consider reading it again at a much better pace i was too distracted","80":"i loved the quirky title of this book u0026amp the exotic time u0026amp location intrigued me being set in the early 1900s in the far east having said that it did take me a while to warm to it u0026amp i was initially disappointed however the longer i stuck with it the more absorbed i became with the two tales which were being spun u0026amp the clever way the present day situation of freida in london was linked with the english sisters in their desperate far flung circumstances i could not put it down for the second half of the book","81":"i really wanted to like this more but somehow it didn't quite come together for me i felt as if the point the author was seeking to make was somehow getting in the way of the narrative and the characters this is a story about those who don't quite fit in always searching for something more and its a pretty damning view of the west's desire to convert the heathens of the east there are some beautiful parts of this book particularly the theme of birds running through it and the descriptions of kashgar but it just didn't come together for me unfortunately","82":"well written intriguing setting","83":" dull and confusing i think i heard about this through bas bleu but i don't really remember i saw it on the library shelf and picked it up and now i'm mad that i wasted time on it i read someone's synopsis that said it was a slow starter so i was prepared for that i feel like it never really started though none of the characters were likable at all they weren't well formed either so i didn't necessarily dislike them i just didn't care i couldn't figure out what lizzie's fascination with millicent was she was pregnant and then a lesbian i also felt like the gay lesbian thing was extraneous it didn't add to the story at all so millicent was taking advantage of a confused epileptic schizophrenic girl why did it have to be a lesbian relationship if you aren't taking it anywhere and how did that fit into the religiosity of millicent and why did the two men have to be gay i'm also not sure what evangeline's affair was supposed to accomplish as that seemed to add nothing to the story at all the links between the two narratives was also really poorly done i felt like they never really joined up to give a clear coherent message i knew from about 1 3 of the way in that frieda was somehow related to the baby and i never figure things out was it supposed to be that apparent or was the subtlety mystery just really mishandled i forgot the worst part eva almost never rode the bicycle there was no cycling in here she dragged it around and there were a couple descriptions of her pushing it not sure where the title came from but a misnomer to say the least i want to like this i don't want to disparage a first novel that someone clearly worked very hard on however i really can't think of anything nice to say i hope i forget this very soon i'm pretty sure i will","84":"although this was a goodreads giveaway i already had it on my to read list having heard a snippet about it on the radio which made it sound interesting the book begins with a shocking scene but for me that's where it peaks the concept is interesting but the story and the writing are too lightweight i quickly lost interest the more contrived the book became which is a shame because there are a lot of interesting facts scattered through it i've rarely felt so relieved to let myself off the hook and put a book down unfinished i haven't read other reviews yet because i don't like to bias my own opinions but i'm guessing that they'll be fairly mixed and possibly torn between loving it and hating it so each to their own","85":"my problem with this book were two 1 the author's voice jarred me when i started analyzing the writing style i realized i wasn't absorbed by the story 2 i didn't care about any of the characters they weren't particularly interesting or endearing i only finished this book because it was chosen for our book club one of us liked it the other three didn't","86":"a bit of a frustrating listen since i did enjoy the sections set in kashgar in the 1920's but then the scene would shift to present day london and the narrative momentum would be lost the audio version was read by susan duerden who kept things interesting enough to finish","87":"the lady cyclist doesn't bicycle much but does use this title as her diary journal name and the name of the book she is to eventually write for publication she exists in 1923 as eva who with her sister lizzie and another woman millicent goes along the silk road intending to be missionaries i'd say without missionary interest or passion what they do is not follow basic customs of travel where one trys to understand the culture of a place instead eva ends up with a baby when a woman died and her sister lizzie dies they are ostracized and forced to live out of town one wonders where this leads as one embarks on the book jumps from these ladies to a current scene in london where the heroine is frieda frieda is casually dealing with daily love scenes and a man from india who comes into her life just to make her a little odder the author gives her an owl to take manage as a pet it took a long time to have frieda want to find her mother who never took care of frieda as a child at a whacky commune type place where no one talks but writes for communicating in the end i get it eureka three generations of women are a little off kilter they just each have their own way of living their own style of adventure in life i'd stay away from these characters in real life","88":"a fascinating insight into the role of missionaries on the chinese russian borders at the start of the last century from a feminist perspective the story is told by three narrators with loose but pertinent connections between them the plot is slightly weak in that i struggled to get a sense of time and place in the historical sections i enjoyed the modern present day chapters more the device of how life changes when a stranger turns up at the door always works well i would like to know more about these women who travelled to such remote areas the book reminded me of the solar cycle diaries by susie wheeldon who recently cycled across the world and started her chapters with similar comments about bikes and cycling in harsh conditions","89":"i loved this skilfully crafted and beautifully written the book flicks between present day london and kashgar in 1923 eva is wanting to establish a christian mission in this silk route city but it is fraught with danger i particularly liked the way the connections between the past and the present were drawn out over the whole book","90":"enjoyed the rich language and liked the modern story as much as the one set in 1923","91":"i read five or six chapters and just could not connect with the story well stories","92":"engrossing story maybe pompous yes well written individual sentences were captivating but as a whole for me the book fell flat my favorite page of the book was the last page the protagonist moves on from her situation and i get to move onto a better book i wish i'd enjoyed it more had it not been our book club's selection i would have abandoned it much sooner","93":"the book changes between 1923 kashgar where a young woman is there on a mission and modern day london i found the excerpts and the story about the young woman in kashgar to be quite fascinating the writing in these sections is full of richness i would have rather had just stayed with this story line the interweaving with a convoluted modern storyline did nothing to serve the story in my mind still i would say this was an enjoyable read","94":"loved this","95":"two engaging stories woven together good light read and it is hard to put down","96":"far more eerie and even a tad dark at times than the whimsical title suggests the voices of the two central characters were imaginative and believable and the prose equally lovely and demanding","97":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar should not be discounted once you've read the title even if you're not a lady not a cyclist nor know where kashgar is it's in the far west of china near tajikistan and kyrgyzstan this book doesn't really contain much about cycling only a few references to a bicycle nor is it a travel guide it's a lovely story with two parallel narratives running how are they linked you'll probably guess that before the characters do but it's a charming read of the twists and turns life takes across the ages the first character we meet is evangeline eva who has almost arrived in kashgar on a missionary journey with her sister lizzie and lizzie's friend millicent they try to help a young woman giving birth but the woman dies and they become imprisoned in kashgar help is not forthcoming during the long hot days and nights eva writes her book diary - 'a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar' in present day london frieda returns from yet another trip to the middle east to find her married lover has left her in the lurch again and tayeb a refugee from yemen outside when she gives him a blanket a friendship starts up and they join forces to find the mysterious irene guy who frieda is listed the next of kin for i really enjoyed this book - i can't say i was overly sure where kashgar was or knew much about it except that it's likely that michael palin's been there eva's insights into the culture of the turkish and the chinese communities were fascinating and the reactions to the christian missionaries were also surprising especially for the fate of one character joinson also managed to evoke the dry dusty heat and parched horizons very well - kashgar was just as i'd pictured it when i looked it up online i also had a giggle at the research frieda does in her quest to find out who irene guy is joinson must have done a similar search herself because one of the irene guys listed real name is a slight variant works very close to my former workplace i'd love to know if she knew she was listed in a book which i find awesome the characters particularly tayeb and lizzie all had particular quirks which differentiated them in the book lizzie is rarely seen without her leica and tayeb enjoys drawing birds and writing quotes on public walls in fact this gets him in quite a bit of trouble millicent is somewhat of an enigma i couldn't work out exactly what she was up to but i got a reasonable idea my only criticism of this book is that is wrapped up just a little too quickly and neatly i would have loved to read some more about frieda's mother and her 'cult' her relationship with tayeb and just a bit more about irene guy this book is fascinating - a departure from the norm of literary fiction which is truly original definitely worth a read - it would be perfect to distract you on a long journey or for a cozy day of reading","98":"in 1923 eva follows her sister lizzie into the dessert as missionaries eva doesn't make the trip for religious reasons but for adventure and to write a travel book for ladies in present day london frieda returns from a long trip abroad researching muslim youths for a publication she meets tayeb an illegal from yemeni who camps out side her apartment door one night tying the past and present stories together is irene guy who leaves her belongings to frieda after her death the novel is supposed to show the differences between cultures i though each woman's section was too short and choppy for me to get to know them and thier surroundings well","99":"i read this book for my book discussion group which i then missed there were some interesting bits but overall i was disappointed sometimes i'd read a sentence over and over and it still didn't make sense the story is interesting and aided by details of the culture two time periods and groups of people are followed in an mysterious fashion","100":"3 5 starsi love a book with two intertwining story lines like this one in the 1920's we follow the story of a pair of sisters who are missionaries in the silk road city of kashgar they are as different as night and day evangeline is full of religious fervor while lizzie is there to experience and take part in the adventure meanwhile in modern day london we meet frieda returning to her lonely apartment from yet another long assignment abroad two things are about to change her world an encounter with a yemenian artist who happens to be camped outside her apartment door and a letter informing her of an inheritance from a stranger the author descriptive prose made me feel as if i was right there in kashgar in the 1920's the melding of the two story lines came together nicely at the end and made me glad i had read this one","101":"i was intrigued by this novel of intertwining characters from different eras and different cultures but it somehow left me hoping for something more something deeper a richer portrait of frieda i'm not sure exactly what was missing for me that said it was a pleasant read and engaging enough that i read it rather quickly","102":"the author attempts to weave together two interesting stories one set in 1923 about three women who though the china inland mission organization travel to the far western area of china to convert people to christianity but find themselves on trial for murder and one set almost 100 years later in modern london about a woman unexpectedly facing some of the mysteries of her own past i usually enjoy books in which the chapters alternate between two stories and gradually reveal the connection between the two in this case the two stories were so different and the author takes so much time to reveal the connections that it's almost like reading two separate books at the same time and that made following the story difficult for me ultimately i was disappointed in the interweaving of the two stories while both stories are interesting and enjoyable tales it takes so long for the author to connect the two that there's a strong tendency to care about only the characters of one story and just wade through the other as for the story itself i don't imagine the china inland mission organization would like this portrayal of their missionaries none of them seem to be the image the church usually wants for itself except maybe eva who isn't really there for the missionary experience i found some of the character names comical evangeline goes to china as a missionary evangelist millicent is militant the chinese baby eva takes in is named ai lien like alien mr mah brings eva a horse mah is chinese for horse frieda is in many ways held back not free by her past tayeb is a nice guy who decides to help frieda on her quest tayeb means nice i'm not sure why these names bugged me but they did especially ai lien overall i enjoyed the book but i think one might need to already have an interest in stories about china or life in the 1920s to really appreciate it","103":"great book interesting premise flowed along and kept me wanting to read whenever possible","104":"liked the book but the ending dropped off rather quickly still quite interesting","105":"a little bit nonfictional but interesting","106":"despite some instances where it seemed like the story was stalling particularly with frieda debut author suzanne joinson paints a fascinating picture of an exotic land and a woman finding her place in life","107":"i loved the 1920's chapters but could have done without the modern day parts","108":"i picked this book up from the stack from the library primarily because it's due back on thursday thinking that i would read for 15 minutes or so best laid plans i read this while i was cooking breakfast i read it while eating breakfast i read it in the garden i read it all afternoon i couldn't put it down in her debut novel suzanne joiner seamlessly weaves together two stories in the first set in 1923 three young english women find themselves under house arrest in kashgar turkestan after being accused of murder the three were missionaries although to be fair evangeline english is accompanying her younger sister elizabeth riding a green bsa lady roadster more for the adventure rather than out of concern for the saving of souls rounding out the trio is millicent frost who dominates elizabeth and suspects that evangeline is interested more in writing a book about their travels than proselytizing the murder charge was the result of the three women trying to help a young girl they found lying by the side of the road giving birth after her baby girl was born the girl bled to death in the second story set in the present in london frieda blakeman befriends a young man from yemen she discovers sleeping in the hallway outside of her apartment returning from a trip in the middle east frieda also finds a letter informing her that she has been listed as next of kin to a recently deceased woman named irene guy frieda has never met anyone named irene guy and now she has a week to clean out irene's apartment before the contents are sold for salvage slowly by alternating how the two stories unfold joinson reveals the connections","109":"the title caught me first then the cover and oh the endpapers they were quite wonderful ...my imagination had been captured and i was quite ready for the story to take hold of me it did i found myself in kashgar in east turkestan in 1923 i was in the company of three lady christian missionaries millicent was their leader a very capable woman who was quite sure of the rightness of her mission but was maybe unable to understand that others might see the world rather differently lizzie gave her full support to millicent but it seemed that she was a leader and not a follower and i wondered if she was truly following her own path and then there was eva lizzie's elder sister ...\"in my mind's eye i conjure up sir richard burton's crackling eyes give me courage sir richard i have convinced millicent of my missionary calling i have convinced a publisher of the worth of my proposed book i have even tricked my dear sister who believes that i am here in his name to do his good works i should be feeling clever i have escaped england but why then always this apprehension to my surprise despite a childhood of reading maps and reading adventure stories i realise that i am quite terrified of the desert ...\"yes eva was a little different i loved reading her words i loved seeing the world through her eyes described so beautifully and so naturally and i grew to love her the three women changed - were changed - and their relationships changed as they ran into difficulties and found their journey halted i was absorbed i was fascinated as more and more of their characters were revealed and i so wanted to know where the story would take them that made it a little disappointing when i found myself pulled back to contemporary london from time to time frieda was another lady traveller in an age when travel was taken for granted and maybe the sense of wonder had been lost she worked for a think tank travelling through the arab world carrying out research and she had come home to london to find a young arab man sleeping on her doorstep and a solicitor's letter telling her that she was the heir to a woman she knew not at all her story was predictable in places and there were times when i longed to return to eva in kashgar but there were also wonderful moments where the story twisted in ways that were quite unexpected where i found wonderful insights into the human condition then i was quite happy to be in such a familiar place a london that i recognised but a london that occasionally felt as different as kashgar the two stories had similar themes threaded through travel cultural differences motherhood women's independence ... so much has changed and yet so much has remained the same they were of course connected that connection was revealed quite naturally and it felt completely right indeed the whole story felt right i turned the pages quickly caught up with wonderful characters fascinating stories and different worlds so wonderfully described that they came alive before my eyes i suspect that eva's love of travel writing that made her want to travel reflects the passion of her creator \"it was reading her descriptions of the candles and lights and the mysterious glittering interiors the tapirs silks the jewels and hangings that had inspired my desire to travel \"that love shone and it made it easy for me to forgive those very few weaknesses to fall in love with this book as a whole and now i think i need to find another book to take me travelling again to see more of the world through the eyes of other lady travellers ...","110":"a great book set in the early 20's and present day loved it","111":"there isn't much cycling in this book the two interlinked stories that make up the novel were interesting enough and i enjoyed reading it but there was something missing i felt besides the bike i didn't really feel involved with the characters or the stories","112":"this is a rich and heavy book full of inner contemplation and sometimes doubts by the main characters suzanne joinson shows the complexities of human interactions simply through the eyes of two women eva u0026amp frieda who exist decades apart each has her own clash with foreign cultures in different ways and each are changed forever by those clashes this book started off intense with the birth of a baby but then mellowed out considerably as the reader gained more info on the characters and their surroundings indeed i was a little concerned for a bit as to whether or not the book would pick up again but it did and i am glad i stuck with it i enjoyed how joinson showed the unrealistic expectations of the english ladies in the early 1900s kashgar with their english meals three times a day etc at first there was a fair amount of religious talk from millicent and lizzie but this became balanced by eva's hesitancy to shove religious believes and culture on the local people the missionary stuff is also balanced by modern day frieda who is english but not caucasian nor particularly religious her separated parents have had a variety of believes throughout frieda's childhood indeed there was a scene with a water wand that was pretty amusing at a later point in the story frieda feels she must find her mother who left her and her father when frieda was young to have some of her questions answered her father helps her track her mother to a commune where we learn not only a few interesting philosophical believes but also key pieces to the story frieda's interactions with tayeb are sometimes awkward but also on a much more equal footing than the high u0026amp mighty millicent to the unwashed masses of kashgar the difference between these sets of interactions cleverly shows how globalization has done much to break down cultural barriers now you have heard all the things i enjoyed about this book there was really just two things that didn't click for me one of which is that lull in the story i already mentioned the second thing is there are several minor characters and one key secondary character there are gay and with the exception of one of those characters all are portrayed in a bad light indeed one outright takes advantage of another person two others beat the snot out of another character and a fourth is rather uncaring and a bit of snot to one of our main characters without the one kind hearted gay person we find later in the book i was starting to wonder if the author had an issue with homosexuality in general while a very minor part of the book i did feel it gave it a slight unbalanced quality and it detracted a bit on my personal enjoyment of the book narration susan duerden was excellent with all the ladies' voices making each one distinct her mail voices especially that of frieda's boyfriend were believable her high u0026amp mighty voice for millicent was perfect and her accents british italian arabic were well done","113":"nice but there are too many irrelevant characters and side stories the book could have used some focus but well written and an author to watch","114":"unique book with a plot and characters that are unexpected","115":"i was drawn to the idea of the early 20th century lady cyclist out in the wilds and by the map in the front of the book showing the tien shen mountains i went there on holiday a couple of years ago and that hooked me in sorry while this is a good enough read it wasn't the book for me the story in kashgar was far too much about the ineffectual eva her dreamy lovestruck sister her lover the awful millicent and there inadequate struggles to set up a mission in kashgar if fact there weren't even any struggles as the ladies seemed to rely totally on others to to things for them find a place to live find a source of milk for the baby i'l come back to her provide money there seemed very little actual mission style work at all most of the early part of their story was taken up by eva's agonising over the baby they were landed with and there was the story with frieda and tayeb which ambles through the book but ultimately has an unresolved ending an exercise in writing perhaps but half a novel i don't think so although the baby from the cycling story turns out to be frieda's grandmother the two parts never really got joined together overall i got the impression of two ideas for a book neither of which was fully fleshed out one of which kashgar wasn't researched enough to give it more depth and life which had been pressed together to make of novel which for me gave an overall sense of incompleteness","116":"the story began well and the descriptive narrative took me to another land era and the somewhat harsh reality of when cultures and religions clash i liked the switch between past and present day life but i was left slightly disappointed with the ending which i felt was a bit rushed book received through the 'goodreads first read giveaway'","117":"the lady cyclist's guide tells two stories one set in the 1920's and a parallel modern day story this book was a bit of a slow starter for me perhaps because of the two storylines once i could see the connections however i was eager to see where the road would take me i thought that the characters were quite vividly portrayed and i felt like perhaps i knew them but i found myself feeling in the end somewhat sad about the choices some had made yet hopeful for the main characters those who like historical fiction might find it a worthwhile read mary ann","118":"i checked out the audiobook for this and it was all kinds of ridiculous an overly dramatic british accent like snl doing a julie andrews impersonation i couldn't take it also while the plot seemed interesting after the opening scene it is too slow to develop maybe i'll check out the book but in the meantime i'll look for something better","119":"the chapters of this book alternate between 1923 in the turkestan desert and the present day in england the connection is not revealed until the end the last half of the book moved more slowly for me than the beginning a different kind of story","120":"an insightful look into a troubling time","121":"fascinating book with two story lines present day london and 1923 in kashgar learned so much about the traditions of the arab world and the clash of cultures worth the read","122":"i wasn't entirely sure what i felt about this one for some time and i still have a hard time categorizing this first novel effort is it about cycling through kashgar um no it's much more about relationships between women the ways we affect each other how echoes begun by some women can echo down through generations but a lot of this takes place under the surface of this story of an englishwoman missionary in western china and a modern woman in london and what connects their lives the men in the story almost seem like afterthoughts very interesting first effort possibly an author to watch","123":"i first became aware of suzanne joinson when i read better than fiction the collection of travel essays edited by don george for lonely planet i was fascinated by her story of a research trip to the silk road area she was going to write about in a lady cyclist s guide to kashgar her personal story was exciting and her writing was fresh and intriguing the book does not disappoint in fact it was even more than i had thought when i read her description in the essay chasing missionaries my missionary ladies were restless adventurers and their reasons for travelling 1900 1940 were so much more complicated than straightforward religious zeal they hoped to carve a freedom for themselves in the takla makan desert there are two stories blended in this book in the one about the missionary ladies in kashgar in 1923- millicent leads two sisters who follow her to the desert the sister who serves as story teller of this part of the story only pretended to be religious in order to live her dream of following the adventurous path of the explorer sir richard burton her life is a perfect example of the wisdom of being careful what you wish for but the journal she is keeping gives joinson the opportunity to exercise her own terrific powers of observation and description the other story involves a modern day woman in london who seems to lead a life connected to those iconoclastic women in the desert her life intersects with a yemini immigrant in london in both cases there are mysteries to solve missing mothers conflict over religion struggles between christian and muslim the difficulty of fitting into a foreign society joinson keeps us in the dark for a bit more than half the book about how these two stories intersect yet we know they finally must not only is this a rousing good story it turns out that the author has done a very good deed in painting a picture of a territory little changed in the past hundred years until recently when the chinese decided to obliterate most of the old town of kashgar as part of their effort to dominate the recalcitrant uighurs fortunately for us joinson visited and recorded details before the destruction this is a portion of a review i wrote on my website to read the entire review and more about kashgar please go to a traveler's library","124":"enjoyed the story but it got a little bogged down in the middle good use of back and forth between 1923 and the present","125":"i don't usually appreciate books with two storylines one past one present that converge at the end but this one is different perhaps because the pace is handled well i didn't get impatient or irritated or lose track of events as we hopped from one track to the other the story of the lady cyclist is set in the 1920's and the other is in present day somehow between both of these bits we seem to cover life the universe and everything in a general way the novel is about how circumstances personality and decisions shape our lives and those of generations to come in ways we could not possibly imagine i enjoyed it tremendously and was sorry to come to the end i hope ms joinson continues to write fiction we need more authors like her","126":"i liked the story but the narrator in the audible version i listened to was completely distracting she did the voices very well but the narrative was awful i almost stopped listening to it because of her","127":"this is not one of the books i would take off the bookshelf to read it took a young lady from the food bank to lend me this book saying here is a great book i just finished reading and i think you will like it too you know she was right i read this book in large chunks in about four sittings i could not help myself this is one unputdownable book i was taken aback by the prose the author is studying for her ph d in creative writing and man can she write i enjoy a story about far away lands with strange cultures and funny sounding languages and this book did not disappoint i highly recommend this book to book clubs everywhere it's a good read 5 stars","128":"a charming novel that really has very little to do with cycling takes place in the early 1900's in a part of the world i didn't even know about kashgar a chinese controlled muslim nation two sisters are on a mission one sister really just going along for the adventure to bring christianity to the desert it is 2 stories being told simultaneously eventually tied together somewhat predictably it is not a show stopper but i did enjoy the gentle read and interesting characters","129":"fun read loved the characters and the pace of the book wished it included more about kashgar itself but worth the read","130":"a promising debut novel since the author had an interesting premise and told a good story but fell down a bit in not developing further two characters the mother and grandmother of the modern character who were the links between her and the cyclist of the title i also may have been disapointed because the blurb on the back compared it to two of my favorite books major pettigrew's last stand and the guernsey literary and potato peel society both of which were first novels but regrettably this is nowhere as good as either of those","131":"this was a lovely story and a quick read as well a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar tells the story of evangeline and frieda two women several generations countries and cultures apart from one another who share some very specific and striking similarities as the story unfolds across 1920s kashgar and modern day england readers discover how intimately connected these women and their stories are and learn how the choices they make both small and large will determine their similar but wholly unique fates one thing i loved about this book was the way items played such significant and symbolic roles throughout a camera a mobile printing press a toy village encased in glass a manuscript a live owl each of these items act as a way of defining and illuminating the people who cherish them author suzanne joinson has done a truly fantastic job of creating characters that readers are compelled to follow through to the conclusion of this story i honestly couldn't put the book down check it out","132":"joinson's first novel brings many pleasures and hints at the writer she may become as she develops greater narrative control and reduces her over reliance on symbolic references this book the tale of a trio of missionary women two sisters and their mentor in 1923 juxtaposed with a modern story of a woman who travels the world reporting on behalf of ngos tries to encompass a great deal women's need to break free from the constraints of culture to forge relationships with men and far more significantly between mother and daughter the themes of flight and freedom are ambitious but in the end joinson meanders and ends up rushing the endings following the climactic though predictable reveal of the relationship between the 20th and 21st century portions of the tale still to joinson's credit i felt for eva an irreligious missionary who decided to pursue life in a strange land to escape the doldrums of life in england as she adjusted to the unasked for role of mother to a orphaned baby girl eva's encounter with new cultures dangerous situations and her dawning insight into the world of sexuality are drawn with care and are richly evoked less convincing was frieda who despite her seemingly glamorous career on the front line of reportage on culture clashes managed to saddle herself with a married and worthless lover yes she was deserted by her mother and raised by a father scarcely less narcissistic but still why does she endure a long term affair with this idiot and why does she bond with the homeless yemeni man who draws her a beautiful bird picture after allowing him to sleep on the landing in front of her london flat why is it that she is suddenly able to confront her abandonment issues once she receives an unexpected notification to empty the flat of a woman she's never heard of before and why all the emphasis on birds but so little on the bicycle that figures so prominently in the title credibility issues aside i prefer literary missteps resulting from bravado to failures arising from cowardice joinson has a good shot at blossoming into a novelist worth watching yes i knowt eva feels a sense of flying and freedom when riding her bike but joinson stretches things a bit far with tayeb's desire to draw birds as a result of his father's occupation as a supplier of birds to be slaughtered by yemen's elite and the owls that frieda inherits from irene guy","133":"thanks to netgalley for providing me with a free e galley for the purpose of reviewing lovely cover exotic sounding story this sounded like it was going to be a beautiful adventure in some ways it was kashgar is located in the uyghur region of china an area that i wasn't at all familiar with until i started researching places to visit in china it was definitely a treat to visit a book that was half set there and get a glimpse into a city that mixed chinese and muslim influences the descriptions of the food made my mouth water flatbreads rose yoghurt and tomatoes sprinkles with sugar and i happily let the book carry me away to the busy bazaars and sweltering heat of the desert in the modern narrative the location was less exotic but there were still plenty of images for the mind to feast on - tayeb's artwork a bohemian commune and an owl expecting its owner to engage in a hoot fest during mating season overall readers seem to dislike the alternating narrative form of storytelling i'm not ready to commit myself to that opinion just yet but i definitely understand the reasons for it it's hard enough for an author to come up with one point of view that readers love and it's even harder to come up with two a lot of the time i'll strongly prefer one to the other and angrily skim past the less likeable character's portion to get to what i want to read like in one day with this book i didn't favor one character's sections overall but at various sections in the book i definitely favored one narrative to the other this was often because the two plotlines alternated in when they were more suspenseful and i would be tempted to skip one narrator's section to find out what was happening in the other however another reason why i didn't have a strong preference for eva or frieda was because the characters weren't very accessible i'd describe both of them as independent and modern for their respective times but that's about all i would come up with another thing about having dual narratives is that they have to somehow connect to each other in some novels that connection is apparent from the beginning in this one it's not it isn't revealed until pretty far into the book and that revelation wasn't particularly impactful i kept reading past that thinking that a stronger connection would materialize but it never did it seemed like the ending of the book could have been fleshed out a lot more i'm not an expert by any means but a few details stood out to me as being inaccurate which makes me wonder what else might be wrong there's a reference to women looking through the slits of their hijabs but typically hijab refers to a head covering a niqab or something like that would have a slit there's also a place where they eat jiaozi pancakes which i'm pretty sure does not exist overall i'm glad i had the opportunity to read this unique and interesting book the plot and setting kept me engaged and i only wish the conclusion could have done justice to the rest","134":"i really hate to give this two stars i was excited to read it i wanted to like it to love it but it just didn't click for me if i could i'd give it 2 5 stars or 2 75 but i can't quite go for 3 just didn't pull me in like i'd hoped it would","135":"this book was pretty disappointing","136":"this was a good read it's another book with two different story lines going one in the present and one in the past and by the end you'll find out the connection between the two the characters were well developed and there were some surprising developments that i didn't see coming","137":"in 1923 two sisters travel with a missionary to asia in london present day a young girl uncovers a story of her mother this was a clever well done story line and was interesting historically as well as shocking at times highly reccommend","138":"the lady cyclist's guide tells two stories one set in the 1920's and a parallel modern day story this book was a bit of a slow starter for me perhaps because of the two storylines once i could see the connections however i was eager to see where the road would take me i thought that the characters were quite vividly portrayed and i felt like perhaps i knew them but i found myself feeling in the end somewhat sad about the choices some had made yet hopeful for the main characters those who like historical fiction might find it a worthwhile read","139":"i was a bit disappointed in this book the story moved very slowly and seemed fragmented with no real conclusion","140":"a heart warming story split into 2 different time periods liked the plot and impressed with the novel","141":"interesting story that travels back and forth between the present time and early 20th century","142":"interesting read but a bit unbelievable","143":"i wasn't sure i was going to like this often when the writing is described as beautiful it gets so flowery and over descriptive that i get lost while the writing was very flowery and descriptive at times it didn't take away from the story lines for me i found that i liked both the old and the modern story and stayed interested in trying to figure out how they connected there were some weird parts in there i didn't get tayab's skin condition as being a big deal though it was referenced an awful lot for example but i thought both story lines were interesting","144":"an interesting weave of characters both past and present with enough details to provide the reader with imagery of vast desert all the way to facial expressions historical information makes for a lovely contrast to present day while the story itself is fascinating i'd be interested in knowing what other readers thought the owl represented in terms of literary significance would make for a good book club discussion","145":"this book left me very torn parts of it i was quite taken with and couldn't put down but as a whole i felt quite removed from this book aside from frieda the characters were not developed in a way that made me like them it was in the end a little anti climactic and even made me feel depressed","146":"this is a story of journeys of not belonging of feeling like an outsider yet still reaching for a connection of reaching across borders to find a more personal bond it is sad heart breaking at times yet ultimately hopeful because the women separated by decades learn to accommodate themselves and do the unexpected i liked it very much the writing was elegant and thoughtful it reminded me of books by some favorites margot livesey penelope lively even a s byatt too bad the cover screams chick lit for this is decidingly not chick lit glad to have picked it up at vromans","147":"i judged this book by its cover and expected to like it the cover is beautiful unfortunately this was a dual narrative that just didn't grab my interest especially the part set in the past i think this book would have been better served to be one straightforward story that stayed focused on the present day storyline i think i would have enjoyed that more and it would have given the author a chance to flesh out the characters more i found myself skimming much of the 1920s story the two do of course end up being connected but not in a way that wasparticularly surprising if i could i'd have given it 2 5 stars because it wasn't the worst book just disappointing","148":"i won a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar from goodreads the settings are a hundred years apart first story is about women travelling in 1923 in china with sister to establish a mission another story in present day london is about unexpected friendship between young women and emigrant eva's journey was really interesting from the beginning to an end well written with interesting descriptions settings and characters telling a lot about exotic kashgar eva's journey is connected to frieda's an unlikely friendship between frieda and tayeb is too predictable the book is quite good but it's not great unafortunately i don't think that i would buy it","149":"i am not sure why i liked this so much not much happens two young women one in present day and one in 1923 are each searching for what they want their life to be in 1923 eva goes purportedly as a missionary to muslim far western china in reality she wants freedom and adventure in the present day frieda is also looking for freedom travel and an affiar with a married man have not provided it it is soon quite evident what connects eva and frieda but this is not a mystery so that is not a problem bikes and birds both provide images of freedom and there are certain links of imagery and situation between the two times the book does not in any way answer all questions and i would have liked more explanation about what came between eva and irene and irene and her own daughter also what exactly the relationship was between eva and francis but this is really part of the charm of the book that all is not cleanly answered","150":"a wanna be a s byatt while the concept was interesting joinson did not make the story as compelling as it could have been","151":"in all fairness i didn't finish the book didn't hold my attention and couldn't see where it was going even 1 3 of the way through","152":"i was loving this book and would have given it 4 1 2 stars all the way up until the end the story followed two women during two different time periods evangeline in the 1920's and freida in present day there was also a story arc on tayeb and that wove in seamlessly with freida's story i spent the first 3 4 of the novel trying to figure out how the two main stories would intersect and loved that the first 3 4 of the novel had great details and imagery evangeline is a missionary in the early 1920's and had traveled to kashgar with her sister elizabeth and another missionary woman millicent eva as she's often called was not there so much for the missionary work rather was there to keep watch over her sister even though this story arc is only from eva's point of view i really got a sense of each of the characters the bad and the good and in millicent's case the bad and the not so awful freida's story is slightly less developed but equally as interesting she's a foreign correspondent in present day london who can't seem to stay in one place she's involved with a man she shouldn't be involved with and has no idea what to do next when she comes back from somewhere in the middle east she has a letter saying that an irene guy has passed away and she is listed as the next of kin and needs to empty out her apartment she has no idea who this woman is or how they are related she calls her father who is equally stumped she decides that she must contact her mother who she hasn't seen since she was a child and is now living on a commune enter tayeb he is an illegal immigrant from yemen who cannot go home again he gets caught up in something unpleasant and then is on the run so he is not deported this is when his path intersects with freida's the story between freida and tayeb is interesting together they set out to figure out freida's relation if there even is one to irene unfortunately the book lost me at the end i don't even know that it was the last 1 4 of the book but rather the last two chapters that disappointed me the end felt rushed almost like the author couldn't exceed a certain page number maybe it's supposed to be left rather vague but i wanted more details there was a lot that was glossed over and a few questions left unanswered once i found out who irene was i wanted to know more about her i felt her character was essentially missing from the book i am so disappointed in the ending because i really did like this novel suzanne joinson did a lot of research on early missionary work and that fact is evident i just wanted more","153":"a great read love stories that cover time and continents","154":"i really really liked this book i have read some reviews on goodreads that slam one part or the other but i liked the whole thing it was kind of a mystery in the sense that there were hanging clues in each chapter that led forward or backward these clues served to enlighten the reader about each character's story there are two parts the present and the past the present is in england and past in a middle eastern place called kashgar i looked kashgar up on wikipedia and there is such a place but i don't know if joinson set this middle eastern biking guide in a real place there are three girl characters in the middle eastern chapters eva lizzie and millicent eva is the one with the bike and has lied about committing to christian missionary work so that she can get out of england and write a book on biking can you imagine riding a bike in the sand her sister lizzie is a photographer unwell with bad eyesight and under the spell of the older millicent who is a rabid christian missionary and a drinker the three witness a birth in the beginning chapter of the book and are duty bound to care for the child whose pubescent mother dies in the sand before their eyes then there is freida who is the present day english character frieda travels in her work and has an obnoxious boyfriend frieda inherits the contents of an apartment bequeated to her by a woman named irene guy frieda has no idea who this person is but luckily a homeless middle eastern man has bedded down outside her doorway one night and he agrees to help her sort through the stuff she has inherited and honestly it is a good book the desert scenes with blowing red awful hot sand are terrific i got a real sense of how miserable life in a desert can be there are massive complications and loop di loops in this story but it really works i loved the references to richard burton the 1000 and one nights scholar and the array of other characters that populate the tale i would reccomend it","155":"this book is not at all what it appears to be on the cover evangeline english accompanies her sister lizzie and an older woman missionary to the silk road city kashgar in 1923 during the journey they deliver a baby whose young mother dies the local people accuse them of killing the mother of being witches etc they are forced to stay in kashgar under house arrest eva chronicles these events in present time frieda is surprised to find out that she is the heir to an elderly woman as she clears out the woman's apartment she searches for clues to the woman's connection with her melancholy but lyrical and compelling","156":"3 1 2 stars interesting book i liked how the author went back and forth between the eras i must admit i found the past story line much more compelling than the present storyline i was not as interested in frieda and her dilemmas and they pale in comparison to those of the ladies in the past the descriptions in this book are wonderful i could really feel the tension and the effects of the desert i can recommend the book","157":"i love novels that give you a feel for places and people you might not ever encounter in real life this one does that beautifully while comparing today's mores and those of 1923","158":"i found it intersting and it took me out of my narrow usa based world","159":"thought this would be cute clever witty but it was just boring","160":"adult book with incredibly rich imagery that brought the book to life for me i could feel myself getting anxious when she described the sand storms and their ability to get into every crevice and the inability to in any way remove yourself from its fierceness equally as fierce was my anxiety about the plight of tayeb a moslem in modern day london whose story she artfully weaves with history and moving geography beautifully done","161":"this book consists of two seemingly unrelated narratives and the connection between them isn't clear until the end both stories are riveting and so sometimes it's hard to turn from one to the other one is the story of three women missionaries traveling in china in the 1920s the other is set in modern day london and concerns a young woman who befriends a homeless arab man both narratives deal with belonging and alienation and with the feeling of being lost there's a tentative quality both in the characters' lives and the ways in which the stories are told which is in stark contrast to the sharply drawn landscapes the writing is textured nuanced with characters that only gradually become known and understood","162":"oh the writing i swooned on every page truly why not a 5 it's not sticking with me somehow the deeper emotional resonance wasn't reached but so worth reading","163":"this week i read a lady cyclists's guide to kashgar by suzanne joinson this is joinson's first novel and i will definitely read more of her books in the future the book contains two stories that are about 100 years apart first there is evangeline a young lady who accompanies her sister elizabeth on a mission trip to kashgar in western china during the 1920s kashgar is one of the most remote cities in the world so i thought the premise of a lady actually selling the idea for a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar to a publisher as highly unlikely evangeline fools the mission board that she wants to travel to china as a missionary but really she is only out to have an adventure with her sister while writing the guidebook elizabeth and evangeline's mission leader to is millicent a middle aged missionary who is manipulative and twisted i truly hated this character and i found her a bit far fetched i wish joinson had balanced this hateful character with a stronger missionary who was committed to serving the china inland mission and god because when i think of chinese missionaries i immediately think of one of my heroes lottie moon when the ladies first arrive a young girl is giving birth right outside the gates of kashgar millicent helps the girl deliver and hands the baby to evangeline the mother dies and the three ladies are soon put under house arrest for murder they are placed in a hotel run by a mohammed and his family and soon cultures and religions clash in present day london frieda peeks out her door and finds a middle eastern man sitting in the hallway outside her apartment she gives him a blanket and pillow and the next morning she finds lovely feathers and arabic words that have been drawn on the hallway wall tayeb the artist befriends frieda and helps her solve a mystery an elderly aunt unknown to frieda has left her belongings to frieda while clearing out the aunt's home frieda discovers a journal and a copy of a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar both stories eventually come together as the identity of the mysterious aunt is revealed as much as i hated millicent i think i preferred the story in the past because i was unsatisfied with frieda and tayeb's ending i thought it was too ambiguous and i would have appreciated more closure i must say that my timing in reading this book couldn't have been better based on what has been happening in the arab world this week eastern and western philosophies religions and culture clash in this novel in both evangeline and frieda's worlds","164":"i really enjoyed reading this book which juggles two suspenseful stories one of three women missionaries who dare to travel to kashgar in 1923 and the other set in present day london the relationship between the two stories is one of the interesting mysteries revealed in the book it's well written and the plotting is top notch","165":"loved this book beautifully written and fascinating part of the world starts out slow but quickly builds i didn't want it to end","166":"i had such high expectations for this one what a disappointment when i got to the part when the freida found the owl and was wondering how to feed it and the story still wasn't going anywhere i gave up","167":"well i tried a little more than halfway into this i realized that i wasn't enjoying it i didn't care about any of the characters and i was much better off completely forgetting about this book so i took the bookmark out and dropped the book off for collection and delivery to the nearest secondhand bookstore and went to read something infinitely more interesting more well written and better the book starts out with a gory disturbing scene of an eleven year old girl giving birth there's a lot of blood and flesh and superfluous and revolting detail the likes of which makes my skin crawl and my stomach feel oddly unsettled i should have known then that i wasn't going to like this book and ten or twelve chapters later i still wasn't liking it i don't like frieda she's weird and dull and unpleasant i don't like tayeb he's gritty and unfriendly and strange and i loathe the characters of 1923 actually they seem a lot more like victorian women less 1923 more 1889 eva wet rag no spunk dull as dishwater lizzie selfish boring obnoxious underwritten millicent well i know we're not supposed to like her but she's so unpleasant that i really have no inclination to read about her she's not the kind of unpleasant character who's fun to read about she's the kind of unpleasant who makes your teeth hurt and your fingernails itch i also don't believe in the recent trend of pushing homosexuality on repressed people for no good reason admittedly i didn't finish the book but as far as i know the millicent lizzie relationship had no bearing on much of anything and in modern writers' attempts to make gay characters more accessible which should be an excellent idea they're actually making homosexuality even more of an oddity but that's a very different argument and i'm not going to go into it here this book had no spark i was two hundred pages in and i didn't care i didn't care whether every single character died in a sandstorm because it made london seem cheap and vile and kashgar uncivilized and evil i didn't finish the book i don't care i didn't finish normally i have leftover guilt but not here this just sucked","168":"this was an amazing read hence the 5 stars having visited kashgar as part of a tour of the silk road i could picture the scenes to some extent as well as the distances from other towns and from europe i suppose it ticked all my boxes religion travel islam modern britain pilgrimage identity and so on it is also a first novel from a british woman writer and i like what the author has written about the writing process sara maitland was her mentor and she has clearly gained a lot from this support i shall look out for the next book","169":"very interesting book am looking forward to her next publication","170":"'the art of wheeling a bicycle steering is a subject for serious consideration a sharp eye quick determination constant care and a steady hand are needed ' what a lovely book easily taking me with them both frieda and eva's tales resonated within me the urge to travel and see the world recognizing it is not the fairy tale place you thought it was the rootlessness and the feeling of being adrift even though you are anchored down i liked the vast expanse and the stillness the author achieved in just moments and words to prevent some disappointment this is not a travel guide this book is more about internal than external travels but if you are familiar with the region the author's words will give you just enough to see the colours smell the scents and breathe the dust","171":"this book is more about finding balance in one's life than it is about bicycling silly me i thought it would be a travelogue","172":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is suzanne joinson's first novel and joinson shows great skill in weaving two women's stories together to create a novel about family and belonging joinson's depiction of each woman's desires and the lengths they go to in building the lives they want is deft creating fascinating well rounded characters read full review here http newtownreviewofbooks com 2012","173":"it's hard to even follow this story on audio the reader is so awful she ends nearly every line on an up note like a very posh valley girl it's like listening to the recitation of an epic poem the writing is fine but the story is there a story we have missionaries in lenin's day getting help from moscow then a modern day character has to recall walking in on her mother receiving oral sex from a man who of course is not the mother's husband give me a break like two books arbitrarily mistakenly published together threw it back without finishing it","174":"i usually live books with this type of premis past story linked somehow to present day i felt like i should have liked this one but even halfway through i still didn't connect with any of the characters i actually felt like saying get on with it already i thought the writing was okay but the characters were never developed enough for me to care about them sorry i know this is a popular book but t didn't work for me","175":"haunting story beautifully written transporting me to another place another time about half way through i felt i was right there with the characters past and present more more more","176":"most interesting window into the world of english missionaries early 19th cen women traveling in foreign lands and relationships between them","177":"this book was amazing it was gripping and intense","178":"i liked both stories separately but together they didn't tie in well together i felt that both stories feel short at the end and there really was no ending","179":"what a long strange trip it was the setting was mesmerizing and the portrayal of that slice of time and place kashgar was eye opening and quite well done the characters were all so real it was hard to like or trust them even as i rooted for some others just really creeped me out all were easy to connect to except the main character she seemed at a slight remove more often than i would've liked maybe that tone was intentional since she was supposed to be taking notes on her experience i loved the cyclist's guidelines and how they related to each chapter's themes u0026amp events cleverly done and of course i always love a book with 2 timelines or a sense of time travel the modern day story line was intriguing once the odd and quite disparate details at the start began to come together the graffiti artist's talents and contributions to the plot were a unique and well written bonus to what was already a cool passage through time story this was a very cool way to reveal family history in bright stark episodes wrapped in a gauzy or cloud like state of emotional tension","180":"a delightful and different read two stories intertwine one set in the present one in 1923 one in the uk one in kashgar the puzzle is what is the connection between the characters and events in each time period along the way as the answer is revealed one can draw parallels between the lives of the people in both stories their characters their experiences their desires and ambitions etc i enjoyed the novel as a story and found the characters convincing multi dimentional and all too falible the people are also engaging and you really care what happens this book is one i shall probably read again i've enjoyed the story and the style i need to reread it to explore some of the imagary and the symbolism i hope i'm not reading too much into this but there are so many layers i still haven't quite got my head around the owl","181":"enjoyed the weaving together of two stories one in the past and one contemporary of two women travelers think the author captured the loneliness physical and mental disorientation of traveling especially to places far removed from our daily lives","182":"wasn't sure what to think of this book at first but as the 2 story lines wove together i can see themes that made me think about relationships parental love living","183":"i'm not really sure how to categorize this story it had elements of a romance but it's not the sort of neat ending one expects from that genre nor is there any steamy sex there are mysteries as well but of a quiet personal sort i think maybe that's the best way to describe it a quiet personal story about people experiencing life and looking for home","184":"interesting and worth the read much better in terms of plot and writing than the cover and title would suggest","185":"not what i expected but well written and definitely interesting","186":"loved this book it took me away to another time and place and then brought me back again wonderful","187":"didn't finish could barely get through the first hundred pages didn't like the characters didn't like the time switches ugh","188":"this book transported me to turkey just before world war i the book features two sisters who embark on a trip to the middle east to become missionaries the story takes a turn when they come upon a mother who is giving birth to a baby in the desert the mother has been stabbed and it is up to eva to save the baby what happens in the rest of the story is an adventure that surrounds the writing of a cycling guide that eva the main character is writing i thought that this book was well written and the plot was interesting to me the plot switches back and forth from turkey to modern day london there is another story within this story that is just as fascinating the story encompasses love mothers relationships and what it means to love a child i could not put it down","189":"this book was not what the lovely cover led me to believe there really wasn't much cycling at all the bike seemed to be the promise to freedom that the main character eva was seeking though she never was able to follow through with her dreams and goals like eva i just wanted more the whole book left me wanting more detail more explanation much more description the dual timeline only worked towards the end of the story as the characters brought relevance to each other so good read for the feminine perspective and the uniqueness of place but not so good for taking a satisfying bite of book","190":"it is the 1920s and evangeline english her sister lizzie and their missionary leader millicent have travelled to turkestan with plans of converting the local muslim population to christianity however evangeline has no real interest or intention in establishing a mission or in converting the heathens rather evangeline has secret plans to write a travel guide based on what she sees and experiences in kashgar it is also present day london and frieda is a modern world professional stuck in an unproductive relationship with a selfish married man and tayeb is an illegal from yemen who finds himself homeless and sleeping in the corridor outside frieda's apartment the two form an unlikely friendship and together they go about investigating the origins of a mysterious inheritance of which frieda has found herself unwillingly in possession a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is split between two periods 1920s turkestan and modern london and is ultimately three stories in one evangeline frieda and tayeb having said that however it was evangeline's story that is the basis for the novel as a whole and the one that i personally found the most interesting the manner in which the novel is written with each individual component consistently interrupting the others made it feel disjointed and the characters distant it is assumed that the three central characters must be connected in some way but this only starts to become clear after two thirds of the novel has been read there are also too many random insignificant ramblings where the story veers off on tangents more often than not right in the middle of a really interesting piece i found this frustrating overall i found evangeline's story to be the most interesting of the three the events surrounding her time in kashgar are the reason i kept reading until the end and i would have been perfectly content had this novel been her story alone","191":"interesting story of two independent women in different periods of history both are interested in muslim cultures the single missionary in the 1920's who finds herself q single parent to a baby orphan girl turns out to have a connection to the modern single girl who finds herself inheriting the possessions of a woman she didn't know both stories are interesting i particularly enjoyed the historical aspects of eva's story about life in a muslim society and her escape with ai lein to russia and eventually back to england and her unconventional life there","192":"when i started this book i wasnt sure i was going to like it as much as i did but i was fasinated by the how the stories entwined probably wouldnt have been the sort of book i would have ordinarily picked but i would read more from this writer","193":"another book i was so looking forward to reading and which disappointed i must confess i only got to page 97 and then i gave up i just never got to the point where i thought any of it mattered any book that takes me 5 days to get to page 97 is not a good book unless something else is occupying a great deal of my time","194":"author suzanne joinson pub date june 4 n title a lady cyclist's guide to kashgardescription eva and her sister are new missionaries to kashgar supervised by the nearly fanatical millicent their very first act gets them put under house arrest and awaiting trial on murder charges meanwhile millicent's not so subtle methods seem to be stirring up animosity among the natives running parallel to this story is the modern day story of frieda and her new friend tayeb an illegal immigrant frieda inherits the contents of a flat belonging to someone she has never heard of and has a week to dispose of them before the housing authority comes in to clear things out review source arc from netgalleyplot both plots the historical and the contemporary kept my interest eva is writing the lady cyclist's guide to kashgar she has brought her bicycle with her on the missionary trip along with her pointers on cycling she uses her notebook as a diary to record the events taking place in this country where they are nearly the only foreigners characters both of the main female characters frieda and eva are well drawn and likeable the supporting characters are also interesting and believable writing style it can be tricky to write parallel stories the author has to make each story interesting in its own right and they have to move at about the same pace from the beginning i was more interested in the historical portion of the novel probably because it was so alien to my own experience aside from this bit of unevenness though i enjoyed the writing style audience i'd place this novel squarely between chick lit and literary fiction i think both groups of readers would enjoy it it would make a good book group read as well wrap up the book's running theme of religious belief and what it means to the individual as well as to the community was very well done and thought provoking i did find the ending to be not as strong as the rest of the book though 3 5 5","195":"i enjoyed this novel courtesy of the publisher via netgalley thanks this novel alternates between two times and places 1920's kashgar in central asia and current day london it's not til about half way through the book that the reader begins to figure out how the two stories relate during the first half of the book i was impatient with the dual storyline because i found the historical part of the novel much more compelling it is supposedly from the notes evangeline english took during her travels as a missionary she plans to write a book about cycling through the region but as the book begins she and her companions come across a dying young woman they help her give birth and then end up caring for her baby joinson paints a vivid picture of a region i knew little about i found myself heading to the web to learn more about the geopolitical issues of the region after i finished the book but that might just be me the modern part of the book concerns a young woman named frieda who is a bit burned out from constantly traveling the world with some ngo she learns about a relative she didn't know she had and befriends an undocumented immigrant named tayeb as the story progesses we learn about frieda's very unconventional childhood and gradually the two stories come together one thing i liked about this novel was that it was more subtle than other books that take place in foreign lands in times of trouble although some bad things do happen it's not one awful event after another i felt like i could get to know the characters without wincing and worrying about war crimes to come i definitely recommend it","196":"this looked and sounded like it could be a really great book but there are just too many things that are ruining it for me so i've decided to quit maybe if it were a little less of some things and a little more like say major pettigrew or something i could read it","197":"i decided to read this book after seeing the cover and liking the time period mentioned in the summary of the book i had no idea really that i would enjoy it so much great storytelling told in a unique way with two threads of a story running parrallel and occasioanally interweaving this novel does not disappont naturally being the curious reader i am i immediately looked up kashgar on the internet after reading the first chapter kashgar accoeding to the almighty wikipedia is a city located in china but near the border and close to tajikistan it has always been a place of great civil unrest and during the time setting of this novel early 1900's was a dangerous place muslims there worship in the largest mosque in all of china obviously not a place welcoming to westerners eva english is very much a westerner she and her sister elizabeth are missionaries being led through the hazardous eastern deserts by millicent their leader in the order of the steadfast pace on horseback with eva on her bicycle of course eva is not as true to the cause of being a missionary as her devoted sister actally seems to be but eva is taking advantage of the adventure to write a guide boks for woman riding on bike through the region although her companions do not know this a terrible event occurs and when the women stop and try to help they become captives of the governing forces of kashgar held after trying to aid a very young woman who gives birth to a child on the side of the road and dies tragically the women take the child and are brought to the city where they are guests held until a trial can be arranged they are free to wander about the city at first and millicent reaches out to a priest another missionary but a very odd person indeed flash forward to the present day london england we meet frieda a young woman frustrated with her ongoing affair with a slightly older married man and tired from her diplomatic travles and globe trotting nathaniel has children and a business and is selfish with her frieda has complicated relationships with her parents in her first days home two odd things happen she meets an illegal immigrant from yemen who takes refuge on her doorstep and she finds she has been left the property of an older deceased lady who she does not know so these two storylines continue this way eva's life is frightening and complicated she is now taking care of a child an infant and this job is all consuming lizzie is somehow charmed by millicent and her constant demands and eva discovers many secrets about her sister whom she feels she must protect in this strange land millicent controls her eva eventually learns many secrets frieda also discovers things about her life she had no idea about the two stories weave in and out intermingling in so many complex ways i was amazed at the incredible storytelling in this novel the timeliness of it was striking without giving too much away of course eva and frieda have a connection frieda learns a lot about herself in a short period of time while eva's journey is longer and more convoluted but still rewarding i can't recommend this wonderful novel enoough i was really struck by the genius of the stroies and their interlocking parts fitting together as the novel prgressed like a chinese box mysterious and beautiful this is a well crafted and well written novel","198":"a wonderful debut novel by a young writing quickly mastering her craft this book champions her skills and i hope it reaches a large audience through a surprise inheritance two different stories converge together with common themes of religious zeal motherhood and infidelity often told with wit aided by a rich texture of research suzanne joinson demonstrates the art of story telling without trying to moralise or use too many words there is the sense of danger as we travel with eva and by contrast the lack of direction frieda even in trying to find out what she wants from life complex characters abound in this book there is a complete lack of stereotype and cliche the novel gently throbs with companionship and a sense of time and place there is no compulsion to rush to the end the beauty and magic is in the story that unfolds in a relaxed pace slowly bringing the central players to a common place a shared belonging this is interesting in itself but the most lasting themes are the strength and resilience to overcome the desire to understand yourself in terms of place family and blood the need to belong and the power of writing imagery history can be as dry as bones but in this author's hands it lives and has a real place in all our stories today this novel transports you to far away lands educates you in former times and sweeps you along in imagery and its choice of words it is a book worth reading and re reading for it not only entertains but it leaves a big smile on your face if i hadn't felt obliged to review this book having received an advance copy i would have missed this fine book altogether and my life would be poorer for that","199":"a confusing book to start with it took me a few chapters to settle into the parallel stories but it progressed into a beautiful lyric tale filled with twists and surprises the parallel stories twine together for a tale of selflessness family relationships and cross cultural interactions in two very different lives a lovely book a definite keeper","200":"i would like to give this book a 3 5 it has an exotic setting and parallel stories set in 1923 and present day which of course link up at the end it touches on a number of issues and gives lots of detail about what is was like for a caucasian woman in post wwi central asia i enjoyed it very much but i suspect i didn't care enough about the characters to give it a 4","201":"the cover blurb of this novel grabbed my attention which is why i picked it up my favorite aspects about this book were the plot the characters and the pacing of the storytelling i enjoy novels with multiple story lines that all tie together at the end granted i sort of figured out how the stories tied together well before the end of the book but it was still enjoyable joinson has a solidly paced writing style if i hadn't been trying to read four other books at the same time i would have finished this one in a matter of days instead of two months i feel like i really got to know the characters in this novel but didn't have the same sense about the setting it was hard for me to picture the different environments in which the novel was set i think though that was due to the fact i read this book in very short chunks of time this sometimes meant i lost track of the setting's descriptions in the end i came away wanting to know what frieda will do with the discoveries she made about herself and her family and also with a hope that frieda and tayeb will have a future together i feel like joinson wrapped up the story well and would be somewhat disappointed if there was a sequel in the case of this book i like that i will have to use my imagination to determine what happens next","202":"this was a difficult one for me i liked parts of it and i was bored with others and just wanted it to be over i love strong female characters in unusual life experiences and found both eva and frieda well written although somewhat scattered a bit of mystery intrigue and darkness not expected added to but did not save this one for me would neither recommend nor not recommend","203":"i loved that from simply perusing the cover you'd think it was a tame little period romance about girl missionaries i never would have read it were it not on my book club list but wow it turns out to be juicy and complex inside don't judge a book by its cover this book is neither about bicycles nor being a missionary thank goodness","204":"i liked most of this book but i did not like millicent and her reckless behavior people say religion leads you down the righteous path but sometimes it just leads you down a really odd path especially if you do not use common sense even though millicent made a lot of bad choices and endangered lizzie and eva i still was not happy about her fate i really would have liked this book better if it had not been for what happened to lizzie and millicent i really enjoyed frieda meeting tayeb and i wanted to know more about what happened with them at the end","205":"i won this book though a giveaway on goodreads i was happy i won it because i really really enjoyed reading it and the story was really good and it was quite a fast pace read to i also really liked the cover of the book to great book","206":"meh interesting idea that was not well executed","207":"the double story of evangeline english missionary to kashgar in 1923 and frieda blakeman present day researcher on the interface between islam and the west is intertwined with a yemeni refugee and a mysterious inheritance breaking with one's culture in the struggle to survive and love is the uniting theme of this intriguing page turner","208":"i heard much good about this book so anticipated an enjoyable story which i got but i was very frustrated with the frieda character who imho really didn't add much value to the narrative in fact she broke up a perfectly good story honestly think it would have gotten an additional star had she not been included","209":"good concept but completely disjointed story","210":"i looked forward to this book since it took place in an exotic area i was disappointed almost from the start it didn't grab me after the first several chapters to continue to read anymore i just sort of skipped pages to get to the end i won't be reading any more of her books","211":"this book had a lot of elements going for it 1920s setting the silk road and bicycles which is why i picked it up what a mistake as other reviewers have noted there was little to no cycling going on in this book aside from that my main beef with this book is that it tried too hard to be literary and wasn't very good at it the author kept using literary devices that made absolutely no sense which in my mind makes them completely useless for example she described the main character holding a baby that felt like a cat that wanted to die personally i have never held a cat that wanted to die so as a reader i have no earthly clue what the author is trying to express here later she describes the other main character sitting in a bar and her words sliding down the barstool and pooling on the floor no clue what that means either i've read other books that have made up for annoying literary pretensions with an intriguing plot and enjoyable characters but sadly this book had neither of those in the end this book was just a big disappointment","212":"i really enjoyed this book two women entwined by a shared history and parallel experiences though different and separated by a generation sympathetically told intriguing frustrating and just slightly challenging the arrogance bravery and questionable motives of the three exploring missionary women and bicycle set against a another contemporary travelling women provides comparison common territory and repeated themes through generations i really enjoyed it as a perfect holiday read","213":"quite an undertaking for a first novel so many subjects to discuss i felt duty bound to finish but could not recommend","214":"knowledge sleeps dormant in the bones until an opportinity comes for it to flourish again 208 this story is exotic and some what engaging but i can not recommend there seemed to be many missing links and i did not care for ending","215":"great start and strong going but did not manage to finish that well i did enjoy the whole historical context of kashgar in 1900's though with all three powers turks russians and chinese vying for power the parallel story in present england is somewhat interesting as well but not as captivating as the details of kashgar culture","216":"two parallel stories take place one set in the 1920s in kashgar on the silk road where 2 sisters are on a supposed religious mission and the other in present day england where a young woman frieda learns she has inherited the estate of a woman whom she seemingly does not know the stories do not collide until near the end of the book the plot is interesting the language beautiful and descriptive and the descriptions of customs food locations etc very well written a worthwhile book though not a page turner","217":"the history was interesting but didn't much care about the characters","218":"i give up i tried and wanted to finish it but this book was slow and did not hold my interest i don't mind books that bounce between time periods and have two in one stories but this one was not for me","219":"weaving a historical novel together with a contemporary one is no easy task though it's characteristic of many of my favourite novels joinson does it admirably drawing both thematic and structural links between the two stories that are strong enough to make the novel feel whole and gentle enough to keep the interconnections from feeling forced if you liked this book you must read the map of love http www goodreads com book show 89 to which it bears many similarities overall i liked the map of love better but then again i read it when i was younger and a little easier to please","220":"i was somewhat disappointed with the way the 2 story lines played out in the first place i was expecting more of a travel adventure type of story and that was not the case in fact i was even questioning why the author used that particular title for the tale that was written secondly i struggled a bit with making the connection with the main characters one from the 1920's the other present day it was interesting enough to finish but i probably wouldn't recommend it for a good read","221":"kindle i really enjoyed this story which was a mix of 2 stories which have a connection one takes place in the 1920's 3 women 2 of them sisters on a mission trip in the middle east forced to stay in kashgar the other is present time england and the life of a young woman named freida","222":"i was pretty uncertain of this one the audio's narrator seemed to have odd intonations but i grew to really appreciate her and the book very much the story is quite engaging in both parallel narratives for very different reasons and the writing is just excellent","223":"good literature for structure however the description of exotic travelling is over romantic the immigrant's derogatory comments about western culture and western women are disfunctional hence the desire to put the book down before the end","224":"currently reading this book i am enjoying immensely two stories one set in early 20th century the other is current day london one set in kashmir i know i had not heard of it fascinating insight into the muslim arab world from a missionary ladies point of view beautifully written very original and gripping","225":"miss evangeline eva english is an avid lady cyclist travelling abroad with her sister lizzie and a militant missionary named millicent in 1923 and this is no leisurely tour of europe suitable for unmarried ladies - millicent has seduced lizzie into religious fervour and they are to set up a christian mission in kashgar in far western china when they arrive in the ancient silk route city they are diverted by finding a child in the desert little more than 10 or 11 and she is about to give birth millicent matter of factly delivers the child using forceps a baby girl but the strains of childbirth were too much for the young mother and they are unable to save her when a crowd of townfolk appear they accuse millicent of witchcraft and the three women are placed under a certain form of house arrest in the town to await trial millicent knows they will need money to extract themselves from the situation they find themselves in and she wires for assistance with funds to bribe the townspeople unlike eva she isn't too concerned about possibly being put to death and she sees it as an excellent opportunity to continue her missionary work focusing on the women kashgar is a mostly moslem population and eva is nervous about millicent's determined ways she has seen the way she has bewitched lizzie and the ways in which her sister has changed now lizzie seems to care for nothing but her leica camera and millicent and eva herself is given the baby of the deceased young girl to care for which soon keeps her busy as they await their fate in present day england frieda has just returned home from an exhausting trip to the middle east researching youth issues she finds a message saying that she is the next of kin to a woman named irene guy who is recently deceased as such she is welcome to come and clear out ms guy's flat and do what she will with her belongings within a certain amount of time or social services will come in and clean out everything frieda is confused - she's never heard of irene guy and she's sure there's some mistake nevertheless she goes to the flat and what she discovers there will draw her into a friendship with tayeb an illegal yemeni refugee who she found sleeping in her stairwell the previous night together they investigate the mystery of irene guy and just who she was to frieda and through irene guy frieda will get to read the fascinating diary of a young woman travelling through north western china on a bicycle in 1923...i often find writing reviews of books i really enjoyed more difficult than writing ones of books i did not it's hard to balance admiration and reason without straying into gushing territory at times but i fear i may be about to do just that with this book i absolutely loved a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar it's an eccentric but charming story featuring heartache and joy fear and anger eva is such an interesting character she's quite close mouthed about her motives for choosing to travel with lizzie and millicent to both her mother and also lizzie and millicent themselves she loves cycling has ever since she discovered the freedom it gave her and i think it excites her to be an adventurer to see these places that no other english women have seen with the aid of her cycle i also think she takes on the trip to look after lizzie who is mentally fragile and prone to illnesses lizzie is a dreamer walking around the town with a leica camera taking abstract photos she seems mostly unaware of the potential seriousness of their situation - if they can't come up with the means to bribe the town leaders out of their predicament they could very well be put to death millicent definitely and potentially eva as well and millicent is hardly helping matters by attempting to convert the women in the town eva tries to reason with her but finds millicent oddly unreasonable and compelling at the same time it's like eva forgets what she's going to say when millicent turns her full attention on her and she begins to see just how lizzie was persuaded to do this trip eva also finds herself caring for the baby that lost its mother - she doesn't know anything about children but it's a learning curve for her and she becomes incredibly attached to the child likewise i enjoyed the modern day story of frieda a young woman who had spent some months abroad studying the youth in middle eastern countries and has just returned to england and her flat she's alarmed to see a man sleeping outside her door in the stairwell but she gives him a blanket and pillow anyway and he helps her with something when he returns the next day to retrieve a pen he left behind i found frieda and tayeb extremely interesting and i actually could've read a whole full sized novel devoted to their story each time i left kashgar for present day england i felt a little wrenched out of the story and disoriented and then i would get quickly involved with frieda and tayeb and experience the same sort of wrenched feeling when it would be time to leave them and go back to kashgar a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is a fabulous blend of the historical far east and present day england i was utterly charmed by both of the stories woven into this book - a truly beautifully written debut suzanne joinson will be going on to my list of authors to watch","226":"another book with a dual narrative one historical fiction the other present day usually with this type of book i find the historical narrative to be much more interesting than the modern day story see sarah's key but in this case i found both to be equally compelling the lady cyclist of the title is evangeline eve who in 1923 travels to what is now the border of china tajikistan russia as part of a trio of missionaries with her sister lizzie and millicent their leader eve herself is not particularly religious but she wants to stay with her sister who is very zealous and also wants to explore and write the guide of the title we follow her story through her journal entries interwoven with the modern day story of frieda a jaded ngo world traveler who is temporarily home in london she crosses paths with tayeb an illegal yemeni immigrant and their unlikely friendship develops slowly and naturally as we gradually learn how the 2 stories are connected in both narratives the author's descriptive language is beautiful to read especially the passages from eve's diary describing the desert and its inhabitants things don't go well for their mission and the tension builds as you wonder whether she'll make it home alive a fascinating story whose two parts come together in a masterful way","227":"i really enjoyed this book although there was very little actual cycling a lot of the focus was around the personal relationships of the protaganist and her adopted baby so perhaps would appeal more to female readers","228":"only giving this one 2 stars because it was written well and the character of eva was a likeable one her diary with plans of publication of her time in kashgar 1923 was interesting descriptive as it put the reader right there amid the cultures divide but it very quickly got boring slowed the pace and i found myself begging for the end of the book to come it's book of 2 stories in 1 really goes back and forth to 1923 and then present day london i wasn't clear on the connection of the stories until much later and too late to care frankly loved the cover and was really disappointed because i feel this story concentrating on missions in a foreign land mired with trial and laws of the land had a lot of potential and fell so flat","229":"this book is not what i expected i did like it though it is 2 parallel stories one present day london area and one in 1923 in the celestial mountain area of asia both are about a young woman facing difficulties i knew the 2 stories had to be tied together somehow i had just about worked out the link when it was revealed in the story definitely not a happily ever after story but a hopeful one at least","230":"beautiful descriptions and imagery likeable women characters","231":"i didn't love it and i thought it would the cover and title made me think this would be more comic than it was but it opened with a rather ghastly birth scene and a veil of fear hung over the three women's lives in this remote outpost in terms of the contemporary side of the novel i wasn't won over by the narrator i kept reading to find out the mystery of the connection between the 19th and 21st century characters","232":"really enjoyed this book the title does not give a hint to personal tragedy the story contains really interesting setting and i enjoyed the parallal stories great characters and lots of research obviously went into this novel would make a great movie","233":"loved the combination of present and history and how the two stories wove themselves together the history was rich and visible in the author's words","234":"fascinating novel the story of two women nearly 100 years apart and their intertwining journeys of discovery growth and love haunting and beautiful not a light read but thoroughly absorbing","235":"three women become missionaries in kashgar in the 1920s the natives think they are too pushy and being foreigners are suspicious anyway eva keeps notes during her stay which are the basis for her guide to be published when the trip is over jump forward to present day england and freida finds these notes in an apartment she is cleaning out for a stranger who just died the two stories are tied together through an exciting plot of escape love and intrigue both main characters ride bikes that's about all that is important about the bicycle reference","236":"what a story beautifully read the language is like poetry this reader had just the right touch i loved the intertwining story lines and the wonderful description suzanne joinson brought these worlds into my living room i kept expecting to see drawings of birds on my wall i received this book as a galley from netgalley com i also received an audio edition from tantor media the book was so good that i read it both ways the reader of the tantor edition was superb for this book i did want to read the print copy as well because the language is so beautiful i just wanted to savor it i'll stop now and go for a bike ride","237":"this novel has two timeframes heroines frieda in present day london is a social researcher specialising in islamic countries but this work leaves her feeling ambivalent unexpectedly she is named as next of kin to an elderly women who has died a woman she has never heard of meanwhile a hundred years or so earlier eva and her sister lizzie embark along with the domineering missionary millicent on a trip to convert muslims in kashgar near tajikistan eva is commissioned to write a book about her experiences hence the 'lady's guide' the part of the novel set in kashgar is the strongest with wonderful descriptions of the physical and cultural environment after she unsuccessfully tries to save the life of a young girl giving birth to a child at the side of the road millicent is accused of the girl's murder while the authorities slowly get around to charging her they are all placed under house arrest eva volunteers to look after the baby of the dead girl and her growing love for the child provides something to cling on to when all else startes to fall apart the progressively tense and strange relationship between millicent and the two sisters is made even more precarious because of riots and an unstable political situation eva's subsequent desperate attempt to escape is thrillingly described by contrast frieda's relationship with illegal immigrant tayeb her piecing together of clues from the dead woman's belongings and her confrontation with her emotionally distant hippie mother is not as enthralling although joinson's writing is always interesting while there is a narrative device link between the two timeframes i was at a loss to work out the point i suppose the relationship between frieda and tayeb represents a positive reconciliation between the cultures compared to the gross cultural ignorance of the missionary approach of colonial times this hopeful note acts as antidote to the more ambiguous resolution of the historical strand","238":"a really gripping read highly recommend","239":"in interesting look at eras and how women's roles have grown and changed not all my questions were anwered but i did enjoy getting to know the interesting women in this story","240":"the second book i've read this winter in which the acquisition of an unknown dead person's estate plays into the story seems a bit odd so my big beef with this book is that i think it has the wrong title i understand why the author gave it this name but i anticipated an updated female version of ibn batuta not a interpersonal analysis of family relationships which happened to take place in remote central asia","241":"this was a fantastic and complex read the prose is beautifully written and this was a delight to read the description were sumptuous beautiful lavish and luxurious and i found myself instantly transported to kashgar this book switched between two time periods and various characters but for once i actually enjoyed the changes of perspective it really really worked and despite it usually being something that puts me off reading a book instead it drew me in further the pace is subtle and i didn't realise how very much the whole book had changed between the first page and the last suzanne joinson's writing is simply amazing you journey with the characters feel as they feel i had a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach as i finished this book as i am sure evangeline did at the end of her journey what happens between the pages is haunting and shocking yet somehow delicate and quite lovely this is definitely one of those books which leaves you with a what next feeling what happens now where do the characters go from here where to i go from here i received a copy of this for free via goodreads first reads","242":"there are two stories one in the present day and one in the early 1920s neither of which particularly drew me in just when you are working up a bit of interest for one story it would switch to the other there is one afternoon's worth of bicycling as far as i can recall and i found it difficult to believe that anyone would pay a young woman who had previously written absolutely nothing to write a guidebook for ladies who want to ride bicycles in the desert in 1923 the book starts out with a promising scene and goes downhill from there not recommended","243":"it wasn't what i thought it would be about but i liked it very beautiful writing and imagery","244":"one hundred pages into this book and nothing has happened yet i don't like any of the characters and really don't care what happens to them bleh","245":"whilst i didn't find this book to be a huge page turner evidenced by how long it has taken me to finish it i loved the exotic imagery there is no doubt the author has a very beautiful way with words","246":"i received this book as part of a goodreads giveaway this is another in the growing trend of novels that blend a modern and historical storyline it can be an interesting concept contrasting and comparing our times and issues with those past in this case i spent the whole novel questioning what the link actually was having finished it i don't see how either frieda's story in modern london or eva's in 1920s kashgar actually complemented or added any weight to each other yes they are both bold independent women and in many ways eva is a reflection of our times rather than her own yes there was a tenuous link 'revealed' at the end but the two stories are essentially unrelated i wasn't quite sure whether the lady cyclist's guide to kashgar came into the story there was little to no cycling some random quotes that seemed to bear no relation to the following chapters and actually not much of a journey or development of character perhaps it was just a symbol of the pioneering independent spirited women in the story but it wasn't really developed as such i was disappointed that i didn't really learn much about kashgar one of the strengths from previous historical travel novels i've read in the past is that they totally immerse you in a different culture and setting evoking how people live in foreign lands this novel could have been set anywhere remote visited by missionaries at the turn of the century in fairness i felt this novel was quite well written with some beautiful descriptions and paragraphs and raised some interesting issues eva and her companions' lives as female missionaries in lands where they were not at all wanted is a fraught and dangerous one and each comes to her calling with very different agendas and motivations something i've always found fascinating and have previously studied tayeb was the most interesting character to me i wanted to know more about his life as an illegal immigrant and his background in yemen but the story was just touched on and not at all fleshed out this is true of many of the characters and plotlines in this novel lots of threads contained with a novel that wasn't really expansive enough to give them much justice","247":"4 5 starsa lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is a gem of a read what a surprisingly absorbing story that lured me in from the very first chapter when an eleven year old girl is giving birth on the side of the road on the route to kashgar in 1923 lizzie and eva are sisters travelling as missionaries with their leader millicent eva takes the opportunity to cycle as they travel with the hope of writing a guide to cycling in the middle east she loves to cycle the story also switches to modern day london frieda's life takes a different path when she arrives home from a work trip in the middle east to find she has inherited the possessions of a woman named irene guy frieda also befriends an immigrant from yemen who takes residence on her front doorstep and together they investigate the identity of irene and how their lives are connected back in 1923 eva lizzie and millicent are under house arrest in kashgar due to allegations that they killed the 11 year old girl the girl died during childbirth following the successful delivery of her baby by millicent eva becomes attached to the baby and becomes her primary carer as the locals are resistant to embracing a baby associated with death the themes around religion and cultural beliefs were really fascinating and in particular the reception of christianity into a muslim community was of interest many of the themes and the challenges faced by the characters were thought provoking and emotionally charging it's difficult to describe what exactly i loved about this book i do think the author skilfully creates subtleties in characters that foster intrigue and instead of dumping information on the reader there's space for the reader to make up their own mind about the characters and the issues raised highly recommended read","248":"i found this to be another less than successful split time narrative while there was some good writing and interesting bits of history i found the premise holding the 2 narratives together flimsy partway through the book i also became very bothered by what i perceived to be a pattern of villainous or menacing gay characters it started to feel like a conservative paranoid fantasy first in present day london tayeb's life is upended and he has to go on the run after he's threatened with deportation by 2 men who are angry because he won't have sex with them they find him making graffiti art in a public restroom and assume that he is a gay hustler then lizzie the narrator's sister in the kashgar storyline is drawn into a poisonous and ultimately fatal relationship with millicent the deranged lesbian missionary most of the disastrous events in that narrative occur because of millicent's actions finally evangeline begins to feel a romantic connection to another missionary mr steyning only to discover that he is in a relationship with mr greeves that realization coming in a nasty little scene in which mr greeves is described in terms like stealthy sneering and sarcastic","249":"i was so excited by the description of this book but it was slow moving and difficult to follow i listened to it on a long trip and hated the wishy washy reader i listen to books on long driving trips to help with keeping alert especially when driving the rv this did the opposite almost put me to sleep","250":"i can't remember the last time i read a book in one day this was such an enjoyable gripping read at first the shift between times and places felt a bit strained but soon the rhythm became natural the input of a good copy editor would have made the book just a modicum better but that hardly matters it's a good story nicely told","251":"jumping from present day to past days was not congruant in my mind so i stopped reading this story","252":"i enjoyed the dual timelines of this book eva in 1920's turkestan and frieda in modern day london and the carefully crafted intertwining strands of their stories however i found the endings of both stories left too many loose strands to be a really satisfying read","253":"absolutely brilliant don't be put off by the title it is such a good read","254":"i had trouble getting into this one maybe not in the right mood i will give it a try at another time","255":"the exoticism of the primary narrative thread three young female missionaries' attempt to convert muslims on the silk road in the early twentieth century is what pulled me through the book the secondary narrative thread that of a contemporary young british woman and the illegal yemeni immigrant she finds camped on her doorstep is also absorbing the mystery at the center of the novel who owns the apartment the contemporary characters are asked to clean out is what links the two threads and that also adds to the book's interest i agree with other readers that the book isn't long enough to develop these threads as well as they might have been but the author does a fairly good job with depicting characters and some of her writing is both insightful and beautiful not an entirely satisfactory read but unusual and interesting enough","256":"another good summer read but not without its flaws the author's device of two protagonists separated by time and set in very different parts of the world is effective but not subtle the best part of the book is the kashgar portions of the novel the author sketches the characters and the settings effectively my personal preference would have been for more depth all over but i concede that this lightness kept the story moving along the bad the england story was at times plodding and not purposeful the description of the meeting with the mother had a repulsive quality to it as if one was reading porn on the other hand a lot of reviewers have faulted the author for the random yemeni calligrapher whose presence does not add depth to the plot i personally found the sheer irrelevance of him very entertaining it saves the book from being a mawkish throwback to novels celebrating victorian explorers and missionaries","257":"lovely story very other like its topic in other words the plot is inventive and sometimes unexpected not fitting a particular genre neatly i did get frustrated at the beginning with the relentless moving back and forth from present to past with every alternating chapter thought of just reading every other chapter so the story would not be interrupted","258":"this book wasn't what i had expected which was good i very much enjoyed the start of the story but felt it lost pace further in the ending was as i suspected but also rather untidy this could have been a better book","259":"easy read good characters and good story line","260":"good story interesting characters and terrific descriptions of remote turkestan and the dangerous terrain bordering china on the ancient silk route alternates between eve u0026amp her bike an orphaned baby and a strange missionary in turkestan in 1923 and frieda in present day london inheriting the belongings of an unknown woman befriending a refugee from yemen she begins to unravel her story amazingly the author has actually travelled to these isolated regions","261":"interesting the books moves back and forth in time between the 1920s when two sisters go as missionaries to the silk road town of kashgar and present day london when a young english woman meets a man who has left his native yemen in the present day lizzie has inherited a flat and its contents from an unknown woman as the story bounces back and forth in time we discover the connection","262":"in 1923 eva liz and millicent set off to the exotic far east to be missionaries in kashgar millicent is a zealous domineering older woman liz eva's sister is a photographer who has decided she has a \"calling\" liz

guide to kashgar lets the reader travel to the exotic kashgar desert in a past time it is really a look at women's relationships and how the past can affect the present the story spanning the decades kept my interest throughout suzanne joinson did a very good job of entwining the stories of eva and frieda and of the past and the presenti received this book through the first reads program","263":"i thoroughly enjoy a good cultural piece and this is one culturally different through time and geography well worth reading i read the audio format and the narrator was excellent i also thoroughly enjoyed the 2 stories that intertwined through the reading experience","264":"i would probably give this book a 3 5 it took me a while to get into the story but i found the plot very interesting","265":"takes place in 2 worlds in 1923 eva as a missionary with her sister lizzie travels to kashgar on the silk road eva brings her bicycle they have some interesting adventures in present day london frieda inherits the contents of a house but she doesn't know the owner","266":"excellent book","267":"this book with it's dual tales in two different time periods built up page by page the characters in both plots are believable i cared about both of the female leads many underlying themes including development of self women's role in society religion and belief and culture clash provide food for thought the descriptive language places the reader in the story riding a bike through kashgar and london","268":"although slow to start off the connection between the two narratives comes together in an interesting way the story of the sisters was interesting and at times weird the relationship of the great grand daughter with her parents was sad she missed out on so much because of in particular her mother's beliefs","269":"i feel like a need to make a shelf for historical novels about women travelling as it is a sort of favorite of mine this was an intriguing read the novel has two parallel threads one set in 1923 in asia and the other in contemporary london the first plot is implied by the title evangeline english is travelling with her sister lizzie and another missionary the domineering millicent to establish a mission somewhere along the great silk road evangeline ironically due to her name is actually non religious and has come on the mission to satisfy her desire for travel and adventure the book's title is also the title of the travel narrative she hopes to create from her adventures the second plot is that of frieda whose job takes her frequently abroad but who feels her connections with outside cultures is based on false pretenses much like her lackluster affair with a married man frieda's life changes however when she receives word that she must clean out the flat of a mysterious woman irene guy an apparent relative of whom she has never heard nearly at the same time she finds a homeless yemeni immigrant tayeb sleeping in the corridor outside her apartment and loans him a pillow and blanket suddenly frieda is caught up in an intriguing web of familial and cultural connections that pull her out of her sterile connection with global culture and into the complex world of real human life and relations i was pulled in by the stories of evangeline frieda and tayeb intrigued by the stories themselves and also by the way that the crosscurrents of history flow through our individual lives in ways we can only dimly comprehend the writing is vivid and well paced not rushed but never dragging the settings are intriguing in themselves and beautifully rendered and the plotlines kept my interest on the surface a fairly quick and simple read but touching on deeper ideas of global society and history","270":"i enjoyed this book very much and i only stopped from giving it 5 stars because it felt rushed at the end all through the book it moves at a leisurely pace and then the gap between the sisters that travelled and the current generation is filled in by some letters being found that were tucked away which explained what had occurred once evangeline returned to london i liked but then became frustrated by the chapters swinging between the missionaries in kashgar and the woman in modern day britain but i thought it was a good way to show the cultural differences from all perspectives the different religions gender date time and place and how all the women from the one family line who survived had ended up unmarried with a baby and each of these reacted differently from the cherished irene to her daughter who left her child with its father and didn't know her i liked that the author acknowledged the sexuality that would have been hidden from view at the time and that in some ways modern life was not that different to what had gone before as demonstrated by the propositions the young yemeni man received in modern times i enjoyed reading about the missionaries setting off even though evangeline was not strictly a missionary as she had other motivations for going with her sister the author's knowledge of the region and the research she had undertaken made the descriptions vivid and the cultural conflict came alive the reader could sense the pending disaster as the leader of their group the wilful and masculine millicent ignored any advice and plunged in taking the others along with her even at the commencement when they come across a young girl giving birth she intervenes saving the baby but with consequences that come back later there are many layers to this book and although it was not what i was expecting from the title it held my attention and the greatest praise is when a reader is so fixated on the book that they are unable to put it down which occurred when i read this book very enjoyable on many levels but i wish it had been longer","271":"i read this book because i too have been to kashgar and travelled to tje takla makan desert i found the this book slow to start but by the end well worth the read the various threads of the story weave together to make a satifying finish i enjoyed the descriptions of kashgar the desert urumqi and heaven lake because i know them so i cannot judge how effective they will be at conveying a sense of place to the reader in the the end the passage which remains with me is this 'travel is in many ways an untranslatable experience this is the problem with the communication of another sphere in all honesty adventures for want of a better word are inherently personal and intimate even the materialty of buying tickets the alighting of trains the catching of ferries and all the consequential trifles that go into the organisation of such an endeavour amount ultimately to a series of personal moments 'i relived my personal moments through this book but hope that others may enjoy the journey","272":"'bicycles are rarely seen here and a woman riding one is simply unimaginable 'it is 1923 and evangeline eva english her sister elizabeth lizzie and their companion millicent frost are trained missionaries who have traveled to kashgar east turkestan to spread the message of christianity lizzie and millicent are driven by their religious beliefs whereas eva with her 'glorious green bsa lady's roadster bicycle' has other motives for wanting to be part of the trip capturing her experiences in writing and hoping to write a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar and have her guide published 'and i shall sub title it 'how i stole amongst the missionaries ' it shall be my own personal observations filled with insights about the moslems i intend to spy upon the women fascinating in their floating garb and the landscape these great monotonous plains and i shall sit upon my two wheels and feel the grit of the desert and move about the streets as if flying ' as we meet them they have just happened upon a young girl in the desert only 10 or 11 who is giving birth and they help her however the local people are against what they have done and they take them in whilst deciding the fate of the three women the women hope that they can gain funds to free themselves the story then moves to london in the present day and we meet frieda as she returns home after travelling for many months as part of her work researching the youth of the islamic world she discovers a man sleeping outside her door and shows kindness towards him the next day she finds beautiful images of birds drawn on the wall outside her home she is in an unsatisfactory relationship with a married man we learn that the stranger is called tayeb and he used to be a filmmaker in his homeland of yemen but is now in a difficult position due an incident that happened to him in london frieda inherits the contents of a flat from a lady she doesn't recall ever having known there she discovers intriguing items from the past and an unlikely and unexpected friendship grows between frieda and tayeb as they both look to their futures frieda has had an unusual upbringing and the inheritance she has received will cause her to revisit past times the author has transported us to another world describing its exotic colours the foods the people and conveying the atmosphere the women find themselves in as two different cultures with different traditions and lifestyles come together it was intriguing to discover how the relationships between the three women changed and developed as more of their individual personalities are revealed to the reader eva experiencing feelings of loneliness and becoming increasingly distanced from lizzie and millicent whose 'friendship was so thick and tight ' of course this is all viewed through the eyes of eva in the passages she has recorded in her journal she ponders why she writes 'perhaps i write it for sense i write it for cohesion i suppose to understand the progression that must occur in the layering of different selves that create a life ' the parts of the novel narrated by eva are prefaced with wonderful short extracts from a book entitled bicycling for ladies by maria e ward from 1896 overall i liked this fascinating debut novel i felt that whilst reading i was able to take a step into the past and experience with eva some dangerous unfamiliar places and felt tension as i read on wondering what would happen to these courageous independent women how would their stories end although admittedly it took me a little while to get into the story fully at first i grew more interested in the story involving frieda and tayeb as it gathered momentum and i enjoyed eva's journal entries more once the story had progressed a little the author moves the story along nicely between the dual strands of narrative historical and modern day and links them cleverly together slowly revealing the connections between eva and frieda and combining to deliver an intriguing and satisfying read as a whole if you like me enjoy novels with this dual time frame structure and which combining historical and present day stories to compelling effect you may well enjoy this book","273":"took a while to get into it and tie the dual stories together but enjoyed it once got into it","274":"a valiant effort by first time writer joinson but i found the narrative lacking and she was unable to pull it together however it was a decent read with a fair amount of good writing but i often found her orientalism annoying and detracting","275":"this book finished well but started very slowly also i felt somewhat ripped off by the title expecting it to have much more to do with cycling than it did as it was it had next to nothing about the topic it wasn't bad enough to consider not finishing but took 2 3 of it to start really gelling in my opinion i liked the way she tied in the present and past day story lines though i never really got the connection with the male character's association with the present day character either i supposed it was the birds again finished it but not sure that's a compelling reason to read something","276":"it was a good read but ultimately sad i was hoping it might have ended on a more uplifting note to me its about people who are adrift and hang on to anything to just keep them going not always recognizing the choices they have or making bad choices i am looking forward to reading more from suzanne joinson i think she has a lot of promise i thought she did some pretty wonderful things with the english language i like her style of writing","277":"i had such high hopes for this book but it felt like it never went anywhere","278":"interesting","279":"i enjoyed the early storyline much more than the modern day part not great literature but it is an easy listen in the car unlike another reviewer i didn't mind the cd version","280":"this debut novel has a lot going on there are two stories the first is set in 1923 and involves a lady missionary who has found a disciple in eva's sister lizzie concerned about her epileptic sister and not wanting to miss out on an adventure eva joins the duo as they head to turkestan to help with the missionary work though not really a believer and to write a travel book about the area that book is named the same as this novel the journey is hard and things go horribly wrong for the women when they stop to help a very young outcast girl who was in labor at the side of the road the girl dies and the women are put under arrest for her death as well as given the task of taking care of the new baby the area at the time is rife with unrest thanks to the very uneasy cohabitation of the muslim and the chinese in the area political unrest religion women's issues and sexuality make for tinder for a fire just waiting to explode the second story is told in the modern day about an independent young woman frieda who travels the world yet still feels a bit lost one night she finds a man sleeping outside her door a gentle soul she brings him a blanket and a pillow thus striking up a very interesting relationship that deepens as frieda is informed of an inheritance from a woman she has never heard of the true magic of this book is that these two narratives slowly twine together creating a story that is far larger than its parts the subtle and very literary writing is simply brilliant this is an astonishing debut of a writer who is about to become very very well known","281":"the book slips back and forth through the stories of several people who are connected over many years and huge distances i found the flow of the narratives very hard to follow the scenes were disjointed and felt like reading bits of half remembered dreams that my mind wanted to string together to make sense none of the stories felt finished and even the last paragraph just left off vaguely heading somewhere some of the scenes are disturbing and i felt burdened rather than enlightened by the time i finished the book","282":"i tried to listen to the audio version of this book but the actor was terrible and the story not much better gave up halfway through the second disc","283":"i picked this book up at the grocery store on my way camping i finished reading it but only because i had nothing better to do","284":"interesting and well written but ultimately disappointing the narrator of the 1920's portions eva is relatively passive and while the turkish russian chinese setting and muslim christian conflicts are interesting she is much more acted upon than the actor other than one noble gesture she is either under house arrest or on the run the connection between her story and the sections set in the present becomes apparent towards the end but everything is rushed at the conclusion ultimately it felt like like the author had something to say but she wasn't quite sure what it was","285":"i had a hard time getting into the book but once i did i couldn't put it down there are a couple of rather surprising sex scenes they're really short but i wasn't expecting them so if you don't want to read them maybe skip the book since they come so suddenly it would be difficult to skip over them by the time you see them they're over","286":"i am on the fence about whether i liked this book or not i don't understand the need for the two timelines overall found it to be a nice read but i have a feeling i won't remember this story tomorrow","287":"the book was well written and had a fascinating background but i didn't like most of the characters and the ending was disappointing","288":"what makes you choose to read a book the title the book cover a review favorite author for me it can be any of those reasons or even a combination as part of my job i read book reviews so i see the titles of lots of new books as well as read their reviews some of my review sources even show the front cover of course i also have my favorite authors when i saw the title the lady cyclist's guide to kashgar i was intriqued the first review i read was very good so i put it on my list of books to read which i keep on goodreads com a great place to keep track of books one of the book review blogs that i follow also reviewed it and that really piqued my interest so i put it on reserve oh the cover is very intriquing as well warm yellows with an early 20th century woman cyclist standing in front of the mountains of an asian desert the book tells two stories one in 1923 of three british women missionaries millicent eve and lizzie to kashgar the other of a young british woman frieda and a young yemeni man tayab in present day london the missionaries witness a young girl trying to give birth outside of her town as they arrive in kashgar millicent the lead missionary helps the girl give birth but the young woman dies and the community blames millicent millicent gives the baby to eve to take care of as it turns out eve is not interested in the missionary work but her sister lizzie is and she didn't want to be parted from her she is writing a book about their travels the three are put under house arrest while the authorities decide what to do about millicent she continues with her unorthodox missionary style which does not help her cause frieda is just back from an overseas trip when she notices tayab sleeping in the hall outside her flat he is in the country illegally and is in hiding while going through her mail freida discovers that she has been named next of kin to someone who has died and she is asked to clear out that woman's flat she asks her father if he knows this woman but he doesn't so she decides to get in contact with her mother who left frieda when she was seven one of the things frieda finds when cleaning the flat is the book eve wrote the book is beautifully written and the stories are fascinating i wondered how they would come together and if my guess about it was right it was","289":"held my interest good use of different time periods cultures locations","290":"i had a hard time trying to identify with any of these characters","291":"disclaimer copy received via goodreads first readsit is 1923 and evangeline english keen lady cyclist arrives with her sister lizzie and their zealous leader millicent at the ancient city of kashgar to establish a mission as they encounter resistance and calamity eva commences work on her book a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar first problem evangeline doesn't own a bike nor has she ridden one until she embarks on the mission second problem millicent isn't so much a zealot as an annoying faux religious maybe lesbian the character is so under developed you barely notice her when she's not being nasty third problem eva doesn't really write a book about cycling as she only rides the bike once and the rest of the time she pushes it loaded up with items or its in the back of a cart in present day london another story is beginning frieda a young woman adrift in her own life opens her frond door one night to find a man sleeping on the landing in the morning is is gone leaving on the wall an exquisite drawing of a long tailed bird and a line of arabic script as their worlds collide the two wanderers begin an unlikely friendship and they embark on a journey that is great and as unexpected as eva's i did not get the impression at any point that frieda was adrift she had a life that was similar to many women i know work boyfriend travel etc the bird and the arabic do not maintain the importance given in the blurb and if what happens between them is world's colliding i guess i need to be very cautious in my own as for great journey going to surrey hastings and victoria station hardly qualify this book had so much potential what has happened is three completely separate and truly interesting stories have been squashed together in 370 pages with no chance for any of them to show their true potential the connections between the stories are all there but have been left distinctly under developed even a little historical context would have been better than nothing it seems the author assumes readers will have the same level of knowledge of the period as she has i have come away from this book frustrated at how much could have been done with this story i wanted to feel more connected with the experiences of all the characters irene guy's connection should have been made specific far sooner so that the reader having worked it out early on isn't left suspended and waiting there are so many ways that this book could have been developed differently that would have resulted in a more fulfilling experience this has left me hugely disappointed and it is disheartening to be left with yet another 3 star review from a book i was lucky enough to win","292":"this book is told in a dual time format present day and in the 1920's the book was a little slow moving for my taste but i thought the author did a good job of connecting the two stories","293":"not sure what to make of this story the modern section was interesting but the section set in the 20s which i was most interested in failed to come alive the characters didn't seem credible and the setting which should have felt exotic seemed flat the title seemed to promise a jaunty adventure but the mood throughout was quite sombre and grim","294":"3 1 2 interesting juxtaposition of two stories one in current day london and one in 1920's kashgar of course it all falls together in the end carol you would like this","295":"i struggled at the beginning and it never really worked for me perhaps naively i expected it to be about cycling","296":"what a great geography history lesson this was all wrapped up in a great novel loved it great story with an added moral dilemma it causes me to think about my motivations for helping very unique story in a little known area of the world but it has a very current message","297":"debut novel where past and present collide with the story of lady missioneries travelling through china in 1923 juxtaposed against modern day london some characters written better than others bit slow going at times","298":"enjoyable and memorable thanks to the clever intertwining of characters who although rather quirky endear themselves to the reader as you follow a parallel plot where their paths historically meet i found the historical and cultural references interesting","299":"2 5 stars really wanted to like this i would've loved more story about eva disappointed","300":"i have reviewed this book here http mygoodbookshelf wordpress com","301":"3 pages in i knew i was going to enjoy this book and i was right","302":"this book did not exactly turn out the way i expected it to i read it for my bookclub and thus began the book without really reading the back summary i knew it was the standard historical fiction and indeed it came with all the standard tropes alternation between past and present female protagonist s some connection between the two sets of characters a mystery a budding romance all that was there the surprise for me was that it wasn't all fluff there was some substance there between the missionary work realities of life in the region the fates of particular characters i enjoyed reading from eva's point of view as she was the least frustrating character although since she is our voice of course she is millicent was unbearable and i have no clue how she managed to attract the love and attention that she did lizzie was too frail and a perfect martyr which was solidly irritating frieda seemed like the lost woman creeping into middle age and apparently being the mistress of a married man runs in her family eva's story was intriguing i looked forward to her tale and wanted to know how things turned out for her she wasn't the only one with frieda and tayeb i was also curious wanting to know where things went after the last page it's night high art it won't change your life but it was an entertaining and quick read and quite appropriate for any bookclub","303":"like a lot of first novels i think that this author has promise this book had some good elements and strong writing style but also some major misses i love a good multigenerational interwoven family saga and the families of this book are no exception it isn't a completely unique storyline but it works well here the contemporary story involves a character who finds a journal from someone she doesn't know but to whom she might be related the historical part of the story is actually the journal made up of notes from a failed mission to kashgar a melting pot of chinese and muslim influence i liked elements of both historical and present day stories both having a well developed sense of place and helped the pace by moving back and forth where i think that this book ultimately failed for me was with the characters this isn't a hugely long book so the lack of distinct characterization was even more disappointing because it seems like it could have been added i had no real grip on either the historical or present day characters why do the historical sisters travel so far with such a sketchy leader what are they running from what are they running to i never understood any of their motivations ditto the contemporary characters tayeb is on the run from his home country for drawing on the walls who is he really and what does he want i don't understand him and you get some sense about freida that is based on her family's commune history but it still doesn't all click together everyone is wandering but you don't really know why which makes for a frustrating read","304":"i received this book in a goodreads first reads giveaway this is an interesting novel that takes place in two time periods with each chapter alternating between 1923 and the present in 1923 evangeline and lizzie english along with their acquaintance millicent set off from london for kashgar on the silk road to become missionaries evangeline eva has been commissioned to write a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar during the course of their travels the ladies discover that they are not as prepared as they should be for navigating the culture and religious beliefs of the area and they end up in some precarious and dangerous situations the story becomes intertwined with frieda a young woman in present day london who learns she has inherited the contents of an apartment belonging to a dead woman she doesn't know in the process she meets tayeb a man from yemeni who is living illegally in london there are lots of twists and turns to this story and the author has developed some interesting characters","305":"starting to grow weary of books that try to blend a modern and an historical storyline this book is one of them and the two story lines took so long to intertwine that it became a distracting puzzle","306":"i love the base story about three women missionaries circa 1900's turkey and i'm totally annoyed at the alternating chapters focused in present day london this may be a big fad and one i'm not at all fond of julie and julia pulls it off but this book sure isn't","307":"pretty good read told in alternating voices one in 1920s and one in present day there are twists and turns and it aligns later in the text the 1920s story line follows evangeline and her sister lizzie as they become missionaries in russia china the present day story follows frieda as she meets a mysterious man from yemen who shows up on her doorstep","308":" i read several good reviews of this and i think it's over rated it was difficult to connect with any of the characters partially due to the format of the book the jumping from past to present interrupted the plot enough that i had to read fairly far into to the book to care about the characters i didn't particularly like any of the characters everyone was manipulative and devious i wasn't sad when lizzie died just thought oh get on with it knew pretty quickly that ai lien and irene were the same person then it was just a matter of wading thru it all to get to the resolution all in all disappointing","309":"i wish i could be more positive about the book but i decided to shelf it after 178 pages much of which were read because the book was picked by my book club i find it full of stereotypes about religions people the characters could have had a bit more depth","310":"this story is one centered around women and their strength to hold their own set back in 1923 you see the lives of several women unfold connecting past to present day there seems to be a lot of emphasis on history repeating itself it almost felt like the author was trying to say they are all the same as the same sorts of things are highlighted through the women's lives there is an odd hint toward homosexuality which baffles me a bit as the majority of it you see in the past and in the christian community the book also screams anti christian sure it follows missionaries however it is written about through the eyes of a non believer and so cast disapproving views on it as a whole the only time that the main character eva didn't seem anti christian was when she was falling in love with a male missionary who is hinted at being gay and expresses to him that being the wife of a missionary doesn't seem to be a terrible thing however i then remembered how she was content to pretend she had faith in order to not be left behind by her sister and so she would have no doubt felt inclined to do it again if it meant she would be his wife the more i mull over the book in my mind i am not sure how i feel about the book and it's message to the reader it paints the picture that all daughters feel suffocated by their mothers and a need to get away from them as soon as possible once on their own they get pregnant on accident and without the ultimate support of a male their mothers expect and want to help them raise the baby but the soon to be mother says no and stays away they then are on their own raising the child which then forces the same fate on their daughter while reading the book you get a sense of pride in these women which leads me to believe that the author is not trying to give us a moral of the story but more a look at what women can accomplish on their own without a man and oh by the way they have been doing it since the beginning of time one thing i know for sure is that the love that eva has for ai lien is real and sweet","311":"after 6 chapters i was still not drawn into the story","312":"this was a book that was chosen for book club and i can honestly say that it would have never been something that i would have picked on my own i wasn't sure about this one as it didn't outwardly appeal to me and i am such a visual shopper i started to read it and i found it a bit think the story was tough for me to get engaged in but i persevered and in the end i did enjoy it i didn't love it and it wasn't my favorite book but i did like the story and some of the characters and i found it an interesting choice for book club and after all that is why i like book club so much because it compels me to read something i otherwise wouldn't have","313":"simply beautiful review to come","314":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar by suzanne joinson evangeline and her sister lizzie are on their way to the silk road and kashgar as lady missionaries under the supervision of millicent a zealous woman intent on converting the locals evangeline has brought along her bicycle a novelty in 1923 while lizzie is a true believer evangeline is more interested in seeing the world soon the women run afoul of local custom and law in current day frieda is confused by a letter informing her she is the sole heir of a stranger she has one week to clean out the mystery person's flat aided by tayeb a homeless refugee she delves into the accumulation of a lifetime looking for a connection this lively story has strong female characters it is an interesting look at the sometimes volatile intersection of differing cultures","315":"i really wanted to like this book made it to page 123 and i am throwing in the towel the characters are just not compelling enough to hold my interest the writing does not have any energy to it disappointed i very rarely do not finish a book","316":"in 1923 three british women set out on an ill advised christian mission to remotest northwest china part travelog part slow motion disaster with repercussions for the present","317":"i really don't know if this book is to my liking because i couldn't get past the reader i didn't even make it through one disc","318":"2 5 starsi was first drawn to this book by the exotic setting the opening story told in diary format finds two english sisters in the middle of asia working as missionaries well one of the sisters is not so much a missionary as a seeker of adventure and adventure she does find right from the strong opening when the sisters find themselves assisting a very young girl deliver a baby in the desert of central asia further adventures follow the second story is set in present day london where frieda has just returned from another of her many research related travels to find a strange man sleeping on her front step the two meet again their story is the second of the two narratives there is some great writing in this debut novel but the structure annoyed me a bit joinson alternates the telling of the two stories one from the 1920's and one from today it was frustrating to get involved in one story only to have it interrupted by another the two narratives do finally connect though i'm not sure the revelations were worth the wait joinson interestingly explores themes of both freedom and dislocation that result from global travel","319":"although a little slow in spots i enjoyed this book an interesting story of missionary experience in a remote part of the world in the early 20th century with a tie in to present day it included a few twists and turns and a character or two that i haven't quite understood the purpose of but still interesting and kept me curious about how the two stories tied together until close to the end","320":"masterfully written with strong characterization and interesting plot twists for some reason i love what could be considered dry descriptions of settings the author's choice to make two characters' stories in the third person and the third character in the first person was a treat to read as it added interest and could appeal to me no matter what my mood i loved that the main character evangeline english was an extremely strong woman despite the time period frieda's listlessness and tayeb's grounded manner fit perfectly together so that they played off of each other and created an interesting dynamic to watch as it progressed throughout the story","321":"this novel moves back and forth between 1923 kashgar and the silk road and the present day in england in 1923 evangeline has signed up as a missionary for the group missionary order of the steadfast face along with her sister elizabeth they are led by millicent a forthright woman eva has brought her bicycle with her and hopes to write a book about her experiences elizabeth is an avid photographer and has brought her camera but is often lost in a dreamy world of her own when the small group of women encounter a girl in childbirth they try to help and end up being accused of a crime eva is asked to take care of the infant and grows attached to her but there is unrest in the area and the women's position grows increasingly precarious eva must find the strength to survive and adjust to the new environment her bicycle has given her some independence and she is reluctant to leave it behind in the present day a young man from yemen in england illegally is targeted after being seen drawing intricate pictures of birds on a wall he leaves his home and in his wanderings encounters frieda a young woman working to understand young people from a variety of emerging nations frieda is going through change in her personal life and when she finds herself in charge of the personal possessions of a woman who has died she struggles to make sense of them and find the connection between her and the woman irene i loved the bird theme that came through the novel and the sense of other a wonderful read that takes you to another world","322":"liked the adventure of it the characters and writing style of this first book for the author","323":"this book would have been so much better without the back and forth narrative between the missionaries and the present day characters this is partly because frieda and tayeb took absolutely forever to get anywhere with their story and by the time anything really started happening with the two i'd totally lost interest in them the missionaries were more compelling by far and i felt like too much space was wasted developing this mostly pointless connection between the past and the present i really wanted to like this book and it had some great moments and great characters but overall it was a bit of a disappointment","324":"this relates to the audio version i disliked the narrator immensely and yet the book was intriguing and surprising and enjoyable connecting present day and the past it's a story of isolation and finding yourself in the face of adversity","325":"what what did i just read i am so not sure although i enjoy womens' stories i had a hard time grasping what these 2 stories had in common i really loved the cover and so i thought it would be interesting but it seemed as if it had nothing to do with that and then things started just falling apart for me shortly after picking it up 1923 eva heads out for an adventure in china then we go to present day london frieda what links them i am unclear of i just didn't care about one character which i really wanted to lizzie eva and frieda needed to have more life breathed into them in my humble opinion and for pete's sake if you name something please have it be in the book","326":"i have to agree with another reviewer that the two thread time frame storyline has been overused this one just never quite got going","327":"i was lured to this book by the romanticism of the title a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar but the book was not what i expected this novel alternates between present day london and 1920's kashgar three women set off as missionaries in the kashgar province but evangeline aspires to write about her travels and bicycling rather than convert the natives to christianity unfortunately the women encounter a terrible situation and are perceived to be the instigators and are subsequently placed under house arrest needless to say there is not a lot of bicycling when you are under house arrest in present day london freida receives a notice that she has inherited the contents of an apartment from a lady she has never met freida searches the apartment interviews her family and her past for clues to the identity of the woman and their connection i checked the audio book out from the library and i would have rather read the book the narrator of the story had an annoying speech pattern it was as if she was reading in iambic pentameter she read in a sing song way with one sentence pitch going up and then the next sentence going down over and over and over again below the surface of the storyline is a unifying theme of racial and cultural differences and misunderstandings","328":"this book got a good review in the nyt sunday section but it was really mediocre the parallel stories in 1920 and present day were the most interesting part of the book and i finished it because i wanted to see where they intersected however the characters were flat and undeveloped and it would have been interesting to learn about such an unknown area of the world but the author focused on the crazy antics of the missionaries and did not describe the surroundings or culture in much detail finally bicycle riding was a very very minor part of the story","329":"alternating story of a group of female missionary in china's kashgar region in the 1920s and a modern day woman of london family secrets bring the two time periods to life in this intense debut the characters never really get off the ground but i was impressed by the author's knowledge of this exotic and foreign setting","330":"an interesting read with plot twists that were definitely unexpected this book has a dark underside i liked the balance between the modern day story and the earlier setting a lot of relevance for today and i enjoy her writing style","331":"wonderful journey beautiful writing visual images to get lost in","332":"this story follows the lives of a handful of people whose paths cross and are connected in various ways joinson's tale skips between modern day england and 1920's northern china and both the characters and the world they live in are brought to convincing life frieda in modern day london is a young woman whose life is in some disarray both her career and relationships she finds tayeb a filmmaker forced to flee his native yemen sleeping outside her apartment inviting him in they become friends and he begins to help her with emptying the apartment of a old lady who has died and although frieda does not know who it is has been identified as the next of kin in kashgar a trio of lady missionaries venture into kashgar in remote china where they become involved with the death of a woman giving birth eva our narrator for these chapters must help take care of the baby whilst the women are held in house arrest awaiting trial for the murder their mission is lead by millicent a blinkered authoritative woman and also with them is her sister lizzie who is dizzy and somewhat intoxicated by millicent each of eva's chapters begin with a quote from 'the lady cyclists guide' a book which eva has brought along on the journey along with her bicycle these quotes have an old school charm of their own and the anonymous author becomes another character of the book what i enjoyed most about this book were the many little details and observations that bring the world to life similarly the characters all have unique voices and their motivations in life are easy to understand and empathise with tayeb's chapters for example capture a believable portrait of what england must be like to an exile without papers always moving always at risk of being discovered and sent home the story moves at a moderate pace and everything is tied up nicely at the end in summary a richly interesting and enjoyable tale that has been finely crafted","333":"the cyclist's guide was beautifully written descriptive of characters and settings i could feel the warm desert winds and feel the sting of the sand in a storm sometimes i empathized with the the characters and other times their motives puzzled me the past was the best writing and the most engrossing whereas the switch to modern day london was not attended to as much i couldn't grasp those characters and how and what they had to do with the ladies in kashgar until the last few chapters the relationships of the characters in the past and present were not strong enough to cause an ahhh now i get it moment suzanne joinson has a wonderful pen going and i hope to read more from her i hope to see something with a life changing experience that grabs the reader and won't let go","334":"i enjoyed this book the book follows the lives of two women one living as a missionary in kashgar in the 1920s and one in present day london the stories especially of the woman in kashgar kept me interested throughout surprised me at times and i also really enjoyed the characters i did listen to this via audiobook so if i had read it the traditional way i think it may have felt a bit slow overall though a good read","335":"this book was so good in so many ways beautiful transporting prose intriguing characters a story where the author had the courage not to tie everything together neatly at the end second best book i've read this year thus far wild by cheryl strayed being the best","336":"such a beautiful story split between the current day and the 1920's it was hard to tear myself away from each decade as it jumped back and forth left me with a wanderlust and a desire to read more by this author","337":"i struggled with this book initially but i am glad i stuck with it i wish we were reading this for book club because there are parts i would like to discuss with others the characters were interesting and kept surprising me the author tied things together neatly at the end this is another book that will keep me thinking","338":"i enjoyed many things about a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar a novel by suzanne joinson but not everything i enjoyed the way it shifted between present day london and the three missionary ladies who left london in 1923 to save souls in the deserts of sinkiang or eastern turkestan in present day london we follow frieda who studies young people in middle eastern nations for a foundation we find her disillusioned by the kinds of things the foundation wants her to study and she finds that she is finally losing her wanderlust she is also fed up with her married lover and her life is at a turning point all she needs is a catalyst in 1923 there are two sisters lizzie and eva elizabeth and evangeline english and the indomitable millicent the most hodge podge group of missionary ladies you will ever meet lizzie eva's younger sister is there because she has been \"hypnotized\" by the much older millicent eva is there because she is the sister who always wanted to travel lizzie cared nothing for travel until someone put a leica in her hands and introduced her to millicent eva is also there because she doesn't want to let go of her sister and because she is on a mission from her mother to look after lizzie lizzie is frail in several ways and is from the beginning a bird blown by a wind that is too powerful for her weak constitution to endure birds are symbols throughout this narrative as are bones even evangeline's bicycle is sometimes symbolic eva is the only one of the women who actually rides a bicycle in present day london a yemeni man who has lived in england for some time is in danger of being deported because he misunderstood a social situation he ends up sleeping outside frieda's door which he chose basically at random is it fate frieda takes pity and hands him a pillow and blanket and with that act tayeb becomes part of the catalyst that brings change to frieda's life frieda also inherits the contents of an apartment from a person she doesn't seem to know but who claims her as her last living relation here is the second half of the catalyst to change and here is the bridge between decades this is a complex book with many characters all worth meeting although they are not all good people throughout this book we experience the clash between the muslim world and the christian world as seen through the words of eva's journals which are published by mr hatchett when she returns from her bicycling tour a bicycling tour sounds so innocent but eva learns little about innocence in her journey to kashgar in fact the desert symbolism is more about bones than it is about birds although both are present as a result of the first act of this trio of pseudo missionaries which is to try to help a 10 year old native deliver a baby eva ends up with just about the only innocent thing she encounters on this harsh journey the arrogance of the missionary role is revealed clearly as the events in this story unfold it is clear that things have not progressed all that much from 1923 to 2012 although some progress is indicated as you will see when you arrive at the end of the story it appears that i have told you a lot the whole book perhaps but there is so much more that i haven't told you i did like that the journeys these women went on were described in terms that are very different from a traditional romanticized travelogue i was a bit disappointed by the ways in which the issues of homosexuality were raised in this book i'm just not sure that it was necessary in every case where it occurred and at least in one case it seemed stereotypical perhaps in every case this is not a fatal flaw in the book but this did mar for me my overall enjoyment in fact i had trouble with almost all of the women in this book except frieda and evangeline but that doesn't mean they didn't seem real","339":"such a disappointment i got reeled in by the jacket blurb and the cover and thought that it would be a story about one woman with spunk that would be needed surely to write the lady cyclist's guide to kashgar instead i got not one but two overwhelmingly obnoxious and stupid lady protagonists do not be suckered this isn't a guide this isn't even an honest attempt at a guide let alone being a window into a strange land at a distant time there's no real understanding in joinson's kashgari heroine of her own sister so the plot of her story goes like this she hates dull dreary england so when her sister catches the missionary bug eva follows her into china with the intention of writing a guide there is even a publishing deal that she's secured for said guide so far so good except things begin to go wrong as soon as they get into kashgar and one of their number is held to a trial due to cultural misunderstanding their mission drops them like a super hot potato which i didn't think was actually done throughout their forced stay in kashgar we get these equations beaten over our head millicent the lady on trial bad lizzie eva's sister stupid and lost and sleeping with millicent mission not helpful muslims hate missionaries and eva stupid because she doesn't understand the previous equations even though she's the one doing the beating and the central premise of the book misleading eva doesn't want to go anywhere when they land in kashgar she whines here do i really need to be in the desert and then in rapid fashion in the last twenty pages or so of the book she travels that is to say she runs with basically no other choice left to her she's only happy once she comes to a place that she calls unhygienic but it's got one european style house with two floors and switzerland style mountains just half an hour away this is truly a spectacular place to visit people a home away from home indeed the funniest part is that once she gets back to england this guide actually gets published which makes frieda the present time heroine's story ridiculous and pointless anyhow she is next of kin to someone who just died and she's given seven days by the state to sort out the dead lady's belongings tada the dead lady is connected to the cyclist lady obviously and she's also connected to frie except how is a mystery ingenious this is obviously a pointless connection her totally useless storyline is further confused by an illegal immigrant character from yemen for some reason why yemen the book gives us no clue in a completely contrived sequence that involves luring an accidentally freed owl no seriously back into its cage frieda and this guy tayeb get together and then decide to putter around the dead old lady's apartment for lack of anything better to do tayeb is obviously handy with more than just the owl he conveniently knows that the leica they find is an early model because he was a filmmaker he knows what looks like a printing press is a mimeograph because he worked in a printing press he knows how to cook oxtail soup because well he worked in a restaurant and he sees frieda kind of naked and the first thing he thinks of is to draw a tattoo on her back because that's the most arabic thing he does draw animal calligraphy on walls and he does the pointing and the recognizing of things within two seconds of being in the old house the cooking takes the bulk of the time in the apartment nine hours he's also the responsible party who finds what seems to be the only photograph in the house available in the first two seconds he finds this in the bible what he was doing picking up the bible is anyone's guess maybe his next profession will be to imitate a man of the cloth honestly that's about it joinson introduces several different cultures she's not satisfied with one or two and basically spits on all of them even the poor old ladies of the english suburbs are not spared at least we can call her not racist we get frieda telling tayeb that she just cannot put down eva's notebook it's so interesting i couldn't put it down either but that's because i need to return the book to the library today we get some half hearted family plot threads that are opened to give the characters some depth i think they're not resolved but the author basically makes us think that they're resolved in the last chapter where frieda stands at the sea shore and apparently the foam washes away all the unresolved plot lines handy i truly wanted to like this book but all it gave me was a lot of material to criticize in a lengthy review","340":"once i started reading this book i could not put it down","341":"was a different kind of story from what i was expecting and the ending was also unexpected it was a good read","342":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar opens with an immediately engrossing scene three lady missionaries come upon a young girl in labor villages are afraid or unwilling to help the pregnant girl a child herself so the missionary ladies step in the baby is born the new mother dies and the missionary ladies are led away to be charged with murder at this point i expected to love this book the missionaries are eva our narrator her sister lizzie and an older woman called millicent the mission to kashgar is really millicent's project for reasons of her own that aren't necessarily gospel based lizzie just wants to take photos and be with millicent and eva wants to look after lizzie since missionary work doesn't appeal to eva she's faking that bit her goals for the trip have more to do with her newfangled bicycle and the journal she's keeping in hopes of publishing a guide for tourists traveling on these exciting new machines juxtaposed with events in kashgar is the story of frieda a young woman in present day who has struggled to make her own life the opposite of her commune dwelling free spirited mother's instead frieda finds herself somewhat tangled between her married lover and a new friendship with an illegal immigrant who's begun camping on her doorstep i disliked frieda and thought her sections of the book were predictable and only served to break up the more interesting goings on in kashgar after dragging out eva's naivete for most of the book the ending rushed by in a blur leaving the reader to piece together events from a few lines in quoted letters in the end i wanted the parts of the story i didn't have and was impatient with the parts that were told","343":"interesting book and interesting reading it just after i read little bee they both deal with illegal aliens in england the book is two stories in one and both are good stories with many creative twists and turns in the storyline","344":"rambling story of 2 different places and times finally ties it together but still left me hanging","345":"as someone else said i'm not sure why i liked it so much but it was compelling reading closer to 4 stars than 3 so thus the 4 wish goodreads had 1 2 stars","346":"romance exoticism and travel team up in this unusual debut the story is set in the stunning remote muslim area along an old china silk route millicent is a domineering missionary out to convert local muslims to christianity her sister evangeline the narrator and keeper of a diary has no interest in establishing a mission her secret passion is to write a travel guide about the kashgar desert another sister lizzie a rather incidental character worships millicent much to evangeline's dismay the story fluctuates between 1923 and the contemporary life of frieda a london resident who is an arabic youth specialist she is a communique of the islamic youth to a european \"think tank \" she becomes involved on several levels with a young yemeni man the plot eventually links them back to evangeline evangeline evidently has a charming sense of humor but that aspect of her personality is minimally developed this reader wanted to hear more from the cyclist who noted in her diary \"difficulties to overcome there is the mounting difficulty and the steering difficulty and the pedaling difficulty and then there is the general difficulty of doing all these things together \" this is not chick lit but a study of opposing cultures and religious fanaticism the title is a fetching hook but the lack of development of the travel guide was a disappointment the main theme is the failed relationships of women but it is wrapped up with a bow of originality and alluring description the advance review copy was graciously provided by the amazon vine program","347":"an absorbing tale of cultural divides told in two time periods the present day and the early 1920s and the barriers that keep them in place then and now evangeline eva is our lady cyclist travelling to the ancient city of kashgar on the old silk road together with her sister lizzie and the marvellously militant and somewhat malicious milicent ostensibly as missionaries although eva confides she has lost her faith eva relates her story through the notes she writes in preparation for her guidebook a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar taken captive after a tragedy involving a local girl the trio of women are forced to rely on their own resources for survival in a strange and often dangerous land joinson is very good at describing both the bleakness and the almost mystical effect this has on the women in the present day tayeb a yemeni national illegally living in london is trying with mixed success to stay under the radar of authorities he meets frieda a woman whose work involves bridging the divide between muslims and non muslims via a mysterious bequest to frieda we gradually learn how the two narrative strands will come together a thoughtful intelligent read","348":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar by suzanne joinson is a complete diversion from the other vacation reading i did from the very first page i felt the seriousness of this novel the tone of a book in which i would find a wealth of new knowledge and be transported into another world two worlds actually one in present day london and the other in the deserts and souqs of 1923 china if the other books i read on vacation felt like splashing in a pool or snorkeling in the shallow waters off a coral reef this one felt like diving deep into the ocean depths surrounded by silence and darkness teeming exotic life and overwhelming beauty some books are fun and interesting to read while others make you feel smarter richer fuller somehow more that you were before you read it this novel is one of the latter it expanded my mind's store of rich images and ideas thoughts knowledge and understanding while missionary millicent and sisters lizzie and evageline travel a hot dusty exotic landscape both outer and inner frieda and tayeb take a journey to explore their self identities their ancestry and the limitations on their choices to make lives of their own i loved these characters and i loved this book it will stay with me for a long long time","349":"the book is not really about cycling though the story is told by a woman working as a travel writer it really focuses on relationships between various women characters including two sisters the story was interesting and it had a foreign flair","350":"this was an interesting story idea but not very well done i would have liked it more as just a historical novel as the modern day characters felt a bit pointless","351":"this is one of those books with two tracks that eventually are shown to be related i enjoyed the modern story more than the historical one rather to my surprise the historical context was interesting and surprising and i should have felt like i was learning a lot but instead i was mostly confused and not quite motivated enough to do side research to get oriented pun unintended but now that i see it i'll leave it there plus the characters ranged from grimly unlikeable to flakily unlikeable to naively helpless the modern story certainly had its grim aspects but oddly i liked the rather eccentric characters right away and was delighted that they became friends however truly improbable that may have been","352":"this was not the book i expected it to be i thought i was in for a charming blend of time periods in a vivid setting what i got was a visit to the looney bin and apparently the lesson that adultery is a genetic trait","353":"has anyone ever seen 'the verdict' starring paul newman i saw it years ago at the theater i think because if i'd seen it on tv i would have gotten up and turned it off up until the last 2 3 of the movie when i was suddenly riveted to the story reading a lady cyclist's guide was like that for me it took me 100 pages to even remotely care about any of the characters in the book the modern day frieda was the first one to tempt me but the last 100 pages really drew me in by the end i was glad i had read the stories of frieda and of evangeline it was an interesting intriguing book","354":"not bad interesting setting but plot fairly predictable","355":"i started this book on my evening commute home more out of curiosity than any desire to dig in when i lifted my head i was at the end of my line and nearly one hundred pages in i was hooked sort of in my flash judge y way i hadn't realized this was a dual narrative i thought it was entirely a historical novel the story is split between two characters eva a 1920s english missionary in kashgar china and frieda a contemporary londoner at the end of an affair eva and her sister lizzie freshly minted missionaries following the charismatic and commanding millicent end up in kashgar china detained after millicent assists in a birth that results in the mother's death millicent is enthralled with their circumstances and lizzie keeps up with her photography but eva finds herself unlikely nursemaid to the orphaned infant scared worried and overwhelmed her own project writing a lady cyclist's guide to the east doesn't seem to be going anywhere in contemporary london freelance journalist frieda meets tayeb a yemeni man on the run from authorities one night he sleeps in the hall of her building leaving a beautiful drawing in his wake when frieda discovers she's inherited something her pursuit of who and who her benefactress is connects her with tayeb and her family's past in my opinion eva's story was marvelous i loved her voice and her arc in the book her doubts about millicent her doubts about her faith and missionary work her concern for her increasingly dreamy eyed sister and her anxiety about the alarmingly foreign world she's in i love 19th century travelogues and while this is 20th century there's that wonderful english fish out of water feel that i ate up frieda's story however was yawn worthy and really should have been left out of the book or at least plunked into another novel she was having an affair with a married man who was a total bore and vaguely ignoring her free love parents her journalism work trotted her around the globe but she felt wildly pedestrian compared to eva and her coterie even tayeb and the mystery of frieda's inheritance couldn't save her side of the story while this book might take best title for 2012 sadly it just didn't totally win for me ultimately this became a dnf as i got so sick of frieda that i just started skipping her sections to remain in the portions with eva eventually frieda's story connects with the one involving eva's and i liked that enough but not enough to go back and read frieda's bits again i'd describe this book as slightly more chick lit y than hist fic y but maybe that's because frieda's sections felt fluffier than eva's a fun enough summer read might be fun for book clubs due to the differing voices and certainly pretty enough to carry on the train or show off at the beach","356":"beautiful writing style really enjoyed this suspenseful work of historic fiction blended with the present day","357":"the book was a little hard to follow on audio at the beginning as it leaps back and forth from early 1900's to present day knowing there had to be a connection point between these two stories i stuck with it the innocence of the young ladies in kashgar was such a contrast to the cold manipulation of the women leader and the trouble she knowingly put them in the present day story built more slowly these characters were less defined but very likable the connection finally comes late in the story but it is not as much of a change in the characters as i had hoped","358":"read my review at literary explorations http literary exploration com 2012","359":"i greatly enjoyed this book i know it's fairly early in the year still but this was the best book i read so far this year mine was an audiobook and the narrator was really good i liked the way she read frieda's parts and eva's parts in slightly different voices underlining that they were different people view spoiler i was drawn into the story almost immediately at first i was fascinated by millicent her air of authority her certainty of herself even the voice the narrator gave her this initial fascination eventually turned into dislike as the plot progressed and by the end of the book i'm finding that there was probably something sort of ominous in that fascination it seemed like foretelling it took a little longer for frieda's bits to draw me in but they did too i found i became quite fond of frieda and i expect that she will be very happy with tayep in years to come he's good for her i think and in a matter of days she built with him a far more healthy relationship than it sounds like she ever had with nathaniel i should have liked to have known what was up with that owl though i saw that some reviewers felt the ending and the revalation of the connection between frieda and eva was an anticlimax but i don't feel it was i had figured out very early that it was definitely a family connection although i hadn't quite guessed how until they found the photo of frieda's mother in the flat hide spoiler i thought this was an excellent book and i'm looking forward to seeing more from suzanne joinson's hand very much recommended","360":"could not put this down read late into the night interwoven stories fascinating and hints helped me never be lost just wanting to know more this is all about rebellion marital political sexual tribal religious career personal and birds unleashed cyclists really cycling was the light leitmotif reminding us of how easy it is to get away the movement and the how to epigraphs good glue birds a bright web of beauty and flight language a delight fave metaphor like looking at a shopping list on a wedding day or some unloved gravestones and the real theme likely eva's why then do i find it so difficult to inhabit my own disguise the trek across eastern turkestan or england or the invoked worlds everyone runs from are built and colored as if we are there loss of course and the missed closeness of successful love are the watercolor wash across it all beautiful book going on my re read list","361":"this is the story of three single women in the 20's who go as missionaries to kashgar where they become involved quite accidentally in the birth of a child and the immediate death of its mother taking the girl baby with them they take up their post and commence to converting the muslims starting with a particular ugly one with few marriage or life prospects the second story line involves a woman rather unhappily traveling the world in a futile effort to do something useful for the less fortunate only in a secular way she is dating a rather disgusting married man and meets a muslim man who has come under suspicion false for terrorism it all comes together when the modern woman is notified that she has been mentioned in the will of a woman she has never known the story is not bad but it's so lifeless all the women are vaguely unhappy and repressed kind of victorian in a bad way in the end it's hard to care very much about any of them and their passionless small lives","362":"i had a hard time getting into this book i almost gave up i didn't really like the characters at first which always makes it harder for me the book picks up about mid way though and finishes strong","363":"great female characters i enjoyed the unearthing of the relationship between characters did see it coming though thought the setting was evocative and exotic enjoyed it","364":"liked the time shifting aspect","365":"very interesting novel i covers two tales which two sets of characters and two periods of time these two tales come together quite dramatically in the end it begins in 1923 as evangeline eva english and her sister lizzie along with millicent travel to kashgar along the way they assist a young girl in the birth of a baby girl the young girl dies and they continue their travels with the newborn lizzie and millicent hope to establish a christian mission in kashgar eva comes along looking for adventure she brings her bicycle with the intent of writing a guide for ladies to use cycling in the desert her writing becomes much more than that it becomes her journal into the danger and adventures she encounters the second tale is modern day the setting is london frieda finds tayeb an arab sleeping outside her door frieda and tayeb befriend and embark on an unexpected journey frieda has inherited the contents of an apartment beloning to a woman she has never heard of tayeb assists her in unraveling these contents i enjoyed the way eva's journal joins the two tales the author does a great job of describing the areas visited by the characters you feel the harshness of the desert and smell the fruits of the land the characters are well defined and quite believable great job by a first time novelist","366":"so disappointing it sounded like it had real potential for interesting and exotic intertwining narratives but really fell short of the mark all round","367":"a remarkable book","368":"audiobook reviewstars overall 3 narration 4 story 3this is a debut novel for suzanne joinson and contains sections of prose that describe the scenes to perfection occasionally there are moments that work less smoothly in the story and narration a sense of self awareness of the literary nature of the prose gets in the way and the passages aren't as smooth those moments tend to overuse descriptive words that remove the reader's sense of input into the visualization a stylistic affectation that will i believe disappear with time and attention the story carries a dream like quality in the writing providing a sense of remove from the characters unfortunately this quality doesn't necessarily stand up to close scrutiny of the characterizations or their connection separated by nearly a century evangeline and freida are the two women we come to learn from and watch as they learn and grow in their adventures evangeline was a half hearted missionary with her more pious sister and an acquaintance her real intent is to pen the book a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar alternately freida is a single woman functioning in the modern world as a travel writer her bicycle is her mode of transport through the often gridlocked london traffic what emerges is a slow to develop convergence of the two women both are striving for freedom independence and empowerment as they self direct their lives eva has a richer life emotionally and experience wise and is more intriguing when contrasted to the often overly emphatic characters in her travel companions frieda is emotionally guarded and rather dry and feels as if she is there to simply pull parallels from past to present forcing the connection between the two women tayeb is interesting and brings with him a new perspective but only momentarily is his position primary to frieda's journey and their connection never seems to develop into a solid one ending with a whimper and not a bang sadly the connected threads of experience from past to present characters did not develop as solidly or as strongly as i hoped being shadows at the edge of consciousness rather than fully formed analogies narration for this story is provided by susan duerden she has a very precise and deliberate speaking style which may feel to some listeners as if she is over enunciating in fact the style is not dramatically distracting if you are familiar and comfortable with the british accent and the minor pitch and tempo changes that are used to delineate characters are not over done i would be curious to see if reading the book brings another perspective but it was certainly an interesting and intriguing story with some beautiful details and descriptions and a unique presentation of east meets west i received an mp3 download from tantor audio via edelweiss for purpose of honest review for the heard word i was not compensated for this review all conclusions are my own responsibility","369":"the book has two parallel tracks each running independently until the later half of the book where we begin to glimpse tenuous links in the first in 1923 evangeline has set off for a trip along the silk route with sister elizabeth and lizzie's friend milicent frost the second track is set in modern day london telling us freida blaekman's tale tired of her travel and work and unhappy with her personal life frieda meets tayeb a middle aged illegal immigrant who lands up on her stoop seeking shelter i was looking forward to this book because of its female centric theme and expected a book similar to tracy chevalier's feminist tales the allusion to cycling drew me in with the close connection between cycling for women and the evolution of women's dress from the corseted gowns to the relatively comfortable pantaloons eva takes her bicycle on the journey and freida has found it to be her mode of deliverance interestingly both women separated by generations want to be free and by inference empowered and see cycling as a way of achieving it while this is a well written book and a decent read i did not find the prose or the intention as lucid as chevalier's i did find eva's situation surreal and her too passive a heroine - she acted but only under the most trying circumstances i liked freida more on the plus side the settings are beautifully described and the village of kashgar and the surroundings of the three english women come to life in joinson's prose the clash between the cultures and religions is interestingly portrayed this book does sketch out the travails of women now and then and their search for independence and it makes for a thought provoking if melancholic read if you're looking for a woman's travelogue theres a cycle on the cover and it in the title with uplifiting notions of feminist belief or action this is not it rather it takes the \"cycling theme\" and it's notional baggage and uses it to tie together the stories of women in two different times fans of women's fiction will be pleased","370":"this is a story about journeys inner and outer physical and emotional told through two women's stories eva english the lady cyclist is a christian missionary in one of the most remote areas of china turkestan in 1923 frieda's story unfolds in modern london i most loved eva's journey and in the beginning found frieda's alternating chapters a distraction i had to trust the author's decision to tell the parallel stories which of course by the end connected the setting was new to me and i enjoyed how eva writes her lady cyclist's guide in the midst of colonial era travel conflicts of cultures and personalities self discovery","371":"i liked the idea of this book and enjoyed some parts of it but found it unsatisfying on the whole upon finishing i was left thinking what was the point i found the ending rather depressing especially eva's story all in all it wasn't terrible but i wouldn't recommend it","372":"interesting characters in this dual tale that connects along the way","373":"strangers in a strange land in a culture they don't understand and where initially they find some welcome but as time goes on that feeling of welcome erodes set in the 1920's and the present day one story of a woman and the other of a man the details of their lives and journeys are very different but at the same time have similarities it brought home that the sense of otherness crosses national boundaries and centuries i would definitely read something by suzanne joinson again","374":"there is nothing wrong with a formula book two stories one in the past and one in the present when it works for the most part this worked however i think the author tried to include too much and left me dissatisfied i wanted to know more about the journey itself and what about irene and how did yemen factor in i don't regret buying it from the remainder table at my bookstore","375":"this book kept showing up on the new books section of the library so i took it as a sign to read it i'm glad i did it is a story which is done in the 1920's and present day three women go to the desert on a missionary trip to convert the families of the area they face many prejudices for being english women and women in general they face many perils taking care of a new born baby one being charged with a death sentence for murder so the locals think of the babies mother evanglina learns her sister elizabeth's secret with millicent the leader of the trio in present day we meet frieda and how she is notified to clear out irene guy's apartment and she finds out who irene is frieda also searches for her mother who left her as a child it starts out slowly but picks ups that you need to finish and i'm glad i did well written story","376":"a bit predictable but still two good stories in one book","377":"loved it wish novel was more about the character actually cycling but it was beautifully written i enjoyed digging further into the characters during book club discussion loved the setting based in the kashgar region felt like i was there","378":"honestly this was not my favorite book but it was worth the listen i was given this book as an audiobook arc this is the second audiobook arc i was given to review but the first one i am going to review the other was so terrible i felt bad reviewing it so i declined the review after only listening to about 15 minutes of it if that since this is an audiobook and the written version has been reviewed a number of times i will focus mainly on the audio part i thought the reader susan duerden had a nice voice to listen too she has a nice accent she didn't mess up reading at all and left long enough pauses between the different time periods that after you caught on you were not lost fyi you do need to pay a lot of attention to this book as it is being read to you since sometimes it can be confusing when time periods are switched i do not listen to an audiobook straight through i listen while cleaning cooking getting dressed exercising so i stop periodically and on a couple of occasions i had to rewind to figure out what voice was speaking at the time it was a very good recording otherwise and i am very well versed in audiobooks having listened to well over 400 over the last several years as with all of my reviews i must inform you that this book has some tough scenes including but not limited to a death scene and a lesbian scene there is quite a bit of talk about and reference to gay sex sex in general is a common theme in this book the modern day woman having had a long time affair with a married man w kids and she doesn't seem to care about the fact that he has a family at all there are quite a few parts of this book that were quite disturbing i would not recommend this book for teenagers at all even though the cover looks fun some adults would enjoy this book but not all it is not a romance and it is not really chick lit either it is most definitely not a mindless fun beach read i received this book as an arc i do not get paid to review books i do so in order to assist you in recognizing books that you might enjoy please read more of my reviews on my blog sarahereads dot wordpress dot com","379":"compelling characterspropels you on with a desire to know how the two alternating stories intersect","380":"looking forward to hearing what my book group buddies have to say","381":"i loved this fictionalized account of 3 female missionaries to western china in the early 1900s oh the blunders they made oh the drama they got themselves involved in oh what fun it was to read for those who want a preview the book is actually written from two time perspectives one is a journal of one of the 3 missionaries and the other is the story of a woman from today who is figuring out her own life is the plot a bit predictable sure but everyone once in a while i need a read that goes according to plan and this one certainly delivered while also providing me a glimpse into the darker side of missionary life","382":"the two narratives was both the thing that kept me reading yet i didn't fully fall into either narrative","383":"interesting back and forth story of two different times 1920's kashgar and current day london at times i couldn't put it down and times felt frustrated by the coincidences interesting book","384":"3 5 starsgoodreads giveaway copytwo time periods two women seemingly unconnected both struggling with their identity and to find their place in the world one a missionary overseas in 1923 the other frieda a young woman abandoned by her mother as a child one day frieda learns she is the sole heir to a house of a woman she doesn't know the tale is beautifully told in alternating voices of frieda and evangelina the missionary though i didn't understand why frieda's story was in the third person i thought first person would have worked evangelina's was the more interesting story the setting in 1923 fascinating the life as a missionary hard and well told though i didn't like either lizzie her sister or millicent their leader frieda's story finding the house learning who the dead woman is who has left it to her how she is connected to her mother was interesting enough but i didn't get caught up in her search for the truth didn't see the point of tayab at all what was he there for overall a nicely constructed story interesting social historical detail but some elements just didn't hit the spot for me","385":"do not be fooled by the cover and title of this book it is very modern in theme and setting overall it is a sad book and sometimes disturbing book many of the characters settle on a half life i hope that frieda steps away from this pattern into a full partnership some homosexual themes are part of this story","386":"reason for reading first off the title attracted me then secondly i was both interested in the location and time period as these are favourite topics of mine a very intriguing story that kept me hooked from start to finish told in two points of view one the first hand account of the diary of eva as she travels through 1920s china as a christian missionary at a time when it is under major muslim upheaval second the third person narrative of a modern day english woman and arab immigrant man who meet surreptitiously and together put their lives back on track i found the historical element entirely gripping and engrossing i always enjoy stories told through journal entries and found joinson has used this device well bringing the reader into not only the time period and the plot but also the geography of a land that no longer exists in today's world i found her detail for description to be just the right amount to bring her world to life without getting bogged down in tedium it is a hot dry thirsty world and was perfect for my time spent reading in the hot days of summer i totally loved the characters in this part of the story as well though not actually personally liking anyone except eva they were all very large as life personalities who brought a tale of religious riot to life on the other hand i found the modern day story somewhat lacking taking up much less space than the other story less time is given to developing the characters and i never felt connected to either frieda or tayeb their story seemed somewhat rushed their connection not quite coherent and honestly freida's story could have been told to greater depths without the tayeb connection this could have allowed the author to concentrate more on the mother daughter theme which runs through the book but got lost and wasn't fulfilled to any great satisfaction freida and tayeb's story was a pleasant diversion though and while i wasn't happy with how it connected to the past it did connect and proved itself in the end for fans of epistolary fiction and historical fiction that concentrates on society and character rather than events","387":"strangely beautiful as exotic as the setting wonderfully woven between time and place can't wait for the movie","388":"i wanted to rate it 1 5 stars one of the stories the one in the past seemed more interesting and the characters were easier to know the present day story left me feeling like i didn't know or care about the characters maybe it was the flip flop of the stories that left me feeling this way can't say for sure all in all the book was hard to get into and felt disjointed i think that if i were to read this ever again i would read every other chapter first so i was actually reading the past story first and the modern day story second","389":"this book left a deep ache in my heart it is beautiful and yet there is a sense of hopelessness laced through its pages","390":"received this book as a gift and it turned out richer than expected the beginning is slow there is promise of action but it is a long build up overall i appreciated this read and while the 'conflict' or revelation was rather irrelevant i enjoyed getting to know the two main characters","391":"i won my copy from goodreads first reads","392":"1923 eva and her sister are missionaries to kashgar eva's diary is found in present day london by her grandaughter this is a story of cultural generational and religeous differences i was a little disappointed the story was dark and slow","393":"a nice diversion the book contains 2 stories which occur in different time periods there is one story about a woman who travels to kashgar a city in china which now borders tajikistan and turkmenistan evangeline english is on this journey as a missionary traveling with her younger sister and an older woman who purports to be very committed tot the church evangeline is not terribly religious herself and is more keenly aware of their surroundings her sister elizabeth seems to be following their older companion millicent eva has decided to write a book about their travels to kashgar in a guide by the same name as this novel she has brought her bike and originally sees that as a central topic of her book the first story takes place in the 1920s the second story takes place in modern day england when a young woman in a troubled relationship with a married man little family to speak of and on her return from an international trip receives a letter which has come to her while she was gone in which she is listed as the next of kin to a woman she has never heard of it seemed obvious to me after a short time how these two stories would merge but the novel was still entertaining i am amazed at the bravery of the women who went to kashgar bravery or foolishness who knows","394":"an enjoyable read although it took me a while to warm to it it was interesting to read the other reviews as it seems like there is a definite split between those who warmed to the character in the present and those who liked the earlier story and characters more personally i warmed to frieda in the current day story the most although the missionaries story was a fascinating one","395":"20th april 2013received a free copy of this as i won this book through goodreads first read program giveaways i am currently reading another book but will read and review this as soon as possible thanks for your giveaway 13th may 2013i love the blue cover on the version i have the silhouetted figure with the gorgeous blue background and the shimmering blue feathers around the top edges would be much more likely to catch my eye if seen in a bookshop read a few sections in the book alternates between 1923 and evangeline eva travelling in kashgar and present day in london with freida having read a couple sections of each time i am more interested and intrigued by the kashgar storyline so far but that may be because more has happened to draw you into that side of the book straight off and life in kashgar is a mystery to myself as a reader compared to london storyline 1st september 2013i have dipped in and out of this book between other reading for several months now i think it's time to sadly admit defeat and give up i'm not quite sure where this book went wrong for me but it just hasn't caught my attention enough to keep me reading for more than a few pages at a time which in turn has made it long winded reading and become more of a chore i managed about a third of the book i am now going to pass onto a friend in australia via bookcrossing hopefully she will like more than me follow its bookcrossing journey here http www bookcrossing com journal 1","396":"reading an advanced reader copy finished tonight very good read lots of errors in the galley from time to time but not enough to distract from the very skillful narrative","397":"read it in less than 24 hours couldn't put it down","398":"half way through i had no idea how two seemingly independent stories one past tale of 3 women missionaries in kashgar and a modern day tale of an illegal immigrant in london would blend together didn't hold my interest enough to keep going sorry to say","399":"other worldly and evocative","400":"liked this book overall but liked the 1920's the best","401":"this is a truly awesome historical novel which successfully bridges both past and present in a unique parallel structure i highly recommend it","402":"interesting astonishing epic 2 stories combined colonial era travel and a modern story 2 women stories travelling in different times 1923 and now a days","403":"the book is two stories or perhaps even three woven together in 1923 eva english and her sister accompany millicent a missionary to kashgar a predominantly muslim area eva writes of their experiences there in twenty first century london frieda learns she has inherited the estate of irene guy a relative she knew nothing about she and a new acquaintance tayeb a yemeni immigrant set about to find out exactly who irene guy is somehow this just didn't resonate with me the beginning was promising but after that i thought it fell flat it was interesting enough to finish but not one i would recommend to many people i also wish there had been more at the end about a few of the characters","404":"i am not sure how to classify this book and while there is rarely any bike ridden in the course of the manuscript the story does meander along with all the speed and grace of a long bicycle ride allowing the reader close glimpses into vignettes passed along the way this is indeed the beauty of this book the two stories one set in the 1920's in kashgar and the other in england currently intertwine in some obvious ways others not so much what on the surface are several storylines of a journey interrupted also forces the reader to take a hard look at the masks we wear at times lyrical and beautiful at times harsh and painful to read a lady cyclist takes you on an unexpected journey don't expect rapidfire pacing take the journey slow the way you would on a bicycle","405":"eva and her sisters embark on an exotic and exciting trip to kashgar during the early 1900's the trip takes a sudden turn almost immediately when the three ladies are placed under house arrest while the death of a local woman is investigated eva still has some freedom and can explore the area on her bicycle which she hopes will help fuel her with stories to complete a travel book interspersed with eva's tale is the story of frieda living in modern day london she has mysteriously inherited the contents of a flat from a person she has neither met nor heard of slowly but surely the two stories wind together this was a pleasant book to read i very much enjoyed the descriptions of the areas that eva traveled to i also enjoyed frieda's story as it unfolded and drew closer to the world of eva while the first half of the book was lighter and warm the second half was exciting and filled with dangerous situations","406":"3 5 actually two stories the first in 1923 in turkestan and the second in the present the first story started quickly with millicent an dictatorial missionary and two sisters stranded in kasgar the second story started out slower but i ended up liking it more loved the history the clashes between christians and muslims as well as the political climate under a chinese ruled turkistan frieda and tayeb were my favorite characters and both stories highlighted the importance of family history as well as trying to break culture barriers when you are a stranger to that country beautifully written this was a most interesting and different read arc from netgalley","407":"what a fascinating story and interesting characters i loved the cultural interactions both in the story told in the present as well as those told in the diary from 1923 unfortunately the author doesn't tie up loose ends the way that i would have liked her to i also thought that she threw in odd facts that were unnecessary such as why certain characters can't speak i'm being vague so as not to create a spoiler or what the significance and history of the owl was i wanted this book to be spectacular it could have been this was a unique book with exposure to parts of the world i knew nothing about and has wonderful characters but it could have used another round of editing and more background information on some characters tayeb as an example lots of small pieces are given but not enough to make show how interesting he really is until late in the book and vague info is given as to why he has found himself where he is at the beginning of the book so all in all i have great admiration for ms joinson's knowledge of these remote areas and the complexities of their situations but i couldn't live this book the way that i wished i could","408":"a stunning debut multi layered narrative deftly handled characters eras and ends of the world neatly bridged full of memorable language and unforgettable images after a slowish start builds to a tremendous crescendo highly recommended","409":"i have long been fascinated by central asia and a novel promising to depict intrepid british women cycling in these seldom visited places in the 1920s was too much to resist and the novel delivered fully on this promise we first meet millicent lizzie and evangeline as they are on a journey to identify a site for a christian mission in turkestan an area that incorporates modern day turkmenistan kazakhstan kirgizstan uzbekistan tajikistan and the uighur region of china they interrupt their journey in kashgar to deliver a very young girl of her baby in the process the young girl dies and the baby lives the three missionary women are duly arrested on suspicion of killing the girl yet they are left to care for the newborn baby girl under house arrest they learn of the political upheaval going on all around them they befriend a drunken italian priest who seems to fly under the political radar as the only friendly european voice they welcome him into their lives despite dire warnings from their sponsor a mr steyning based in urumqi there are wonderful subtexts we infer that millicent is lesbian and that lizzie is attracted to her meanwhile evangeline who narrates the story also seems drawn to millicent thus we start to question their various motivations for being out in the desert this story is interleaved with a strange modern day story of frieda a widely travelled researcher who finds a strange yemeni man outside the door to her flat alongside elaborate graffiti of bird feathers this man tayeb seems to be on the run from the immigration authorities and conveniently frieda has been given the keys to a council flat as the next of kin to a deceased woman irene guy frieda has a week to go through the flat take what she wants and the rest will be cleared and the flat re let the second story is weaker frieda is not as well drawn as evangeline and at times it feels rather contrived but most of all modern day norwood simply doesn't feel as evocative as 1920s turkestan for the first half of the novel this story feels like an unwelcome intruder and its link with kashgar is unclear there is a reveal where things come together and it is well done but it isn't quite clear that the story as a whole has a point to it on its own the kashgar story might have been short but it had an internal consistency it was a study of dislocation and clash of cultures it had elements of the innocent abroad but frieda's story feels like a bookending device that will make things feel profound whilst not actually adding much it is a minor thing but it just stops the novel from quite achieving brilliance because actually for the most part it is very close to brilliance the atmosphere is real the descriptions are luminous and when there is suspense and thrill it is well controlled a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is a terrific debut and well worth persevering through some initial confusion the momentum really does build","410":"two inter connected stories one present day london one set in 1923 the connection was fuzzy at first just tantalizing glimmers freida brought up by free love parents and abandoned by her mother befriends a homeless yemeni man she inherits the possessions of a stranger named irene guy whom authorities insist is a relative among irene's possessions is a 1923 diary of evangeline english a young missionary in the kashgar region where china russia tibet and mongolia meet","411":"marvelous adventure self discovery relationships mother daughter and romantic exotic locales as a reader i enjoyed discovering the link between the two time periods and how the characters were connected","412":"throughly enjoyable read far more enjoyable than i expected and some nice twists which if thought about you can work out","413":"i loved how the past and present are interwoven in this book and i often found myself wanting to find out more about each protagonists story each time a chapter would change i was tempted to skip ahead but found myself feeling this way regardless of whether i was reading about the past or the present it was an adventure i was glad to join in on","414":"i'm not sure what i expected from the title but this book wasn't entirely what i thought it would be in some good ways and bad the concept is an excellent one and the way the two time strands are brought together is done well there are themes that dance across the ages showing that some things alienation love loss are always part of the human experience however i felt i didn't enjoy the book as much as i could as the characters were not entirely fleshed out i found it difficult to become invested in the fate of any of them save tayeb perhaps overall though it is a promising debut and i would like to see what else suzanne joinson writes","415":"there were some good characters in this book but the story was very choppy actually it was 2 stories 1923 and present day but there were too many details left undone and the weaving of the two stories never really got off the ground","416":"this was a great book overall it is two stories in one that eventually we find out are intertwined the characters are humanly flawed and interesting the ending was disappointing though it felt like the author had used up her allotment of words and ended abruptly i'd love to read other books by suzanne joinson","417":"it wasn't what i thought it would be but i liked it","418":"i wish this book had been just that tiny bit better the multiple or even as in this case just dual pov narrative seems to be the structure du jour these days and can be effective or it can have pitfalls one important aspect is sustaining interest in both or several story lines this novel alternates between 1923 kashgar and present day london the kashgar sequences are riveting and extremely evocative of place and time the london episodes are curiously uninvolving perhaps because both the main characters in that time line seem passive drifting through their lives and pretty much unchanged at the end the connection between the two story lines is set up as a mystery but really there is no great surprise at the outcome i wanted to know more about both the present day protagonists and wanted a greater sense of closure for the 1923 character the kashgar sequences kept me reading but the novel as a whole felt like a lot of potential that is never quite fulfilled","419":"this is one of the most enjoyable novels i have read in a long time it tells two stories eva's and freida's in alternating chapters this is among my favorite of narrative styles so i was greatly pleased also i loved the fact that eva's story was told in a rather obscure location and time period western china in the 1920's freida while in modern day london still is exploring different cultures both in her personal in professional life and that really is what i feel this story is about both parts of the story explore the differences in culture and if they could possibly mesh this was such a complex story all of the details which you think are irrelevant combine and are woven into a wonderful ending only thing i would change if i could would be the occasional strong language this is something which fairly conservative readers might want to be cautious about many thanks to netgalley and bloomsbury usa for a chance to read this book for review","420":"i read this because i liked the title i'm am avid cyclist it really wasn't much about cycling though it has a back and forth thing going 1923 4 to present day two separate stories that eventually coalesce no spoiler alert needed on that the older story is that of two sisters and a missionary woman who travel to a very remote area in turkestan to set up a mission right off the bat they get in trouble with the local muslims because they find a young girl 11 or 12 by the side of the road in the throes of childbirth the missionary woman delivers the baby with forceps but the girl dies she is then charged with murder and the child is thrust upon the three their quite dismal story continues back and forth with a present day woman frieda who has troubles of her own the present day woman is remarkably like the author observation it seems that nearly all the british novels i've read in the 21st century have common threads lots of muslim characters lots of hippie raised characters disintegrating or non existent family structure homosexuality adultery amorality hopelessness quite a jane austen bizarro world","421":"great interweaving of a present day woman and a woman in the 1920s who goes on an ill fated missionary trip to china another excellent use of anticipation wanting to know what comes next note to self interesting reference to the freedom biking brings to eva when she flees the country she doesn't want to leave the bike p 307 i did not tell her that it was my shield and my method of escape or that since the first time i pedalled and felt the freedom of cycling i've known that it is the closest one can get to flying","422":"a pleasant read like the way the writer moves between present and past and her prose alternates smoothly","423":"i read this for book club the book structure contains two parallel stories the first set in 1923 is documented by way of a diary eva is a young single woman who follows her sister and another missionary leader to kashgar in north east china modern day turkmenistan eva's belief is a pretense in order to escape her boring life back in england and she intends to write a travel book about the region her sister is devout but the pair under the guidance of the nefarious hard line millicent are out of their depth the book begins with the birth of a child by a roadside in the region millicent takes it upon herself to help the mother deliver the baby despite her help the mother dies in child birth angering the natives who accuse the ladies of witch craft the second story is set in modern day london it follows frieda also a young single woman making her way in the world she comes across tayeb an undocumented yemeni film maker who is sleeping on her doorstep and graffiting the walls with arabic calligraphy frieda is bequeathed the contents of flat by a mysterious benefactor despite a promising start the story didn't make much of an impression on me it has a similar structure to the english patient the parallel story informing the present day a diary used to tell the story etc yet it wasn't exciting the characters aren't developed enough on the whole the gay characters are cast as sexual predators there is one good gay character the protagonist doesn't act she prevaricates despite being the sole charge in some critical situations the author who works for the british council i'm sure that didn't hurt when it came to finding a publisher carried out a lot of research for this book but it's not in evidence page after page of tedious colonial stuffiness wore me down the scene where one of the protagonists meets her mother is too convenient it was readable but didn't set my imagination on fire","424":"i liked the book but it was so much darker than the title suggests i can't help thinking that the title and the whole cycling guide part were tacked on later by a publisher trying to find a way to market it they just didn't mesh with the tone of the rest of the story which was otherwise quite good","425":"an incredible first novel by british writer suzanne joinson from the eastern stretches of the silk road in the early 1920s to london present day this was a journey through time relationships cultures and religions it was an unexpected find at the library for me and i definitely recommend it","426":"i was drawn to this book because of my interest in kashgar and uyghur turki people however i find the historical inaccuracies in the book way too distracting the statements no churchman has ever set foot in this area and that there was only one european in kashgar are completely wrong by then 1920s the swedish church had a well established missionary station in kashgar since many years as well as in several other towns in the area the missionaries also did a significant amount of medical work they were midwives doctors nurses and worked in daro chanas established medical treatment facilities and pharmacies how on earth she could have transported her bicycle any further than andijan over the mountains to kashgar in the 1920s is beyond my understanding making even the title impossible as far as i understand the old turki did not have multiple wives living together they sometimes married several times but often got divorced as well rather than having a harem of wives i am also of the understanding that they did not wear abayas but rather horse hair veils and often the words of the turki language that the author uses appear wrong and more like arabic rather than turki etc etc etc i was surprised that the author did not research these things the story set in london was much more captivating than the one in kashgar despite my interest in turki culture if you come across a translated version of from your sister lovisa by maria gustavsdotter this is a much more accurate and intriguing account of the lives of western people venturing to kashgar in the early 1900s","427":"a strange book could not get into it at all scimmed through it hoping it would get better to no avail lucky it was a short read really a 1 5","428":"this was ok nothing special the story has two narratives and i continued the book to see how they would connect","429":"sort of strange but interesting","430":"this novel is a bit difficult for me to rate i ended up giving it four stars but after a decent beginning it nosedived for me until it picked up again during the last third of the book the book has two simultaneous stories one in present day britain the other in 1923 that moves from britain to kashgar which much to my surprise was in china it sounded like india to me the two stories alternate throughout the book until it all comes together in the end for a while i was enjoying the present day story more than the past story which is unusual for me give me the past any old day i found myself to be a bit puzzled by the past story because at times in the middle i couldn't tell what was going on and what people's motivations were but at the end both stories picked up the pace and i found myself enjoying it by the way there is very little cycling in the story especially in kashgar and i was disappointed that even though the map in the front of the book shows a little figure of a woman on a bicycle eva's journey is by local transportation","431":"2 5 stars i picked this one up at the library based on the title and cover i was in a bit of a reading slump and this is not something i would normally read it reminded me a bit of m m kaye's death in kashmir although it is nothing like that book the book was fine but i was reading for the sake of reading rather than a compelling desire to finish or find out what happens in the end i didn't really care about the characters or what they were doing and none of things i actually wanted to know about were in the story like what eva's journey must have really been like as she tried to make it home","432":"strange almost like you are in the deserts on the verge of heat stroke reading this novel i really wanted to know what happened to the baby evangeline found and the story of frieda","433":"i really liked this book towards the end i felt that it might have plateaued a bit but i had no problem finishing it none the less","434":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is two stories alternating in 1923 evangeline eva is traveling with her sister lizzie and another woman named millicent they are missionaries and have arrived in the city of kashgar lizzie and millicent are both very enthusiastic about their religious duties but eva is not she comes with a green bicycle and a commission from a publisher to write a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar the second story is in present day england frieda a young woman comes home from one of her numerous international trips to find a man sleeping outside her door she gives him a blanket and pillow and in the morning finds a beautiful drawing of a bird she befriends the yemenese tayeb and when she inherits the contents of an apartment belonging to a woman she never heard of they embark on an unexpected journey together there's a sense of religious fanaticism in eva's story millicent is consumed by her desire to convert and lizzie is drawn in as well i think joinson portrayed that aspect really well i enjoyed both stories though i think i preferred eva's story both eva and frieda are intelligent independent minded young women and i admired them the writing style wasn't anything special though there were lots of flashbacks as eva frieda and tayeb remembered something about their past i enjoyed this novel and i'm glad i checked it out at the library for me it wouldn't be worth buying","435":"the premise and the first third of this book were very promising but the transitions between the past and present times seemed really clunky and made it hard to switch back and forth and to stay interested in either timeline the end of the book seemed to fizzle and felt like it was put together so hurriedly just to get the book overwith","436":"i quite liked this book but it was not at all what i was expecting from the title and the back cover i was expecting something quite light and this got dark pretty quickly both in the historical portion and the modern part of the book there are so many things that are lightly touched on here religion sexuality colonialism honour killings missionaries etc very little about any cycling though she did cart the bicycle half way round the world","437":"i found this book fascinating and compelling but also felt it was let down by some slightly naive writing nevertheless i look forward to seeing what joinson comes out with next","438":"this was so close to a good story but it's coming together just remained elusive the two story lines one of eva in 1945 and one of frieda in present times seemed so disconnected and while i'd figured out the link and how they were related fairly early on there didn't seem to be much meaningful correlation the book left me feeling strange i couldn't quite put my finger on it but now i realised it made me feel lonely both eva and frieda are strong females but the sense of their loneliness is profound and lasting even the secondary characters like frieda's mother or eva's sister lizzie are not only bitterly lonely but they are very weak too i don't mind feelings of loneliness but it seemed hollow and unexplained tayyab was such an interesting character and could really have been developed so much more it wasn't a complete waste reading it but it's not a memorable book in any way","439":"i found this very strange and the characters unbelievable story is intriguing however","440":"two stories one historical and one contemporary are slowly twisted together in this fascinating tale of two young women uniquely linked by place and circumstance","441":"told in dual time lines a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar tells the story of two women evangeline in 1923 and frieda in the present day at first it's unclear how the two women are connected but that eventually comes to light slowly as the story unfolds eva lies to become a missionary using it as a cover to write a book a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar armed with her bicycle and notebook eva is ready to change her world however the story opens with things taking a wrong turn for eva and her compatriots and she finds herself figuring out ways to keep herself and her sister lizze alive in the present day frieda returns home from months away to find she has inherited an apartment and its belongings from a woman who has passed away - a women she has never met she finds unexpected help from tayeb a man who can't go back to yemen his homeland finding him on her doorstep one night frieda hands him a blanket and a pillow and thus starts an interesting relationship the story went back and forth between 1923 and the present day and i didn't find it disrupted at all even though i was still wondering how these women were connected almost halfway through the book the differences in the two women were evident eva was a young woman who had goals and knew what she wanted out of life and went for it frieda was doing a job she wanted but in reality the life she created for herself was probably her rebelling against the life she grew up with with her parents it wasn't until the end of the book that i think frieda started to figure out who she really was i skimmed a few reviews before reading this and saw some people had issue with the ending and felt that the last part of the book felt rushed so i prepared myself but i didn't have a problem with any of it for me the ending was fine i'm not a huge fan of the definite 'the end' endings because in reality life goes on even after the last word on the page","442":"it was a good book not great with an interesting story line it reads pretty quickly","443":"a tribute to all those adventurous victorian women","444":"the writing is good but after 100 pages the book just wasn't keeping my interest the characters are too emotionally distant to feel involved while the past present perspectives are interesting there's too little moving forward to maintain interest a pity because i had high hopes for this book but i'm just not interested enough to see where the story goes","445":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar tells the parallel stories of evangeline or eva a missionary in the 1920s and frieda a modern day woman living in london their stories while different merge as we see one beginning a generational habit that the other looks to break this book was not at all what i expected and not in a good way the description on the jacket is completely misleading and i was really disappointed in what i found while the final chapters bring a sense of redemption to the uncomfortable revelations of the previous ones it just couldn't make up for the dislike i felt so many modern fiction writers seem to follow a similar formula that includes shocking sexual encounters that lack a purpose in the overall arc of the story while lacking in authenticity i'm not surprised any more when i run into writers that use this and i tend to become dismissive i wish the author had spent more time in describing the exotic setting and her characters' abrupt introduction to that setting i think that would have made for a more interesting story instead we have to labor through something that i think is just too familiar one aspect that joinson really grabbed me with though was eva's journey through unexpected motherhood becoming a mother myself has made me much more attuned to scenes that involve parents and children and i appreciated the realistic process the character went through other than that this was a disappointing read for me that left me yearning for something more real than and independent of what is so common","446":"it grew on me interesting to see a new part of the world","447":"the best book i read in the summer of 2012 surprising and educational with two good storylines the historical one being further developed than that of the modern day lots of interesting characters and a real life setting that i'd never even heard of before kashgar","448":"file this book under reminder of why we don't judge a book by its cover i really wanted to love this book because even the title has three words i love lady cyclist and kashgar however not a single character elicited either interest or sympathy from me in fact at a certain point i found myself almost screaming yes i get it everyone is gay can we move on yet utter loss","449":"beautifully written although this reminds me of the kashmir shawl it is a much better book the link between the past and the present is explored in the two parallel stories and the strong women characters shine through","450":"the parallel stories of eva and lizzie in 1923 and frieda in present day london offer a neat too tidy contrast the connection between the two narrative arcs was easy to discern the impatience waiting for the characters themselves to realize the ties was more than offset by the fascinating and evocative 1923 side of the story to be a missionary particularly one in kashgar under false pretenses presented a host of challenges that became more so as local tribal conflicts intensified the striking innocence of eva as she encounters inscrutable relationships is juxtaposed with her larger awareness of safety issues and the motherhood that is thrust upon her of all the characters frieda took the longest to thaw but she herself was deeply puzzled if not outright mystified by her own upbringing simultaneously rebelling against and imitating that same life in the end there is hope for frieda can she live a life as rich as eva did only time will tell","451":"i won this book in a firstreads giveaway the story is split between two women frieda in present day london and eva in 1923 and her travels each chapters moves from one story to the other both women are very similar they are keen cyclists with a desire to travel eva accompanies her sister and the mission leader to kashgar to convert the locals to christianity they are met with resistance and trouble befalls them disaster after disaster occurs for them all the while eva works on her book a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar the sections written for eva are composed of journal entries letters and telegrams frieda a young woman who feels lost in her life meets a man sleeping outside her door in the hallway of her apartment block and they become friends after a series of unusual events including an owl frieda's journey while not as long in miles are time as eva's brings clarity and understanding to her life the book is very well written and i really felt at times as if i too were in kashgar a truly great read","452":"i wanted to like this novel more than i did the story alternates between the present day and 1923 and neither tale came fully alive for me a trio of female missionaries in central asia runs into trouble when they try to help a young girl give birth in contemporary london a rootless woman learns she has inherited the contents of a council flat i enjoyed the story of frieda and her developing friendship with a yemeni immigrant but it took too long to make the connection between her tale and the missionaries every time the story traveled back to 1923 i found myself wishing those chapters away i kept thinking i would quit reading but then some little surprise would occur and i would keep going i don't recommend this for everyone but if the story appeals to you maybe read a few chapters to check it out","453":"i had a little trouble getting into this one at first but by about halfway through i was riveted written in lush haunting prose this novel captures perfectly the peculiar sensation of not fitting in in any culture","454":"i was riveted by this book it time travels between eva who travels to the ancient city kashgar as a missionary in 1923 and the present day reporter frieda who resides london and reports on the situation in muslim countries how these women's lives eventually merge skillfully evolves and joinson's writing is magically descriptive","455":"i made it to page 120 and couldn't read anymore there was not one character in this novel that i cared about for me there has to be a connection good or bad love or hate with the main character or at least one of the characters i just could not get involved at all","456":"the map at the beginning of the book suggests the heroine rode her bicycle all over central asia which is extremely misleading she spends 3 4 of the book in one city in any case it was fine another book that flips between the past and present with every chapter","457":"this one didn't suck me in until close to the middle of the book and i didn't care about the characters i have seen a lot of marketing that this is a readlike for the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society but only if the appeal is a unique setting this galley is from netgalley a lady's cyclist's guide to kashgar","458":"i thought this book was a bit...pointless i personally am not a fan of books with more than one pov i find it jarring to be flipping back and forth in time i would rather have read one story or the other but really neither was terribly gripping i wouldn't bother if i were you","459":"this is a tale that takes you to another country in the early 1900's and present day the decisions made lead to some life changing consequences","460":"i enjoyed this book a lot but it ended too suddenly","461":"story of a 1923 missionary and 2 friends sisters that is a bit preposterous gay couple later a male gay couple lots of complications in turkestan story alternates with modern story of woman and a man she meets who is arab and in england illegally lots to this story","462":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is a book told in two times on one hand you have sisters lizzie and eva as missionaries whose mission has gone awry on the other you have frieda in present day london there is of course a connection between the two stories but it doesn't come together until the end there were a lot of things that i liked about the book first i really liked the setting especially in the historical story kashgar is a very old city on the silk road you get a great picture of what it looks like and what the people in the book are like you don't get as much of a sense of what frieda's london is about there are also a couple different themes this first is religion lizzie and eva are missionaries lizzie is incredibly religious eva is much more interested in writing a bicycle guide for kashgar i really wish that the author explained a little bit more about lizzie and millicent's the leader of the mission hypocrisy there is so much material there and i definitely think that it could make things a little bit stronger i did like the connection between the two stories but you could definitely see what the ending was i wish that we would have learned a little more about frieda's family i thought the connections could have had more detail i liked this book but there were so many places where i think it would have been nice to have a little more","463":"i really liked this book it is not a book about cycling","464":"i quite liked this book well written interesting story and although one eventually figures out where it is all going it doesn't quite matter because the author has something a bit deeper to say good reads has posted this decent video from bloomsbury with the author http bit ly 1mkswe9 recommended for a relaxing yet enjoyable read at home at the beach or on an airplane","465":"i wouldn't recommend this book to my friends there was little about cycling one of the characters writes a book about cycling in the middle east western china in the 1920s but there's very little cycling not enough for her to write a book about i almost stopped reading the book several times in the first half finally became intrigued at page 150 or so 287 pages in the book the ending ties up the storylines a bit but doesn't really work for me parts of the book are very well written with great descriptions but the plot needs a lot of work","466":"this was a good book interesting but somewhat confusing to me","467":"loved loved this two stories separated in time bit of genius really","468":"this book igives a look into a time of missionaries travelling to exotic places perhaps this is a bit different because it is a story of time travel through diaries and attests to the fact that missionaries the people themselves disn't always succeed in making converts personal discoveries about weaknesses and strengths and dealing with hardships of travel as wellmas revolts all the while trying to maintain an identity with the life left behind in europ and returning to it intersting reading though it is a novel depicting life on the road","469":"eva is going on a grand adventure with her sister lizzie and her acquaintance millicent they are traveling to kashgar as missionaries it's a treacherous road for 3 women in the 1920's but eva is determined to make the best of it while she is traveling eva is writing a guide for cycling to kashgar back in the present freida is a world traveler she loves the freedom of being able to leave and experience so many wonderful places soon though she meets tayeb a man trying to avoid deportation to his native yemen she also learns that she is responsible for an apartment full of stuff left to her by a person she has never met the tales of freida tayeb and eva all intermingle as they each work their way through their separate adventures this book wasn't at all what i expected there are two main stories and it is unclear how they are related for quite a bit i loved the way they tied in but i wish the author had dropped a few more clues along the way i had kind of figured it out but the payoff felt a little late for me i loved the feel of the book though eva is basically using the mission and missionaries for a chance to see the world i thought she was a great character freida and tayeb were a bit more difficult to get a feeling for i also felt like their story had slightly less resolution too i was very interested in their stories though i was really drawn into this book and there were some great surprises too millicent was perhaps the most interesting person in the book i really wanted some more back story on her although it really wouldn't have fit in the context of the story when things were finally brought together in the end it was nice to see it all make sense overall i found this to be a really absorbing and fascinating story galley provided for review","470":"i can actually describe this book in one word--odd odd characters doing odd things and saying odd things that wasn't always a bad thing but most of the time it was puzzling and distracting there are two stories told in alternating chapters in a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar one is the journal of evangeline english who has accompanied her sister lizzie and a zealous missionary named millicent no doubt the oddest character of all on a proselytizing trip to kashgar turkestan in 1923 the other story is about frieda an unhappy woman in present day london who is bequeathed the contents of a house by a person she doesn't even know these two stories will of course come together by the end i was sucked in by the title and cover of this book the setting was interesting but it gets off to an odd and disturbing start when the missionaries come upon a ten year old girl giving birth in the desert millicent delivers the baby who survives but then she's charged with the murder of the mother in what is the first implausible part of the book--these missionaries are given the baby to take care of despite the fact they've been charged with the mother's murder this is a spoiler i know but it occurs in the first chapter so i hope you'll forgive me the implausibility continues into present day london when frieda invites a strange man who has been sleeping in the hallway of her building into her flat and then into her life supposedly frieda is a smart successful career woman are we to believe that she would do something so incredibly risky and stupid after that rousing start the story slows down to the pace of life in the desert i was bored and about to give up but the excitement and suspense picked up about three quarters of the way through your call whether or not you want to stick with it until then although eva frieda and tayeb are fairly well developed characters millicent and lizzie are disappointingly one dimensional millicent is just crazed and evil and she's clearly bewitched lizzie in more ways than one poor vulnerable lizzie flits around with her camera clueless to the dangers of the people around her and the environment she's in both are odd odd odd and difficult to figure out i won't give any more examples of anyone's odd behavior because the good part of all this oddness is that you have no idea what people are going to do or say the author chose to include some odd bits in the story that i don't believe have any relevance whatsoever tayeb suffers from eczema and we get to hear all about his itching and scratching the question is why this has no significance to the story author joinson has created odd hippy parents for frieda again why the only point to this is to throw in lots of detail about the hippyish way frieda was raised it wasn't necessary lastly i probably shouldn't be so nit picky but detail is important to me these characters say a lot of very odd things here are some examples eva is holding a cat \"...it was like embracing a cat that simply wants to die \" i've owned several cats throughout my life and i've never picked one up and sensed it wanted to die a lawyer is surprised when frieda asks him who bequeathed the contents of the house to her \"he looked to frieda as though he only ever ate homemade sandwiches and perhaps occasionally soup \" the meaning of this completely escapes me tayeb is out for a walk \"nodding peace be with you to the seagull he watched every morning hula hooping like a fool against the threat of rain \" i just can't envision a seagull hula hooping therein lies my biggest problem with this book the author tries just too hard to write in a clever creative unusual fashion other readers may think she's succeeded i think the book is simply odd","471":"eva has a hidden agenda when she and her sister sign up to be missionaries to the far east in the early 1920s she plans to bring her bicycle and write a guide for ladies who would like to explore this part of the world as a cyclist little did she imagine that a muslim chinese rebellion would surface shortly after they arrive or that they would be charged with murder after helping deliver a newborn from a very young mother who then dies from complications of childbirth parallel to eva's story is frieda's who lives in current day england and who has been bequeathed an apartment with all of its contents from a woman she does not know the two stories are brought together in an engaging fashion it's interesting to see the cycles that are repeated in all the women's lives","472":"i will admit it took me a while to really get into this book initially the back and forth between current day and the early 1900s seemed a bit disjointed however by the end of the book i was completely enthralled and i wished that it didn't have to end johnson has a beautiful illustrative form of writing richly depicting the foreign lands and cultures i was also intrigued by the idea that missionary service may have been an outlet by which gay individuals could live an unmarried lifestyle in a socially acceptable manner back in those times in a delightful read and i will look forward to johnson's upcoming works i did receive a free copy of the book in exchange for this honest review","473":"you'll really want to travel after reading this book fascinating interesting hard to put down with a slightly disappointing ending i thought it was hurried but a great read","474":"jumpy slow not for me","475":"a very enjoyable tale of interconnecting women's lives a 'coming to terms' story as frieda understands why her family is like it is beautifully written not a single word is wasted","476":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is the debut book for author suzanne joinson and as such it is a pretty good effort the book is told from two perspectives one in the early 1900s and the other in current time at first this made the book seem very disjointed to me especially since there seemed to be two stories going on in the present day but as the story unfolded it became clear that the three stories were related and would ultimately join into one story from the start i enjoyed the current day story of frieda a londoner who travels extensively in the middle east unfortunately i found the story from the earlier time period a bit disjointed and hard to follow the earlier story centers around three women missionaries who are living in kashgar as it begins they find themselves in an unusual and dangerous situation which is only made worse by their attempts at conversion the plot set up has all the requirements of a great story about a little known time and place unfortunately while the story is good it does not deliver the hoped for greatness to begin with the characters of the missionaries although quirky seem somewhat lackluster in addition what i felt would be the most interesting part of the story was totally glossed over it says something that the most enjoyable part of the book was the completely ordinary story of frieda in current day london i would have loved to have seen the author right a more compelling story that focused on the quirks and relationships of the missionary women and or the situation that bound them to kashgar all in all a good book but it could have been great","477":"i really enjoyed this book lots of adventure and excitement","478":"icky the main narrator is stuck for 80% of the book so there is no cyclist until nearly the end so why bother putting in a map and surprise everyone is gay surprise s whatever this book was just plain boring blah blah with sudden bits of grotesqueness","479":"bah two stories intertwined modern one relatively interesting and 100 year old one supposed to be filled with intrigue mystery other cultures but ultimately flat i would have put this down but was on flights so powered through didn't learn about other cultures specifically no bike adventures and really no bike story in the thing other than as a token element of western women in an eastern environment would not recommend","480":"strangely interesting saw positive review in the post not much about bicycling but 2 interesting plots which join predictably at the end","481":"if you think you are going to learn about the silk road or have an adventure forget it pass this book on by","482":"to start i do think this book was closer to 3 5 stars than four but deserving of being rounded up rather than down i enjoyed the book from the beginning but found it to become truly compelling about halfway through two things this book did for me was make me realize my relationship with my mother could be a whole lot worse and make me grateful that the only married man i am in love with is my husband","483":"i started reading this novel out of curiosity for the title but very soon i was completely captivated by the two stories one situated in the early 1920s the other contemporary two missionary sisters eva and lizzie and their strong willed leader millicent get stuck in kashgar a muslim town on the old china silk route in modern day london frieda a world travelling journalist mostly in islamic countries is confronted with a legacy of a family member she never knew with the help of a yemeni man she will try to unravel the secrets of her past very compelling and captivating historical novel evoking the meaning of home family ties cultural barriers and the hidden power of sexual dynamics","484":"would really rate this 3 5 thought the beginning was slow once the parts tied together it was more interesting","485":"another coupling of parallel stories the first being that of three women missionaries travelling in kashgar at a time of backlash towards europeans trying to convert muslims the second strand follows a disaffected woman and an illegal alien whose paths cross and set out an adventure of discovery needless to add the two stories merge in an interesting crossroads each story line was interesting but i could not invest in any of the characters","486":"really slow start but a satisfying ending","487":"i love the premise of the novel and got an early read through netgalley only read a small part so far but hope for more reading time in the next couple of weeks so far it's very good my netgalley time ran out before i could finish reading the book too much life got in the way i hate it when that happens i had read about half the book and really was enjoying it i'm looking forward to publication so i can finish reading it it's just the type of fiction i enjoy interesting characters in an interesting place having to come to terms with a completely unfamiliar culture the time split was beginning to add another element of interest with the contemporary character having the journal lady cyclist's guide this is just the type of novel i think would be of interest to our customers i will definitely make it a staff recommendation marked it as read although i need to finish it","488":"i read this a few years ago the title was just so irresistible and intriguing to me and i enjoyed it very much i should reread it to give a proper review","489":"i do my ratings based on how much i enjoyed reading the book and i enjoyed this one very much an engrossing plot interesting characters and a few surprises along the way","490":"an interesting story about a part of the world that was almost unknown to me a young english girl heads into a desert area to serve as a missionary along the way she discovers that people are not always what they appear to be intertwined with the historical novel portion of the book is the story of a modern english girl who inherits a mysterious collection of old letters and dairies with the help of a new friend who literally appears on her doorstep one evening she discovers a family secret i really enjoyed this book","491":"i actually give this 3 5 starsan interesting book weaves two stories into one i would have liked to have had a few more answers about the characters in the book and a stronger ending what did the mission know about millicent what exactly did millicent and the priest do that made everyone say they were bad i would have liked a bit more info on the end of eva's life than just those few letters","492":"this was an interesting story i enjoyed the historical insight into the region","493":"i enjoyed this the modern story more than the story set in the twenties mostly because the very presence of the western characters in the kashgar region made me uncomfortable the book was well written and that quality carried me through the parts i found less comfortable it also made me think a little","494":"the plots in both the past world and the present world it flips between worlds each chapter moved along at a good pace which is a major determinant of whether or not i'll like a book as i've mentioned in other reviews i'm a little sick of clever literary devices like flipping between past and present from chapter to chapter can't we just write some books that start at the beginning and end at the end i particularly enjoyed the plot line about the owl in the modern story and the insight into missionary life in the late 19th century early 20th century","495":"a good story with a lot of twists and turns i really liked it","496":"this book started slowly for me but kept my interest better as it went on the characters were interesting however i wonder if the lady missionary sections were realistic for that era","497":"i didn't think that i would enjoy this book but wow so many different cultures beliefs and climates present and past successfully connected persist","498":"i read this after the tenth gift by jane johnson and i liked that one better this one felt a little flat i couldn't really connect to the characters but if you like this type of book i would recommend the tenth gift mentioned above","499":"interesting period piece","500":"page 175 i'm thinking why am i still reading this book i give one star for the story line i really think the plot sounded fun and interesting the main characters were absolutely a bore their personalities were stiff and lifeless very disappointed","501":"this is a decent debut and i did enjoy the read but ultimately it just fell short for me the writing is quite lyric in parts and i loved the exotic locals but take away some of the window dressing and what you're left with is a fairly standard plot with a fairly standard ending even the shocking relationships were easy to spot so not all that surprising all that said i do think suzanne joinson can write and i will definitely give her next book a try in the hopes that she will grow and develop in a fine writer","502":"when i first received this book i did not know where kashgar was i had to go to the internet to discover it was on an old china silk trade route i'm still a little unclear on the exact location as it's bordered by states with names i neither know or can say it really made it clear to be just how big the adventure was that eva accompanied by her sister lizzie and a fiery missionary millicent set out on it's breathtaking that these three women set out on this fantastic leap of faith to explore new places in 1923 eva takes her bicycle and a book contract to write about her adventures and sets off on this very long and hard trip she's not out to save anyone but just knows she wants something else in her life her story fluctuates with that of frieda a young woman in present day in london she is an arabic youth specialist who spends much of her time in the mideast involved with a married man and dissatisfied with her job life changes for her suddenly she finds a young arabic man sleeping on her doorstep and gives him a blanket and a pillow she also receives an unexpected inheritance from an irene guy someone she doesn't know the story is how these two very different and yet similar women's discoveries on life unfold what do they have in common the answer is at the end and not what i expected a little overwritten at times and a little far fetched at others it is still quite interesting and worth a read","503":"i really enjoyed this book a story in 2 parts really eva and her sister lizzie who are trying to establish a mission in kashgar in the 1920s they arrive to the scene of a young girl of 10 or 11 giving birth under a tree things go from bad to worse when the european women are accused of murdering the girl and are held under house arrest with the girls baby the other half of the story involves frieda in the present day who has mysteriously been left the contents of a flat in england thousands of miles from kashgar from someone she has no knowledge of you are left wondering how on earth these 2 stories become one and the book has you guessing right up until the point it is revealed a charming if unsettling book looking at the relationships between dramtically differing cultures a really fascinating read","504":"this book weaves together two stories both with the theme of exploring foreign areas while encountering many obstacles put up by conflicting cultures the main story involves eva her sister lizzie and millicent who are missionaries traveling through china north of tibet on the silk road to kashgar in 1923 eva has brought her bicycle and is writing a travel book about her cycling experiences they are resented by the local people who do not trust the foreigners the second story set in present day england involves freida an international journalist who befriends tayeb an artistic man from yemen frieda is notified that she has inherited the belongings of a deceased woman she has never met she tries to unravel the mystery of their relationship by reading the diaries in the woman's apartment tayeb and frieda travel together to try to put the pieces of the story together although the links between the stories do not emerge until the reader is far into the book it is not difficult to switch back and forth between the chapters set in 1923 and the present the book has a lot of foreign color the sights the food the travel and the customs it also has interesting unusual characters in both stories i would recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical fiction or like reading about foreign culture","505":"3 5 stars come on goodreads with the half stars crossposted here i was initially intrigued by the subject matter of a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar a lovely debut novel written by suzanne joinson the story alternates between two times and places 1923 kashgar and present day london and follows two young women whose lives are vaguely connected though you don't find out how until maybe a quarter of the way through the novel eva from whose perspective the 1923 portion of the story is told is a young woman posing as a missionary both to accompany her sister on an expedition to asia and to gather material for a travel guide she hopes to write her sister lizzie has become taken with millicent the elder leader missionary whose methods of conversion involve latching on to a woman's secret unhappiness in order to manipulate them into separating from their current way of life and joining the evangelical mission on their journey the stumble upon a young girl about to give birth though they try deliver the baby safely the too young mother dies and the local people accuse millicent of murder they are taken to kashgar and put on a sort of indefinite somewhat loose house arrest in present day london frieda an academic scholar whose work involves much travel to muslim areas to work on her research has returned from her latest expedition to realize she's completely dissatisfied with her life both her career and her relationship with a drunkard married man who appears to have no redeeming qualities making one question why on earth she ever bothered with him to begin with purely for the physical relationship seems to be the answer tayeb a yemeni in london illegally after his travel visa ended years ago has been found out by the authorities and is trying to avoid deportation back to yemen where he would most likely be jailed or killed frieda receives a strange death notice in the mail and the story takes off from there to be fair it took quite a while for this book to pick up for me possibly until a quarter or a third of the way through the 1923 thread was fairly intriguing right away but the journal style read a little awkwardly for a while the present day bit following frieda and tayeb who form an unlikely bond in an almost too unlikely way took a little too long to explain what was going on and why we should be interested but right about the time the connection between the two stories becomes clear the stories both really seem to hit their stride through eva we learn a little about kashgar a formerly buddhist town in western china that had become mostly muslim it is one of the towns on the silk road and during this time period attacks are beginning in the region she's brought her bicycle along and occasionally manages to ride around town and it later becomes crucial to her survival frieda discovers more about her past than she ever thought to ask both women in the process come into their own and realize important qualities about their characters the bicycle remains in the background of much of the story symbolizing both responsibility and freedom the book is interspersed with bicycle guidance a touchpoint of recurring themes what the bicycle does mounted on a wheel you feel at one the keenest sense of responsibility you are there to do as you will within reasonable limits you are continually called upon to judge and to determine points that before have not needed your consideration and consequently you become alert active quick sighted and keenly alive as well to the rights of others as to what is due yourself though the novel did start off slowly for me and had a few elements of unbelievability it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable read i generally enjoy novels that give a glimpse of other cultures and this one lives up to that it is also a refreshing story about women in that it does not revolve around men or their relationship to men but rather their relationship with each other with their families and with themselves i received this book for early review courtesy of bloomsbury via netgalley","506":"an odd but interesting novel","507":"i loved this novel in fact it's one of the best books i've read of late i found the subject matter so fresh and unique a story alternating between the 1920s in kashgar along the silk road and present day london two sisters one a beauty a passionate photographer and missionary and her older sibling travelling in order to write a first book as 'a lady cyclist in kashgar ' as well as fierce and frightening missionary detail their extraordinary journey attended by both insight and tragedy in present day frieda a rather lost young woman inherits the contents of an apartment of an old lady she never knew the story has momentum and great drama and tension all i wanted to do was read the book and we keep turning pages to discover what will happen to this quartet of women and also the reveal of the relationship and connection between the two stories which is both unexpected and yet makes perfect sense the characters are layered and vivid the writing exquisite and just right the story powerful i highly recommend this novel we will discuss it in our bookgroup","508":"one of my favorite books from last year hope there's more to come","509":"the best parts of this book were the title and description on the back i read two thirds of it before giving it up there are too many other good books out there waiting to be discovered","510":"an enjoyable summer read the novel moves back and forth between the present and the lives of young missionaries to kashgar the historical details are the most interesting part of the book although the current relationships keep the story moving as in too many books written by women the male characters aren't totally believable","511":"i really enjoyed this book","512":"exotic setting unique characters and very different story line recommended","513":"just ok the historical part of the novel just didn't gel enough with the current day part of the novel","514":"i made it through but i didn't care for this one i somehow always think i'll enjoy historical fiction more than i do this one's been recommended to me a couple of times so i thought i'd give it a go the back and forth between eras got old before page 50 the writing had a lot of telling not showing of emotions and exchanges the main characters eva and lizzie i found to be flat and un relatable i desperately want to read a book so good that i put the book down for a week right before i'm about to finish it because i'm not ready to say goodbye this sadly was not that book","515":"really enjoyed this it was absorbing and intelligent and the movement between the two different stories well balanced my only criticism and its a minor one is that the link between the two stories was obvious to early in the story for my taste which took away from the slow reveal which i think the author probably intended but well worth a read and i look forward to reading future books by this author","516":"this was an engaging read and very straight forward nothing arty or philosophical but a good story","517":"i'm not really quite sure what to write about this book i feel quite ambivalent about it it is a tale told in three strands the first which gives the title to the book is that of evangeline english an english missionary to central asia in the 1920s the others are of two contemporary characters tayeb an illegal immigrant from yemen who is on the run from the authorities and frieda unsettled product of hippy parents summoned by the council to clear out the flat of a deceased woman she does not know inevitably tayeb enters frieda's life and it turns out that frieda is related to evangeline it took me a long time to get in to in fact i fell asleep trying to read it on the train more than once having said this once i had gotten past a certain point i did start to find it interesting i thought the sections in kashgar with evangeline were infinitely better than the modern sections although i was disappointed by what happened with her in the end i liked the descriptions of kashgar and the surrounding area and millicent made a wonderfully creepy antagonist i think the book would have been improved by dispensing with the modern sections and expanding on kashgar and the 1920s characters the connection between the two stories was weak mainly because the main character's generations are quite far apart and there were gaps in the story as you hear little about the in between generations it read to me a bit like the author had decided she was going to write about various things and had pushed them together in one book it ended up feeling disjointed with nothing explored to my satisfaction i'm sure there were lots of layers and deeper meanings in the text that i missed but i didn't care enough to work them out which says it all really","518":"i think i would like this book much better in the non audio edition so i may seek it out at another time but i am unable to continue listening to this narrator whose breathless sing songy delivery actually detracts from the story and turns one's thoughts toward poisons and weaponry just kidding about that last part mostly","519":"it took me a little while to get hooked on this book but eventually i did and i am glad to have read it","520":"it took me a while to get into this and actually wasn't sure i'd even finish it until i got to about a third of the way in when it started to make more sense and come together there were still sections of the prose which i found a bit tedious but i became genuinely interested in both the present day story and the 1920s story in particular the links between the two saying that i found the ending a bit disappointing so three stars instead of four but overall i'm pleased i stuck with it","521":"listened to audio cd on roadtrip really enjoyed the story i like flipping between characters and time periods thought the narrator was a little to breathy but once into the story i did not notice it as much","522":"excellent story and settingcharacters are believable and the setting is rich and exotic set in a pert of the world that is still a mystery to most of us","523":"this book was okay for me the two stories seem very disjointed as the novel goes back and forth between the 1920's in kashgar and present day london i found myself more interested in the kashgar story i never felt fully invested in the present day characters the story ultimately brings it all together but it was just okay for me","524":"interesting book but was not that easy to get into i liked the subject matter and how the author unfolded the story between present and past i think this would be a great book for a discussion group even thought it wasn't exactly a page turner","525":"i liked very much the mix and clash of characters of the periods and places of cultures and the way their connection gets slowly revealed to the reader the idea of writing a travelogue on a trip by bike was attractive lizzie reminded me a lot of the dad in the poisonwood bible which you absolutely need to read if you have not yet done so though her moral weakness was a surprise to me i found it a bit my full review is here http wordsandpeace com 2012 10 13 2","526":"had a difficult time getting through this one i heard the buzz on it just couldn't get into it eventually it grew on me and i had to find out how it ended","527":"two stories intertwine sort of 1923 asia three young british women missionaries and present day england young woman inherits belongings of someone she's never heard of a workable debut novel but doesn't really hold together after reading that said the characters were believeable and several were actually appealing","528":"i absolutely loved this book it gave a wonderful view into the muslem world of western asia in victorian colonial times the customs life the quality of light i even enjoyed those portions which take place in modern england tho i usually dislike this type of literary device i suspect this is the kind of book you either love or it leaves you cold","529":"this book was both wonderful at points and frustrating at other times i loved the entire middle section but it took me a little to get into this book i also didn't care much for parts of the ending parts of with the constant flashbacks of tayeb and frieda's individual past didn't seem to coherently mesh with what was happening in the present day while this wasn't always the case it was disconcerting at certain parts i loved the story of eva but thought it was well blended with frieda's story this was enjoyable and beautiful to read at parts i felt embarrassed for eva and hopeful for frieda so for me this book did a wonderful job at presenting the story i just think the ending could have been more fluid","530":"although i did not like this book i have to admit that i could not put it down i liked that there was two stories told at the same time and they came together at the end but each story was so strange and painful to read yet you had to find out what happens i have to say i was glad it was over as i could not take anymore of the dust heat dirt sick babies and traveling under just the absolute worst condition","531":"another story told from two different people at different times past and present sisters are missionaries in kashgar it is so different than their lives were they are not accepted many trials a young woman finding herself and how she is connected to these missionaries","532":"lovely story and settings ending just a bit abrupt","533":"i was delighted to receive this book from netgalley and my thanks to the publishers bloomsbury for allowing access to a pre publication galley edition the story opens in kashgar 1923 as evangeline english a keen lady cyclist and her sister lizzie set off on china's silk route into kashgar to help set up a christian mission they are travelling with millicent a stubborn and assertive missionary leader who against the odds gets drawn into a local tragedy which subsequently forces a violent reaction from the local muslim population this trio of unconventional women are keen to experience adventure but their naivety threatens their very safety in present day london frieda finds a young man sleeping rough outside her flat she gives him a blanket and pillow but in the morning he is gone leaving behind a beautiful picture of a bird together with an arab inscription drawn onto the wall behind where he slept an unlikely friendship develops between frieda and this young man and together they embark upon a journey of discovery as frieda seeks out more information about a mysterious inheritance what then follows is a cleverly constructed dual time narrative with colourful descriptions of life in kashgar balanced against vivid images of present day adventures the author has managed to weave the two stories quite well and although at times the narrative seems a little clumsy overall i thought that this was an enjoyable read and a good example of what happens when the present involves itself in the past","534":"this book contains some elements of a really good book but certainly not all","535":"i was very impressed with suzanne joinson's debut novel i was drawn to this book because looking at the cover i could not figure out how the lady in the beautiful purple dress was going to ride her bike in what looked like some pretty rugged terrain this dual storyline was very well done my preference would have been for the entire book to be about eva but the author did a very good job of keeping present day frieda in contention with eva i did a comprehensive review of the map at the front of the book and i was expecting to do a lot of traveling throughout the story but that was not the case i had to look up several words in my dictionary i doubt i will ever be using them in my conversations however i felt that i took away more from this book than just reading a wonderful story i felt educated in matters that were foreign to me i was reminded of what true adventure must feel like always on the cliff waiting to fall off or be pushed off this book does have a serious nature to it social conditions for women continue to change over time i realized that money has always been helpful in times of great need monetary bribes seem to be the universal language wherever you go i was impressed with the lavish detail and vivid imagery presented by the author with respect to food and geography i'm not sure about the authenticity of some of the food that was available to eva and her traveling companions but it did leave me with rich images that lingered long after i read the words on the pages i was a little disappointed with the final several chapters i think it was the fact that i didn't want eva's story to end but i did want freida's story to be over with and to be honest i really didn't even care about how the two woman were historically linked i look forward to reading suzanne joinson's next book p s if i was going to inherit property from somebody i sure would have been a lot more excited than freida was","536":"really enjoyed this perfect choice after the dark and disturbing gone girl story alternates between elizabeth a young british woman who is traveling as a missionary in kashgar on the silk road in 1923 and frieda a young british woman living in england who discovers that she has inherited an apartment from a woman that she didn't know elizabeth and frieda are both likeable characters quite a switch from the book i read before this and the author has a nice style of writing so that you appreciate these woman elizabeth's story is very interesting she writes of the challenges of being a white woman with flaming red hair in a remote desolate part of the world western part of china on border of tajikistan where christians are not popular and she struggles with feeling conflicted about the purpose of the mission and fears about her sister frieda also an independent woman struggles to find her place in the modern world she's untethered no strong personal connections or even a family enjoyed how the stories became linked near the end of the novel quite impressie for a first time novelist","537":"i was disappointed usually something i would give 2 stars to would never even have been finished i regularly use a 100 page rule if a story doesn't grab me by 100 pages i put it down and chose another time to try it but the title intrigued me on this one and i felt it had so much potential that i kept waiting for it to reach unfortunately it never did in my opinion the narrative told 2 separate but connected stories in 2 time periods the characters in the early 20th century didn't have the depth they could have i couldn't figure out why because the 21st century characters were full bodied and interesting having just finished another book in a very similar location in the 20th century this one paled by comparison","538":"i had a hard time finishing this book in fact half way through the book i dropped it back off at the library for a month or two before picking it back up to finish i did not like any of the characters they were boring weak dull and irritated me i did not like the plot again it felt boring and dull not a lot happened in the book there were so many superfluous mystical dream like and strange details like noticing the pores on someone's nose and yet not enough details to build exciting characters or plot i felt like the bike and the owl were stuck into the story to make the book appeal to more people because bikes and owls are cool right now i had a hard time seeing how the two stories connected the characters in time did not seem like they were experiencing similar situations or learning similar lessons it felt like two disjointed stories with the older story explaining frieda's existence it's mentioned that frieda felt different and looked different but she probably felt different because her mom was a hippie not because her mother's origin","539":"what a fun book went between current day and the early 1900's where 3 women traveled to an area along the china russia border to act as missionaries took a bit for me to figure out exactly what the connection between the two women would be good writing fun premises","540":"i saw this book last summer in the display window of a second hand store in kingston ontario i was there on a day trip with my lovely family and the book's cover caught my eye and although the title seemed a little strange i wanted to read it unfortunately the book store was closed so i was left on the sidewalk yearning the book and it became a fixture on my to read list which is incredibly long then one day at my local library fate intervened and the book sprang out to me from a shelf proving it was meant to be ok maybe that is a little dramatic i dove into the novel hungry devouring the first few chapters while researching a little of kashgar's history on the internet i had trouble understanding how these three missionary ladies were to communicate with their host charities at that point in history predating when phones were common to people's homes in a country backwards to what they knew the first scene was quite dramatic and immediately added to their predicament the modern day story of frieda was inter weaved throughout but it became more her story then that of eva's the losses she suffered and the journey's she makes emotionally mentally physically frieda has yet to figure out where exactly she belongs in life and sleeping with a married man does not seem to be helping much an unexpected act of kindness on her part brings her to tayeb whom together with she will connect her history to find her path as well as providing him with a safe haven this book shows clear differences between muslims and christians and the revolts that clashing opinions may cause weather within an individual a small family or even within an entire community a peaceful outcome can be hard sought as much as i enjoyed the beginning and middle of this novel i found it to be dragging at the end and was just suffering for it to be told and over this book was weird and i was hard pressed to finish it","541":"half the book tells the story of eva and her struggle to write a 'lady cyclist's guide' in 1923 turstan she u0026amp her sister lizzy have followed a missionary there to do good works but get themselves in trouble with the local customs u0026amp laws the other half is present day london with frieda a disconnected young woman who befriends a homeless man sleeping in her hallway while searching for answers concerning a letter stating she is next of kin to a woman she's never heard of kept me reading even though it was a different story than i expected the last third of the book moved quickly and i was satisfied with the ending first book by the author","542":"i loved this book i couldn't put it down till i finished it beautifully written and a joy to read","543":"just re read this book restarting it originally with no memory of having read it before it is quite a beautiful story romantic without a romance i do believe i liked this better the second go around","544":"suzanne joinson's split narrative novel is the kind of book you will indeed finish even though you will be constantly aware of the pitfalls of this narrative style with every chapter my that sounded pretentious but how hard must it be to keep two narratives going and have them both be equally interesting how hard can it be to find a modern story to compete with a 1920's englishwoman writing a guide for ladies who want to go bicycling for heaven's sake through a remote muslim area of western china damn hard joinson's parallel story takes too long to ramp up modern day frieda forms an odd bond with a yemeni man who stays in the flat she inherits from an unknown relative of the two women frieda is the hardest to connect with cyclist eva makes her trip to kashgar not only to write her guide but to accompany her sister who aflame with religion has hooked up with a rather frightening missionary frieda is an odd loner who is caught up in an affair with a married man this relationship meant to humanize her is simply inexplicable what will keep you reading is wondering how these two stories are ever going to come together but when they do it is rushed and not entirely believable joinson should have the confidence that her story would hold readers for a few more pages to wrap eva and frieda's stories up as they deserve i read this novel through netgalley and i thank them for the opportunity","545":"joinson suzanne a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar unabridged 9 cds 10 5 hours tantor audio 2012 isbn 978 1 4526 10752 8 $39 99 fjoinson's debut is an engrossing narrative coalescing the lives of two women eva and frieda separated by a hundred years and a thousand miles yet connected in ways that are slowly revealed eva masquerading as a missionary in kashgar east turkestan in order to keep an eye on her possibly mad sister is ostensibly writing a guide to bicycling the region frieda a modern day government worker in london is hiding from her married lover while cleaning out the apartment of a mysterious women who has died and named her next of kin vacillating between antiquity and present day joinson highlights difficulties of women which translate across time sisterhood motherhood lovers careers with ethereal language and engrossing characters full of surprising and shocking revelations the landscape and breadth of the novel is breathtaking read by susan duerden who may have detracted from the book's sense of illusory enchantment with over elocution recommended to fans of the chaperone by laura moriarty terry ann lawler phoenix public library az","546":"i loved this a rare split narrative where both tales are equally enjoyable","547":"i really thought i would like this book considering the historic setting a lady cyclist in china the past present connections however the characters were as thin as the paper they were written on i kept wondering why but no answer was delivered by the end of the book","548":"\"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar\" sounded like just the kind of historical traveller's tale i love one of those magical \"stranger in a strange land\" adventures of an intrepid edwardian woman venturing where foreigners aren't welcomed and foreign women are seldom if ever seen however suzanne joinson's novel turns out to be quite different from these expectations most of the historical action takes place while the narrator her sister and their friend millicent are under house arrest because of their missionary activities their journey along the silk road has brought them to kashgar in eastern turkestan it is 1923 and evangeline english finds herself becoming a surrogate mother to a newborn girl child it is because of the baby's mother and because of millicent's aggressive proselytising that they are in their current predicament meanwhile in twenty first century london frieda blakeman encounters a homeless artist from yemen outside the door of her flat shortly afterwards she discovers she has inherited the contents of the home of the late irene guy - apparently a relative of whom she knows nothing together she the yemeni refugee tayeb explore the contents of irene guy's home trying to find out who she is and how she is related to frieda all this sounds intriguing and it is but it is a novel that lacks the necessary spark to make it really memorable at times i found myself becoming impatient for something to happen particularly to evangeline and her companions whose narrative is by far the most interesting part of the book but i have to hand it to ms joinson - her novel while not being what i expected was also rather unpredictable in some of its revelations always a nice surprise for the reader","549":"an okay book but could have been better if there was more of the story sent in kashgar in the 20's rather than it keep jumping backwards and forwards between the two time periods","550":"a chore to read through to the end my copy went straight to the recycling bin when i was finished i didn't want to put anyone else through the misery by dropping it off as secondhand","551":"a good book but not memorable","552":"i received a free copy of this book from the goodread first reads giveaways as i write this review i find this book rather hard to categorize it was not exactly what i expected as only half the book concerns the fascinating story of a lady missionary in 1920s kashgar her story is interspersed with a modern tale of a woman in london the yemeni man she meets and the flat the council informs her she has to clear this latter story has moments of brilliance especially in its obvious learning and descriptive skill however i saw a lot of the modern story as an echo of that in faulks' birdsong that is to say not badly written but somewhat trivial and unnecessary compared to the main plot the historical section was very interesting and well researched with better defined characters and plot and felt frustrated each time we left that timeline especially as the actual bicycle journey alluded to in the title mapped in the front is almost sidelined only taking place in a quarter of the book however that story is worth waiting for and is a colourful portrait of a place completely foreign to me the characters are a little predictable but nevertheless likeable and well drawn this novel shows a lot of potential and i will be interested to read the author's future work","553":"did not find any redeeming qualities in this one sorry","554":"this is a beautiful multi cultural multi generational novel that portrays western china in the 1920's with a watercolor dreaminess we meet two strong women living 100 years apart both british and both traveling to distant lands where they face challenging situations we know these women are somehow linked and by the time we figure out their connection we're emotionally invested in their lives their journeys and their unlikely cross cultural relationships i didn't think i'd enjoy this story nearly as much as i did i listened to the audiobook and susan duerden's narration was perfect i could listen to her gorgeous voice all day long","555":"this is an interesting book it took a while to get into it and wasn't a real page turner for me but i did enjoy it","556":"i won this in a first reads giveaway i didn't personally enjoy this novel but i understand why others do the plot isn't bad and the writing is actually pretty good it just didn't click with me i was originally going to give this two stars but that felt a little harsh considering i just didn't like it for a reason i can't even put my finger on the best way i can describe this is okay it was fairly pleasant i didn't feel like it was a struggle to pick it up but i didn't look forward to it either","557":"this was another of those books that simply made me say huh","558":"fascinating story i liked how the 2 tales intertwined the adventures of eva in the 1920's in a part of the world i know very little about were so interesting her journal is a very immediate way for us to experience what she is experiencing the story of frieda in modern times as she struggles to find her way is enhanced by her friendship with tayeb the homeless yemeni who ends up on her doorstep i highly recommend this book","559":"thoroughly enjoyed this","560":"this novel was another where the title was misleading sure the main narrator took a bicycle with her into asia but she never seemed to ride it and none of her narrative really was about traveling on a bicycle annoying still i enjoyed the characters the story and the back and forth between the present and the past it was a fun read and quick but not an earth shattering read for me","561":"this book just lacked so much for me characters were written in with little or no background provided substantive details were omitted about the locale and plot situation no spark ignited the story line not sure why i've given it 2 stars instead of one","562":"i really enjoyed this book which is two stories one in the present and one in the past both stories really pull you in with intriguing protagonists that you care about almost from the first page","563":"i enjoyed this book written in two different periods and two different settings that come together at the end","564":"i was excited to have won this giveaway the story goes back and forth between kashgar in the '20's and modern london the london part is really boring and the kashgar part is better but not engrossing i did enjoy the fish out of water aspect of it and it was an interesting peek into the missionary life in on the silk road but i am not sure the book was worth my time the london part really distracted from the novel as a whole","565":"what an unusual book because it bounces back and forth between times it's a little hard to follow but i think the storyline makes the bouncing worthwhile i am a fan of gertrude bell and other early female adventurers so i am probably a predisposed to like this work first for the 1920s chapters ms joinson paints the region then called the near east of russia china well her characters are interesting although i take exception to millicent--a total looney--representing christianity and missionaries the reader needs to be willing to suspend belief at times such as regarding the premise that two young women would have been so easily released to undertake a journey of this type at this time as to the contemporary part of the story i think the author does a particularly excellent job of depicting tayeb he is believable based on westernized young middle eastern males of his generation i know a few her characterization of frieda is rich although i'd like to have seen this character exhibit some of the spunk and less of the politically correct altruism of eva all in all this is a very enjoyable read it's about a region in which i'm interested both the 1920s chapters and the contemporary ones and it well written recommended","566":"i'm drawn to books about clashes of cultures set in a intimate personal story here there are two story lines in alternating chapters in one set a young woman in 1923 travels with her younger sister and a protestant missionary to kashgar a city on the borderlands of china and the mostly moslem stan countries in the other shorter chapters set in the present in england a woman well traveled in the arab world encounters a 40 something undocumented immigrant from yemen one of the few countries in the region that she does not know much about even though the former story is cast as notes for a book intended as a guide to the region the account tips too far for my taste in the intimate personal direction what i know about kashgar i learned from consulting wikipedia not from the book itself which revealed precious little about the region or its culture likewise the story set in the present is not very revealing about the struggles the yemeni immigrant faces both are slow developing stories with the connection between them a total mystery until at least halfway through and pretty oblique even after that","567":"an interesting part of the world in an interesting time for women i liked the plot and the book overall one modern story merges with that of the past want to give it a bit more than 3 stars because i did get through it pretty quickly tayeb's character was a little hard for me to completely comprehend and perhaps just a bit contrived for the muslim modern man but i didn't find him annoying this book made me want to get the map out and look at exactly where this convergence of muslim chinese and russian actually occurs this was my favorite aspect of the novel the place and people i found the main character eve to be very powerless and not in control of her own destiny but perhaps this is purposeful given her missionary role how unwelcome they were in that land the time period and the power of millicent i really wanted to punch that character overall a pleasant read especially if you're into travel and exotic locales","568":"i really enjoyed this book was not 100% sure at the beginning but glad i stayed with it","569":"i enjoyed it but the back and forth between present day and the past was a little much for me","570":"it was interesting","571":"an irresistible title if you know where kashagar is or have even been there as the person for whom i bought this has it goes into the mail on monday it's a great read the story moves back and forth between kashgar in 1923 24 and modern england it's really a bit of a mystery story and a lot about human and family relationships through time the descriptions of kashgar and other locales seem accurate as far as i can tell i read almost the whole book in one day","572":"when i lived in asia i became i interested in the silk road and central asia of which i and most americans knew little about this book part travelogue part historical fiction part story of the clash of cultures centers around a pair of sisters living in kashgar in the early 1920s the story also traces into present day to a young man and a refugee from yemen i had a little trouble getting going in the book but then found descriptions about life and adventures in central asia fascinating","573":"well this is one of those books i kept thinking about after it was finsihed i found the historical story more compelling that the modern one but i had to wonder why frieda and evangeline made some of the choices they did","574":"the chapters with the historical story are very good but i could not say the same for the chapters in modern life how disappointing to skip those chapters out of frustration","575":"ended up liking it but it took a while","576":"i had anticipated that this would be a thrilling adventure of a woman on a bicycle set in exotic locations unfortunately it was not as interesting as i had hoped the first half of the book moved at a snail's pace the second half developed quite nicely and the alternating storyline began to pull together however i had difficulty believing that in real life any of the characters would behave the way they did i had hoped to learn a lot about the locations that the characters traveled to but since most of the story takes place with characters in hiding or sheltered from the world this was not possible","577":"couldn't finish this one just uninteresting","578":"i enjoyed the split narrative of this book and the way she connected the two main character's lives i also enjoyed the history i learned from this book as well as the geography","579":"usually the only type of book that keeps me compulsively turning the pages is a suspenseful mystery a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is the exception in alternating chapters the book leads us tantalizingly through the stories of frieda a peripatetic journalist based in present day london and evangeline english an adventurer pretending to be a missionary in 1920's kashgar the descriptions of eva's life in the heat of the desert under the suspicious often threatening eyes of the muslim populace are evocative enough to make the reader sweat on a cold winter's night in london the exotic feeling continues with the numerous bird references and frieda's encounter with a homeless yemeni named tayeb i would have awarded the 5th star in my rating if not for the chapter in which frieda confronts her estranged mother the strange circumstances of that encounter seemed unnecessarily outlandish fortunately that one misstep is not enough to derail an unusual story involving the persistence of love and the urge to push the boundaries","580":"seems there is a trend of books telling dual related stories this is another one unfortunately the connection doesn't really add to the story the connection is not even made clear for quite awhile which i guess is supposed to build intrigue i enjoyed the modern day story more than the one set in the past which i found a bit confusing at times and it didn't always made sense skip ths one","581":"this is not the usual sort of book that i would necessarily choose to read but i won a copy through a goodreads giveaway the title could be considered a little misleading as you may expect to be following the story of a lady travelling by bicycle through kashgar however what you have is a story of two strands the first is set in 1920's china and follows the story of evangeline english during her time travelling with her sister lizzie and companion millicent there are themes of religion politics family relationships and even a hint at homosexuality running throughout the second strand is set in modern day england with the story of frieda and how she inherits the belongings of an apparent stranger the story moves between each of the narrative voices and it took me a little while to get used to the descriptive writing style i also felt the first third of book was a little slow for my liking however it was worth sticking with it as the latter part of the book is much better and without giving too much away you get to find out how the two stories are linked this is the author's first novel and based upon this i would read another one of her books","582":"i didn't necessarily dislike this book but i didn't like it either the two intersecting stories seemed very promising at first but the unravelling of them was very slow and the end result not very satisfying also there wasn't much cycling","583":"too much sex not enough cycling","584":"i enjoyed this book very much the flashbacks and connection to the present were equally enjoyable the locale for the story in the past was intriguing i actually could not put this down and read it in one day beautiful writing","585":"when i first started this book i really wasn't sure about it it was a little confusing and not very interesting i made myself keep reading and the book did get better but i don't think i would read it a second time","586":"this was an odd book that left me wondering why i read it","587":"i liked the interplay of the two stories and each was intriguing in its own way but the book did not engage me in a must read sort of way","588":"i enjoyed this story of an english woman on a missionary trip to kashgar it was heartfelt and i always enjoy books that take me to a place and time where i've never been i thought the writing was very good but the plot was slightly rushed toward the end worth the read","589":"i never felt invested with the characters except wanting to know who irene was read the first half skimmed the second to get the answers a story of history repeating itself just okay","590":"i loved this book and would recommend it for book club discussion the only thing keeping me from giving it a fifth star is the fact that not one relationship in the book was solid making it a tad unbelievable a solid relationship given a storm of its own would have offered a point of contrast and comparison i had expected a charming little read but this betrayal played right into the theme as eva launched her journey well done","591":"not at all what i expected very well written interesting would recommend","592":"well i got half way through and i really tried hard but dnf this book i haven't given up on a book in a long time this had all of the potential and all of the elements to be a really exciting read but there was no depth to it no thread linking events or characters together i didn't care about any of the characters and the random events that were slotted in didn't make sense to me the owl hadn't been fed in days so i strapped it to my bike and went the pub why give a man who has been following you a pillow to sleep outside your front door why was it necessary to have two men follow him and incite sexual violence how does someone carry a set of forceps around the desert i just didn't get it at all","593":"interesting and did keep me updated interested but the ending was disappointing","594":"an interesting story that goes back and forth between the 20's in the city of kashgar and present day london eva and lizzie are missionaries who go to kashgar in the 1920's while frieda is in present day london and meets a young yeman named tayeb they are all tied together with notebooks and secrets","595":"i love books about travel books that take place in exotic locations and books about women finding themselves and this book had all three it's told from three different points of view two female one male with two story lines taking place at two different times the story lines were both interesting to the point that i stayed up later than i should have reading it","596":"i found this book a bit of a mixed bag the first quarter was all over the place - the modern and historical stories sat very uncomfortably together and i usually love dual time stories and i even contemplated throwing the towel in but from that point on the story really takes off the modern story of frieda and the yemeni refugee she finds sleeping on her doorstep and her unexpected and unusual inheritance is well told i really preferred the 1920s story of three women in kashgar and their missionary work undertaken by each for different reasons lots of detail in both stories - stick with it it's all there for a reason which becomes clear by the end the stories come together really well as the story progresses and the book comes to a satisfying close with all ends neatly tied up yes i really did enjoy it thanks to netgalley for the advance reading e copy","597":"i almost put this book down the beginning was trite the dialogue awkward but kept with it and loved it the story of english sisters who become missionaries in china but it's not the usual story they are arrested and held for trial joinson portrays the heat and the dust the strangeness of the food and clothing and dwellings beautifully there is also a modern day love story and a mystery","598":"i was drawn in by the story and had a hard time putting it down wishing to make the connection between frieda and irene","599":"right firstly let me say i won a copy of this book via a goodreads give away there are two stories told in this book a chapter each the first set in 1923 and told through the eyes of evangeline english a keen cyclist who arrives with her sister lizzie and leader millicent in the ancient city of kashgar on a mission the other half of this story is told from the viewpoint of frieda and tayeb neither of who know the other until one night when frieda opens the front door and finds tayeb asleep on the landing the stories do wonder how if at all they are linked together and it's a very interesting journey to finding it out admittedly if i hadn't won a copy of this book i would never have chosen to read it the title alone gave me the impression it was going to be a diary of someone going through kashgar on a bicycle it's really anything but i really liked this story there was so much description of the desert the places around kashgar the troubles that were happening that made me enjoy this book so much the research that must have went into this is wonderful evangeline was my favourite of the characters because she didn't go to kashgar to be on the mission that was her given reason to everyone but it was to protect her sister lizzie the title of book is the book diary that evangeline is writing whilst in kashgar to turn into a book when she is back 'a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar' is the debut novel from suzanne joinson it gives you a lot of insight into central asia as well as the journey taken by evangeline and the eventual link to frieda i was pleasantly surprised","600":"i enjoyed this book but possibly mainly because i love any book about travel and adventure ultimately it was a little depressing and the main character seemed to take a bit of an 'oh well' attitude to the loss of her two companions which was a bit disappointing with such a dramatic storyline","601":"this book grew on me initially given the title i thought that it might be meant to be amusing but on further reading it became clear that this is a novel about serious topics the two main stories didn't quite hold together for me but were interesting","602":"ugh not sure how to describe this book i listened to it on cd and initially found the narrator's voice so irritating that i couldn't tell if i didn't like the book because of her voice or because of the actual story i almost gave up on it half a dozen times but i stuck it out none of the characters are particularly likable the story lines have a tenuous link with each other and there is next to zero actual cycling in the story all this being said i think i like the writing style if not the story itself and i am willing to give suzanne joinson a second chance with a different book","603":"i picked up this book based solely on the title which i still love and i enjoyed the book didn't love it but liked it a bit travel narrative a bit mystery a bit meditation on the intimate relationships we have with sisters and mothers and daughters","604":"so i really enjoyed this book particularly the historical narrative in kashgar where the tension and the story line kept me really wanting to see where it would go there are some good characters and some interesting themes but when our book club met we agreed that it could have been developed so much further the way the two stories fit is flimsy i wanted a tighter connection some of the imagery bikes birds doesn't go anywhere and the ending was a little unsatisfying for me still i enjoyed it so it wasn't that bad","605":"this was a really interesting book and a great read i couldn't put it down it is two stories intertwined one set in 1923 in the far east and the other set in present times london the story slowy unveils the connection between the two protaganists i highly recommend this for a good summer read","606":"vdifferent type of story about 3 missionary ladies 1 missionary lady her 'follower' u0026amp the follower's sister who are 'taking the word' to the far east about their travels u0026amp lives very readable","607":"in the 1920s sisters eva and lizzie join missionary millicent on a trip to kashgar on the silk route to save souls however things go wrong as soon as they arrive which leaves them in danger in present day london frieda an expert on the arabic world is bequeathed the possessions of an unknown woman and must try to find out how she and the deceased are connected it's quite common for contemporary novels to have a dual narrative with two stories going on which may not immediately seem connected but in this book i didn't feel that the format was entirely successful i was much more interested in eva's story than in frieda's and wanted more of the former and less of the latter in particular i'd have liked more about eva's later life rather then the tiny bit we're given here the book has a lot to say about women's lives the freedoms we have and the freedoms we give up on occasion i did enjoy the book and read it pretty much in one long sitting but would have enjoyed it more without the modern day sections","608":"great read my first by this author the missionary sections were increasingly gripping especially to this missionary child of china inland mission parents culminating in evangeline's flight across the deserts and mountain passes of nw china google earth was in my other hand as i read","609":"the 2 timeframes used are interesting as you don't suspect who is related until quite late in the novel well writtenk interesting subject matter","610":"very enjoyable story with a couple of twists along the way i guessed quite early who irene guy was but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story i liked both the modern day tale of frieda as well as the missionaries of past times in kashgar a recommended read","611":"started out good but it wasn't what i expected the parallel story line was clever but a bit too unbelievable","612":"i almost really liked this book but it just missed the mark a little for me the stories were compelling three lady missionaries and their struggles with faith each other and the culture around them made for a very interesting story the modern day characters were also compelling a man from yemen running from deportation who meets by chance a woman who is searching for purpose in her own life i loved their story and would have been happy to have read more about them the problem for me was that the two stories never came together as a whole i never felt a meaningful connection between the events in 1920's kashgar and modern day london the character that could have connected the two stories irene was oddly absent and i wanted to know more about her however i was moved by the stories and the writing was unique and interesting it was definitely enjoyable","613":"novel idea could certainly believe the women as they idealistically went off to save a little part of the world glad i read it","614":"wooed by the cover this was a great find and one i did not want to end can't wait for her next book","615":"it's certainly an interesting book and the author has written some lovely prose in places there are a jumble of threads to the plot which make it very hard to categorise it has a time span of nearly a century and no emotional parallel between the historical storyline and and the contemporary one the linkage is strained and this could have been written as two or possibly three short stories perhaps there's a shared theme of love giving direction to aimless life but it doesn't come over strongly i like the book though and i'll look out for joinson's next","616":"i really really wanted to like this book so i kept reading past where i probably would have given up normally unfortunately the last few chapters that tied up both storylines actually made it even more disappointing i found tayeb a fascinating character and really wanted more details about his past in yemen and his experiences in england i found him a more sympathetic and interesting character than freida as for the 1923 timeline i don't know why i found it boring since i'm pretty interested in central asian history usually i like the whole epistological conceit but i think in this case seeing everything only through eva's eyes made the focus too small now i want to find a good history of the area to find out what exactly was going on and why i also have a lot of thoughts about the portrayal of queer characters in the book but i'm finding it too hard to organize them enough to be coherent basically just a mishmash of negative stereotypes employed that left me coming away from the book feeling slightly greasy the writing itself was beautiful and i think it was very well researched so i hope other people enjoyed it more than i did","617":"this is a really good read and i was well into reading it from the first pages and was in the book with the characters its a story of friendship and trials","618":"as many other reviewers noted this book was not quite what i expected it was quite dark and sad and did not really provide as much insight into the history of the time and places it touched upon the modern day component of the story did not really interest me although i did like the character of tayeb it was an interesting book but i think if the author had only focused on the historical story we could have better understood the native women the weird priest in the kashgar etc i was drawn in and read through the end in a rush however to find out what happened to ai lien it also took me quite some thinking to figure out how the past and current realities aligned i think that says more about me than the book","619":"i'm not sure why i liked this book but i did a story of three missionary women who find themselves in kashgar during a muslim chinese russian war with a duel thread of an english girl and arab man trying to find their way in life the story moves along well and is an easy and interesting read","620":"the story is told in two times the present in england and 1923 in kashgar eastern turkestan well into the book the reader gradually begins to see how the two stories are connected the lives of a modern young woman and a missionary young woman are gradually revealed and the past connects to the present after i was drawn into the two story lines it became a page turner for me","621":"i did not enjoy this book at all the overuse of metaphor and lengthy descriptive passages distracted from what was a very thin story at best it was a diary written by eva about her escape from the desert","622":"i could bearly put this book down the story and characters were very well drawn and i didn't want to leave them i felt the unknown pieces really drew me in i wanted to figure it out on my own the variety of location and breadth of characters was extremely entertaining did a nice job of touching on social taboos prejudices and the fact that they continue to this day","623":"i love historical fiction but it just didn't hold my attention whenever i feel my mind wandering during reading it's time to move on","624":"this story was very involved and i struggled to get through it my mind kept going back to the kashmir shawl which was also along similar lines with missionaries then and relatives now i think the title of this book was misleading as it gave a promise of something else this is a good book and is nicely written but it did not suit my reading won in giveaways","625":"i thought this was an outstanding book the obvious clash of cultures in both stories was beautifully done loved every minute of it and could not put it down","626":"i got this book through goodreads first reads it is something i probably wouldn't have picked up on my own i love historical fiction but the time jumps didn't work for me i thought it was predictable i don't mind time jumps in books like the kite runner but it didn't work for me here i would have preferred to have stuck to one storyline i liked the journal parts but not the modern parts it was a decent read though","627":"this was a very enjoyable read the story of two strong women in different eras whose literal journey's lead them to internal journeys to greater self fulfillment one story line takes place in the '20's in central asia and the other in modern day england both lead you to appreciate the strength and inner stuggles of the lead women and i couldn't wait to find out how the two were linked which certainly keeps you reading apace to get to the end i also loved the bird theme that runs throughout the book a metaphor for freedom as i understood it my favorite parts were the modern parts and i have the images of one of the characters drawings in my head too bad i can't see the real thing","628":"i really enjoyed the premise of this book and the descriptions of the region that the author brought to this book it's real strength lay in the descriptions of the time and place of the post ww1 journey that landed the protagonist in extreme western china where the turkic peoples russians chinese muslims and people from the indian sub continent all mash together i tired a bit of the diary format it lent itself to more reflection on action than on action it's a bit different to hear of a tragedy through the lens of i don't know how to bear to write about this than actually watching it unfold in real time as a reader","629":"i try not to give five stars in my reviews i have even been known to go back to old reviews and lower the number of stars after all a five shouldn't be given out easily with suzanne joinson's a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar however i will happily bestow a five this is simply a great novel in every way that a novel is satisfying joinson's prose is spare and tight with a hemingway like propensity for understatement honestly i don't think there is an extraneous word in the text not one two parallel narratives told from three perspectives play out gradually interweaving with measured but brisk pacing this is not an easy feat often i am annoyed by multiple narrative novels resenting having to work through a less engaging section to get on with a more compelling one joinson doesn't let this happen and i experienced the rare phenomenon of not wanting to let any chapter go in order to get on to the next both narratives stood on their own one not being merely a structural device to support the other as for the telling of the story joinson respects her reader's intelligence through a strong preference for allusion over statement yet there is a richness to her minimal descriptions that allows one to be easily immersed in the world she creates if i wanted to complain about anything and i don't i might ask for a bit more on the back story of tayeb especially his early life of the three central characters he gets the least treatment in this regard but perhaps this is joinson's intention to keep him a bit mysterious or perhaps she isn't as comfortable writing about men as women if it is the latter as a man i can say she writes men very well ultimately all ends are tied up with a conclusion that avoids both romanticism and existential bleakness in considering this book i would encourage men to give it a read the title and cover art bespeak a woman's book especially the weak cover design of the recently released paperback edition this novel is a universally appealing well wrought tale with jarring surprises and turns that keep it from ever being conventional i am eagerly awaiting joinson's next title","630":"this book offers a few beautiful moments which you know come directly from the author's experiences abroad the descriptions of yemen details of meals and surroundings in kashgar etc overall however it never makes a connection all of the characters are cursed to live purposeless lives never in harmony with their environment always loving those they cannot truly possess or feeling unwelcome and unnatural in their everyday lives none are drawn with much depth they are just tragic shadows cast with clotted prose who live and die with no agency or self awareness the worst is perhaps the fact that the author describes the pitfalls of colonial perspective then jumps whole heartedly into orientalism with two dimensional untrustworthy exotic characters of the east it is an interesting but unsatisfying read","631":"the story of a victorian girl who travels with her bicycle to kashgar on the silk road is a counterpoint to that of a contemporary woman who finds an arab illegal immigrant sleeping outside her london flat","632":"i liked the style of writing although i found it hard to get into this novel maybe because the shifts between time were unsettling i felt a whole novel could have been made from each time period there sure were a lot of eccentric and quirky characters too","633":"very interesting read the story covers two different time periods in two different locations once i settled into that framework i found it quite engaging the characters are fascinating the location complex and intriguing and the plot suspenseful and interesting","634":"this book was good it features an english woman who is on a missionary trip to kashgar and then also has a modern day story about a woman who is somehow connected i feel that this type of story has been done before and done much better i didn't really care for either character and the modern day woman frieda didn't seem to care much about her connection to the missionary when she figured it out there were a couple of themes throughout the book birds and bicycles again they were just touched on and not really made important i feel like the author had a good idea but couldn't seem to get it to work on paper","635":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar moves back and forth between 1923 kashgar and present day london three women travel together in kashgar millicent a representative of the missionary order of the steadfast face elizabeth her loyal follower and an enthusiastic photographer and her sister eva our narrator and a \"modern\" woman writing the lady cyclist's guide to kashgar eva professes to \"believe\" in order to go on the trip but she does not in the first chapter millicent attempts to help a very young woman giving birth to a child the mother dies millicent is blamed and the entire party including the newborn are placed under a kind of house arrest eva has a very uneasy relationship with millicent - she is awed by her she mistrusts her and she is jealous of millicent's relationship with eva's sister lizzie lizzie seems increasingly distant and eva is left to care for the baby in present-day london frieda frets about her relationship with her married boyfriend befriends a yemeni man and discovers that she has inherited a flat full of possessions from a woman she has never heard of among the possessions she is shocked to discover is a live owl in a cage who has had no care since the woman died as the alternating chapters move forward the two stories past and present begin to come together in a fairly predictable way it took me a long time to get into this book i was actually about ready to give it up until the owl entered the story the owl piqued my interest enough for me to keep going i found the early chapters set in kashgar to be grim and unhappy the chapters set in london were confusing and hard to follow as so many plot details were presented finally when i was about halfway through the book i began feel interested in the story and where it would go i found the characters set in present day more interesting than the ones in the past the plot took some unlikely twists in both storylines but the ending was relatively satisfying the book was not what i expected from the excellent cover art and the description on the back cover i would recommend this book to readers with a lot of time to invest in a complicated story and to those with a strong interest in the city of kashgar in the 1920s i read an uncorrected proof copy of a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar i had considered choosing it for my library's book club but i think it is too slow moving if members aren't hooked early some are unlikely to finish the book","636":"huh not what i was hoping for","637":"this book is a page turner for sure the book is two stories one set in the 1920's and one in present day london the two stories collide in a somewhat predictible way but never the less it was an intriguing book and would be good for book club discussions for sure","638":"i can see why other reviewers found the title of this novel misleading you assume the book is going to be a light travelogue when in actuality very little travelling or indeed cycling takes place nevertheless i really enjoyed it reading about the three women missionaries in the early 1900's primarily in a very claustrophobic setting in kashgar where events spiral out of control and tragedy seems to perpetuate itself as the heat grows more oppressive and the political situation more dangerous every other chapter is narrated by frieda in a modern day setting whose connection to the earlier events gradually becomes apparent and her friendship with tayeb a yemeni refugee they are both on their own life journeys and i enjoyed their interaction and their observations of each other","639":"this was two stories that intertwined in the end the story of two sisters on a missionary trip on the silk road in the 1920's and frieda in present day who befriends a homeless man from yemen sleeping on her doorstep in london both storylines were interesting eva joining her sister on the mission so she could write a book about their experience and freida bequeathed the contents of an apartment from a dead woman she'd never heard of i had much of it figured out but was surprised at the twist between freida and her mother the most interesting aspect was all these connected woman who lived extremely different lives yet seemed so similar in how their lives turned out the book was a slow read but i enjoyed it","640":"this one borders on a literary novel in my opinion that's not good or bad although i've read many novels in the literary genre over the years they're not my usual reading i did enjoy the novel it was extremely well written and about an interesting time in history i also liked the going back and forth in time and the female characters but like most literary novels i've read i'm not left with a sense of being completely full with all of this said i'm glad i read it","641":"i started listening to this book on cd the reader's voice drove me nuts and i didn't make it through the second disk the book itself sounds interesting and i may try to read it rather than listen to it","642":"a lady cyclist's guide was a lot like riding a bike a little wobbly to start but picked up steadiness at it went along in 1923 eva accompanies her sister lizzie and lizzie's mentor millicent on their journey to kashgar as missionaries although lizzie and millicent are both avid eva has a different purpose for the trip when a tragic death occurs at the side of the road the three women find themselves under house arrest and at the mercy of the chinese muslim community in a parallel story in modern england freida returns from a trip in the middle east to find that she has been listed as next of kin of a woman she knows nothing about she encounters a gentle man sleeping in the doorway of her flat building and together they journey to find who the unknown woman was both story lines have at their heart the lure and realities of travel finding yourself in a different culture and what constitutes family either storyline could have been developed by itself into an interesting novel combining the two made for a very interesting read that unfortunately leaves the ending a little flat","643":"a debut novel by susanne joinson won on goodreads thank you both i gave this book 4 stars after much thought i will admit i was on the fence with it put it down picked it back up and so forth and so on but something kept drawing me back to these two different intertwined lives in different era's i did love the concept of switching back and forth from present time to the 1920's overall it had a good story line and was beautifully written i have already recommended this book to several people i loved eva and frieda and tayeb was also a good character","644":"a fantastic fantastic romp through kirghizia in the 1920s but i think even non central asian enthusiasts would like its message live life without fear and amazing things can happen","645":"stunningly beautiful prose lovely engaging i loved this book it somehow fell short of one of those novels that stays with me forever but i still recommend it entirely as beautiful writing and unique settings and characters quite amazing","646":"good writing just ok storydid com together on th end","647":"i thoroughly enjoyed this story i hope ms joinson goes on to write more novels as her first one was powerful on many levels","648":"a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is two separate tales of cultural and social difference the first tale is of evangeline english cycling trip across east turkestan in 1923 evangeline eva and her sister lizzie embark on a missionary trip to the middle east under the authority of an idealistic millicent leader of their missionary group millicent and eva come across a young girl giving birth on the side of the road they find themselves in a precarious situation when the girl dies after the baby is born the locals call them witches devils and they must stand trial for the girls death they are held up in the city of kashgar east turkestan when in kashgar eva soon discover their religious mission political maneuvering of local officials and the traditional role of an english woman causes mounting difficulties the second tale takes place in present day england freida story starts when she returns from her middle eastern travels to find that a mysterious benefactor irene guy has left her an inheritance she also finds a man of middle eastern descent sleeping on her door step she soon discovers that man's name is tayeb an illegal immigrant from yemeni freida offers tayeb the use of irene's home if he agrees to help her go through the contents although they are from traditionally different backgrounds a mutually beneficial friendship develop between freida and tayeb eventually these two story intersect and you discover that both eva and freida journeys put them on the road to find themselves embark on a story of their inheritance find the positions in which they belong and discover their personal history this was an interesting and descriptive telling of these explorations into eva and freida's lives you watch as tribulations appear and how they discover the strength within themselves to overcome these adversaries i enjoyed reading each story individually although my emotional investment in the characters was slow going when the point of view jumped between time lines in the end suzanne joinson wove two separate stories into a fascinating tale this arc copy of a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar was given to me by goodreads first reads and bloomsbury in exchange for an honest review","649":"a very bizarre book and it would definitely sour me on missionaries","650":"in 1923 eva and her sister lizzie set out for the ancient city of kashgar on the silk road lizzie is on fire with religious zeal eva with her bicycle and a commission to write a lady cyclist's guide is ready for adventure in present day london frieda returns from a long trip abroad to find two things awaiting her that change her life a young yemeni man sleeping outside her front door and a letter informing her that she has inherited the contents of a flat belonging to a woman she has never heard of in chapters alternating between the past and the present the author interweaves the stories of eva and frieda ultimately revealing the link between them in language that flows gracefully but is also sparse and taut these are characters that hold their emotions in check","651":"here is another first time author who works in the literature department of the british council not only is it well written but quite creative telling two different stories at the same time eve english traveling with her sister lizzie to kashgar in 1923 her sister is a true missionary and eveis just ready for an adventure meanwhile present day london frieda returns from an overseas trip forbusiness and finds she has a call from a barrister about inheriting many things from someone she is not familiar with this novel weaves back to 1923 to the present day without skipping a beat","652":"i listened to the audiobook and the narrator drove me crazy the tone of her voice was pleasant but the cadence was really annoying the story was interesting but moved too slowly for me and with too many details i did like it in the end but not enough to recommend it","653":"i think the title and the cover intrigued me more than the reading but this was not lower than a three but not higher either i too thought it was going to be light reading not","654":"i really liked the cover of this book and had a hard time figuring out why a lady would want to be riding around on a bicycle in the china desert keeping in line with the last several debut novels i have read i was very impressed with this book and i was reminded of what true adventure must feel like the reason why a lady might want to ride her bicycle anywhere is to get away from her boring life and not admit to anyone that she's got no plans for her life other than to trot along after her sister who in turn thinks she wants to be a missionary this dual storyline was very well done my preference would have been for the entire book to be about eva but the author did a very good job of keeping present day frieda in contention with eva i did a comprehensive review of the map at the front of the book and i was expecting to do a lot of traveling throughout the story but that was not the case i had to look up several words in my dictionary i doubt i will ever be using them in my conversations however i felt that i took away more from this book than just reading a wonderful story i felt educated in matters that were foreign to me this book does have a serious tone to it i reflected on the social conditions for women over time i realized that money has always been helpful in times of great need monetary bribes seem to be the universal language wherever you go i was impressed with the lavish detail and vivid imagery presented by the author with respect to food and geography i'm not sure about the authenticity of some of the food that was available to the characters but it did leave me with rich images that i did not want to end i was a little disappointed with the final several chapters i cannot detail specifically why but i do know that i wanted eva's story to continue on and on i just was not ready to move on to my next book i think this book could be made into a really good movie","655":"good story modern day setting london and far east in 20's","656":"i don't know why this book got such good reviews there are two plots going on one in the past and one in the present but it ended up to be like some hypothetical sweater i'd try to knit strange patterns that never really become clear stitches dropped all over the place sleeves that don't match and a button or two missing i don't recommend it","657":"really enjoyable fast read beautiful scenes wish there was more i'm missing the characters","658":"not what i expected from the title good story","659":"suzanne joinson's debut novel a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is a dual narrative tale which explores several broad themes such as motherhood belonging and religion with rich language and intricate descriptions the novel opens in 1923 with evangeline eva english describing how she her intensely spiritual sister elizabeth lizzie and their mission leader millicent came to be under house arrest joinson spent two years researching female missionaries of the early twentieth century in addition to specialising in the literature of china and the middle east and it shows the atmosphere and sense of place within eva's narrative is tangible but not overwhelming excerpt from full review of a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar at for books' sake","660":"i'm not sure my review can do justice to this book it's a very complex novel that deals with a number of different themes that linger in your mind as does the desert atmosphere of kashgar in fact the more i think about the book the more interesting i find it the search for self fulfillment how one's life and choices affect the next generation the intersection of cultures the history and culture of kashgar all play important parts in this book the book is populated with people who are trying to escape their lives and find a new way in the present we have frieda and tayeb and in the past there are eva and frieda's mother the contrasts are quite interesting eva's travels to escape her too staid life frieda who travels constantly but longs for roots eva sort of accidentally ends up adopting a baby who then becomes the center of her life while frieda's mother has a husband and child but ends up walking out on them the author does a marvelous job of describing both the physical environment and the disorientation of being in a totally different culture her vivid imagery makes the heat and dust of life in the desert positively real and she brings out the almost surrealistic feeling eva has on several occasions when the layers of a person or a situation she thought she understood are pulled away and she realizes her perceptions had been completely off probably the only reason i wouldn't give this book 4 5 or 5 stars is that the characters all seem to be looking at their own lives from the outside which made me feel a remoteness from them rather than relating closely to them","661":"oh my this cannot be a fair review because i did not even make it through the first disc of the audio book the adjectives irritating and annoying are far to weak to describe the reader every declarative sentence was ended as a question i managed to stay with her into both stories hoping that her reading of the contemporary parts of the novel would not be so overdone but i was destined to disappointment i received the audio book as used and was surprised that only the first disc had been unsealed now i know why i hope those who actually read this book had a better experience with it","662":"i had high expectations for this book and was a little disappointed i really liked the prseent day story i emphasized with the characters and appreciated the illustration of different ways of life in modern day multi cultural london i was expecting more colour in the descriptions of the various silk road cities however for travel writing evanglina's lady cyclist's guide to kashgar had remarkably little about kashgar or the other places she visits of course it makes sense to the extent that her movements were restricted to the house when it became clearly dangerous to wander around town but even the descriptions of the insides are rather brief on may 4th she describes kangs for the first time the kangs are strange beds made of hard mattresses resting above a small brick stove area built underneath the fires keep our bodies warm at night but strangle the night air of oxygen usually the brick stove for the kang would be fed from an adjacent room which serves as a kitchen that doesn't seem to be the case here from the descriptions of lolo's movements in the kitchen if the kang set up was unusual maybe for example because the house was built for a wealthy household it would have been nice to have been told that on may 8th they go to the market in kashgar what they see on that trip is described in less than one paragraph when evangelina arrives in urumqi she simply says urumtsi is very turkic and reminds me of kashgar with its moslem area situated a mile in length from the south gate and the mosques calling their siren songs to stop the men working at noon evangelina tells us she is the first british woman ever to visit urumqi surely she would have wished to tell british women more about the place the descriptions would be suitable for someone well travelled in the region writing to a friend who is similarly well travelled and wordly but surely not for evangelina's audience of victorian ladies","663":"i enjoyed the read very easy but was disappointed at how it unraveled","664":"i found this book quite fascinating the insight into a foreign land in such a tumultuous part of its history following one lady's adventure while also trying to figure out how a modern day story is connected to it kept me never wanting to have to put it down exploring not only land but also emotions beliefs and perceptions a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar leads you on two separate but related journeys i received my copy for free through goodreads first reads","665":"i was very excited to read this book and thought i might enjoy it and was thinking it would remind me of three cups of tea one man's mission to promote peace one school at a time the book began well when 3 missionaries happened upon a pregnant girl about to give birth and helped her deliver the baby the girl died and the story went downhill for me i was confused throughout most of the book it was disjointed and all over the place the story is told in present day as well as the past i found that i enjoyed the present day and the tie in to the book more than the actual story all in all i was disappointed in the book on a positive note the author shows promise as her writing style was very good the book just didn't come together for me 2 5 stars","666":"this is a curious book it is well written with two alternating narratives set apart by 90 years and with interesting heroines there is a lot of plot and it moves along quickly but when you reflect on the whole book somewhat of a spoiler it seems to be all about failed relationships between mothers and daughters and women and men the key characters are single mothers for generations and all have bad relationships with their daughters so not sure what the message is really it seems to be no matter where and when you live and how smart and brave you are you are doomed to a screwed up lonely life the modern story has a suggestion of a happy ending possibly looming in the future but it is very tenuous","667":"loved the central asian setting and the characters who only subtly reveal their true selves the 1924 story is stronger than the contemporary one but i appreciated both beautifully written and the kind of book i want to start again as soon as i've finished it","668":"lovely read if a little sparse on any actual cycling unusual in setting and theme although the historic modern alternating story lines is kind of trendy these days description was vivid and plot was engaging and vaguely suspenseful a close analysis might reveal some weakness of intent or denouement but it was just an enjoyable story so i won't get too picky","669":"at first look i wasn't expecting much a 1920's missionary and her bike don't sound like my kind of thing however it soon got into the action and wasn't slow as i had feared it might be there was lots of drama and the fact it is written about two different women in two different eras without getting confusing shows its well written i liked the fact that the link between them wasn't immediately obvious i shall look out for this author again","670":"a very good read recommend it","671":"i enjoyed this debut novel very much two stories intertwine from present day london to kashgar in 1910 always like novels that deal with social conditions of women look forward to more by this author","672":"joinson presents two separate tales that unfold in alternating chapters until they gradually link together one and the more interesting of the two takes place in 1923 when evangeline eva joins her sister lizzie on a missions trip along the ancient silk road to the city of kashgar the other story is set in present day london a young woman frieda returns from a trip abroad to find tayeb in flight from his homeland of yemen sleeping outside her apartment tayeb and frieda strike up a friendship and then embark on a journey when frieda learns that she has inherited the contents of a stranger's apartment including a live owl joinson reflects on the restrictions of society both in the present and in the past she writes a compulsively readable first novel","673":"another debut novel another winner it seems like 2012 has been a good year for first timers what do you think the latest in this series of good reads for me is a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar by suzanne joinson the action in a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is set in 1923 and involves sisters eva and lizzie they are on their way to do mission work in the chinese governed muslim city of kashgar lizzie despite her frailness is the zealot on this trip although she does have other passions eva who has brought along her prized bicycle is looking for adventure and a possible book contract for a travel guide the third wheel on this journey is millicent frost she is the expert the one who is going to see them to silk road city of kashgar there is also a contemporary side to the novel joinson has divided the action between the missionaries and the story of frieda in present day london let's take a full stop here for a moment when have you ever read a novel that toggles between a historical setting and a contemporary one where the author manages to keep them both of equal interest does the word never come to mind there must have been at least one or two books over the years that i have read that used that device and the miss modern times part has been equal to the historical portion but i cannot for the life of me think of them frieda is a professional expert on islamic youth and little else she is questioning her relationship with a married man helping a homeless filmmaker get on his feet and inheriting things from some mysterious person she seems to have no connection with taybo is the homeless man he is a refugee from yemen whose visa has expired the locales the period details and the politics in lady cyclist's are all layered in with a casual simplicity that creeps up on you no beating you over the head with research here yipee the excellent characterizations in lady cyclist's are successful fed by these details and the plot eva lizzie millicent and frieda are all carefully drawn their very interesting quirks and their search for themselves all come about naturally but don't assume that equates to a see dick and jane kind of obviousness joinson uses her talent to let you bring all of these particulars together and discover for yourself the depths of the idividuals and the relationships can frieda's search for the reasons behind an unknown benefactor's gift the wonderfully interesting inventory of the inheritance her relationship with taybo and her everyday living problems really compete with the story of three white women who take off in 1923 searching for all different freedoms in an unstable country the answer is a surprising yes hats off to joinson for pulling that off in the lady cyclist's guide to kashgar she has married skillful writing with an emotionally and historically rich story about independence abandonment and love","674":"if you don't expect too much this is a good book for the summer holidays i enjoyed reading it although there is not as much depth to the story as the author tries to create","675":"there are some books that just tell me from the outset that i'm not going to like it so i might as well just give it up before i invest too much time in it after struggling through a half dozen chapters i surrendered to that fact won't be finished","676":"it seemed to have great promise but i didn't warm to any of the characters this is one to avoid","677":"interesting plot but the author failed to develop most of the characters later in the book a major life event happens and the main character is almost non reactive to it easy read but not much substance to it","678":"mixed feelings about this book it definitely kept my interest and i wanted to keep reading but in the end i was pretty neutral about it i feel like it had the potential to be a lot more but it somehow fell short for me","679":"this book looked promising but it was a bit messy we switch back and forth between nowadays and older times many characters whose i couldn't identify to","680":"read the avdanced reading copy i love 'cross cultural' reads and loved the story of frieda's great grandmother grandmother doidn't take me long to work the link out 2 sisters and a friend have become 'missionaries' to escape the convetions of english life during the 1920s i loved the 'metaphors' between evangeline's cycle guide she was writing and inspirations for life essentially the story is of frieda discovering her family roots and the unknown grandmother she could have done with as she grew up the high points were the stories of how evangeline survived the silk route and rescuing ai lien irene and frieda discovering her story low points the lousey mother frieda had and how sad that she was a prodcut of irene an interesting insightful read if you enjoy cross cultural fiction","681":"loved this book all the elements of excellent fiction characters that are complex and engaging two fascinating story lines and wonderful writing","682":"adventurous but frustrating a good story though","683":"a more unusual travel book inter twining a story set about 70 years ago with one from today both stories are interesting and the setting for the historical one is very evocative note there isn't much cycling in it","684":"i enjoyed reading about the far east in the pre world war i days the story was interesting but definitely sad in the fact that there were no christians even though the story dealt with two missionary sisters the author's world view is not one that i share but i was interested in her perspective she did write well","685":"felt like a mash up of all the things that are supposed to make a best selling novel for women readers a little poisonwood bible add a little potato peel dash of kite runner throw in some shameful sloppy writing mistakes and there you go two stars for the mother baby story but i am aware that even that is a reader suckering move","686":"first plot was intriguing but i couldn't get past all the sad marital relationships in this book kept skipping parts and then just put the book away in disgust i am christian i am happily married and most of my friends are there is not one happy marriage in this book all are either unmarried having affairs with married men or gay lesbian book is alternating chapter between cyclists and her great granddaughter with that being said i started off reading then skipped frieda's chapters after her affair came out then put whole book down all together i didn't finish the book thought it would be more about her traveling but its really about her being stuck and the granddaughters life sad that all the clergy in the novel were gay and preying on young girls they are groomers didn't finish wish i had not read","687":"historical fiction totally different but interesting read if you like learning about other cultures you won't be able to figure out what happens and may seem a little slow but keep reading it begins in 1923 w sisters eve and lizzie english who are missionaries traveling to kashgar in e turkestan silk rd frieda blaekman is a londoner who is in charge of settling the affairs of a woman she didn't even know she finds her journal and becomes hooked on the story of the sisters the story is told in chapters which bounce back and forth to now and then","688":"disclaimer i received a complimentary copy of the book through goodreads first reads i was not required to post a review the story lines move alternately from 1923 with three main female characters who have traveled to the ancient chinese silk road city of kashgar to serve as missionaries to modern day london where we meet a young woman named frieda who provides the second story line the blurb on the back of the advance copy states that a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar is a major literary debut in the tradition of major pettigrew's last stand and the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society a wonderous richly conceived irresistible debut novel that sweeps the reader away to a different world i have read both the mentioned novels and was enchanted by them so i had high expectations for this book as well i truly wish i could say that i enjoyed it but i found it to be boring disjointed and just plain difficult to read and connect with none of the characters with the possible exception of eva seemed likable or sympathetic and while there was a tie in between the historical and modern story lines that connected the two there was nothing that captured my attention or imagination with either of the stories the book just felt awkward and depressing i started to abandon the book entirely but finished it out in an attempt to be fair","689":"an interesting tale parallel stories that eventually connect one following eva her sister lizzie and companion milicent on a mission in the 1920's to kashgar in the western part of china and the other introduces us to freida in contemporary london who befriends a young yemini artist she finds camped on her doorstep when freida receives a letter advising her of the death of a stranger who has named her as next of kin she sets out to discover who this person is which will require looking up her mother whom she hasn't seen since she was seven years old review coming soon at 'word by word'","690":"this book actually had a great storyline but it just didn't hit the mark the writing just didn't grip me it promised to be so good but was just ok i didn't want to put it down unfinished as i would if i hated it","691":"couldn't put this down interesting mix of adventurem travel missionaries and some surprises has a modern day element and an early 1900's almost victorian element","692":"an interesting book alternating tales of women immersed in different cultures in different generations well written although the revelation was somewhat predictable imho","693":"overall i enjoyed a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar but i didn't find it to be the most compelling book ever it follows the storylines of a contemporary woman named frieda in london and a woman named eva who travels to kashgar in the 1920s for a while the relationship between their two stories is completely unknown but there is a connection in the end more than just telling their stores the author is also trying to convey a general sense of culture clash and the feelings of otherness i found that it was a little too postmodern contemporary for me taste just touching on people's lives without really pulling you in to be a part of their story i also was disappointed that cycling did not play a larger role in the story given the detail but in the end the lady cyclist's guide was just a premise for the story the author wanted to tell","694":"i think i would really like to rate this 3 5 stars but its not 4 so 3 will have to do i enjoyed this one perhaps because of its unusual nature rather than despite it the dual storylines one in the 1920 and the other in contemporary london is not such an unusual technique and you know that there has to be some sort of connection between freida and eva it just takes a while to be revealed its not the point of the story anyway it is more concerned with relationships and understanding to the point of belonging about culture clash and context the apparent lightness implied by the title has to be ironic there is nothing ladylike about the conditions under which eva and her companions travel to kashgar and maybe that's the point in a way women can cope freida in london is trying to extricate from an unsatisfactory relationship with a married man who isn't interested in leaving his wife and family and to understand who it is that has bequeathed her a household of goods and why as uncomfortable as eva feels in the alien lands of kashgar as victimised and vulnerable so tarek the yemeni feels in contemporary england where he is an illegal refugee on the run from the authorities but only seeking peace there are some good points of contrast and comparison in the twin lines and whilst the conclusions are a bit vague life isn't really neatly packaged up into decisive ends when freida finds her long absent mother some mysteries are solved but others emerge like the way the community of which she is a member seek some sort of higher experience of existence by slicing the anchor of their tongue in order to elongate it and achieve some peculiar contortions but the result is that they can no longer talk they no longer have a voice in seeking perfection they lose the power to communicate freely humans are quite deluded really but however peculiar some of the events are the story is engrossing and continued to keep me interested through to the end quite easily","695":"not at all what i expected but mildly enjoyable i loved the line the moment of disorientation when its impossible to tell whether it is the platform moving or the train","696":"a very unique book that took me some time to get into i believe this is only because i suddenly had an influx of books that i had requested from the library so was intent on reading it fast when i finally noticed the poetry in the author's prose i slowed myself down and let myself be taken to places so very foreign to me the story then became more than just a story more like a tone poem in words it shows how religious zeal can so often go awry also how such zeal can have very negative effects when applied blindly i ended up really liking the book","697":"fantastic eloquent writing the kind that makes itself invisible so that the reader is left with the soul of the story joinson pulls this off even with a split narrative looking forward to more from her","698":"loved this book my favorite quotes from eva the bicycle was my shield and my method of escape since the first time i pedaled and felt the freedom of cycling i've known that it is the closest one can get to flying \"wipe clean and feed them and with each action i hollow myself out i am a vessel for their requirements and all this relentless giving has begun to hammer a new shape into me it is the selflessness of mothers and wives i suppose carving rooms inside oneself and allowing love to come running into them like water the danger is that the water could engulf and erase me entirely \"","699":"the prose can't carry this drab story i kept waiting for the story to invoke some kind of emotion but the story falls flat one of the most undramatic books i've ever read","700":"i read this book courtesy of the kind folk at netgalley and found it an enjoyable read its a dual timeline story which is one of my favourite genres and it manages to be a little different to most the story is told from the perspective of two women seemingly unlinked modern day london frieda a young career woman whose work has taken her abroad to some unusual places struggling to maintain her relationship with her inconsiderate married lover her very unconventional upbringing has left her without strong family ties and a yemeni refugee she discovers sleeping outside her apartment becomes an unlikely friend who helps her when she makes an unexpected inheritance with some unusual heirlooms meanwhile we are transported back to the 1920s where we travel to kashgar a remote province of china where 3 young women go under the guise of becoming missionaries however all is not as straightforward as it seems eva the eponymous narrator of this part of the story is more interested in escaping her mundane life in england and seeking adventure travelling and exploring on her beloved bicycle which she takes with her across continents and her journal becomes a book she longs to have published her sister lizzie has been heavily influenced by her missionary friend millicent who's zeal seems somewhat misplaced and eva wonders about her possible ulterior motives at the beginning of the book we are witness to a dreadful event the 3 english women come across a native chinese girl about to give birth and their desire to help just makes matters worse and leaves them in deep trouble mistrusted by the locals and with a new born child to care for there are a lot of seemingly irrelevancies yet most become apparent by the end and the storyline is pretty complex loads going on and you'll not be bored both the contemporary timeline and the historical narratives are richly detailed and quirky in some ways it reminded me of the sandalwood tree and if you enjoyed it i think you'll like this one too an accomplished and fascinating novel for lovers of dual time fiction and historical fiction","701":"first i would like to thank the publishers for giving me the chance to read this book through goodreads first reads giveaway i enjoyed this book far more than i thought i would it was slow to start and i was unsure at to how anything was connected but it picked up and ran along quite nicely once the pieces were set in motion each time the perspective changed i wished that i could have a bit longer with the characters i was currently following which is nothing but a good thing i guessed the pivotal reveal very early on but this did not make the book any less enjoyable i found the story of eva to be the more interesting one and felt that her story was the one that had been given the most depth unfortunately i found that her character was also one of the only ones to be given real depth and so i cared rather less for any of the others overall my main criticism is that the book was rather slow at parts and could benefit from a slight edit as there were points that i was tempted to put the book down i see the mark of a truly classic book as one that i have to tear my eyes from and although this was enjoyable it did not quite hit that mark i recommend it for anyone that likes a good slow burner but unless your willing to take your time which eva telling the story will do you may find your mind wandering reading this 3 5 stars","702":"not the best writing but a really intriguing story i liked visiting such an exotic local without the discomfort of actually being there it was fun to see how the two parallel stories were going to intersect upon a second read i found a lot to like about the writing","703":"it took me a good while to get into this book after a dramatic start i couldn't work out where the story was going to go now that i've finished it i'm somewhere in the middle in terms of between being annoyed of the time wasted in reading it and raving about it","704":"revealing look at the impact and consequences of missionaries in the 1800s in asia and not always for the better would be a good read for those who enjoyed the poisonwood bible","705":"so this was set up like a dual narrative with the stories gradually intertwining over the decades i think the subject matter was strong and i really enjoyed the two stories but i felt like there was too much going on in each of the narratives seriously the kashgar plot could have been an entire book itself and i feel like it wasn't developed enough for me to really ever feel like i entered that world and i really wanted to because it was so foreign so much was going on religious persecution murder trials sexual exploration biking but it was all kept so brief and fleeting ditto for the london plot immigration issues poor parenting a pet owl adultery etc by the end i never really felt like i got to know any of the characters or what made them tick i read it last week and i'm already having difficulty recalling their names it was full of beautiful prose and very interesting subject matter but i don't think it worked in this format i actually think splitting the two stories into two novels would have been more effective when dual narratives work they really work i just didn't see how the two stories complimented each other","706":"two stories one in 1923 kashfar the other in present day london these connect would love to know what happens to the characters fun read","707":"it took me a while to figure out why this book felt odd to me it's starts out to be a great story but then skips two generations i was left with questions as was the character as to how she ended up where she was like i said it took me a while","708":"i loved this book such an unusual story but her attachment to her bicycle really resonated","709":"loved the book and didn't want the story to end","710":"i know you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover but it usually works for me i chose this book because is cover was a lovely optimistic shade of blue but the book let me down there are two different stories in the book but you have to wait till the end to find out how they're linked one story follows evangeline english a girl in the 1920s who has talked her way into accompanying her sister a missionary to kashgar but all she really wants to do is write a book about her adventures the other story is set in the present day and follows frieda a girl who travels as part of her job and gets home london one day to find a man sleeping outside her flat and a letter saying a lady she has never heard of has died and left her all she owns including an owl both of the main characters are very lonely people who spend their lives travelling and don't really seem to fit in anywhere i didn't find their personalities very likable which is why i gave this book such a low rating i was also disappointed by the fact that the book begins with a map showing evangeline's journey through china but after reading more than half the book she hadn't gone anywhere it was an interesting read and the author obviously did a lot of research but i didn't find it very inspiring i received the book free from goodreads after entering a competition","711":"two fascinating tales are told side by side in this vivid debut novel a lady cyclist's guide to kashgar one is an incredible story of sisters two young englishwomen who aspire to become missionaries in remote southeastern turkey in 1923 the alternate chapters tell the story of a young professional woman in present day london her parents were free spirits who we would have called hippies if they were in the usa and she rebelled by seeking out traditional schooling and a career in research one of the sisters in the first tale elizabeth english is committed to taking the gospel to the heathens in remote southeasternturkey but her sister evangeline is just committed to getting out of england and not being left behind by her sister she comes up with the excuse of writing the guide as a ruse and then almost accidentally meets a publisher who is willing to advance her money for her future manuscript so she is more committed than ever to keeping a journal and attempting to write the book in the second tale frieda blakeman has just returned from a work related trip to gather research for a paper on the youth of the islamic world as a part of her government job she hopes to spend the evening with her lover a married man but he fails to come to her apartment oddly a possibly homeless man has followed her home from the train station she winds up offering him a pillow and a blanket as he is intending to spend the night in the hallway in front of her door when she checks the next morning he is gone but the blanket is folded neatly with the pillow and he has decorated her walls with beautiful drawings of birds his name is tayeb and she will meet him again lizzie and eva are traveling with millicent an older experienced female missionary who has a very strong personality and seems to wield an enormous influence on the impressionable lizzie as they approach the end of a very difficult journey through the desert the women hear a woman wailing who turns out to be a very young girl in the throes of child birth millicent determines that they must assist with the delivery though they are not trained nurses or midwives when the birth mother dies the strangers on the road who have stopped to watch accuse the women of killing the young mother and take steps to have the missionaries arrested thus begins their interaction with the people they ostensibly have come to save millicent offers the infant to anyone in the crowd who might be related to the child but no one comes forward she then assigns child care duties to eva back in present day london frieda receives a perplexing letter from the government informing her that she has inherited the contents of a deceased woman's apartment since she is identified in their records as next of kin certain that this is a mistake she calls her dad who doesn't recognize the name frieda's mother had left the commune where the family lived when frieda was 7 and her dad gave her information of her mom's last known whereabouts in case frieda wanted to check with her the book follows both stories switching back and forth as they move toward the point where the seemingly disparate stories eventually merge in the meantime we see how cultural differences and language barriers affect communication and community and how love and sacrifice intertwine to create a whole new story quite the good read with lots to ponder when at last the tale has been told","712":"i was totally immersed in this story while reading the book particularly the story that takes place in kashgar i was able to lose myself in time and place and journey with evangeline among the peoples of eastern turkestan the clash of culture religion and relationships of the characters drive this novel and the exotic locations make it a fascinating read","713":"an original story partly set in an incredible part of the world during an islamic uprising counterbalanced by another narrative set in modern london descriptive emotive clever and enjoyable","714":"was not to sure to start with but did enjoy it loved the description of the back yard full of plants i presume though that frieda's mother looked completely anglo saxon with no hint of her foreign ancestor not saying it's not possible but perhaps a bit of a plot fudge","715":"fascinating during that time period reading a bike not like the bikes we have today and in the clothes women wore back then oh my i do like the past present there's quite a few books i've read lately that do that","716":"very enjoyable highly recommended well written well plotted looking forward to reading more by this author summary girl's father dies so she accompanies her missionary sister and another missionary on a trip east keeps a diary to write a book they encounter trouble in kashgar she escapes back to england starts in 1923 flashes back and forth between then and present day","717":"mixed feelings i listened to this on cd in the car during a fairly long trip and it served me well in that capacity i wanted to like it more than i did it certainly provided interesting insights into what life would have been like in an extremely remote part of what is now china in the early 20th century for a small group of female european missionaries but while it offered lots of the stress which could have appeared in any high pressure situation a lot of the day to day details of life were left out oddly enough there is almost nothing about the main character eva actually riding her bicycle although there are a lot of notes for the guide she hopes to publish she says riding her bicycle makes her feel free as if she is flying but she spends very little time actually riding her bike and is most often pushing it i was also a little put off that there are a handful of gay characters only two of whom are not predatory in nature the moral at the risk of ruining the end seems to be that if you stay put or follow your dream you will be equally miserable but at least if you stay put you will be safe and cause a lot less distress for those around you","718":"if you choose to begin your book with the dramatic scenario of an underage girl giving birth with the help of traveling missionaries and forceps it should be believable in this case it isn't but what it is is gratuitous in all the wrong places and a cheap tactic in place of a genuine hook this book rests on flimsy foundations","719":"the story of 2 women living about 90 years apart but both traveling through the muslim world loving travel and history i greatly enjoyed the story of kashgar in the 20s the current woman is in england just returned from a trip when she meets a strange man who camps on her doorstep the comparisons contrasts of the 2 worlds is fascinating an excellent tale of adventure abroad and discovery at home","720":"didn't like this book for the first few chapters but then became more drawn to the story and the style in which it's written am a little confused still about the relationship between eva freida and irene guy although i'm sure if i read it again it would be more clear it proved to be a very interesting story","721":"i enjoyed both the present and past storylines in this book however once the book was over i wanted to know more i wanted more about irene guy as an adult and her distant interest in frieda i also wanted more of tayeb's story","722":" a group of english ladies set off to convert the peoples of central asia when problems arise because of the death of a woman in childbirth eva inherits a young baby and vows to look after her later her sister dies and she has to flee leaving her compatriot and fellow missionary to face her fate the one thing that keeps her going apart from the baby now called eileen is her manuscript about cycling in the present day frieda inherits the contents of an elderly lady's flat which contains various items written in arabic plus a photo of frieda's mother obviously pregnant the two stories interweave to fill in details from frieda's past and to give a very rich picture of inter racial life victorian times this is a great read","723":"the first chapter appealed to my historical fiction sensibilities the switch to modern day in the second chapter really piqued my interest but then the momentum slowed too much and it was difficult to regain interest i think the characters and the sense that their development is key to the story could be enough to entice other readers to muscle through but i have too much other reading material at this time to attempt it","724":"i think i enjoyed the title and cover art of this book more than the actual stories yes stories two narratives one set at the turn of the 20th century another set in present day london and the dots will be connected by the last page as is often the case i found myself more interested in one story line the lady cyclist of the title and reading more impatiently through the present day story for me i think the problem was that the character who is the link between the two stories is never really there in either","725":"quite interesting and entertaining","726":"two plotlines start out miles apart but then interweave to create a complex past for the main modern character frieda i admit i enjoyed the 1920's story more because evangeline and her sister lizzie were written in a more detailed and personal way i wanted to see evil millicent and she was evil a missionary who lured hurting young women in to her lesbian grasp and got at least two of them killed hang i understood the muslim anger at invaders trying to steal and convert their daughters great first novel although the ending was a little too quick and neatly tied up

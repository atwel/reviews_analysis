overcrowded lifeboat grace knows that some around her must die and that she doesn't want to be among them rogan's brilliant tactic as a novelist is to give grace just enough narrative rope to hang herself while leaving the reader to judge whether she should this book is definitely worth the read and the psychological twists keep you interested to the very end","7":" this story takes place in 1914 the narrator is 22 year old grace winters she is newly married and also newly widowed when on her honeymoon travelling from london to new york the ocean liner explodes and quickly sinks she survives a long wait on a lifeboat with 31 other people but very few of them make it the story actually starts with grace awaiting trial for murder then the story goes back and forth in time to see

like to try to survive at sea in a lifeboat for a month hard to imagine these days was fascintating i do feel that it feel short in that you really do not find out what happened to the supposed heroine in the end other than the result of the trial say no more enjoy","10":"started slow but developed the characters nicely the trial got long and drawn out but overall a worthwhile read","11":"reasonable psychological thriller reads like a late atwood which is by the way a huge compliment","12":"would have rated it 3 5 if i could have that is the score it really deserved when i compare this book to others on my 4 star list it doesn't quite measure up however i do think it better than many of my 3 star books","13":" i was excited to read the lifeboat unfortunately it wasn't very exciting i didn't care for any of the characters which made it hard to get into the book people died people lived i honestly didn't care i just kept reading to see if something happened the book contains plenty of drama and events considering it takes place in a lifeboat for days but it just didn't read well for me i found it a bit boring not boring exactly just not interesting grace the main character just didn't seem relateable to at all she tricks an engaged man into falling in love with her and seems only to care about herself hard to pity her i think if i had found the characters more likable i would have enjoyed this book much more","14":" this is a work of american fiction that broke the mold the narrative is a naive unreliable narrator rare in a female character rogan knows more about her than she does and the result is a microcosmic mirror of the novel's macrocosmic theme about the indeterminacy and ambiguity in human morality the characters are literally at sea in a lifeboat after a luxury liner bursts into flames a year after the titanic there are many layers to this book layers of tension theme plot development and the character herself perhaps the end is too hasty and a key point of tension that could be told within the time frame of the narrative is told in retrospect nonetheless this is a book that deserves the praisse it's gotten in the midst of all the safe fiction that conforms to a template","15":"interesting period piece but wanted to push the main character off the boat by the end","16":"not quite as gripping as i would have thought but the main character keeps one guessing is she lying about what she remembers or not i read it in an afternoon and it held my interest and the denouement is kept cleverly delayed","17":"could have been much better","18":"i agree with a fellow reviewer that while i enjoyed the book i found the ending vaguely unsatisfying and lacking it is intriguing and a quick read however and helped me get closer to my yearly reading goal","19":"i was expecting a better ending good beginning and middle but fell short quick read and it does make you think what you might do in the same situation","20":" hard to put down story of 39 people trying to survive in the atlantic after their ship went down the narrator grace winter has been accused of murder along with two other women to help with her defense her lawyers have asked her to record what she remembers of the events at sea the story tells of the struggles with the weather with depleted stores of food and fresh water and with each other that the final 28 survivors overcame before they were rescued perhaps the most interesting aspect of this story is the psychological study of how people react in times of crisis and of the lengths some people will go to come out on top","21":"i just finished reading the lifeboat and though in some ways it should really only receive a 3 star rating from me i found it a bit redundant at times i boosted it a bit because i actually really liked some of the lines in the story and i could very much relate to the personality of the main character","22":"this book was better than i expected from the reviews i enjoyed some of it i think that the main character was very unlikable she schemed and lied then was unsympathetic empathetic so it was hard to relate with her the circumstances however were interesting to read about i feel the ending could have used more zing a little let down in that area i would read only if you have nothing else to do not bad but not good either","23":" i was really pumped up to read this book after reading several gushing and amazing reviews of it in magazines and it wasn't quite what i was expecting this is not really a book about surviving at sea in a lifeboat although that is the exact situation that our narrator 22 year old newlywed grace winter finds herself in after the ship she is sailing on with her new husband sinks instead the book is about our very unreliable narrator and trying to figure out the truth of who grace winter really is and what role she played in what happened on the lifeboat she is on trial when the books starts so we know that something happened i expected to be blown away by this book but i wasn't if you're thinking this is a survival book it isn't it is really a psychological thriller masquerading as a survival book the 1914 setting may appeal to some these are proper ladies in full dress after all but i suspect it may end up disappointing you as much as it did me still i was interested in the character of grace and figuring out the truth of her situation you'll want to have someone to discuss it with afterward though","24":"interesting story it certainly lends itself to good discussion topics however overall i was disappointed and bored by the lack of character development","25":"this book had so many possibilities but i thought it fell flat i didn't find the character development was thorough and the ending left me feeling like i had missed something","26":"the narrator really made this book she wasn't entirely likable but the ambiguity of her character matched the tone of the story i kept thinking of the alfred hitchcock movie lifeboat while i read this but the book didn't suffer from the comparison it was perfectly crafted psychologically riveting and very suspenseful","27":"i really liked this book a lot i so wanted to read it and couldn't find it from the library so bought it for kindle so you can borrow it if you want it's about another shipwreck that happened around the time of the titanic and the story of the survivors in the lifeboats pretty good stuff","28":"i loved the idea of this book the growing tensions between the characters in the lifeboat were skillfully teased out i had trouble liking the narrator u0026amp main character grace but in retrospect i think that's what the author intended for readers to have mixed feelings about her to not know what to make of her it's well written u0026amp paced i think the reason i haven't given it more stars is merely because i thought the ending was far too convenient","29":"i love twisty narratives with slippery unreliable narrators and this book delivers in spades the fact that it included an ethical dilemma and explored female power humanity and memory makes it the best book i've read so far this year","30":"it was entirely different from what i expected it seemed to drag on and have few actual scenes rather than a bunch of inner dialogue i felt like it really started somewhere but never reached its destination and left too many questions unanswered","31":"good fast tale of the psychology of survival in a lifeboat the politics the pressures the decisions etc","32":"i felt i was in the life boat adrift at sea","33":"i'm not sure what i think about this book creepy comes to mind i didn't like any of the characters but i don't think i was supposed to the narrator was unreliable which was a bit disconcerting as you tried to figure out what happened on the lifeboat i can't say i enjoyed it but didn't dislike it i know i never want to be stranded on a lifeboat with 40 other people the book was well written and i think i was left with the feeling the author wanted me to have","34":" grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes rate this 5 5 because i thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it in 2 sittings a very well written book about how people fare under life and death circumstances and how they have to make hard choices in order to survive","35":"i grabbed this at quail ridge bookstore in raleigh on my way to the beach and i read a positive review in the store it was a quick read because i couldn't put it down perfect beach read very suspenseful not left hanging and surprising twists i rated it highly mostly because it fit exactly what i was looking for well developed light read","36":" the lifeboat

pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes my thoughts and opinion even though this book was not about the titanic i thought it fitting to read during it's 100th anniversary there is one mention of the above named ship within the book however because of the premise i was able to vividly create my images from when i did see the movie titanic the book grips you in the prologue when grace the main character is standing on on u s land with head raised mouth opened trying to catch the rain and on her way into court where she stands on trial for murder murder i'm hooked the reader is then taken to the ship when passengers are being loaded into lifeboats grace a newlywed managed to secure a seat in one with the help of her husband who was left behind as the ship is sinking the book continues with a daily recap of the passengers and survival in a lifeboat for 21 days from grace's perspective the characters were aptly described and could be visualized the setting and description the same the book was a quick read kept my interest because i couldn't imagine why a murder charge however the overall 21 days at sea story was at first a page turner but and this is my opinion only then seemed to drag at times and details that were omitted until the end felt unrealistic when the book was finished again this is my opinion but felt that the plot lacked action at times due to circumstances of the story line as i said the imagery i created was due to the movie which helped greatly even though it kept my interest i expected more maybe due to all the titanic hype this month overall it was a fast 274 pages and entertaining read my rating 3 2012 challenges mystery suspense what's in a name off the shelf freereads where are you a z merely mystery 52 in 52 outdo yourself 100 reagan arthur","37":"a little choppy much like being in a lifeboat with a bunch of strangers for 21 days","38":"i had high hopes but it was just eh","39":"this book was an easy read even if the main character was not always likable this book may deserve a higher rating but it had the misfortune of being read immediately after the sense of an ending which i thoroughly enjoyed","40":" lifeboat snapped me to attention with its opening line delivered in the prologue today i shocked the lawyers and it surprised me the effect i could have on them a first line might not make or break a book but it can set the tone and draw you in this one tickled my curiosity to read on and find out the who what and why this is the perfect book to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the titanic if you've ever wondered what it might be like to be forced to abandon your comfy stateroom for the uncertainty of survival in a lifeboat lifeboat is realistic enough to give you a glimpse rather than start with the explosion that caused the ditch to sea of the passengers of the empress alexandra lifeboat's first pages begin with day one the survivors silent in the lifeboat either acknowledging or not their fate the lifeboat #14 the one we're privy too was one of the last to be launched is taken charge of by one of the ship's mates mr hardie this seems lucky for its flock as mr hardie has much knowledge of the sea rationing supplies weather sailing etc the main narrator is grace winter age 22 both a newlywed and a widow she sees mr hardie as a godsend to her plight if anyone can get them rescued mr hardie seems the likely choice not all would agree while the inhabitants of the titanic lifeboats were rescued rapidly most within hours we quickly learn that lifeboat #14 is not to be so lucky it is apparent that this lifeboat is overcrowded 39 passengers and though it should hold 40 cost reductions to its design make it inadequate to hold that many at the outset the 39 passengers are not named but are slowly introduced throughout the narrative a clever device used by the author i found myself writing down their names keeping track each much like friends as i continued reading i started to wonder which of the survivors was a reliable narrator and who might be manipulating me mr hardie grace mrs grant each of these and a few others the strongest personalities aboard lifeboat presents complexities and moral issues there is much to think about much to talk about as each day goes by and the fate of the survivors becomes contingent on weather their numbers space water and food supplies who lives who dies the lines between good and evil become murkier and a person's choices less black and white lifeboat seems to be a realistic portrayal of a shipwreck and its aftermath it would make for a great book discussion","41":" boring i just couldn't get into the story or even care about any of the characters in fact if you asked me what this book is about i'd probably answer um a girl is on a lifeboat w other passengers from a ship u0026amp they float around the ocean for a while that pretty much sums it for me even though i tried really hard to pay attention to this audio i tuned it out 30% of the time the best part of this book was the synopsis which makes it sound really good u0026amp interesting unfortunately for me it wasn't either","42":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book dragged on forever it started in her trial and then went back and forth between the past and current wouldn't recommend it but it was worth a shot","43":"a book about a shipwreck and the survivors on lifeboat 14 as told by one woman on the boat i was impressed by the wisdom and knowledge offered by this survivor grace although i found it hard to believe she was so well schooled and articulate given the impression by other women how suppressed they were this story takes place shortly after the marconi wireless was put on ships and before the lusitania's sinking there were many good quotes and thoughts throughout the story really touches on what can happen to human beings when put in life death situations what animal instincts kick in and the struggle for survival supposedly one's true character comes through i'd like to disagree with that i'd like to think that one's true character is how we are in the day to day the way we control our thoughts show kindness to others and curb the natural man's desires yes human nature kicks in when in survival fight or flight mode but i'd hate to have that define who i truly was in such a dire situation i'd hope i was kind and selfless in such a situation but until you are there you never know","44":"this book was not what i expected but was enjoyable none the less a fast read that paints a vivid picture of a complex senerio","45":"what would i do what would you do","46":"eerie grisly really a psychological thriller in many ways as well as a fascinating look at the class structure and mores of the time","47":"this was a very good book well worth a read","48":" there are many books written about people in a lifeboat or even facedown in a rock cleft in which the tide rain and edible things come and go but this one has a couple of unique qualities first there is no cannibalism second the key character grace is one of those elusive not quite trustable persons the woman reflects over her life and her recent marriage to a wealthy man whom she lured away from another woman this is the aspect that i strained at she does not appear to have had great seductive skills nor character the author just has her accomplish the feat of taking this man away from his fiance who did not appear to be unloveable and was from a good family grace was relatively poor and was not described as particularly enchanting the depiction of their young marriage and trip to europe also did not seem promising yet here she is in a lifeboat with some reflections along the line of why me lord but not very deep rather we are given a day by day accounting of herself the sailor who captains this lifeboat and the other occupants who dies who lives and how they live from the author's notes and the foretelling the book was inspired by some legal notes from a real event the issue that supposedly drives the story is the fact that the survivors are judged by whether they murdered others in the boat to survive and grace the young woman is the one not immediately exonerated i do not know whether the author wanted us to be ambivalent about grace but that is the impression i got the one deep reflection from grace is her wondering in different forms from the time she got into the lifeboat about the circumstances of her being the one saved she does not seem to reflect on her deservingness but rather things like whether her young husband paid for her to be included she reflects on others in the closes nearby lifeboat who were kicked off to keep their boat from being overcrowded in spite of my reaction to grace the key character i found the book very well written and the story kept me involved throughout i look forward to reading more from charlotte rogan","49":"i was reading three books at once normal for me and this was the only one of the three that i actually finished i think it only made it that far because the other two were so unlikable this one was slow and because the setting is the main character didn't keep me page turning it is well written but just never hooked me","50":"i thought this book was a great read i found the characters to be well portrayed and very believable the book was well written and provided a lot of suspense to keep me turning the pages i'd recommend","51":" wanted to throw myself overboard by chapter three rather than read any more but i did it was hell the idea is great rags to riches governess is in a lusitania type sinking in an overfilled boat everything's there but it is as tedious as being stuck on that boat rogan writes well above average in many ways but in the all fashionable first person which all publishers now seem to like even then we don't engage with the main character and if you can't nab us in the first person well this is such a wasted opportunity if the writer had gone into what happened on the boat before it sank or into the key characters on the lifeboat it could have really worked instead we get endless tedium of the skies and infighting this isn't a new idea and hitchcock's film did it way better rogan is let down by the publisher editor and agent who surely must have seen the flaws in this book surely due to the reviews and publicity i bought this book but it was clearly rushed out in titanic year sadly because rogan could do better i won't buy another","52":"i enjoyed this book it was a quick read one thing that was confusing was how she ended up with henry i am also interested if his mother knew about them","53":"a unique character study in peer pressure bullying and acceptance in adults interesting this book was extremely wordy the story could have been told in fewer pages i kept trying to pick out pertinent sentences from the lengthy paragraphs and skip the rest but it was challenging i soldiered on i really loved the premise so i wanted to stick with it to the conclusion which unfortunately felt a little anticlimactic and rushed after all the thought that went into the rest of the book that said i liked the book a lot it was very thought provoking and somewhat believable however without giving away spoilers the motivation of some of the characters was unclear but if you're looking for a quick read this isn't it","54":"uninteresting 3 4 of the novel takes place in the boat making for an invariable landscape the protagonist's purportedly strong voice sounds more like an emotional parrot than a charlotte bronte personality pass on this one","55":"had higher hopes after what i had read about the book","56":"this one has gotten a lot of press since it's release a couple of months ago it was well written and well plotted fairly existential asks a big question how far would you go to survive i didn't really feel like there was an answer which is of course what makes it existential i would recommend this mainly for how well written it is","57":"would actually give it 3 5 stars if i could enjoyable book which kept my curiosity up though never addressed nor answered some mysteries unraveled in the story since the protagonist didn't know the answers it kind of works however in this case","58":"a very interesting book i like it cause you have to change your perception of the characters in this book can you really trust the narrator it's not as claustrophobic as a book about a sinking ship might be so for that i'm grateful my book circle had very interesting discussions about this one for sure i recommend it","59":"told from the point of a view of a woman on trial for murder she is accused of killing a man on a lifeboat that a group of people spent a few weeks on after their ship caught fire the story isn't exciting i am sure that that many days on a lifeboat without food necessities takes a toll on your mind and body i was hoping the author would have gone into that a bit more","60":"i found this story engaging in that it made me think about what it would be like to be stranded with strangers for ten days in a life threatening situation what i liked about the book was that it examined the dynamics of people in a survival situation doing things that they never thought they'd do an example was that they passed by a child stranded on some wreckage because to rescue him would result in capsizing their lifeboat and bringing death to them all what i questioned about the book was the feasibility of survivors facing murder charges once rescued all the people in the lifeboat were guilty of being responsible for peoples' deaths see example above they could also be guilty in the situation where they drew straws to determine who would jump overboard was it murder or was it doing whatever they needed to do to stay alive for a first novel i was impressed with the story and how it drew me in","61":"i loved this as i was reading it but really felt in unsatisfied with the ending which on some level i appreciate because things rarely resolve in a tidy way but there didn't seem to be much learned by the character about herself after this experience that should have been life changing","62":"interminably dull","63":"this book has an interesting premise set four years after the titanic has sunk a ship on its way from england to the us catches fire people are loaded into lifeboats which are supposed to accomodate 40 people but actually hold only 38 the narrator is a recent bride whose husband gets her passage on this lifeboat though he humself cannot be accomodated the story of the 21 days they spend on the lifeboat and the interactions between the occupants as well as the aftermath when they are rescued makes for fascinating reading","64":" i was so looking forward to reading this book i really wanted to like it but it was such a disappointment i have to give credit to the author as this was an extremely ambitious book to limit the majority of the book to one small setting was a very brave idea however it does not pay off unfortunately i was actually really surprised at how tedious the book became while describing the trials of the lifeboat's occupants you would think that there would be a slow building tension as they slowly succumb to dehydration starvation and exhaustion but the pace and atmosphere just sort of limped along i did find myself at one point hoping that the boat would just sink just to end the monotony i did have an issue with connecting to the main character grace she comes across very cold calculating and unemotional it's difficult to read a book where there is only one setting and the main character is so stone hearted that you don't care if she lives or dies i really can't see what all the hype was about for this book and after reading voices from the titanic the epic story of the tragedy from the people who were there the lifeboat is no comparison and not even an entertaining fictionalisation of similar events read the real thing you can't beat it","65":"ah lolita my little lo no wait that was my last review but while we're on the subject did anyone else notice the similarity of format a person who has been arrested telling their story to a jury lawyer as part of their defense but that is where the similarities end i wanted to like this book more than i did ms rogan is a good writer but i can't say she's a good storyteller there's a big difference there are several poetic sentences and wonderful insights about life and people ms rogan did not rush the ending--it was nicely drawn out it's obvioous she poured her heart and soul into the novel in the story grace winter the protagonist is on trial for murder and yet she is calm placid naive clueless the only thing believable this woman did was to intentionally accidentally meet a wealthy man who was already engaged and steal him away she was portrayed as a victim all the way through to the end larry brooks of storyfix wouldn't like that the novel on the whole could have and should have had so much violence tension and fear but it really just skated over the surface of the narrative just try to imagine 21 days at sea in an overcrowded boat with dozens of scared hungry strangers the narrative timeline felt disjointed to me jumping back and forth and forth again between the past the lifeboat and the trial sometimes all in the same paragraph also the dialogue did not ring true to the time period 1914 lastly and i don't know why this hasn't been talked about more is the undeniable similarity to the alfred hitchcock movie also calld the lifeboat which was written by john steinbeck in all the press i've read about his book and author everywhere from people magazine to oprah magazine to the new york times i've not heard her give any credit to either of those men coincidence yeah no i'd like to give this 2 1 2 stars but i'll round up to three stars because i feel a connection to ms rogan a wife mother and self taught author throwing her heart out there for people like me to critique keep writing","66":"exquisitely designed and constructed this book will take you on a cruise you never hoped to go on in reality the one ending on a lifeboat in the worst of circumstances here is the fictional journey on that boat what would it be like how would i fare could i bear it here if you you are curious and lean overboard you can observe the reflexion of your image along with the other passengers' images you can test not only your survival skills but your moral mettle would you in an overcrowded lifeboat beat away the others your honesty is on display to yourself what do you admit to on view therefore is just not the magnificent meeting of the sea and the sky but human nature listen too to its internal soliloquy and subliminal murmurs observe the magnetic fields of power and once onshore track the faults and fissures of human justice included is an appointment with your god but to come down to the rivets of this books construction it is solid and so is the historical tenor take this journey for ever since odysseus the unbearable had been made to float for us humans in the vessels of poetry i enjoyed the elegance of this book's construction as well as its meditative quality and i was sorry when it was over","67":"not very good the beginning was promising and the prose is well written but the characters were totally flat and there's no tension in the story i basically skimmed the second half hoping there would be some sort of twist that would make me feel like it had been worth it no luck can't recommend this book","68":"this is a great read until the story leaves the lifeboat then it loses interest","69":"gripping twisted book loved every moment twist and turn ideal for a reading binge","70":"really enjoyed this could have been a real dog of a book but she kept my interest throughout and i wasn't sure whether i liked grace or not right up to the last page","71":" an apology in advance for the following sentence i found the prose dry and listless by the end of the book i see that grace's first person account of her lifeboat experience requires the ambiguity that can only come with waves her remarkable strength matches her incredible naivete ultimately however i see outsmarting us all both the characters in the lifeboat and me the reader both situational and dramatic irony at work it would be a great book group read because the ambiguities of interpretations could be discussed late into the evening","72":"great story but disappointing ending","73":"we just discussed this book at one of my book clubs and the consensus was that the vagueness took away from the story we wanted more details we wanted a conclusion we felt we had earned knowing the endings and unanswered questions spoilersis grace a lesbian what was in the box jewels what happened between henry and mr hardie before grace was put on the lifeboat had henry managed to radio his mother or did he opt not to were mr blake and mr hardie involved in a nefarious scheme why did they hate each other were hardie's intentions honourable why would he not have raised the sail as it is clearly what put them into the path of rescue it could have been a much stronger book if it had a bit more fire passion and less ambiguity we found out that it will be a movie apparently starring anne hathaway two people in the club said they'd see it just to see if it gave more answers than the book did it is a good book read it then tell me if you think you wanted more answers too","74":"this is a book about hard choices and survival the lifeboat is a novel about the aftermath of an ocean liner that experiences an explosion the reader is introduced to the occupants of a lifeboat that is overcrowded at sea hoping to be rescued and unsure of who else has survived the story is told from the perspective of grace who was on the ocean liner returning from her whirlwind marriage with monied henry to meet his family for the first time grace is a complex woman especially for 1914 her views about herself and her situation in life are forward thinking her account of what went on in the lifeboat and her thoughts about those who she shared this life and death time with are poignant while i felt that some of the story got bogged down with her musings overall this was an interesting book","75":"quick read the first person narrative is easy to follow the novel starts by telling the reader part of the ending and then flashes back to the experiences on the life boat a true page turner","76":"interesting character study food for thought not sure what i think of grace yet","77":"i thought this book was really interesting it went inside the minds of people lost at sea so there were a lot of ethical dilemmas the characters faced i think this would be a great discussion book for a book club","78":"misery typical oprah book miserable","79":"lots going on in this book exciting to follow the saga that at times keeps you on the edge of your seat","80":"though the premise is interesting i ended up skimming the book grace is one of 39 people on a lifeboat after an accident on an ocean liner yet i couldn't root for her i didn't feel a connection with her or any of the other survivors","81":"started quickly but then it dragged i didn't like any of the characters and so it didn't really matter to me who lived or drowned and in a lifeboat you always have to chuck a few over the side","82":"this would be a great book club book so much to discuss","83":"i really wanted to like the lifeboat and i did enjoy it for the most part if you can say you enjoy reading about passengers of a lifeboat trying to survive the elements of the atlantic ocean i originally bought this book to give as a christmas present to my mom i'm glad i read it before i gave it to her as i know that she wouldn't have finished it there were way too many people in the lifeboat literally and figuratively it was extremely hard to remember who was who i probably wouldn't have gotten as frustrated with the book if it had a schematic of the lifeboat with a seating chart of the passengers another sticking point for me was that the trial u0026amp the relationship of grace u0026amp her husband were not as developed as the lifeboat ordeal it seemed like those chapters were just thrown in as filler i would have given the book to my mother if the novel wasn't as disjointed and the number of characters were wittled down","84":"while i liked this i can't say i loved it i think to keep the ambiguity of grace going throughout the story we lost the ability to root for her the trial was very esoteric i enjoyed the philosophy of the argument but i also lost the thread of it a couple of times as well","85":"the lifeboat is about the survivors of the sinking of an ocean liner in 1914 it's not about the titanic there are references to it in this book so we're dealing with a completely different boat and different circumstances although pretty much everything else is the same too many people not enough lifeboats and it's a life and death struggle to get in the few lifeboats available the difference with this book is what if no mayday alert got out what if those survivors in the lifeboats spent nearly a month at sea waiting to be rescued the lifeboat is told from the viewpoint of 22 year old grace winter she is recalling her time spent in the lifeboat while she is on trial for murder grace details the everyday struggles the 39 people had to endure to stay alive on the small boat while they suffered from starvation dehydration and exposure to the elements for the most part i really liked this book i'm always a sucker for a survival story and especially when women are the strong ones i did have questions when i finished this book why the ship sank was never explained the secrets of the boxes weren't ever told in full although the contents were somewhat hinted at some of the actions of john hardie the ship's mate didn't make sense and i guess it was chalked up to madness brought on by starvation but i don't know it felt like there was more to it but it wasn't explained http fromthetbrpile blogspot com 20","86":"this was an enthralling page turner i was excited to read this book but at the same time really questioned how interesting it could be i mean what can happen on a tiny boat for 200 and some pages that would keep the pages turning the style of writing kept me reading and the characters circumstances intrigued me as they changed throughout the story","87":"couldn't quite get into this book i liked the story line but i didn't enjoy the way it ended","88":"this book was an interesting look at human nature when a group of people are trapped together in a lifeboat for an extended period of time","89":"this is the first book that i have started and never finished ever while the story had the potential of being good it was so boring it was the same thing chapter after chapter they were adrift hungry dehydrated and argued constantly it was not a fun read i have no problem reading dark even depressing books but this was just blah i might pick it up again and finish it to see if i ended it to quickly but i was far along in the book with no reprieve in sight for me i think i made the right choice to stop reading it i think others could enjoy it and hope my review does not deter them from reading it everyone likes different things and this is only my opinion you might end up loving the book always take the chance if you think it sounds like something you'd like even an unfinished boring read is never wasted time to me","90":" at first glance the lifeboat seems to be a typical survival story meant for escapist adventure lovers but is i much more than a tale about 39 people hanging on to life in the sea no this rather dryly told struggle explores the political life of its characters the struggle for power becomes more of a concern than the prospect of drowning adding to the drama is the position of women vs men a prominent issue of 1914 where the status of women played out in the wider world here on this small boat we see up close how this issue effects the survival of the boats inhabitants and influences their ultimate destiny lifeboat is a book that will linger in your mind and evoke discussions among people who have read it","91":"i absolutely loved this don't really get all the negative reviews so eerie a total page turner the actual situation in the lifeboat is thrilling and grace herself is quite a character perfect for a beach read","92":"such an interesting story idea survivors in a lifeboat how they change toward each other amidst their shifting circumstances i felt the characters however were not so well defined that i was completely drawn in many were painted with mere snatches of recalled dialogue making it hard to follow","93":"it was about people in a life boat don't expect huge action but like how it dealt with it all","94":"the themes in this book are screaming to be discussed primarily how reliable is the narrator i can't wait for someone to chat with me about that one also how do privilege class and appearance affect others' perceptions of our guilt and innocence i don't want to be friends with any of the characters but i can't stop thinking about them","95":" this is probably a 3 5 star book for me i loved the opening sentence today i shocked the lawyers and it surprised me the effect i could have on them and i thought that the story could make for a good movie exploring how people react when adrift on the ocean with no real prospect of rescue the reason i didn't give it a higher rating despite liking the writing was that i didn't feel it really explored any new ground we have had enough real life stories of people stranded for long periods in perilous circumstances to know the kinds of tricks their minds play and how the need for survival causes them to face the most fundamental moral dilemmas forcing each person to come face to face with what it means to be human and where they will draw the line on what they will or will not do if their life depends on it alert some may consider the next sentence a spoiler stop now if you are concerned about this i was also bothered by foreshadowing that seemed to promise more layers of intrigue and more of a surprise ending than the book delivered to me it all seemed fairly predictable","96":"maybe i missed some stuff because i was listening to the audiobook but there were a lot of loose ends here i was going to give this 3 stars because i liked it okay but the ending or lack thereof annoyed me i also thought the narrator wasn't very well defined","97":" an enjoyable book the plot is well conceived and interestingly constructed so i wanted to read on to learn what happened particularly what happened on the boat i was less interested in learning about the resulting trial grace the narrator is a flawed calculating person intensely dedicated to being sure she survives and sure she succeeds in life her memory is also flawed but mostly grace is just very selective in what she chooses to recall and what she chooses to tell the book is reminiscent of remains of the day with the narrator's beliefs and actions revealed slowly and piecemeal where everything is not quite what it seems however the lifeboat is not nearly as good the writing not nearly as nuanced two critiques the characters other than grace are numerous and not clearly drawn necessarily there are too many people for the lifeboat but that makes too many characters for the book also the days in the boat become repetitive necessarily the story needs to build slowly and be revealed piece by piece but that means the days begin to blur together all that said the lifeboat is still an entertaining read","98":"story is like life of pi without the magic ocean liner sinks and grace is in an overcrowded lifeboat story is from grace's view can't tell if grace is good or bad book club discussion could be enlightening","99":"the lifeboat is the story of what happens after an ocean liner sinks leaving some of the passengers stranded in a lifeboat the protagonist is grace winter a recently married woman events that occur on the boat lead to grace and two other women being charged with murder the book starts in the present time goes back to the events on the lifeboat and then returns to the trial the book is set in 1914 the language is a bit stilted but it fits the time i guess there are some mysteries left unsolved at the end of the book and the ending isn't terribly satisfying but i was pretty eager to find out how everything would work out so that made it a good read","100":"this is a thought provoking book well written but not easy to read because of the subject the narrator is both unreliable and not particularly likable the author raises lots of interesting issues which makes the novel great for a book club discussion","101":"grace winter in involved in an ocean liner disaster in 1914 and her new husband secures her a seat on a lifeboat which has no room for him in fact the lifeboat is over capacity and as the people on board suffer through many days they have to make decisions about not only how to survive but who should survive the novel opens with grace in prison awaiting trial for her actions during her captivity on the lifeboat her lawyers suggest she write an account of what happened on the lifeboat so they can work on her defense most of the book is that diary but the reader wonders if it is all truth or grace trying to bend the truth to show her innocence i thought the book was pretty well done but the setting the lifeboat was too confining for me if that makes sense even with some flashbacks explaining her childhood and her marriage i got impatient with being stuck on the lifeboat","102":"compelling reading i could not put this book down i am looking forward to discussing it at book club","103":"this book got excellent reviews i have no idea why","104":"this book seemed so interesting and had great reviews so i was excited to read it unfortunately it was not what i had expected i tried so hard to get into the book and like it i failed to make a connection to any of the characters or even understood what they were about","105":"i can't say i was mesmerized by this book but i was interested throughout it was interesting to see the characters develop and i really never knew what was coming next which is always fun","106":"i am ambivalent about this book i wanted to like it more than i did and as it ended i enjoyed it a bit more than i had thus far but the fact remains that it was not an easy book for me to get through - it did not grab me despite being impeccably written if i wasn't so stubborn about seeing it through i don't think i'd have many qualms about putting it down it was the cover that did it i admit i fell in love with the cover in such a way that even as i was struggling to read it i couldn't not finish it the premise was interesting the writing lyrical i had a really hard time liking grace though i felt no empathy for this character and though i was happy with the ending i was not exactly satisfied with her progress i love that the author posed the kind of hard questions and moral struggles that don't have any real good answer - but there were some many things happening in that boat that i opposed to so vehemently that it was hard not to judge i am glad i read it but it wasn't an entirely pleasant voyage","107":"the story plot is original but it keeps dragging on and on the actions bore me the classic language was intresting in genral i like it but it wasnt a very memorable read to say the least","108":"interesting look at human nature","109":"i felt like i was stuck out to sea with this book i found it boring the author writes well and developed some interesting characters but the interaction between the survivors and boat experience was discouraging and mundane","110":" two years after the sinking of the titanic the empress alexandra sinks into the ocean a lifeboat with a capacity of about 36 launches with 39 total people on it and is precariously low in the water of the 36 people in the lifeboat we know that by the end of the ordeal three women including our narrator are being charged with murder how they get there is the point of the story this book published one hundred years after the sinking of the titanic and amid all of the titanic panic going on in theaters and on television right now was well played by the publishers they chose the perfect time to publish a fictional account of the sinking of a ship and a group of passengers on a lifeboat as with many books i read i thought that this one had a very cool premise but it was not as well executed as i had hoped the story was told in a first person narrative but the narrator had few thoughts of her own most of the happenings were documented as this happened then this happened and i remember thinking this then this happened it was hard to connect with anyone in the lifeboat but maybe the author intended us to see how emotionlessly she was able to recount all of the events i'm not sure but it didn't work for me also i disliked how a lot of the mysteries of the book were never solved since it was told from the narrator's point of view we only learn the answers to our questions insofar as she does which is not always a whole lot of answer once again i'm sure the author intended this but i didn't like it overall i give this book 3 5 stars simply because the mystery kept me reading even if i couldn't get connected to the novel","111":"frankly i thought it was a tedious read but i finished it as it was our book groups selection for the month we discuss it tonight but we also drink a lot of wine as we do so that should help","112":"for some reason i think i just didn't get this book the synopsis made it sound exciting but i found it to be really boring and it took me a long time to read because i just couldn't get through it i mean no disrespect to ms rogan the writing was excellent i just wasn't into the story there were quite a few people on the boat to start and i had a hard time keeping them straight i guess it's because of the etiquette of that time period but there were very few first names use everyone was mr or mrs so and so and i couldn't remember who was who there were a few interesting events that occured on the boat but mostly it was a descriptive of how they just drifted along for those weeks","113":" i was really attracted to the idea of this book 39 passengers on a lifeboat struggling for survival making tough choices and operating within a tricky ethical and moral framework but for me the book didn't live up to its promise the characters were poorly developed i simply didn't care about them the single first person narrative structure lessened the reader's ability to interpret the situation from multiple points of view and the narrator is a dull reasonably submissive self centred bore there are too many flashbacks to the time prior to the sinking of the ship and too much of the story is set after the final passengers have been rescued the dilemmas were framed in the predominantly christian ethical framework of the early 20th century which was very limiting and predictably there was a church figure amongst the passengers on the lifeboat this is a short book but it was a struggle to plough through it had enjoyable moments and passages but the narrative structure of the story and the period in which it was set both conspired to constrict the moral and ethical superstructure to such an extent that it ceased to be interesting in summary the premise is great but the execution is poor","114":"enjoyable debut novel but surprisingly short the general story is a familiar one so i was expecting some twist or other rogan isn't gimmicky though we expect character development to be tense and introspective in a story like this and she delivers she throws in a bit of mystery as well but i was a little disappointed in the resolution there i liked the book but i think it could have been 200 pages longer i would also have loved to learn more about the other major characters","115":" there is a profound truth i think that we never know how we will act in any given situation until we are in it but we hold a fascination with imagining what we would do if we found ourselves in whatever the situation it is the summer of 1914 and grace elopes with henry winter in london they are travelling home to america via ocean liner when a mysterious explosion causes their ship to sink henry sacrifices his life to find a place in one of the lifeboats for his new wife so begins the ordeal that finds grace being on trial for her life in the opening scene of this first novel as the story unfolds we learn of the incredible events that happened during more than 21 days lost at sea afloat in an overcrowded lifeboat full of many personalities the strengths and weaknesses the fears hopes desperations of humans are examined and held up to the light the theme of survival holds an endless fascination for us we wonder how we might have behaved and whether we would have survived in that situation the lifeboat is a story that is both a tragedy and a revelation it asks some of the big questions and prods us to consider our answers a strong first novel","116":"i was excited to read this one survival on the high seas etc in reality a little too much discussion of morals and values and not enough plot for me i thought the last third of the book was slow and kept thinking of life of pi another not so favorite book","117":"quite an interesting book i read it as an audiobook to which its personal first person narration is very well suited i'd call it life of pi meets titanic and that more or less covers it","118":"not a very enjoyable book i don't know why but there have been so many books about shipwrecks lately well i've read a few about shipwrecks and people on lifeboats hanging on for dear life trying to survive unbroken by laura hillenbrand and life of pi by yann martel are two of them the third is this one where unbroken is a true story and life of pi is more of a philosophical story the lifeboat seems to revolve mostly around women's rights and part of the book is about a trial some of the survivors have to attend because they have been accused of killing one of the passengers the main protagonist grace is one of the accused she's not a very interesting character in that she never voices her opinion not in her own head or aloud she lets herself be led others which is basically what this book is about grace and about 30 other passengers on the lifeboat are looking at the power struggle between a boatsmen mr hardie and a very opinionated strong woman mrs grant also this book is set in 1914 when women's rights were very limited it's an easy enough book to get through but it's just very bland and it doesn't leave the reader with any form of satisfaction afterwards","119":"a very strange and slightly disturbing book will make for an interesting discussion at book group didn't really like the main character","120":"i did not relate to this novel at all i found it sterile and devoid of any suspense despite the dramatic nature of the story cold and depressing","121":"i enjoyed this book it flowed well and kept me interested as the background of the main character and narrator was revealed the story opens with grace standing trial for murder the story then goes to the beginning of the struggle for survival in the lifeboat with 39 others i found the characters to be a good mix and quite civil under the circumstances as the days went on and as hope of recovery waned things took a turn the characters were beleivable and some more sympathetic than others","122":"the book was well written and the story was an interesting one but i really disliked all the characters i only kept reading because it was for book club and then i had to work late so i didn't even make it to book club it will go to the dump free shack not a keeper","123":"this book reminded me of an american tragedy but much narrower and with less character development overall i found it thought provoking and will read it again","124":"a good book interesting story i am fascinated that the author was able to develop an entire story that takes place in one very small location","125":" two years after the titanic sinks another ship sinks traveling from europe to america a group of people about 40 end up in a lifeboat not large enough to hold 40 the main character is a woman named grace there are several other central characters the most interesting being the man in charge of the lifeboat i just finished the book and need to digest it more before adding more to my review my initial reaction is great writing on many levels a beautiful description of the ocean and weather and complex characters readers will not be surprised by how the plot progresses as all lifeboat stories tend to follow the same trajectory what makes this one different is the characters and the gray areas the undecisiveness the slow unfolding of weak from strong individual realizations human flaws and cruelty because i do not want to give away the story and spoil it for anyone i won't go into my final assessment of the main characters here but i would like to if anyone else wants to discuss it","126":"some nice passages but overall getting a sense of who was in the boat and their overall goals except for the villain wasn't quite clear i ended up thumbing through the last 1 3rd","127":"didn't finish this one just couldn't get into it","128":"i enjoyed this book it is a story told from this perspective of a young newlywed who finds herself in a lifeboat in the middle of the atlantic ocean with 38 strangers after the ship she was on sunk it was a truly riveting tale i was engrossed in the story and found it thought provoking moving and even a bit horrifying what would i have done in the same situation","129":"not my usual read this book felt very slow and the characters were not very endearing","130":"i liked this book both the time period and the story it told it made you wonder what you would do if you were on an overcrowded lifeboat with no food and if you would survive the ordeal","131":"i was so wanting to like this book it had such potential there were so many ways the story could have gone but every path it took me on led to a dead end a lot of the characters lacked depth however the salty mr hardie is someone who will stay with me through her description he came alive and i can see his weather beaten face even now","132":" i was looking forward to reading the lifeboat after perusing reviews that ranged from lukewarm to warm the plot was promising a young woman grace winter recently married and more recently widowed is adrift with 39 other passengers after their luxury liner sinks in the atlantic in 1914 after a mysterious explosion one distraction was that the book was virtually all internal monologue in every paragraph almost every sentence we're in grace's head i was wondering what if this was told in third person would have been a much better book told from multiple points of view that would have been a great book another distraction was how little rogan dealt with issues of gut wrenching survival two or three days after not eating or drinking humans become obsessed with food and water rogan mentions they're hungry catch a few fish scoop up rainwater and snare seabirds but it's almost an after thought then there's the issue of weather which in the north atlantic is treacherous in all seasons sudden storms towering waves bursts of torrential rains and ferocious winds grace and the others are in an open boat yet the dangers of surviving in open seas are treated almost like casual annoyances in the end it seemed that the lifeboat is grace winter's journal of dreaming about being on the lifeboat she wasn't really on it","133":"i wish that i sunk on the lifeboat so i didn't have to read the rest of what happened i wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time the best part of the book doesn't come until around page 200 just a lot of characters that i didn't connect to or give a damn about don't bother","134":"very descriptive the story concept is good survival at sea of a large group of strangers but it felt longer than necessary","135":"i haven't read much fiction in a while so when i saw the excellent review of this novel in people magazine i figured i'd venture back into the genre the entire book is a study on the relationships between people...who's a natural leader who is weak etc it gets sort of lord of the flies in the middle but the narrator is excellent at rationalizing things and even looking at several perspectives of the same event if you like character dynamics definitely give the lifeboat a read","136":"this book was suspenseful and made me think about what i would have done in this horrible situation the ending left me with many questions","137":"amazing book really makes you think about what you would do if you found yourself in this situation","138":"thrilled with the moral ambiguity of the narrator","139":"i really thought this book had potential but it fell flat every time i felt momentum it would stall there were so many characters the author could have delved into and she just didn't i would have loved to know more about any of them but especially grace who seemed could have had more depth hardie would have been great to know more about it seems the author was trying to go for more deeper symbolism about women in society at the time but if that was the case it was poorly delivered","140":"boring","141":"this would be a really great book for a book club i however am not in a book club but i still liked it a lot and would love it to discuss it with someone","142":"a strong debut novel undone slightly by a weak ending the premise is strong a group of people trying to survive an overloaded lifeboat the main character grace winter is a bit of an unreliable narrator everything is told from her point of view her mental state and or motives are suspect which will keep some readers from connecting with her this makes the book more of a mystery than a standard survival story i both liked and disliked this approach on one hand its an interesting spin on a story i've seen before but on the other it keeps the reader at a distance the book ends with a trial no spoiler since they tell you that early on but i would've rather had more time spent on the lifeboat","143":"i usually don't read historical novels but this book looked interesting on the local library shelf i did enjoy it and stayed up late finishing it it was interesting to see how people acted differently to a life or death situation the trial at the end was extremely surprising overall an enjoyable story","144":"as i read this book i thought it might not be fiction as the story progressed so authentically it was compelling the way it flipped back and forth from the present to the days stranded at sea in a small lifeboat very interesting reading but the end was not satisfying to this reader","145":"riveting the author did such an amazing job writing such a thought provoking novel i never wanted to put it down and found myself thinking about it a lot after reading it it really makes one wonder on the nature of people in survival situations and question what makes some stronger than others very good book i really wanted to give 5 stars but the ending left me with just a little too much to mull over for myself","146":"i've gotta hand it to rogan the lifeboat is a veritable page turner i've devoured it in an incredibly short amount of time eager to know what goes on in the lifeboat in spite of knowing from the first page that our narrator grace survives the whole ordeal i was intrigued by the idea of the novel the lifeboat is quite an interesting piece because it questions the human nature and explores the battle between ethics and baser instincts in crazy circumstances however the execution is both the strong and weak point of the book the choice of grace as the only narrator doesn't present a clear and objective picture of all that had happened during those days in the lifeboat i can't help but wonder if the novel would have been more intense if the author had decided to play with multiple points of view nevertheless i think rogan did the best she could with a less than optimal choice for grace is a strange character i can't make up my mind about her is she really the weakling she presents herself to be i don't think so even though we have ample evidence for that from her retelling about how she behaved on the boat i'm leaning more towards the opinion that she's a figurative master of disguise after all from the short flashbacks from her past we know grace is no stranger to cunning games in order to survive in the pre wwi world but such an underhanded character who tells her story in a cold almost detached way didn't connect with me on any level luckily her narrative is cut down and streamlined so that there are no fillers which would bog down the book but still i felt the book could have been better with a more engaging protagonist all in all i grant the lifeboat 3 stars because of its thought provoking and page turning qualities","147":" after a slightly slow start this book suddenly grips your attention as the raw personalities and strengths and weaknesses of human nature are revealed in one lifeboat in the middle of the ocean considering the limited location space this book manages to hold your attention and becomes not only something of a thriller but also an excellent character study most significantly pitching man against woman it also cleverly draws reference from real life ship wreaks during the same period such as the titanic and lucitania which inevitably allows you to draw comparisons to those ship wreaks but commendably the book's self awareness of this only serves to fascinate you further","148":"well that was weird 3 stars because i flew through it probably should be 2 i just listened to an npr pop culture happy hour podcast which is an amazing show everyone should listen to about unreliable narrators so that came in handy when thinking about the hussy central character's account of events whooee does this book club need to start picking some lighter better written material","149":"i felt there was not enough character development and that the novel did not pull me in","150":"the lifeboat charlotte rogan survivors in a lifeboat struggle with weather lack of food and water while creating the best possible power hierarchy for survival explores the leadership gender class and the way these are important to the passengers again a protagonist that manipulates is not what she appears and is not very likeable 288 pages","151":" the lifeboat is unsurprisingly the story of a shipwreck and one particular lifeboat full of survivors grace winter a young woman recently married narrates this pre wwi novel from a first person point of view in the form of a diary bookended with first person recollections of what happened after her lifeboat's rescue this book started out at a fast u0026amp furious pace with its creepiness and its exploration of survival ethics earning it a solid 4 star rating there are all kinds of obstacles from the very beginning the biggest of which is that the lifeboat bears more people than it can safely hold not only can it not take on more people who are floundering in the water the boat must collectively decide who will be cast away from it so the rest of them can survive but what does that make them murderers or survivors one man a seamen named hardie seems to be in charge but in time there are mutinous mutterings and rumors start circulating from passenger to passenger that he can't be trusted that he's a thief that he destroyed the radio and thus prevented the ship from sending distress signals that he caused the shipwreck to begin with and so on suffice it to say that there is plenty of hardship and hysteria with various men and women making and breaking alliances as the opportunities arise the diary portion of this shipwreck novel comes to an end about 3 4 of the way in and a murder trial gets underway this is not a spoiler you know from the prologue that the murder trial is happening and things slow way the heck down lost momentum unreliable narrator lost interest and thus results in an overall 3 star rating the subject survivors in a lifeboat put me very much in mind of the biography unbroken which i'm reading now and the novel life of pi the human variation not the animal one human nature can certainly be appalling and the author does a good job of showing us moments when we're incapable of controlling our most damnable impulses too bad the early potential wasn't carried forward for the remainder of the book","152":"after a shipwreck in 1914 people are huddled together on a lifeboat trying to save their lives mistrust greed and jealousy fill the boat some live some die memorable line for me was when hardy says ye're born ye suffer and ye die","153":" read this book while sitting very close to where grace darling made an heroic rescue of a struggling boat crew many many years ago so i thought it was quite apt to read a book about a lifeboat with grace as the lead character but i didn't much like it apart from the end that i didn't 'get' at all i didn't gel with the heroine she seemed so passive and yet this was literally a life or death situation where was the terror the crying the thinking of all the things she should have done with her life apart from all the inner thought about the guy she loved i don't know but i just felt there was something missing i didn't get why there was even a trial under those sort of circumstances it seemed odd and then i didn't get why the trial came to conclusion it did i felt as though this should have been very exciting and i was never really excited i think part of the problem was actually having to have so many people in the boat you can't give details on all the characters and so it gives a sort of false idea of the way things played out some bits with the priest made me gulp but overall i wasn't as riveted as i'd hoped to be","154":"interesting story of survival and group dynamics","155":"lifeboat stories usually have predictable occurrences this story isn't all that unusual except for the time and the circumstances the author writes well but the drama is very low keyed and quite civil perhaps 1914 was a better year for civility even in lifeboats i can't imagine obedience and civility being predominant qualities in a 2012 lifeboat crisis in any event the book moves along in a slow undulating pace until the end nothing much here except the sound of the sea","156":"this story was ok grace was a very strange character i enjoyed this grim story about what any of us may be capable of if our situation becomes desperate enough","157":"surviving in a lifeboat for twenty one days brings out the best and worst in some of the 39 passengers aboard an overcrowded lifeboat definitely an interesting read","158":"i enjoyed the way the author writes and i bookmarked several passages in this book but there was also something that kept it from being a great read it was just okay for the longest time i wanted more back story and more present day within the chapters and she stuck to the re telling of the first several days at sea then the book switches to the present and i found myself wanting to know more about the final days at sea i think this is a book where alternating chapters could have really worked well there were things mentioned and theories presented that the author never expanded upon and i feel like there is no point in mentioning something if it is not going to be important later also view spoiler i really wanted to know what was in that box and i really wanted to know if the second lifeboat had the chest in it if hardie and blake and possibly even henry were in cahoots about something and i wanted to see what the reaction of henry's family would be i also definitely wanted to know more about grace agreeing to marry the lawyer hide spoiler the story definitely had the potential to be great but it just fell short for me too much was left to be inferred and i wasn't necessarily impressed with the ending i would definitely read something else by this author though","159":"actually 3 5 i've started and stopped half a dozen books in the past few months and this was one of the few that drew me in not amazing but a good read","160":"this book was o k a little disappointing and boring after awhile by day 11 i was hoping that the next page would be page 21 and the book would be over sadly it wasn't","161":" a clever story that addresses some big issues through a simple plot of survival charlotte rogan tells the day by day story of grace and her fellow passengers as they struggle for survival in a lifeboat following the sinking of the empress alexandra as the days pass and there is no sign of rescue the paranoia and power struggles began to dominate the lives of those trapped in the small vessel it is a great study of human nature and a microcosm of society with issues of women's rights equality justice and the value of human life explored against the backdrop of an extreme situation a good quick read that puts the reader within the lifeboat and asks you how far would you go to survive","162":"good story crappy ending what a let down","163":"ugh it totally missed the mark it was boring pointless trite and completely self serving it seemed like me the author didn't know where to go with a survival story if you are looking for a great lost at sea survival tale pick up unbroken it will shake you at your very core","164":"i enjoyed the style of writing it really did read like something written in 1915 i don't know how the author did that but it was very effective in the telling of the story i actually felt sort of claustrophobic while reading the lifeboat scenes and they were certainly suspenseful","165":"if any given cross section could be cut including forty people and those people randomly survived a catastrophic shipwreck in an overcrowded lifeboat and drifted mid atlantic for 6 weeks one would discover a microcosm both of the extremes and of the limits of our inherent survival drive the story does not stop here though but lays the outcome before the moral scrutiny of a dry land courtroom this is a good first novel by an author whose future work i will follow with enthusiasm","166":"it's an odd book with a great twist at the end well written","167":" i hated lord of the flies when i read it as a kid so i was worried i wouldn't like this but i did the protag grace of course is wonderfully flawed and personally i think that makes the story she is a survivor and as such we have to ask why this is a great book for book groups because it raises those age old questions such as are we insane by nature but appear sane because civilization has made it possible for us to suppress our true selves or are we sane and brought to insanity by impossible forces also who survives this is an unfair question to the many good humans who have survived devastating tragedies but worthwhile in this case some have said the book was boring because 40 people are stuck in a lifeboat not so if anything dragged for me it was the courtroom proceedings at the end but i've read a lot of books that end this way and merely scan those parts it's a relatively fast read and good for the beach where you can smell the ocean and wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the middle of it for days because therein's the spoiler","168":" this is a novel about a woman in a shipwreck during the summer of 1914 she makes it to the lifeboat only to spend several weeks on an overcrowded boat without proper supplies in the middle of the ocean this is ultimatly a story of survival and a retrospective of the main character looks back on her life love and her family during this difficult time the passangers are faced with tough choices which ultimatly leads to the death of others on the lifeboat in my opinion this is a thought provoking story and a worthy debut novel","169":"i always feel relief when i read a great book after reading one or more that i dislike somehow i always feel like am i too picky can i just not commit to a book but it's not me it's the books i just loved the lifeboat i like j m coetzee's description in his review blurb on the back where he calls it a deceptively simple narrative of shipwreck really i could describe the plot to you in about three sentences but the really great thing about this book is the moral ambiguities that arise in such an extreme survival situation and the cool thing is that this narrative of shipwreck is as old as the hills but rogan just gets underneath and and really pulls at all the threads of how right and wrong become less and less clear how the rights of individuals can be at odds with the needs of the group how priorities shift and true personalities come out rogan according to her bio is a mature woman who did other stuff architecture engineering raised triplets before she published this debut work and she is my new hero","170":"3 5 stars this was a very interesting book that brings a lot to the table which i think would have gotten a higher mark from me if not for 2 things 1 i think i'm in the mood for something a little lighter right now this was a bit too intense for me i need something light and frothy to counteract my busy schedule 2 i read this quite close to burial rites which to me is quite a similar book and which i actually preferred to this one rogan does a really great job here though my caveats will not be everyone's caveats and anyone who enjoys historical fiction and loves as i do reading about people's reactions in difficult and trying situations of near death will probably enjoy this book it also has another of my big star ups which is an unreliable narrator who makes for very interesting if slightly unpleasant reading this is definitely not a character that was likeable for me in any way her obfuscation of her true actions really grated on me i've known girls like this in my life and it's always a pain to be around them but reading this woman's narration and trying to read the between the lines was interesting and a refreshing and different take from the balls out raw evilness and candor of the equally as unappealing narrator in alissa nutting's tampa definitely enjoyed i wish i had waited until i was on vacation on a beach somewhere with the sun and saltwater on my skin it might have given a stronger impression","171":"i was waiting for some passion hysteria some emotion in this story but never found it in the narrator you know from the very beginning of the book that she lives but the how comes along later i never grow to like her","172":"listened to this book which was an unfolding of a person's experience in a lifeboat when a cruise ship sinks around the titanic time period not great","173":"the lifeboat was a nice quick read the ending was sort of disjointed in my opinion but overall i liked the book","174":" this book is simply made for book discussion groups it has it all a perfectly contrived setting to explore the darkest reaches of human nature 39 people stuck in a lifeboat a potentially unreliable first person narrator exploration of women's roles in society prior to gaining the vote and deep questions of morality religion and what is permissible in life or death situations for some reason the book didn't grab me emotionally in the way that i had hoped it would and i found its pace slow at times but overall it is fodder for some very good conversation","175":"i found this book uncomfortable to read at times and didn't really like the main character but nevertheless found myself really enjoying it","176":"it's 1914 and a luxury liner crossing the atlantic explodes and this is the story of the three week ordeal of 39 survivers on one of the lifeboats it is told by newly married grace winter imho a not very appealing character","177":"a fascinating first novel by charlotte rogan an odd bunch of people is put together in a lifeboat as their ship goes down in 1922 a young woman is put on trial for the murder with a couple of other women for having thrown of fellow passenger overboard this is a book about her mental machinations as she goes over what she has done i enjoyed it a lot a little horrifying","178":"this debut novel from author charlotte rogan is a gripping tale about human nature and survival in the year 1914 a ship is struck down by an explosion the story centers around a group of passengers who have sought refuge on a lifeboat as predicted there are struggles and hardships faced by the thirty something survivors on the boat the story is told from the point of view of grace she tells her story via flashbacks and utimately tells the story of her trail for murder the book is a page turner as you are anxious to see if they get rescued when they do it is quite uneventful i would have preferred more detail about the rescue and how the main character felt when it occured after having recently watched life of pi i already had an idea of what life stranded at sea entails the book may have been more interesting to me had i not just seen a movie with a similar setting and plot the book was well written especially considering it is the author's first novel","179":"i read this book in 5 days straight some of my favourite books took longer than that for me to read so i think that says it all its description of events were astonishing and only added to my enjoyment and visualization of its events well done","180":"i liked the concept of the book but i never really connected with the main character or any of the numerous other characters in the book","181":"this was what i call a good read it's a story of survival told from one woman's perspective the work of a first time author who did a fine job bringing her readers right into a story with tension psychology and historical verisimilitude i didn't quite accept the role of the psychiatrist with his importance to the story feeling like a device for the hero to convey her thoughts but that's a minor quibble it was well done overall","182":"just ok slow moving wouldn't recommend it to others","183":"i give this book 3 5 stars i liked it but found it hard to believe as well if someone survived 21 days at sea during the cusp of war would the courts waste time and resources on trying 3 women for killing a fellow passenger regardless it is an interesting story of a woman who has to make difficult choices each time her life takes a turn for the worse","184":"i really enjoyed this book the main character made choices often without consciously looking at them as decisions and definite choices did she realize this at the end or not","185":"is it murder to kill one person in order to save 30 other people this is the question at the heart of this engaging story as you read lifeboat you'll keep asking yourself what would you do in a situation like this available from ocls in print and audiobook here","186":"could have been something truly remarkable like lord of the flies how do passengers on a lifeboat deal with the thought of never being found of difficult co passengers and being forced into teamwork well don't know because the author didn't really address any of this very disappointing","187":" in the lifeboat author charlotte rogan explores the actions of a group of people who are forced to survive on a small lifeboat and the repercussions of this event the premise seems simple enough but in the dexterous hands of rogan the story takes on a larger life that invites readers to join in on this fascinating journey the year is 1914 and newly wed grace is traveling with her husband henry across the atlantic ocean aboard the luxurious ocean liner the empress alexandra after a sudden explosion the passengers frantically evacuate the sinking ship doing whatever it takes to secure a spot in a lifeboat as lifeboat 14 begins its descent into the ocean it stops just long enough for henry to put grace and seaman john hardie onto the boat hardie who clearly has the most experience with all things nautical takes lead of the small boat navigating through the debris and coldly passing other passengers who struggle to stay afloat in the sea hardie is the only one aboard the lifeboat who understands that the small vessel is already overcrowded and to take in even one more passenger would be suicide as the days pass the passengers all follow the lead of hardie who has assigned tasks for each of the evacuees they all seem to believe that despite their misfortune help will arrive soon after several days the solitude of the sea begins to take its toll on the passengers hunger and thirst muddy their minds a looming storm threatens to sink their boat and different opinions threaten to tear apart the unified effort of the passengers the novel is told from the point of view of grace who is writing a journal of her time on the lifeboat we learn through many flashbacks that grace is currently on trial for murder as the novel progresses we gain further insights into the events that took place on the boat and are forced to face the question of how far a person should go to further their survival being the debut novel from rogan i was very impressed with the strength and clarity of her story telling the suspense of both the struggle to survive in the ocean and to clear her name in a murder trial kept the pages turning and my attention fully held rogan descriptions offer subtle glimpses into human nature and the desire to live despite the fantastic build up i felt a bit let down by the ending it seemed as if these philosophical ideas about survival were leading to some kind of revelation instead we get a resolution to the plot with no emotional punch that being said i think this novel is worth the read for that build up alone perhaps the lack of a real answer to the questions that come up in this situation perfectly captures the reality of the event either way this novel forced me to conjure ideas about life death and the will to survive","188":"easy read but too many unanswered questions at the end i liked that it started in the lifeboat and didn't have to build up to it","189":"this book was a bit dark but i really enjoyed the questions it posed it would make a great discussion","190":" i read the book quickly enough in just over a day but i was left unsatisfied out of 39 people in the boat most of them could have been cardboard cutouts as they didn't have a voice let alone a presence we deal with just a small band of people who attracted the narrators gaze and of course who she was sitting closest to i was expecting more about the rescue and where abouts in the ocean they were found for instance did they make much progress away from the ship or were they going round in circles as once suggested but unless i missed something there was nothing relating to that at all a background of ethics and human behavior which is fine but sometimes doesn't make for a good story a page turner but only to see if there was actually more to the tale there had to be a better story in there than this surely after all it's got some really great reviews fortunately it was relatively short at under 300 pages or i would have given up next","191":" charlotte rogan's debut novel the lifeboat is set in 1914 just two years after the tragic loss of life associated with the sinking of the titanic it is likely that the similarity of the fictional situation to the real tragedy will bring the novel to the attention of countless readers who otherwise would have missed it unlike what happened with the titanic survivors however empress alexandra survivors lucky enough to make it to a lifeboat will not be blessed with a quick pick up from relatively nearby ships grace winter the novel's narrator hints at what is to come in the book's short prologue \"...along with two other women named hannah west and ursula grant i was to stand trial for my life i was twenty two years old i had been married for ten weeks and a widow for over six \"grace winter an ambitious young woman until recently unsatisfied with her lot in life is traveling with her wealthy new husband aboard the empress alexandra when the ship is sunk by a devastating explosion thanks to henry's determined efforts grace manages to find a place with 38 others on one of the ships lifeboats as the passengers will soon learn there are not enough lifeboat seats to accommodate everyone aboard the sinking ship just as tragically some boats are lowered in a panicked rush before taking on a full load while others are dangerously overfilled within hours it is evident that grace's lifeboat is in danger of sinking because of the excess weight it is carrying because grace recounts her story via a journal she is preparing for her defense lawyer the book's tension does not stem from wondering whether anyone will survive the torture of being lost at sea for more than three weeks from the beginning it is obvious that there will be survivors and that murder may play a direct role in deciding which passengers will survive and which will not the core of the lifeboat story is what the 39 survivors learn about themselves and their fellow travelers as they are faced with moral decisions that will determine exactly who lives and who dies what are they willing to do to increase the odds of their own survival even at the expense of the man or woman sitting next to them in the lifeboat some will surprise even themselves charlotte rogan explores in detail the moral dilemma the passengers face as weather conditions worsen food and water are exhausted and it becomes obvious that survival now depends on a willingness to engage in physical and psychological warfare against fellow passengers alliances are formed by likeminded passengers only to be reshaped within hours or days as paranoia becomes the order of the day for those who manage to hang on to their spot aboard the lifeboat the lifeboat although it has a heartbreaking story to tell suffers from being presented entirely through the eyes of a single character readers will only know as much about grace's fellow passengers as she learned about them before the explosion or after being confined with them on the small lifeboat not enough character development is offered to make the secondary characters entirely sympathetic or to explain their actions aboard the lifeboat perhaps this is rogan's way of showing that everyone is capable of this kind of behavior in a confined life or death situation the emotional impact of the novel however would have been greater were the characters better developed this one will i think especially appeal to titanic junkies and fans of the 1944 alfred hitchcock movie lifeboat","192":"it was just ok was rather tedious","193":"unlike most i actually liked the protagonist she was very much self possessed yes but necessarily so i thought she was also a bit flat but i don't think that was really a fault of the writer but her true personality it was the rest of the book that i found lacking not tense enough not frightening enough not interesting enough also i thought the dialogue was unrealistic for the time period and hardie went in and out of sailor speak too often for me","194":"this book has received mixed reviews but i liked it and found it a quick and enjoyable read","195":"the boat sinks you get put on a lifeboat with others and now how do you survive out at sea physically and emotionally the characters are lovely and interesting the story line is intriguing there is a murder sort of men vs women a little bit honestly i thought there would some great twist towards the end but there wasn't","196":"was hoping to like this a lot more as i tend to enjoy survivor stories like this it was ok but a bit weak","197":" a story with an interesting premise we follow the disintegration of civilisation in the form of a group of survivors adrift in a lifeboat the story told through the eyes and suspect character of one of them a young woman who has recently 'caught' herself a wealthy husband to avoid the tedium of life as a governess it was well developed but i felt that once the women 'took control' the men became invisible in the boat and without giving away what happens i would have expected them to have more of an involvement in the aftermath the jury is out for me on this one","198":"between 3 and 4 stars very good debut novel i'm not quite sure what was missing for me in the end","199":"the measure of a good book is how much it makes you think this book certainly made me think a great deal about the value of a life and how all that changes with uncertainty there were time the story seemed to become confusing and drawn out in hindsight that is probably what the author wanted the reader to experience just the way the characters were stuck in their situation this is a book i will be thinking about for a long while","200":"2 5 stars i don't know what's wrong with me it was a while since i got really interested in a novel that wasn't all feel goody maybe i'm beginning to be real picky i should love the lifeboat i mean it has an unreliable narrator i love unreliable narrators but throughout the novel it only got hold of half my attention like i read it but wasn't invested in it since this is my fifth 2 star rating the last month i'm not exactly sure who's fault it was mine or the book's","201":"this book was a real page turner time magazine did a review recently and also gave it high marks it would be a great discussion book but unfortunately since it is so new it would be difficult to get i got it as a one week sizzler from the library the book opens with a woman on trial for murder after being stranded on a lifeboat for 21 days while waiting for rescue very interesting dynamics between all members on lifeboat the story is told in flashback but you can't wait to get to the end to make your own conclusions about her innocense or guilt highly recommend","202":"my review in swedish u0026gt romeoandjuliet","203":" the lifeboat is another choice from waterstones eleven eleven debut novels which they have earmaked for commercial success and critical acclaim in 2012 this is my fourth read from the selection and yet another one which i thoroughly enjoyed even on a par with the snow child which is high praise indeed set in 1914 most of the action or should that read \"inaction\" takes place on a lifeboat stranded in the atlantic ocean following the sinking of the empress alexandra five days after her depature from liverpool our narrator newly wed grace winter has written an account of her experiences during three long and exhausting weeks spent aboard the overladen vessel - an account which could once more mean the difference between life and death for her as she now stands trial for murder some of her fellow passengers didn't survive - some jumped and some may have been pushed but grace's involvement is rather unclear and she isn't the most reliable of narrators what is crystal clear though is that the reader will question what he or she would do in a similar situation how far would we go to survive this is one of those novels you will want all your friends to read so you can discuss it afterwards and share your views underneath the deceptively simple prose lies a multilayered entity which sucks in the reader from the opening pages grace is an interesting character flawed and human but does her devious streak extend to murder lifeboat no 14 is predominantly female with 30 women 8 men and 1 child and half of the men end up perishing in the ocean the whole power struggle between hardie the ship's crewman and mrs grant mirrors women's struggle for emancipation and grace tries her best to steer a middle course between the two however when they're back on terra firma facing a murder accusation it's back to normality to a male dominated society so everything changes charlotte rogan wrote the first draft of the lifeboat 10 years ago and she has been writing whilst raising triplets so she has had little in the way of spare time i for one am glad that she decided to revisit this novel and set it loose on us readers grab your lifejackets or at least have plenty of snacks to sustain you as you will be enthralled by this compelling debut my thanks to net galley for allowing me to review a digital proof of the lifeboat","204":"i liked the main character and the book was based on an interesting premise the problem is that the bulk of it describes what happened on the lifeboat most of which was boring with lifeless characters not recommended","205":"read about this book on a list of twenty one books written by women over the last five years every woman should read i would remove this book from the list i didn't care about any of the characters and skimmed big chunks of this book lifeboat starts out where \"titanic\" ends the story is about what people really think and how they act when they are stranded in a lifeboat for days and days after their ship sinks as expected some step up as leaders some act in their self interest and some end up in jail for their acts against humanity if the author's goal was to reveal the darker sides of our nature she has succeeded if only there had been less anti social behavior so i could have liked some of the characters when i read gone girl by gillian flynn i had a similar reaction and had to quit reading it the personification of character disorders and the reveling in them does not interest me","206":"this book was not as good as i expected it to be i never really warmed to the character of grace and at times she absolutely annoyed me i really wanted to like the book more but i am glad that i didn't give up on it and move onto something else i could have skipped ahead to find out what happened but that's not something i am in the habit of doing","207":"liked this book a lot","208":"this was the most boring story of survival i have ever read a disparate group of survivors from a cruise ship that explodes their painful ordeal on a lifeboat watching their moral devolvement in slow motion","209":"wow this is a novel about the experience of surviving for three weeks in a lifeboat on the open sea however the lifeboat is a microcosm of a society with among other things its struggles for survival and for power its formation of relationships and how those change with changing circumstances there is lots of material here for philosophical discussion and facing up to what you might think feel and do if you found yourself in their situation","210":"impressive for a first novel until the ending which i felt was just too vague","211":"felt like i was on the titanic the entire time i could hear celine dion singing in the background i giant bore","212":" lifeboat takes place in 1914 two years after the sinking of the titanic a mysterious explosion occurs on the empress alexandra and a raging fire ensues that devours up to half of the lifeboats passengers scramble to board the remaining boats this story centers on one lifeboat that takes on 39 people above the capacity of 32 the crowded boat lies too low to the water and does not have enough rations to help those aboard survive more than several days the novel begins with three women being charged with murder the passengers' ordeal at sea is retold by our narrator grace as she enters her memories in a journal at the request of her lawyer what could have been a fascinating foray into a group's descent into madness as they were stripped of their humanity in a life and death struggle was anything but riveting the days at sea were endless and the description so boring it had me want to abandon the sinking hull of this book early on the characters lacked development it would have been so interesting to learn the back story of the other passengers and have them take turns recounting the ordeal from their point of view instead we are subjected to narration by grace a scheming manipulative unlikable character that would do anything to survive in life the author introduces many snippets of mysterious events and conversations on board the empress that peak the reader's curiosity as grace recounts the events and speculates on their significance and the motives of her fellow passengers you continue to hope that a connection will become evident unfortunately this never happens this added to my frustration with the book and i felt cheated by the author as i realized that the events mentioned led nowhere and were just added as filler the conclusion is very unsatisfactory leaving you with the impression that the author simply tired of the story and stopped writing a great author makes us care about the characters that they have created i was unable to relate or empathize with any of the characters in this book i simply did not care whether they lived or died","213":"39 people are stuck on a lifeboat after their ship sunk in 1914 i loved the first half of the novel but i feel the story unraveled after that great psychological analysis of the characters and worth reading","214":"there are too many things left open in this book which doesn't enhance the story or make it seem richer or more complex it just seems unfinished doesn't live up to the hype grace the narrator is pretty unlikable if you want a truly gripping account of a lifeboat survival situation try unbroken by laura hillenbrand which is nonfiction","215":"the heroine was a complex character and a survivor in the course of her story i wondered about her choices and whether the charge of murder was valid in her case the conditions on board the lifeboat were horrendous and terrifying at times and the ways people treated one another on board were frequently disturbing the ending was a bit hard to believe or not","216":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked a lot about this book i'm a sucker for things that take place at sea duh you and i have met internet and i've never met an unreliable narrator i don't like that said i felt like the lifeboat raised some questions it wasn't entirely ready to answer i don't need everything spelled out for me but some possibilities had grace and henry even known each other which was by far the most interesting to me had she been in some way allied with hardie or blake prior to the boat al i liked a lot about this book i'm a sucker for things that take place at sea duh you and i have met internet and i've never met an unreliable narrator i don't like that said i felt like the lifeboat raised some questions it wasn't entirely ready to answer i don't need everything spelled out for me but some possibilities had grace and henry even known each other which was by far the most interesting to me had she been in some way allied with hardie or blake prior to the boat all sorts of things were too interesting to leave entirely unexplored it almost made me feel like a bad reader since i finished up and then began thinking about possibilities never even really put forth in the book ambiguity is all well and good but perhaps we as readers are owed more than i somehow knew him maybe or did i that's just unsatisfying more","217":"entertaining if somewhat disjointed i had difficulty formulating characters and motivations in my mind","218":" ho hum historical survival story 39 people trapped in a lifeboat after a luxury oceanliner goes down at sea narrated by grace who has lost track of her husband in the melee lifeboat attempts to be suspenseful laying down clues as to what happens along the way we know she's on trial after being rescued and we know that some people have died unfortunately i simply didn't care for the characters many seemed one dimensional the audiobook's narrator did a fine job for grace's voice but others verged on being comically overacted which detracted from the listening experience the conclusion left me cold and indifferent to the book as a whole","219":"i thought it was a bit of a dry and slow read","220":"this book succeeds where so many others fail it's a simple plot but told really well well crafted and written it doesn't fall into the trap that others do pretending to be more than they are i read it straight after gone girl which i found boring two dimensional and unbelievable in contrast the lifeboat is exciting full of suspense even though nothing happens really for long periods of time a great read","221":"i really liked the first half u0026amp couldn't put it down but then it went down hill and the last few chapters i had to skim disappointed","222":"huh i felt like this book had so much potential but just really fell flat for me so disappointing that some mysteries and clues were introduced early on that were never resolved since there were so many open ends left it might be an interesting discussion book though","223":"not exactly what i expected i lead a lot of true survivor tales and this as a work of fiction is more cerebral morality is not as clear cut as we think when we are faced with the battle to survive a deep read i'll probably revisit this one because there was a lot here that made me think","224":"i listened to the audiobook for about the first 80% and was quite entertained however i suspect that if i had read it i would have found it tedious","225":"this was an engrossing book that kept me up until the early morning hours just to see what happens next from the beginning of the book you know that the narrator is on trial for murder she is recollecting how she came to be in the lifeboat and all that occurred during the weeks she was stranded on the boat with 39 other people great characters made for an engaging read","226":"in 1914 a liner crossing the atlantic sinks after an explosion grace winter finds herself adrift in an overcrowded lifeboat with 38 companions in order to survive dreadful decisions regarding allegiances need to be made this is a great read enough even with the examination of how far we would go to ensure personal survival but it has the the added dimension of the mystery of the explosion and whether or not grace is what she appears to be","227":" it was good just not as good as i had hoped i like reading about circumstances that involve the big moral right or wrong question if in order for some to live some must sacrifice themselves is it right what if it's not self sacrifice and more of a short straw situation if you force someone to die so that everyone can live is it murder what if you only helped push the guy over because you were afraid that if you didn't you would be pushed over yourself these questions were all addressed in the book and had a great set up i just wasn't satisfied with how it all came together","228":"like lord of the flies but situated on a lifeboat it has deceit and romance and shows you how easily humans can turn on each other when only some can survive","229":" a dark book about survival of the fittest on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean i believe we'd all like to think we'd be noble and brave in this kind of situation but the truth is we just don't know how we would act given a life and death choice i had a hard time relating to or even liking the main character but found myself unable to judge her actions or the actions of any of the others because who knows if i would have done the same in their shoes some chapters were hard to take but it really made me think of how curiously human behavior can turn when given the right set of circumstances","230":"i thought this was going to be a good read but was disappointed it started so well and i was so interested in the plot then ut became a continuous stream if thoughts from grace whuch confused me greatly by the end i was skim reading to get finished i didn't like h3r character at all","231":"grace tells her story starting at her trial and works her way through her experience of being on a lifeboat after an explosion on the ship she was traveling with her new husband the narrative tells a lot about grace what she was thinking and what she thought was happening i began to wonder what i would have done in her situation how does one go through an experience like she did and remain sane","232":" much like many of the other readers i enjoyed this book but not as much as i hoped to it was well written original and had parts that were exceptionally good however something just didn't work for me perhaps it is that i just felt indifferent about the characters even grace they all strike me a little flat and failed to spark any real positive or negative emotions in me even more i felt the author began developing some interesting storylines and then abandoned them for one that i found much less entertaining or thought provoking","233":"good storyline that you kept you interested","234":"quick read entertaining intelligent treatment of survival very well written a pleasure to read","235":" i found this book on a list of must reads this summer and it was a disappointment the characters were unremarkable and poorly fleshed out when one disappeared over the side of the lifeboat i felt nothing because they meant nothing to me the main character would have been far more interesting if rogan has allowed her to be a fully manipulative social climbing sociopath rather than someone who had deliberately pursued her husband because he was wealthy but truly and honestly grew to love him i don't believe her their lifeboat's captain appeared on the scene spouting dialogue that would have sounded cliche in a pirate of the caribbean movie and i groaned wondering if i was going to have to endure that for the entire book when the rescue is finally told it is anticlimactic and buried at the end of the book and our narrator picks up another rich husband the blurb at the back of the book notes the author got her degree in architecture from princeton that struck me as a snooty name drop i cannot see how that was in any way relevant to this book","236":" i think this book would have been more enjoyable if it was told in straight chronological order the opportunity to write grace's backstory describe the ship and its passengers in rich detail and briefly introduce some of the other characters that were to appear on grace's lifeboat would have made the story much more interesting as the pre shipwreck period would have helped the reader to develop an understanding of the characters before they were being observed under extreme duress which would have made this much more interesting as a character study as it was i thought it fell a little flat beginning with grace's lawyers immediately gave away the fact that grace was going to survive which took a lot of the suspense out of the lifeboat days also while i was reading i thought the idea that the survivors could be tried for events that happened while they were under extreme fatigue dehydration hunger and mental strain was unbelievable however i was wrong according to this review from the guardian rogan was inspired by 19th century legal cases in which survivors of shipwrecks were tried for their actions at sea the guardian http www theguardian com books 2012 i would have enjoyed the book much more if there was a preface stating this as i would have spent less time questioning if this was even possible","237":" i have a personal life rule don't read books about shipwrecks because being lost at sea tends to be a pretty boring plot device either you are rescued or you die and what happens in between is a whole lot of slow starvation and the occasional moment of cannibalism but because it was well reviewed i decided to ignore my biases and go ahead with the lifeboat i'm glad that i did the author manages to construct a compelling narrative out of the story of 39 survivors of an ocean liner sinker in the eve of world war i the lead character is already a survivor long before she ever enters the lifeboat and her kills serve her well by setting the story in a socially rigid time but filling the boat with a range of social classes you get an added layer of drama and s suspense what mores will hold true and how strong can our social code be against the forces of nature are some of the underlying delicious currents of this book i wouldn't say it's couldn't put it down drama but it will draw you in enough to make it handy for a trip to the beach or a long flight","238":"started great but slowed about 3 4 way through","239":"ask the question who am i how do you answer this what is your source for information after reading this book i can say stick me on a lifeboat with 30 other people limited food and water and little hope of rescue i think that might answer the question for me are we all driven to do whatever we must to survive perhaps does this define who we are who i am perhaps","240":"fascinating look at an uncomfortable situation adrift in a lifeboat the 30 odd people who survived a sinking ship but now have to survive the sea and each other it asks the questions of the reader of how would you behave in this situation do you succumb to despair do you meekly follow others lead do you rise to become a leader yourself do you become ruthless in your determination to survive really enjoyed this","241":"the empress alexander has sunk and some of the passengers escaped on lifeboats that is where we begin this story in the lifeboat and on the first day grace the protagonist made it onto a lifeboat and we see the events and the people through her eyes in some ways it is a literal recounting of the 21 days on the lifeboat as grace is writing journal entries to remember each day and event as she sits in a jail cell in boston the crime is not currently clear but will be explained day by day how the group changes and power shifts what will each of the life boat members do to survive what will they sacrifice in some ways the book reminded me of life of pi it is also an allegory for society in the microcosm of the lifeboat power sacrifice greed and convention along with god are all touched upon and change like the weather and waves in the vast ocean one tiny lifeboat could be overlooked does anybody know they are there does anybody care who is in charge who can save them the book is riveting and at times disturbing great book club book with many themes left for discussion","242":"i was waiting for a twist in the story but it didn't happen it does make you think about human morals but i think a lot more could be done with the great story base life of pi meets titanic","243":"i liked the first half of this book better than the last half i liked the premise but i felt that the much of the story was incomplete more ambiguous details were added as this book progressed u0026amp was left unresolved feeling very let down","244":"well written but a mediocre ending the style of writing mirrored the monotony of floating endlessly for days with little patches of terror horror or the darkness of the human soul worth the read but not entirely gripping","245":" this was the most boring book i have ever read i couldn't even finish it and that is saying alot since the main character was on trial for murder the characters were all unlikable in fact i disliked all of them i would say the author is a good writer but the story just droned on and on i thought a story of people stuck in a lifeboat for days would be exciting and character driven but the author never stirred my interest i just wanted to go to sleep and didn't care if they all drowned i wasted my money buying this book on nook","246":"a pretty unusual story really absolute page turner i thoroughly enjoyed it well written i could almost feel the sea","247":"another badly chosen book club selection slow to get the story started and even slower getting to finally the last page more lord of the flies on the high seas than anything else and frankly my dear i don't care i cleaned that last sentence up for the tender ears","248":"interesting but dark i was disappointed that the main character told the entire story from her viewpoint i really couldn't tell in the end what the truth really was and it bothered me plus i am a true believer in faith hope and love all of which was missing from the lifeboat perhaps it should have been called the death boat i also would have liked to have known more about the trial perhaps more of the truth would have come out","249":"i love unreliable narrators and rogan writes well i would have liked a little more at the end though i'm not sure what but overall this was an interesting and fast read","250":" it is 1914 and grace is adrift on a vast ocean after the ship the empress alexandra sank following an explosion her diary and thoughts tell the story of the suffering survival and loss of all those on the lifeboat she occupied for three weeks until rescued a new bride she finds herself with 39 strangers fighting for their very lives as time passes their relationships change and bitterness often rears its head with petty jealousies and foolish power struggles arising from the depths of their despair they soon begin to mistrust each other and fear they will never be rescued and will soon all die at sea are their actions irrational or the result of desperation they begin to question the judgment of those making the decisions for their very survival even though they themselves could not or would not have made them and they know less about the sea and the ordeal awaiting them there are many questions that arise as they sink further and further into a state of hopelessness could they sacrifice someone for the good of the others when they discover that the lifeboat is overloaded and was never built to the proper specifications would they expect the weak to give themselves up for the strong should some be sacrificed so others can survive is that the humanitarian thing to do or is it self serving since in sacrificing someone else you are saving yourself at their expense how would you act under such duress would you tolerate the weakness of others or expect them to perform equally or surrender their lives so that others might live is that barbarism or survival and common sense would you hoard food and water to save yourself or share with others could you eat raw fish and birds should the fate of these survivors the three women who are on trial be in the hands of men because women do not yet have the right to vote and therefore cannot serve on a jury is that a jury of their peers were they guilty or innocent you the the reader will decide their fate along with the jury what really happened on the ship to cause its demise how did grace earn a place on the lifeboat since it had already begun its descent into the sea and was raised up so she could board did her husband bribe mr hardy who also got on the boat with her was mr hardy a villain or a hero was mr blake a thief or maligned how did henry know these two men was someone stealing jewelry it crossed my mind that henry was either smuggling jewelry or purchasing her a place on the boat which one was it was grace really telling the whole truth in her diary and at her trial since later on she seemed to remember other random memories what really happened is it truly necessary to find out to know is it necessary to explore the depths to which people sink when they have no food or shelter is it simply a given that they lose their humanity and then once rescued simply return to normal life free from guilt who becomes the leaders and who the followers when crises arise the story explores the need for people to have answers and certainty even where none exists and yet do we even need answers to unanswerable questions it explores the behavior of people when faced with untenable circumstances is it perhaps simply best to accept what fate brings us and move on without looking back should we rather look ahead and face life's new opportunities as we forfeit others should we live for ourselves or for the sake of others grace describes the reactions of each lifeboat occupant to the controversies that arose and the decisions that were made which often conflicted with their fragile consciences under such duress do we make decisions we never thought ourselves capable of making can we forgive ourselves for those decisions should we be judged for those decisions when they were made under such extreme conditions grace finds herself on trial for murder with two other of her lifeboat survivors were the decisions they made rational and necessary for the survival of the many or were they the result of premeditated and planned executions if you murder someone who has murdered another is that still murder or is that justice are decisions made when faced with death either their own or the death of others decisions for which they should be culpable is it about sacrifice and sorrow selfishness and compassion accusations and innocence remorse and guilt is it about courage under the most difficult situations when we may also exhibit cowardice or strength of equal strength as an alternative the experience on the lifeboat was harrowing choosing between life and death for themselves and or others is a controversial unrewarded and unwanted task thrust upon them due to the exigency of the situation however survival was of the utmost importance and it often involved deep sacrifice the book seemed to raise more questions than it answered while it was thought provoking requiring a good deal of introspection to discover what we think we might have done in a similar situation asking us perhaps to make a judgment about the innocence or guilt of those on board regarding their behavior the tale of the time on the lifeboat seemed a little too long and tedious repetitive and occasionally even a bit boring it will however make a good choice for book groups since the discussion about the morality and ethical choices of the lifeboat occupants will surely take center stage","251":"sorry book group members but i didn't like the book at all i couldn't connect with any of the characters the plot was boring the author didn't make the story come alive if this wasn't a book we discussed in our group i would have quit after page one","252":"years ago i took a course in gestalt psychotherapy and i remember that one of the exercises we had to do was to imagine ourselves in a lifeboat in which someone has to be sacrificed for the benefit of the group it was a horrendous assignment this situation is the core of this book the main character is a young woman grace who we meet for the first time on trial for murder in boston the murder charge stems from her actions aboard a lifeboat in which she has spent a number of days after the ocean liner on which she was crossing the atlantic sinks the main part of the book is comprised of her memories of her ordeal as she writes down all that she can remember at the request of her lawyers of the 39 passengers in the lifeboat only one is a seaman and he at first takes control at first there is food and water to be rationed and an optimistic feeling that they will be rescued by a passing ship as the days go on and the weather worsens the food and water run out the group must make difficult decisions about how they can best survive grace is a strong woman and she does survive but at a cost to herself the story is gripping and the way in which it is set out moving backwards and forwards in time works well this is a difficult book to read only in that the subject matter gives much food for thought about altruism self interest and what we ourselves would do in such a situation","253":"super interesting to think about i think it'll make for a great discussion at book club the writing was good and i liked the intrigue of it probably not the best book to read before going on a cruise though","254":"the lifeboat is the debut novel by author charlotte rogan as you can guess from the title the story is set in the lifeboat over full of passengers from a fictional liner that sank in the atlantic in the days before world war 1 the story is told from the point of view of a female newleywed who made on to the last lifeboat before the ship sank through her eyes we get to know a few of her fellow survivors as days go by the passengers begin to disagree over many things on the boat there are too many people and the boat is riding low in the water with an eventual storm posing a danger the first half of this book is extremely absorbing and i was intrigued by the lead characters point of view while suspicious if we were hearing accurate stories i think it starts to fall apart in the last several chapters when the story continues back in the post rescue world i didn't feel like th framing device was entirely successful but i still give it 3 starts for the great first half","255":"i read all the reviews on the back of this book and what people mag said and i couldn't wait to read this book but after all the hype it really fell short to my expectations spellbinding and beautifully written they said i really had a tough time staying interested sorry this one i won't pass on i don't really mean to be a hater but i can honestly say the end is the best","256":"this book made me want to jump overboard","257":"i thought this book was boring there was no big mystery no character development at all and i couldn't wait for it to end there was wasn't one character i connected with or was rooting for i also felt like most of the story lines were never really finalized there are so many other great books out there don't waste your summer reading this one","258":"absolutely superb book and easily in the top 1% of all books i have read in the last 5 years thematically similar to the lord of the flies but a bit faster paced without losing the psychological questions and tensions of the aforementioned classic while being a quick read or page turner i can easily imagine returning to this novel in the future to reread it and perhaps glean additional highlights very strongly recommended","259":"this book had a intriguing premise and started out strong but petered out for me by the end","260":"disappointing intriguing premise with a promising beginning and a suggestion of real mystery it ended up going nowhere","261":"there is nothing mindblowing about this book but it is an entertaining read about a group of people stuck in a lifeboat after their ship sinks at the beginning of the 20th century it provokes some thought about ethics so if you like ethical dilemmas about life and death you will probably enjoy this book","262":"i read this book in a day it is a real page turner the only problem with it for me is that it seemed to run out of puff right at the end","263":"this book was ok humans put in a lifeboat and tried to survive for 21 days none of it really surprising","264":"i read the lifeboat within 12 hours it is well written and entertaining post titanic and newsworthy given the recent sinking of the italian cruise ship the lifeboat explores the psychological and moral dilemmas facing grace a young recently married woman who suspiciously secures a place on an already overcrowded life boat the intimacy of surviving at sea and the court case following the rescue is recounted by grace with references to aristotle freud christianity gender alliances and war time capitalism grace survives how she survives is questioned where does the readers' moral compass point a book for book clubs discussions","265":"simply too slow with so many people on one lifeboat with little resources you'd think it would be more exciting but nothing much happens even character deaths are a non event i had high hopes because i love outdoor adventure type books but this was disappointing","266":"i couldn't decide i was too much of a feminist or not feminist enough for this book it's a compelling and readable story but i had a hard time nailing down any particular feelings about the narrator","267":"intriguing but had a weak ending with loose ends not tied up","268":"this would make a good beach pool or boat read some spoilers ahead the beginning of the boat moves fairly quickly you never get a strong sense of who many of the characters are or even any idea about why they are in the lifeboat there really is no drama about survival since the author begins with the premise that the heroine survives the only excitement is how she survives and that ends up being a non story","269":"a solid 4 i'd read this book before so i knew the ending whether or not that stole from the suspense i don't know this novel has some lovely prose and asks some harrowing questions and it is all capped off by a deliciously unreliable narrator i feel like there was more to this book that i missed i found myself having to push through at times dispassionate at the turns of events however this book is still a gem and i heatedly recommend it","270":"kind of boring not too much can happen on a lifeboat there were a few flashbacks but not enough to keep it interesting just ok for me","271":" the lifeboat is an interesting conundrum for me i give it four stars because i sat down and raced through it it was engaging and well written i also give it three stars because as i look back on it nearly a month later nothing that memorable jumps out at me it's 1914 the ocean liner carrying grace winter and her husband sinks grace makes it into a lifeboat as the book progresses it becomes clear that the lifeboat is overloaded and for it to stay afloat not everyone is going to get to live an interesting albeit not new premise rogan's story is compelling and the plot moves that said i didn't really feel like i got to know any of her characters and when i finished the book i realized that while the read had been fun it didn't make that much of an impression on me if you're into books about disasters at sea or the early 20th century you might be into this if you're looking for a quick read you also might be into this if you really want to get to know your characters this might be a book to skip","272":" the lifeboat for me was probably more a two and a half star book than the three i've given it i've been a bit generous because the beginning was quite engrossing but then the middle part of the book was just ok and by the last third it had become rather silly and unbelievable which is a pity because of the very promising start to make matters worse as the book proceeded i realised i really didn't like anyone in it especially the main character grace and couldn't have cared less by then if everyone had perished view spoiler most of the characters behaved completely unbelievably i e the folks chosen to sacrifice themselves for the good of the others i doubt very much that anyone no matter how devout or whatever would throw themselves overboard to their death without at least a fight also hardly any mention was ever made of the one child on board who would have been very likely crying a good deal of the time from hunger or dehydration etc but this apparently incredibly well behaved and never heard from boy spent the whole journey carefully wrapped under his mothers clothes and may as well not even have been mentioned in the first place as for grace whom the book revolves around nothing about her description makes me understand how she seemingly manages to wrap a couple of important men around her fingers she seems quite shallow and uninteresting to me although obviously quite manipulative shown through her relationship with both the men in her life and also the women in the lifeboat hide spoiler love the cover","273":"so this was a little like life of pi but not quite as good but i really liked it this is a great book for our club because i have so many questions to ask regarding the characters i think the interpretation of each is really open and i can't wait to hear what others say especially grace i think there is also room for a lot of discussion regarding symbolim first book for this author who now lives in westport i look forward to more from her","274":"as usual enjoyed it more after book group grace as a potentially sociopathic unreliable narrator could play well on a re read","275":"i actually purchased this book rather than getting it from the library i really thought it was going to be good loved the premise of the book and i can't say i hated it but it was boring seriously i finished the book but barely i can't for the life of me figure out why others rated it so high and why anyone would describe it as a page turner i didn't connect with any of the characters i really didn't care if any of them died the only one i really wanted to know about in the end was henry what happened to him i didn't find the story of the main boat sinking exciting or believable i found the exchanges between the people in the lifeboat petty and then courtroom drama at the end of the book wasn't dramatic at all i really haven't been this disappointed in a book in a long time i'd say skip this one","276":"i found the book to be an quick read and it keep my interest in the first half then i found my mind drifting it didn't keep my interest i had wished that the author told us more about the other people in the boat and developed those characters more","277":"real simple july 2012 book club option","278":"didn't really like this one maybe i missed something","279":"i was intrigued by the topic of this book as well as the fact that it's the debut novel of a middle aged female architect there's some promise in the first sea faring chapters and rogan puts effort into an untrustworthy narrator who is easy to dislike but the last third of the book really disappoints rogan tries to set up a court scene that smacks of witness for the prosecution but leaves the reader dizzy and bored with he said she said testimony although i commend rogan for her efforts this is not a book i'll be revisiting","280":"i was waiting and waiting for the big reveal in this one and unfortunately it never came kudos to the author though for great suspense building i subtracted a star due to no big payoff","281":"grace winter 22 a newlywed is one of 39 people in an overcrowded lifeboat after an explosion aboard the empress alexandra on the eve of world war i john hardie an experienced seaman takes charge but power struggles soon ensue since \"people are moved primarily by desire for power and fear of others \" stranded for 21 days grace and some others survive but she and two other women are charged with the murder of another person aboard the boat the novel begins and ends with the court trial the middle is the diary that grace is asked by her lawyers to write recounting her time aboard the lifeboat the diary reads much like a nautical lord of the flies examining human behaviour in a situation where people are subjected to extreme physical and mental duress so \" t he bare bones of people's natures are showing \" the novel examines moral choices in extreme situations when \"a person's choices are rarely between right and wrong or between good and evil because people are mostly faced with much murkier options where there are no clear signposts marking the better path to take \" for example \"if you take for granted that some or all shall die if no action is taken should an action be taken to save some \" in other words is it ethically acceptable to allow or compel the weakest to die so a majority may survive grace proves herself to be an unreliable narrator she admits as much herself she discusses the process of recollecting and admits that \"forgetting always relates to the life drives the greatest of which are to reproduce and to avoid death \" in the process of recollecting events for her diary is she \"forgetting\" events in order to avoid the death penalty should she be found guilty of murder grace shows negative aspects of her personality so that the reader realizes that she should not be trusted for example she is very conniving and manipulative she describes how she set about meeting the man who would eventually become her husband she spent a week watching him and figuring out his daily itinerary and regarded his engagement to another woman as \"only the mildest of impediments \" although she tells him that \"'i won't try to influence you'\" when he has to decide whether to end his engagement she nonetheless wore \"a pale dress and outlined my eyes so they looked big in my ashen face it wasn't a costume or disguise exactly but a form of communication i wanted henry to see that i wasn't strong enough to lose him \" she wasn't trying to influence him grace's actions demonstrate her belief that \"life depended on the ability to subjugate other creatures to our use \" when mary ann a woman next to her in the lifeboat irritates her she suggests she sacrifice herself so the chances of survival would increase for others \"'why not mary ann you'd save yourself a lot of suffering by flinging yourself into the sea you're going to die anyway and i've heard drowning is far more pleasant than dying of starvation or thirst \" then she justifies her actions \"am i to be blamed for this we do not ask certain ideas to enter our heads and demand that others stay away i believe that a person is accountable for his actions but not for the contents of his mind \"the novel makes some interesting observations about men and women grace wonders whether one of the other women charged with murder \"would have been incarcerated if she had been a man \" though she claims to be in favour of women's suffrage grace is not beyond using feminine wiles for instance one of grace's co defendants wears only black and the other wears trousers but grace dresses to soften her appearance in front of the male jury so it is not surprising when she is asked \"'i am sure a jury of men suits you just fine doesn't it '\" grace admits to \"arranging that sweet vapid smile on my face that was so useful during the trial \" grace's observation that \"men rarely knew what decisions a woman had or hadn't made\" suggests that she sees them as being as capable of being manipulated as women this book is definitely worth reading it forces one to consider what one would do in similar circumstances would you \"choose the nobler part and jump overboard in order to save others\" would your will to survive be so strong that you would be totally ruthless acknowledge that \"we are all predators \" and see the death of another as \"some sort of natural selection\" please check out my reader's blog http schatjesshelves blogspot ca and follow me on twitter @dcyakabuski","282":"it was ok i thought the events in the lifeboat could have been described better a lot of things happened and there was no explanation also events happened and it was not noted until after other events occurred could have been so much more that being said it was an easy read character development was non existent","283":" meh the setting is so gripping i expected to feel compelled from start to finish unfortunately i didn't some of the major events in the book are described so nonchalantly that i had to reread them on a number of occasions to ensure i understood the magnitude of what had transpired some of the reviews about this book that i have read describe the narrator grace as unreliable which seems to me an excellent description she's been cast at sea in an over filled lifeboat for weeks her memory will undoubtedly be fuzzy and the author is so skilled at conveying all the nuance of human interaction time and again grace questions whether she correctly interpreted a look someone has shot to her or the meaning behind particular phrases this creates intrigue and leaves the reader wondering in a good way for me though it felt as though too much was left hanging and i would have preferred a few more answers or at least the perspective of another character for the only angle we have is grace's i don't know maybe i'll like this book a bit more after it marinates in my brain for a bit upon the close of the final chapter though the best i can do is 3 stars","284":"while some parts of the story were riveting i never really empathized with any of the characters grace was not someone i would want to be with in a lifeboat that's for sure and i could not shake the memory of having read unbroken a true story of a lifeboat survivor there are heroes and there is fiction and in this case in my mind they are not equal","285":"i found this book's topic to be quiet interesting but the writing was just so so a very short book that i should have finished rather quickly but it did not hold my interest all of the time the story is about a titanic like story where close to 40 people are stranded in a lifeboat and what happens to them","286":"predictable wants to be more sophisticated than it ultimately is","287":"really deserves 3 5 stars","288":"well at first i was interested thinking that it might be an interesting read people stranded on a small boat in the ocean hoping to be rescued but alas for me i would have liked a tad more action or drama it was all a little pale for me i will give it a 2 5","289":"rogan put a the main character's grace thoughts at the forefront of this novel the idea of being saved from a downed ship the physcology of living in close quarters with others on a small lifeboat for three weeks and the trial that ensued as a result of the murder s that took place during that time presented grace with her take on the events what would one do under these circumstances how can a jury of your peers determine your fate based on an experience like no other truly a book with food for thought","290":" this book did not meet my expectations while it was a short and easy read and interesting as a survival tale on a superficial level the story was not compelling as a psychological study nor as a character study with the exception of grace and henry i thought the characters were decidedly undeveloped the life altering decisions are made essentially by a handful of people on the boat and one is left wondering what in the world were the other 30 people doing while this was going on this field has been plowed many times before if you want to see how a lifeboat scenario can be entertaining moving and informative on several levels i suggest that you watch the 1944 hitchcock film lifeboat based on a john steinbeck story you won't be disappointed","291":"well written but i disliked the ending","292":"book jacket says this is a book about a woman rescued from a tragic shipwreck after fourteen days and then put on trial for her life for the death of another lifeboat occupant i thought it would be descriptive and interesting and discuss human nature in reality this was the flattest book i have ever read couldn't care less about any of the characters the one sided description of the time in the lifeboat was boring the issues surrounding what would have been a fascinating trial where nearly non existent pass","293":"i seldom give 5 stars however the psychology and emotions of the survivors of a sinking ship puts me in awe of anyone under ptss","294":"goodish great concept disappointing exploration but keeps the readers interest","295":"this

they are heading back home from a business trip in london henry is a wealthy man brought up in a rich family and grace is a nobody without money or a set future before she meets henry they are about to build a future together when the ship empress alexandra suddenly explodes and all grace remembers is being put into a lifeboat without henry i got really fed up with grace she had a way of thinking she was more mature acted more like a lady was stronger better and capable of surviving on her own than others i however thought she was kinda naiv and not capable of seeing herself in another light during the entire time in the lifeboat she was dependant on others not willing to stand up for her political views in the boat she was wishywashy and needed someone strong to look out for her her sister took a job while grace did everything to hold of a job and instead get married to a guy who could take care of her grace thought that was a way of not settling making her more capable of making good decisions in life when a girl named mary ann cried whimpered and was frightened this made grace angry and she constantly told mary ann how pathetic she was but not loud enough for others to hear what she said grace mentions in her diary she often felt the same way mary ann did but when she saw the way the other girl acted she had to bottle up her feelings this made her believe she was strong to me she was a character i grew to dislike and despise more","296":"three stars beautiful prose psychological dynamics and fabulous descriptions of survival on a 1900s lifeboat but i finished with a lot of unanswered questions what did grace's husband say to the man as he put her on the lifeboat i wanted more","297":"i thought that the actions of the various characters while in the lifeboat were extremely interesting however i did feel that the ending was anticlimatic there could have been much more done with that overall i enjoyed it","298":"grace is an interesting character who seems to spend her life going from one survival situation to the next i found her emotionally vacant and couldn't really sympathize with her plight however i did appreciate her struggle to survive her early years the lifeboat and the courtroom she made me question whether the will to survive is stronger than a person's humanity and need to be truly happy","299":"$24 99 the sea can be unforgiving

danger of going under tsometimes we must make horrible choices in order to survive such is the case in charlotte rogan's gripping debut the lifeboat the phrase what doesn't kill us makes us stronger never rang truer rogan's main character grace winter despite her faults is one of the strongest female characters i have encountered in a long time tgrace manages to live through an excruciating ordeal one in which many die the lifeboat is chilling as grace and others must struggle and sacrifice in order to survive twhen rogan introduces us to grace she is widow on trial along with two other women for murder her lawyers urge grace to write an account of what occurred she reluctantly agrees and begins a diary her narrative is the basis for rogan's story twhile crossing the atlantic ocean in 1914 there is an explosion on board the empress alexandra people shove others out of the way to get on lifeboats grace's new husband henry forces her onto lifeboat 14 but he does not follow rogan draws eerily similar comparisons to titanic yet this is no love story far from it tgrace recalls there were bodies floating in the water too and living people clung to the wreckage... a toddler reaches out to her but neither grace nor any of the others save the child this is the first instance where the reader notices how cold and calculating grace really is there is a detachment to her perhaps it is her lack of emotion that helps her survive tmany people are alive in the water three swimmers approach the boat on the orders of an officer from the ship mr hardie the oarsmen beat the men to death with the oars it is truly every man for himself the simple hard fact is that we could not save everybody and save ourselves tmr hardie emerges as leader this makes sense given he knows the water grace has confidence in his abilities in her eyes mr hardie knew about this world of water and spoke its language the less she understands his rough seaman's voice the greater the possibility that the sea understands him out of necessity mr hardie makes some tough decisions grace though perseveres in her support for him or at least at first tbecause the boat is taking on water it in all likelihood will sink the lifeboat supposedly has a capacity of 39 people and holds 38 in actuality the lifeboat is capable of holding much less than 39 people tthe lifeboat is overcrowded a fact that is obvious to everyone mr hardie asks for volunteers several men and women jump out and into the sea to their deaths soon mr hardie's actions are questioned especially by two women mrs grant and hannah mrs grant is appalled when mr hardie does not turn back for the child she calls him a brute just like that grace explains mrs grant was branded a humanitarian and hardie a fiend ta power struggle unfolds as food and water necessities for survival are hard to come by grace's allegiance to mr hardie teeters it becomes obvious that she will support whoever suits her needs best she will cheer whoever has the advantage clearly grace is interested only in saving herself tthe situation on the lifeboat grows bleaker at one point a flock of birds falls dead into the lifeboat both men and women eat the birds and gnaw the bones until they are bare of meat blood runs down their chins such a thing is implausible to me i wonder if this might be a veiled reference to cannibalism perhaps the reality of the situation is such that grace is unwilling and unable to call it what it truly is tyou just cannot trust grace she is definitely an unreliable narrator she often tells half truths and even lies it's my experience that we can come up with five reasons why something happened and the truth will always be the sixth she confides if this is part of her nature or if it is a result of the tragedy rogan chooses not to reveal it is through the eyes of the other survivors that grace comes across as callous and manipulative her cold and calculating nature is nothing new however as rogan reveals grace used these same tactics to lure her husband from another woman if you guess he came from money you are correct trogan plays with grace's memory and history in this novel when the others discount a memory on the stand she emphatically denies what they say grace's memory and history are at odds grace also retreats into herself on the lifeboat she withdraws into her own mind to what she calls the winter palace her retreat may partly explain why she has no recollection of certain events then again maybe it is her plan all along one thing is certain though over time the situation on the lifeboat grows more tenuous and more perilous tthe power struggle between mr hardie and mrs grant and hannah comes to a head grace plays a major role in this battle which is the reason she is on trial rogan writes this with suspense tit is interesting that three women are on trial if circumstances had been different i do not feel mr hardie would be accused of murder it is as if in 1914 at least a woman's place was to create sustain and nurture life not take it people expect a man to fight even defend himself if the scenario demands why shouldn't the same be true for a woman ta lifeboat takes on ironic meanings in rogan's novel lifeboats are lifesaving vessels they are places of refuge and salvation in this book though the lifeboat takes on a whole different sense it becomes a deathtrap ti recommend the lifeboat to anyone who is fascinated with titanic i also would suggest the novel for those who enjoy yann martel's life of pi i do want to warn you that there is no romance no magic here the lifeboat is sometimes bloody sometimes chilling and always shocking it will literally give you goosebumps tmore than anything grace winter is a survivor and you must respect her for having the will to save herself grace never gives up whether you are at sea or navigating the shark infested waters of life grace can teach us all something sometimes we all have to struggle in order to get through this life t","300":"much like the people in the lifeboat i waited to be rescued","301":"thought provoking fast paced interesting read i will be recommending this to my book club and continuing to think about it for days while it wasn't quite as twisty as i anticipated i was surprised by the events and by the narrator who obviously doesn't reveal all she knows give this one a try you won't regret it","302":"good quick read i stayed up too late last night in an attempt to finish it","303":"two years after the loss of titanic and just after the outbreak of wwi the ocean liner empress alexandra sinks there is an explosion and a fire on board leading to panic and the launching of just over half the available lifeboats grace winter newly married to henry is placed by her husband aboard lifeboat 14 one of the last to get away safely at first it seems as though their only problem is to get the lifeboat as far away from the ship as possible however having escaped the initial danger those on board thirty nine in all including thirty one women and one child have to face the harsh reality that the rescue they are awaiting may not be coming when we meet grace a most resourceful and realistic heroine she is in prison on trial for her life her lawyers suggest she try to recreate the events of those twenty one days and her diary is what we read as the story of what happened and why she is on trial unfolds this is an excellent atmospheric and well written novel which draws you in and refuses to let you stop reading grace tells her story simply and well feeling no doubt in her actions although we readers are often unsure she should be so certain of her actions in fact grace's status seems as unreliable and shifting as the sea the boat floats precariously on as grace narrates her story she says the bare bones of our natures were showing and it is hard to disagree with her yet it is also impossible to judge how people could or would react in such a desperate situation certainly the situation in the lifeboat leads to those on board exhibiting the best and worst that humanity has to offer from disagreements discord and jealousy to self sacrifice if this novel does not win awards i will be stunned this is an excellent book and would be ideal for a reading group looking for an intelligent and thought provoking novel to discuss","304":"the saving 'grace' of this book is in the writing charlotte rogan creates mood emotion and insights in a masterful manner unfortunately the premise of the book has been done and the outcome is predictable doubt that i will recommend it","305":"well written book with a good plot but i felt the story was a little slow at points and the end kind of left me needing more from the story","306":"very compelling book i didn't want to put it down super fast read only problem it gave me nightmares luckily it only took 3 days to read","307":"not a quick read but very intriguing story makes you think about human behavior in the worst of circumstances what would you do in a survival situation","308":"at first it is seems like another lost at sea heartbreaker however it is anything but that","309":"i liked this book but didn't love it interesting to read about surviving on a lifeboat after the cruise ship sinks it's written in an old fashioned manner and very philosophical","310":"loved it would be a great book club discussion no foul language no immorality and a great story line to boot","311":"engrossing tale of survival","312":"very thought provoking","313":"really a good read not one i thought i would enjoy so much in the strictest sense of the word there is not a lot of action but this book is brilliantly written and really keeps you turning the pages","314":"i liked the story on the lifeboat the trial and the life after the experience i found dull and even annoying i also failed to grasp what i was supposed to understand about her i feel she clearly was a certain person yet couldn't pinpoint what type of person she was i did really enjoy the story that took place on the lifeboat","315":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here grace narrates the story of her series of unfortunate events losing everything due to her father's poor business affairs falling victim to a boat accident being trapped on a lifeboat then later trapped in jail pre trial for her desperate and practically subconscious actions from when she was trying to survive the lifeboat the good she is a strong well rounded female character the most interesting thing about grace is how she embodies a certain weakness and at the same time she seems to grace narrates the story of her series of unfortunate events losing everything due to her father's poor business affairs falling victim to a boat accident being trapped on a lifeboat then later trapped in jail pre trial for her desperate and practically subconscious actions from when she was trying to survive the lifeboat the good she is a strong well rounded female character the most interesting thing about grace is how she embodies a certain weakness and at the same time she seems to manipulate convince those around her to get what she wants allowing herself to be rescued by men seems to be grace's most consistent character trait be it mr hardy henry or mr reichmann i'm not sure whether she orchestrated those rescues or if they were controlled by the men but in the end grace is a fun character who i think i would be friends with and who fights when she needs to with 39 people on the lifeboat from the beginning i found it difficult to keep track of characters and i found the book a bit slow at points had i known some of the characters more intimately perhaps it would've held my attention more more","316":" \"of course \" i exclaimed out loud and others took up the cry \"god helps those who help themselves \" it was a principle i lived by and while it sometimes might make a person who espoused it seem selfish and theologically uninformed people who refused to live by it looked to me weak and parasitic when the sun had first broken through the fog i had been reluctant to face it having grown accustomed to taking refuge in the night in limited vision and those crystal days where we could see forever at least until the world curved and dropped off into nothingness haunted me because there was nothing to see i wondered if all a person could hope for was illusion and luck for i was forced to conclude that the world was fundamentally and appallingly dangerous it is a lesson i will never forget mrs grant kept a constant vigil she was dressed entirely in black her hair was pulled severely back and even a week of wind and waves was not enough to loosen it from its fastenings her gaze did not waver in the face of nothingness her face burned then the skin peeled off and she turned a dark brown color and still she gazed out to sea i had the idea that if a ship appeared on the horizon after all this time it would be because she had drawn it to her by her sheer determination and the force of her will i could see the effect she was having on some of the others who would make excuses to move near her or touch her shoulder as she went about her duties i saw this and i think i understood it but still i looked to hardie as the foundation of my strength i was not alone in feeling a strange sympathy for all that lay around me the sky the sea and the boat full of people all of whom now had blood dripping down their chins and lips creased with painful fissures that cracked and bled when they chanced to smile i miss henry with him i felt that character was less of a requirement in me as his character was so well defined and unyielding","317":"it was ok not one of my favorites","318":" i can't say i loved the book but it certainly held my attention the author did a masterful job of portraying grace while leaving many many questions unanswered i think this would make a wonderful book discussion choice throughout the book i'm sure most readers would question grace's veracity and narration of the tale through inuendos and suggestions each reader would most likely come to different opinions as to grace's innocence in the lifeboat incidents as well as those leading up to her marriage and the shipwreck for those who enjoyed the life of pi this would be a good fit although even more intense as to the decisions which might result in who should and could survive","319":"this is a fairly short book so i finished it in a day it has a good story line and characters but it could have been so much more i would have liked more from other character's points of view it was interesting an easy but not great","320":"pretty good was waiting for it to take off still looking for this years great read","321":" in 1914 grace winter--young determined recently married and just as recently widowed--endures three weeks adrift in the north atlantic in an over crowded lifeboat once rescued grace and two other women are put on trial for killing a sailor this harrowing suspenseful tale explores moral ambiguity human nature and the psychology of manipulation what would any of us do or not do if our lives depended on acting in our own best interests during the worst of ordeals is it possible for a person to be \"both alive and innocent\" are those left standing survivors ... or villains and what is truth rogan was inspired by an old criminal law text and her childhood experiences in a sailing family the legal and ethical ramifications of the titanic disaster 1912 are related in alcott's the dressmaker featuring a spirited young maid and her employer flamboyant british fashion designer lady lucile duff gordon","322":"as i was reading this all i could think of was my religion morality class sophomore year in high school where our teacher assigned each of us a character name age gender profession ect he then told us we all survived a great ship wreck the problem was that there were too many people on lifeboat and we had to decide what we would do i do not remember the outcome of what we did as a group but i have a feeling the it played out much like this book fortunately for us it was just a lesson and not a real life situation the author did a very good job in describing grace's story and thought process the use of flashbacks really made an impact it was sort of like you were an observer of the traumatic experience and were able to switch back and forth in lucidness of what was currently happening and the memories of the past that brought you up to that point","323":"kinda creepy kinda interesting kinda fun to read","324":"the idea of this book was compelling a group of people cast into the sea trying to survive it seemed like a good chance to dive into the human psyche and examine the depth of human desperation when faced with starvation dehydration and madness i was disappointed that the author barely scratched the surface on these topics and allowed the story to become more of a play by play of the events that transpired in the lifeboat a nice read for a weekend but was hoping for more","325":"this was a good one to listen to during my trip it was fast paced and well written the story did seem to end a bit abruptly though i felt like the author was being very descriptive for the first 3 4 of the book then it seemed like she ran out of time and hurried to tie it all together this opinion could have just been a consequence of having it on audio book and paying various amounts of attention at different points in my drive","326":"review to come in march","327":"gripping tightly wound story that keeps moving even when it's confined to a small overloaded lifeboat i've recommended this to everyone who has asked what i'm reading lately","328":"in the alternative ending i wrote in my head everyone votes the protagonist off the lifeboat then they shoot the scuba tank in her mouth and she explodes","329":" the lifeboat is about the adventures of a lifeboat full of survivors from the empress alexandra in 1914 the main narrator is grace although she is a minor player in the battle between mr hardie a sailor from the ship and mrs grant who both want to be in control of the lifeboat there are disputes about what happened and when before they are picked up by an icelandic fishing vessel as a first novel this was fairly well written and i found most of it very easy to read where i had difficulty were when it got exciting and i felt the written pace was too slow and some of the details were a little confusing i would be interesting in reading another book by her as i feel these faults were only minor and could easily be improved upon","330":" this book was intriguing from the very first page i liked the author's style and i did care about her storyteller the whole idea of floating about the ocean in a lifeboat with 30 something strangers better than a tiger was appalling in many ways her descriptions kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the book then something happens and it becomes a murder mystery i rather liked it until then see for yourself i recommend it i don't think you will be disappointed not gruesome in anyway you could give this to any one not those scheduled for a cruise however","331":" young american bride drifting in lifeboat with 39 others in the atlantic after ship goes down the story takes place in 1914 2 years after titanic sank many moral questions arise as passengers try to survive as others meet their demise sides develop people form alliances questions of privledge and status economic backgrounds and roles of men and women come into play well written novel that leaves you faced with many ethical questions as one evaluates the actions of those drifting on the sea waiting to be rescued","332":" i gave this 3 stars because it kept me turning the pages and left me thinking about it but i was left wanting more by the end it fell a little short of satisfying though it was an interesting read and study of 39 diverse characters afloat in a lifeboat for a few weeks in order to survive they form alliances while personalities fall naturally into a hierarchy where they must draw on each other for emotional mental and physical sustenance and what people would do for self preservation meets natural instinct family background and belief systems narrated by grace newlywed and newly widowed and her unending focus on using her femininity to achieve status and financial security","333":" charlotte rogan has delivered a wonderfully complex debut novel of intrigue and tragedy starting with grace winters on trial for a crime that is to be revealed throughout the story the novel displays a talent that i believe will go far in our current literary world the lifeboat is deft at keeping you guessing - what is the crime how exactly did grace get on the lifeboat while looking for these answers the reader is given a wonderful ride of tension and allegories that will leave them pondering our current world and the way we make our way through it i cannot think of a better novel that i have read thus far in 2012 i have raved to my friends about this book and cannot wait for them to read it so that we can discuss the broader implications of the plot and narration what a wonderful book","334":"couldn't really get into it","335":"very well written exciting but realistic great if you are looking for something deep but not boring","336":"the premise of this novel was very intriguing what happens to the occupants on an overcrowded lifeboat over time as they wait to be rescued but the novel ended up dragging along","337":"the lifeboat - charlotte roganthis book held my attention simply because i needed to know who survived and who didn't as well as the back story of grace winter the book is well written with believable characters and a growing sense of the horror of the situation on the lifeboat unfortunately many answers are simply missing and the reader is left with as many questions if not more at the end as when the book began as a character study it is excellent as a mystery there is a definite lack a book group would find much to discuss as well as to complain about if your group needs resolution avoid this book if your group thrives on speculation this is the book for you this book was provided free by the publisher","338":"do rules of morality change when you're adrift in an overcrowded lifeboat trying to survive this book lets the reader decide i loved the way the story unfolded","339":"kind of boring","340":"sort of like a reality tv show but more deadly nicely drawn characters especially the protagonist i was drawn into the politics very quickly and was rooting for the quiet ones it was easy to be taken in by the outward appearances of these people only to see their true nature as the circumstances worsened","341":"amazing loved this book and am encouraging everyone in my family to read it just want to talk about it with everyone was she wasn't she","342":"not a very exciting book sequel will be coming soon as it didn't tie all loose ends up","343":"brilliant pace eloquent narration interesting story","344":"pathetic","345":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book i was drawn in from the prologue and found it hard to put down until the last page i finished the lifeboat over a week ago but i am still thinking pondering questioning kudos to the author for a fantastic debut novel","346":"kept waiting for it to grab me and it never did didn't enjoy at all","347":"i read this book in one sitting on a rainy day i was quite gripped by the story of a shipwreck and the events that take place over several weeks in the boat the main character grace is the narrator of the story and as the book progresses you find out bits and pieces not directly but indirectly she is a fascinating character and the writer has done a great job of making a person who is not totally likeable still compelling enough to make you want things to work out ok for her","348":"yes from the early pages the reader is pulled into the story and unable to let go the emotional level of this book is powerful and moving and to me even more compelling than the eliteral story","349":"hmm gave you a lot to think about should someone be found guilty of murder if they are on a boat in the middle of the ocean just trying to survive it just didn't hold my attention through out the book it wasn't a bad book but it could have been better","350":" thought this would be a thriller and a fast read turns out it was a psychological novel and did not read quickly too many twists of language and not straight forward talk too many loose ends left at the end of the book as why did grace remarry what happened to henry's mother her mother her sister and what caused the ship's explosion and fire setting events in motion only a semi happy ending psychiatrist played an unusual role introduced late in the story and kind of being a hanger on and his motivations not clearly delineated a disappointment","351":"i don't know i mean obviously it's like some weird mix of lost and life of pi and titanic the last of which they actually make mention of but not as good as either and it's historical fiction the best parts of the book are the ones that actually take place on the ship and even in that case it is neither as compelling or interesting as life of pi's boat segments mrs grant and hannah were odd and though i found them quite creepy their rivalry of sorts with mr hardie was not developed as well or as dynamically as it could have been i don't think i liked the development of some characters mary ann was interesting i thought but others i think could have been explored far far more the book is so inside grace's head and then there are the parts about her and henry which seem almost as if they're from another book and maybe that's the point but because they're not interesting to read and don't have anything to do with anything i do kind of wish they had been replaced with more story time about the boat itself the trial at the end was interesting but again could have been dramatic solidly a three star book","352":"liked it a lot wasn't sure where it was going so it held my interest unusual topic","353":" after listening to an interview with the author on bbc radio 2 i thought that i would buy the book and give it a read the subject matter is not my usual genre but the behavior of people in unusual or difficult circumstances is always interesting the premise of the novel is fairly straightforward two years after the titanic sank the empress alexandra goes down in calm seas after catching fire 38 people are in a lifeboat that is too small though it should have fitted them comfortably lifeboat 14 sits in the water up to her gunnels there are few provisions and little water on board as the row clear of the wreckage what they do not know is that it will be three weeks before they are rescued charlotte rogan has a first novel to be envied she has a gentle flowing style which drifts along like the lifeboat itself always going somewhere but you never know what will be thrown up at you next so many emotions and feelings are suppressed then vented in sudden violent squalls that you are left breathless the story is told in recollection by the main character grace winter as she writes down all that she remember as she stands trial for her life i am not one to spoil a story in a review and that i will not change but as the story is told in first person you know from the start that our lady must survive the question is how i thoroughly enjoyed this book it is eloquent but never flowery words are not wasted to meet a publisher's word count neither are they clever the story is told at the level of the main character's intellect no mean feet when the author is quite clearly smarter than most if not all of the people in the boat a class act in story telling a definite 4 star contender","354":" i didn't enjoy this story at all although very well written it was just too dark and depressing i didn't like grace the main character and i didn't much like any of the people in this story i really didn't like the ending either maybe i need to change this to two stars i guess it gets three for the impact i do keep asking myself why in the heck i would have wanted to read a story about shipwrecked survivors who were all sort of bad people or at least not very kind nope didn't like it","355":"i really enjoyed this book as others have said i don't think grace was the young innocent girl she purported to be through her diary she was a very sharp young lady who played the game just right i loved the structure of the book and the concept of the story the 'what we would do to survive' stories never get old in my opinion i enjoy them and this one was particularly brilliant i'm impressed","356":"it went back and forth between the time on the boat the time before the boat and the time after the boat i also felt a little disoriented much as grace did on the boat going back and forth so much","357":"i hovered between 4 or 5 stars for this book not my normal reading choice but i got into the book quickly the first chapter begged me to continue to find out why she was on trial for her life at times the book wandered and got a bit 'rambley' but i stuck with it this is where i hovered with 4 stars and i am glad i did what would any one do in their circumstances interesting to find out what they did do","358":"very very good read and thought provoking","359":"i love the plot of this book the story taking place in the early 1900's 39 people left stranded in a lifeboat that isn't big enough for everyone i wish the characters were more fully developed before we cut to the lifeboat but i guess that's what keeps the reader going grace the narrator had above average intelligence but i found her too naive at times but she's 22 years old so i will give her a break i liked this book with it's titanic esque feel but i certainly didn't love it","360":"i think i would have given it a 4 star rating until the end it seemed like the author ran out of the energy or ideas to really complete the story","361":"this book was reviewed fairly well which is why i picked it up however it did not thrill me it's the story of a shipwreck oddly reminiscent of the titanic and the survivor's stories there are 38 people in a lifeboat it's over crowded and it doesn't take long for conflict to ensue the crux of the story is is it ok to sacrifice a few for the good of many the narrator grace says yes as god helps those who help themselves it's a short easy read but did not entertain me","362":"wonderful probably the most original story i read all year everyday life got in the way as i couldn't wait to get back into 'the lifeboat'","363":"this was a two day book so not a huge effort the story is told in the first person so you almost get to know the other characters better than grace winter beautifully told but in reality if this was a true story the pain and suffering would have been far greater and this was missing in this narrative well written for a first novel i look forward to other works by rogan","364":"a gritty tale of survival aboard a lifeboat after an ocean liner goes down twenty one days of living on the edge as told by grace winter a newlywed young lady who is 'writing a diary' of the events i liked the tale but felt a bit incomplete when i finished still i'm glad i read it as it kept my interest and kept the pages turning","365":"i was expecting to be blown away with this book i was not the characters were flat and not exciting the protagonist grace winter was rather boring and not much of heroine in my opinion she was passive aggressive and an opportunist good thing i got this book for free","366":" after indulging my need for a lazy day i finished one book and immediately picked up the next one on my list the lifeboat it grabbed me from page one and kept me turning pages until bleary eyed i finished it at 11 30 p m one thought compelled me to keep reading how would i behave under similar circumstances this book raises difficult issues when if ever is it appropriate to commit an evil act to save others when is inaction the greater evil than violent action how clear and present must danger be in the comfort of one's normal life living morally and ethically is relatively easy in the face of uncertainty and death what causes an individual to relinquish deeply held values and justify unspeakable evil does society have the right to punish heinous acts committed under such circumstances and who among us can know for certain that we would maintain our integrity even if it meant death for ourselves and several others this debut novel pulses with drama that unfolds through characters who are complex and very human i highly recommend this book i predict you will read it in one sitting and then find yourself wrestling with existential questions for a long while thereafter","367":"fairly slow moving considering 90% of this takes place on a boat characters i didnt think were developed all that well everything is told from one persons pov","368":" given all the hoopla around the titanic anniversary this was a well timed release with a premise guaranteed to intrigue--a ship sinking in the atlantic at the start of wwi and what happens to the survivors remaining in one lifeboat for weeks on end it's life of pi with a touch of steinbeck hitchcock and a dollop of the narrator from gillespie and i a short quick read but one with many layers in fact i'm sort of surprised by it's low rating on goodreads given how ridiculously high people often rate things it seems many people are going into it expecting a rollicking adventure and not the dark introspective text that this is while i would have liked more resolution on some of the subplots overall i was very intrigued and sped through this one","369":"pretty good interesting issues involving ethical and survival choices made by a group in a lifeboat for 21 days the book slogged through some slow spots for me","370":"definitely an interesting book the old question of only so many people can fit into a lifeboat who would you save is addressed somewhat in this book it starts out with grace the narrator being on trial for what we don't know and then the rest of the book is more or less a flashback to being on a lifeboat after the luxury vessel she was on sank you need patience for the moral and emotional questions this book raises but i found it to be a worthwhile read","371":" just like some of the other readers i had certain hopes for action plot entertainment but in the end felt disappointed i had to permanently remind myself of the time period to which the story was anchored because the role of women in the book is rather repulsive the role of men is to sacrifice themselves for the comfort of women and in the end the women turn beastly against the men the worst for me was to read the thought excursions of the lead character grace nothing but bridal dress and boring snobbery thoughts i caught myself skipping paragraphs then even entire sections but i liked the authors idea of showing unabashed how women can turn wicked and from wicked to raw and brutal in thought and action that i think is bold and daring that's also where this book scores points big time to blow away the myth that being a woman makes you automatically a better human this could have become a grand novel if it had focused on this very issue had explored it and bolstered it with a fierce narrative drive","372":"the lifeboat is a book that taps into one of those great fear moments a ship sinks in the middle of the atlantic ocean and 39 survivors find themselves in a lifeboat with little food and water and no idea when or even if rescue is coming as the situation becomes increasingly desperate allegiances are formed and broken and the survivors are forced to make some impossible decisions grace is a seemingly sweet if naive young woman but as more of her story emerges before during and after her time at sea her motives and actions become more and more muddied is it reality or simply an over active imagination and blurred memories with flashbacks to her and henry's courtship the hours before the sinking of the ship and her criminal trial the truth becomes ever more evasive the lifeboat also poses some interesting moral questions if you own survival is at stake how far would you go to ensure that you were last man or woman standing how can a particular situation or person influence your actions and in such a fishbowl environment can everything be taken at face value the language in which the lifeboat is written is perfect for the era i was immediately immersed in the world of 1914 and the desperation and anxiety of the survivors had me completely hooked the lifeboat is an incredible debut for ms rogan it reads like a book written by a seasoned experienced author read more of my reviews atthe aussie zombie","373":"audio a slow moving story about people surviving on a lifeboat and the decisions that have to be made set after the sinking of the titanic in the northern atlantic","374":"little slow and a bit tedious i would have preferred less lifeboat and more trial or else more drama in the lifeboats rather than explanations and descriptions of seemingly unimportant details the events of the lifeboat appeared to build up to this trial the rationale behind me wanting to keep reading but it was rushed felt brushed over and very anticlimactic ending was unsatisfying heroine was quite unlikeable","375":"i'm don't think i enjoyed this story as much as i had hoped but i'm not sure why perhaps i just didn't care much for the main character or maybe i was more in the mood for an uplifting story when i read this and this book was certainly not that there were definitely some interesting parts and it was well written","376":"review forthcoming","377":" 1914 an ocean liner sinks there is a boat full of survivors how do they react cope the book will take you on a voyage to explore human reactions in my opinion it was a great pacey book it wanes a little toward the last quarter but picks up again after that it made me think about all sorts of life issues and moral decisions it helped me examine the effect that those who have an 'air of authority' about them have on others whether it is actual or perceived authority the book brings out the obvious questions of 'what would you do in that situation ' 'how would you respond ' 'would your will power be sufficient to survive ' etc however it also brings out other deeper questions about ones response to adversity defence of actions that are perceived as moral and correct faith are impaired decisions better than no decision at all etc over all a good read as i said i loved the pace anything less and it would have lost its impact","378":"this book was a study into the human nature of survival and societal pressures much was said not a lot was done and it was confusing at times what the story was really about however the language used to tell the story was rich and well spoken and it was a much more intelligent novel than most i have been reading as of late","379":"a good yarn about people lost at sea","380":"i enjoyed the way that the book was written through the eyes of a survivor of a shipwreck and trying to pick out the truth from the dishonesty however i was glad to reach the end","381":"after i finished this book i considered the reading time invested in it wasted the two main characters don't have a positive attribute between them and the two most interesting minor characters are poorly developed until the last few pages the plot has no ending there is no sense of resolution whatsoever i would not recommend this novel to anyone who isn't a cast iron die hard reader the plot and characters have a great deal of possibility none of the possibilities has been developed at all very disappointing","382":"well written psychological detailed but utterly boring and uninteresting to me none of the characters ever mattered i felt nothing for them and sort of wished they all died","383":"i saw this on the best seller lists and looked forward to reading it based on the premise but i was disappointed i really can't recommend it because the style of writing just doesn't resonate with me it felt aimless scattered and disconnected none of the characters were particularly likable and the story just drug","384":"i read this quickly because i wanted answers to the mystery surrounding the people on the lifeboat several of those questions go unanswered there were many times i just wanted to throw grace off of the boat oh wait maybe i am more like her than i want to be it should make for an interesting book club discussion","385":"an ok story about people in a lifeboat after a ship sinks and how their thinking evolves i think it could have been better","386":"kind of disappointed the plot really isn't that bad set in 1914 it's the beginning of wwi after the sinking of the empress alexandra 39 people are adrift in the atlantic cramped up in a lifeboat that can't carry that many people apparently the book starts off with the narrator grace telling the story retrospectively which i didn't like how it was done this ruined it for me because i had no clue our narrator was looking back on what happened and so that made the story fall flat at one point in the story it was suddenly very fast paced and then dragged again and i didn't know what i was reading anymore there are many mixed reviews on this book in my opinion it's a good plot gone to waste","387":" the year is 1914 there has been a shipwreck and as the title implies grace and 39 others are on a lifeboat awaiting rescue i loved the beginning of this book the details are not all together or not there at all and there is much confusion i found it compelling and really wanted to know what was going to happen but the last quarter of the book with the turn of a page suddenly drops you into a trial and you have no idea what has happened to the lifeboat or everyone on it it was just confusing and lost my interest","388":"one of those books that i found competently written but that never quite got me by the throat in particular i found myself struggling with some of the characters because i never fully bought into their motivations as presented","389":"a scary psychological tale of what happens when a group of dissimilar people get stuck together in a horrible life changing situation well written and good characterizations","390":"this as two stars indicates was okay it was a semi interesting look at the human psyche in a survival situation but that's about it it briefly touched on women's suffrage a theme that was maybe more important in earlier drafts but then written out overall no real complaints but also not one i'll be reading again","391":"a little slow going in places but worth the time","392":"very interesting story would make a great book discussion read lot's to think about with this one","393":"not an altogether gripping or entertaining story but something i happened to find on holiday and borrowed for a couple days glad i read it but it is not a 'feel good' tale more a serious fictional tale covering all manner of deep emotions of trauma and fear sorrow and loss worth reading if you are comfortable with topics associated with these emotions there are notes of hope and optimism and i think this is what kept me reading the book it is gripping at times and i'm glad i read it","394":"2 5 would be the most fair rating from me","395":"i really liked this realistic my only complaint was there wasn't much detail about their eventual rescue","396":"this book takes place just before world war i erupts when a ship goes down and we follow the events on one of the lifeboats as day after day goes by without help arriving in between we learn about a trial about to take place with several people from the lifeboat charged with murder you'll have to wait until the end to see how it all plays out mostly i thought this book was very good not quite excellent but not bad","397":"another book i was prepared to like but didn't i never really got inside any character's head enough to care about them and the pacing was just plain strange","398":"i found this book difficult to plod through first the writer keeps us hooked as the lifeboat is adrift for 16 days too long and the characters struggle to survive having to make very difficult emotional decisions about their survival then suddenly we find ourselves in a courtroom with grace and two other characters on trial for murder really what happened to the rescue to the credit of the writer she did go back to the rescue but in my opinion didn't cover it enough from the emotional perspective of the characters this is what they had been waiting for after 21 days at sea when i got to the ending i thought to myself huh this is the ending on a positive note i thought the writer did a good job with the grace character she was complex she portrayed her as being very smart to being indecisive manipulative and calculating","399":"the concept is totally interesting the execution didn't live up to its potential none of the characters even the protagonist were drawn with much depth","400":" without sounding cliche' this is a harrowing tale of survival not just once but twice to be adrift on a lifeboat without any prospect of rescue grace winter is just one of dozens of castaways from a cruise liner that has sunken a mere 2 years after the titanic sank a lifeboat that cannot hold all of the castaways for a few reasons who lives who dies who should live or die these are some of the obvious questions but there is also the larger scope of a microcosm of a society being formed within the lifeboat along with rules laws choices on things like food water weight upon the boat and course of action i myself felt the burden of each choice as i read this book realizing that there are not always right answers without spoiling anything at all i will say that surviving on the lifeboat is but one aspect of this story and that another has to do with events occurring elsewhere it creates the basis for the other form of survival that i alluded to above and yet many of the same questions are posed for the consequences of what occurs on the lifeboat itself this is a humorless tale obviously but that is not a criticism there are a couple of moments that are unintentionally funny e g signs from god interpretations that they are signs of prevailing or signs of succumbing to fate but expect a heavy story from the onset","401":" imagine you are stuck on a tiny boat floating in the vast ocean lost to the world with dwindling supplies and a few too many people how do you cope do you take charge do you follow the majority do you give up hope do you wait for things to get better for the passengers of the sunken empress alexander life is about to get very hard as they wait for rescue and debate whether they will be rescued or if they need to rescue themselves crises bring out survival instincts and test moral characters much like the lord of the rings the inhabitants of this tiny lifeboat form their own little world and must struggle to stay alive and to keep up hope despite the grave and seemingly hopeless circumstances this small little book really makes you think how would you behave in this situation would it bring out your best or your worst can you live with the decisions you are forced to make under duress","402":"this books leads you through the events and emotions that occur when survivors of a shipwreck are in a lifeboat together it shows how different characters cope and what the passengers are prepared to do to save their own lives it makes you question what you would do in that situation and shows how in 1914 even in a lifeboat class can still be a distinction i enjoyed it but not as much as i hoped","403":"i wanted to like it more than i did decent read just nothing that blew my sock off","404":"i love shipwreck stories and from the premise i thought i would love this one but despite the interesting beginning i closed the book at the end and thought what was the point of that did i miss something crucial or did none of the smaller mysteries get solved although i finished the book i am not recommending it","405":"thought it was good dark made you wonder about your own mind left many questions i had unanswered but i think that was intentional","406":"great story well written and exciting lacking a little at the end i enjoyed that activity in the lifeboat much more then the story of the trial","407":"interesting look into the psychology of survival","408":"i'm giving this the mystery suspense tag because i think it does suspense rather well i picked this up after hearing lots about it and survival stories are always interesting this is basically a fictional version of what might have happened in one of the titanic lifeboats except this goes a step further as there was a somewhat mysterious death in the lifeboat and one of the occupants is now on trial i found this very compelling and suspenseful and i think rogan wrote well a strong debut in my opinion","409":"reminded me of the other typist psychological drama","410":"set in time contemporary to the titanic a large shipwreck then 39 people end up in a lifeboat whichis not made to hold so that many something has to give and we start the book knowing that some of the passengers will go on trial for events in the boat an unreliable narrator is telling us the story very suspenseful and a quick read but i was not fully satisfied at the end felt i was left with too many unanswered questions","411":"i would give this book 3 1 2 stars there were some interesting characters but could have been revealed more in depth i liked to concept of the book although it just didn't get me wrapped up in it","412":"very clever and interesting characters but it only gets 3 stars as it is a tension filled book but i did not feel the need to push through as expected perhaps i expected too much","413":"read straight through but wish i hadn't read the reviews before reading interesting life and death issues like what would i do in such a situation in unbroken by hillenbrand the men talk to each other to save their sanity in the lifeboat people seem to have gotten crazy quicker 21 days vs several weeks that's military training for you","414":"when i read the premise i expected little beyond a trite reworking of the hitchcock stienbeck movie from the 40's that gave me nightmares for years i was delightfully surprised to discover a beautifully and subtley crafted book written from the point of view of a deliciously ambiguous and unreliable narrator if you love action and want everything clearly spelled out for you you will hate this book if you want to do some fresh thinkiing on some old and always fascinating questions about human nature society faith morality and truth you will probably enjoy this read fabulous first novel i will be thinking about grace for a long time","415":"an ok book wasn't as good as i thought it would be","416":"it was a nice weekend read charlotte rogan has a refreshing writing and the book brings about an interesting discussion on what is acceptable or not when you find yourself in extreme situations what i found quite amusing is how she was able to introduce a certain comical touch to the dreadful circumstances in which the people in the lifeboat found themselves","417":"the premise here had merit and the narrative voice is just cold enough that the reader is left with some very interesting questions this would be a great book club discussion for many reasons for me though i needed to both like the narrator more and have something concrete to work with too many of the questions the book raises are left in ambiguity i didn't need a need ending but to tie up one or two things in a clear way would have helped me or a good book club discussion to figure it out would do the trick too","418":"the book was very boring i should have stopped reading it and not wasted my precious reading time good thing i did not pay full price for this","419":"audiobook two stars it was okay as i was listening it was having a hard time keeping my attention i think i must have missed some important stuff because i was totally underwhelmed at the end","420":"really liked it good writing but something felt missing from it great idea though","421":"i liked this book it was an interesting example of the unreliable narrator and gave glimpses of her true character vs who she wanted to be seen as for the purposes of her defense and yet i never fully emotionally connected but i also felt that perhaps the character never did either so it is squeaking in with three stars","422":" i think that as a first novel this book was ok i really wish the character had been more deliberate and fleshed ot i would have liked to spend more time with the main character grace before the accident to really get a sense of her what the author did very well in my opinion was recreate the norms and expectations of women right before wwi perhaps the lack of clarity in the character springs from the fact that she is always defining herself in relationship to someone else that women weren't really allowed to be themselves i'm not entirely sure that would explain some of the reasons behind grace's distant sounding voice throughout the story","423":" grace winter is twenty two years old and on trial for her life the events she is on trial for occurred on a lifeboat she was on after the ship the empress alexandra exploded one fateful summer night in 1914 and sank in the atlantic \"married for ten weeks and a widow for over six \" grace's life has taken a terrible unexpected turn told through flashbacks we slowly learn from grace what happened after the terrible explosion she would never have survived if her husband henry had not forced her onto lifeboat 14 along with mr hardie a member of the crew and then walked away never to be seen again once the boat was launched if it had not been for mr hardie who took command and drafted people to take the oars and row away from the sinking ship they might have been caught in it's treacherous vortex while grateful to be on the lifeboat grace and the others soon realize that it is too full and riding precariously low so even as they come across people in the water they cannot take them in without jeopardizing themselves soon they realize they are short on water and the emergency rations are running low and still there is no sign of rescue or the possibility of reaching land we never know how we will react to extreme circumstances i think we all hope that we would act in ways we could live with later but as rogan points out we are not always able to bring our best selves forward when our lives are in jeopardy or we feel threatened grace's calm and seemingly forthright narration takes us deep into the human psyche and helps us see that the choices are not always so clear and that deprivation starvation and uncertainty can exact a terrible toll on our ability to think or feel clearly this was a page turner skipping back and forth between the trial and grace's account of what happened on the lifeboat kept me on the edge of my seat rogan has captured the complicated relationships in the boat and it's various personalities but mostly we see through grace's eyes the disintegration of civility when only fear and scarcity surround you","424":" great debut fiction from charlotte rogan lifeboat is very well written novel about testing the physical and mental survival in a lifeboat after the liner empress alexandra sunk traveling from europe to america in 1914 grace winter's experience engages the reader only through her perspective about the true nature of the human mind of course with the unexpected twists this leaves the reader turning pages faster than bailing water from a life boat it will keep you going until the very last page","425":"the book was a quick and entertaining read but i just couldn't get past the thought of hour unrealistic the situation was also to make us have the pitty of a woman around wwi i guess i needed more background to feel any real compasion or understanding for her","426":"fascinating story","427":"interesting psychological thriller about thirty nine passengers on lifeboat 14 after their cruise ship empress alexandra sinks after catching fire they are adrift for twenty one days the social order and power struggle between the women and men is examined john hardie a crew member from the ship is initially in charge he forces the survivors to make choices about who will need to jump ship in order for the craft to remain afloat in heavy swells and rains this was a very tense portion of the book and makes the reader think about how fragile life and social order can be ultimately three women hannah west ursula grant and the main protagonist grace winter take charge the fate of mr hardie and others still living in the lifeboat is in their hands when they are rescued by an icelandic fishing vessel seventeen women three men and one boy are alive hannah ursula and grace face trial for first degree murder this was a very interesting twist on gender role reversal what happens when women are in charge and the power balance is taken from men did hardie initially make the right choices by having the men draw straws to determine who would jump first to the best of his abilities was hardie committed to the survival of everyone they certainly faired better in lifeboat 14 than on the other lifeboat they came upon when difficult choices need to be made for survival what constitutes first degree murder or suicide should women and men be sacrificed in equal numbers do women need to be spared or protected or should they have an equal weight in being sacrificial is dr cole the court appointed psychologist to be trusted or not was dr cole a misogynist good book for a book group discussion","428":"the story was good the ending was a let down the author could have done more with the ending i thought","429":"a rather trite theme too many people in a life boat sacrifice some to save more or all risk death still i enjoyed the codependence of the protagonist","430":" i had high hopes for this book and really wanted to like it in fact there was much about it that i did like however like some others who reviewed this book i never felt sure that grace was a reliable narrator could we really believe her story of what happened she even admits there were gaps in her memory and all the other survivors had different stories to tell about each other i also expected a revelation at the end and was disappointed to not get it but perhaps this is one of those endings where we ourselves decide what really happened","431":"4 of 5 stars i enjoyed this story of alice a survivor among 39 others on a lifeboat after their ocean liner explodes and sinks she narrates a story of the politics amongst the passengers on the overcrowded boat as their water and food supplies dwindle over the course of their weeks at sea almost immediately factions develop that determine the fate of more than one passenger the story is written as her memories of what happened while she is on trial for murder very interesting story","432":"this book was really just ok for me i felt it lacked excitement a stronger point","433":"tedious and pointless","434":"loved it the lifeboat would make a excellent book club pick","435":"i loved the premise of this book 1914 a ship sinks in the mid atlantic and our protagonist is on a lifeboat with 38 other strangers it's sort of a mystery why were corners cut when building this ship why was there so much gold that was put on board at the last minute how does it relate to our protagonist's husband the banker what was mr hardie's big secret in relation to mr blake and or his little secret box that he kept hidden away is our narrator truly reliable or is she simply self serving in writing this account after the fact unfortunately it's only sort of a mystery because most of these questions are never fully answered the book does attempt to delve into big questions of morality vs self preservation religion issues with leadership influence and groupthink i had very high hopes for this book and while it did hold my attention and i wanted to find out the answers to my many questions the lack of character development and plot details really left me flat by the end of the book i was left wondering if i missed something important or if the details i was searching for were just never included","436":" i was so disappointed in this book it seemed to have gotten such good reviews and had an intriguing premise and i was looking forward to a good read in some ways it kept my attention but at other times i couldn't have cared less about the characters they weren't developed enough especially the narrator grace i didn't particularly like her nor did i feel her connection with her new husband there were only about eight 'vocal' characters but there were 39 people on the boat i didn't want to get to know all of them but i wanted to feel their presence moral issues were raised but i didn't feel involved the last few chapters were awful there was nothing compelling about them and little to no courtroom drama how did they come to be on trial honestly by that point i didn't really care","437":"won't be one of my favorites definitely well written with great imagery but i had to force myself to pick it up and read started out interesting and i thought i would really enjoy the story of a lifeboat overloaded with survivors from a sinking cruise ship and the choices of who will live and who will die but it just seemed to go on and on and on i didn't find anything really interesting about the characters they were just what i would have expected the brutal crew member taking charge the minister attempting to administer to the spiritual needs of the survivors and everything in between just not the book for me","438":"i forced myself to finish and hated every page","439":"interesting although i wanted to love it more i expected this to end with punch and verve in a really interesting way but it didn't do it for me i was hoping for a gillian flynn like twist i guess and finding something out that had been hidden or something about the narrator we hadn't previously known but i got nothing of that and it seemed to end with a sigh","440":"the author created beautiful descriptions some of her language reminded me of poetry the setup of the book was interesting but i thought the characters were horrible and i didn't connect to them i think the dilemma of the book deciding what to do with an overcrowded lifeboat would have been more interesting with more fully drawn characters","441":"i had a hard time getting into this book at least the parts while in the lifeboat","442":"a good story but too much philosophical pondering","443":" the lifeboat was one of my book club's reads but at the time i didn't really mind because it had been lurking on the edges of my radar for some time it's a fairly short read i read it over a few days in the middle of the working week and predominantly character based as you would expect because there's not really very much change in scenery on a small boat in the middle of the ocean as you'd expect from the title the book is about a ship that sinks in the middle of the ocean on the way to america from england the majority of the book takes place on the lifeboat with some asides to the pre boarding time of grace and her new husband and the aftermath in some ways it reminded me of emma donoghue's the sealed letter in that we see all the events unfolding to finish with a big crescendo when i read this book i really didn't mind it but didn't love it i thought grace the narrator was cleverly done as she appeared to be both naive at times then quite calculating i think rogan left enough hints for me to doubt how reliable grace was as a narrator using grace as the narrator i felt made some of the boat's power struggles between characters seem less important than what they may have been perhaps using the third person would have demonstrated this a bit more clearly as well as showing the issues without bias however i think rogan was testing the reader's power of observation in addition to making us question how often we believe someone is telling the absolute truth rather than their version i thought the boat scenes dragged sometimes and felt repetitive - there was a lot of moaning and fatalistic comments but that appeared to ring true with what i think would happen if you were stuck on a lifeboat when relief came this is not a spoiler it all happened too quickly and without the power plays that had been going on in the lifeboat a lot of people at my book club disliked this book however i must warn you that there is one person who detests every book we read - they felt it was boring and could have been more eventful i think rogan did well with what she had and we need to remember this is grace's story few shared my thoughts that grace was not the most unbiased person to tell the story but then again was anyone in that boat i think if you're interested in stories of survival or books with unreliable narrators you'll like this one http samstillreading wordpress com","444":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here passengers and crew of a sunken ship struggle for survival in a cramped lifeboat the story is narrated by grace winter who is one of the survivors in the lifeboat and recently married to a wealthy american it is clear from the beginning of the book that grace is eventually rescued and later faces trial but the alleged crime and the circumstances in which it was committed are only revealed later in the novel this is an accomplished first novel with a gripping plot that is especially topical passengers and crew of a sunken ship struggle for survival in a cramped lifeboat the story is narrated by grace winter who is one of the survivors in the lifeboat and recently married to a wealthy american it is clear from the beginning of the book that grace is eventually rescued and later faces trial but the alleged crime and the circumstances in which it was committed are only revealed later in the novel this is an accomplished first novel with a gripping plot that is especially topical exactly 100 years after the sinking of the titanic the difference though is that passengers on the titanic were rescued relatively quickly whereas grace and her fellow survivors spend weeks trapped in the lifeboat and many of them perish before rescue arrives the characters are flawed and all the more credible for that as the story develops and we learn more about grace doubts start to grow about her motivation and morals and whether her version of events is entirely correct so far as the plot is concerned i found hardie's death difficult to believe would a group of people who had gone through such a harrowing experience together decide to kill one of their number in addition i was unclear what the mysterious box that hardie had on the lifeboat was meant to contain and what happened to it more","445":"a compelling debut centering around a moral dilemma faced by a strong interesting female protagonist","446":"this was on the recommended shelf at my favorite local bookstore and it was a nice read probably more of a library read than one that i recommend buying but definitely worth reading we start out at grace's trial we don't know exactly what she is on trial for but this tells us that she has clearly survived being on the titular lifeboat we immediately jump back to when she and 39 others from the empress queen ship find themselves in a lifeboat just over a year after the titanic sinks mostly women but a few men and one child this group is stuck together until that rescue ship comes along it's coming right right the book is interesting because it tells the story from a narrator who can't possibly know everything and it touches on very interesting philosophical questions basically it's like one big thought experiment there is a lot going on for a bunch of people stuck on a small lifeboat but at the same time we don't get resolution to everything i can't figure out if this is brilliant storytelling because do we every really know the full truth or lazy storytelling because the author created this world she can tell us the full truth if she wants i devoured the first half then somehow was distracted but finished in on a flight maybe two weeks later i think it's worth a read if you come across it but it isn't a must read","447":"i enjoyed this book the writer managed to convey the paranoia of the lifeboat and i am still pondering a few things two days after finishing","448":"boring boring boring","449":"although i couldn't stop reading it i found the book to be just ok nothing more just ok","450":"i liked this book but it did not really jump out at me and say i must recommend this to everyone i'm not even sure how i would classify it mainly survival story part history and a few other things it just felt like i had heard this story before reminiscent of the alfred hitchcock movie of the same title after their ocean liner sinks 39 people are standed on a lifeboat this is where their story of survival begins as time progresses and the elements begin to take their toll on the passengers of the boat both mentally and physically alliances are formed decisions are questioned and sacrifices are made the big question or theme throughout the book is when desperate times call for drastic measures how do you go about making those decisions and should you be punished for them once you are rescued","451":"read this entire book on my flight to minneapolis today very short and easy read well i guess it's not easy to read about 30 some people trapped on a lifeboat for 21 days and the things that they do to survive but a compelling read all the same and very intriguing if you need a good book to capture your attention","452":"i was reading this bit by bit at barnes u0026amp noble my bookmark was in it almost every time finally picked it up at the library","453":"an unsatisfying read rogan raised many questions and left most of them hanging it has the feel of required high school reading the protagonist is thinly drawn and in the end you don't really care whether she lives or dies the plot is highly contrived and there is so little action just endless thoughts of grace whom i found unlikeable at best","454":"i had such high hopes for this book but i just didn't care for it i felt like too many things were introduced and then left open and not tied up and as a friend of mine said not a lot of character development my book club girls and i all agreed we didn't even care if grace got tossed overboard b c she was annoying","455":"i listened to this book and found myself impatient when short of opportunities to get to it i felt enthralled by both simultaneously told stories the survival or not in the lifeboat after the ocean liner fire and the resulting murder trial of three women survivors for their actions during the 3 weeks at sea i felt soaked and cold and hungry and thirsty i felt mired in the moral dilemmas caused by 39 people in a lifeboat not big enough to support that many i was totally into the book but then it ended i was left somewhat flat grace winter the 22 year old narrator had been such unreliable eyes to see the story through when all was said and done after spending a whole book with her i could not be sure if she was strong weak independent conniving or just plain emotionally unable to connect with what happens to her i went from being sympathetic to wanting to shake her and she wasn't in a position to really know enough to tie up so many loose ends and nobody else stepped forward to do that and the loose ends were a problem for me a bit of a spoiler here what was the deal about the jewels what was the issue between mr hardy and mr blake was there something fishy about how grace got on the lifeboat what happened with grace and henry's mother why was there a trial in the first place and i could list a few more so averaging out a great story while in the throes of it and a deflating aftermath i came up with a 3 rating","456":"newlywed grace winter is sailing with her husband henry on an ocean liner across the atlantic when a mysterious explosion sinks the ship henry makes sure grace gets into one of the lifeboats and she never sees him again as the story unfolds we find out what happens to grace and her fellow survivors on that lifeboat and through flashbacks we learn a little more about her and how she came to be on the ship and how she came to be mrs henry winter and how she came to be eventually tried for murder along with two other survivors of the disaster a riveting page turner amazing that this is charlotte rogan's first book published at age 57","457":"this is the story of a girl who is in a shipwreck and stranded on a lifeboat for many days it is set not long after the sinking of the titanic she is not a likable character but an intriguing one it is well written and gives the reader a real sense of time and place there is a big twist at the end that i did not see coming","458":"i classify this as a good summer read it was quick it did not require immense amounts of energy to untangle and the story was engrossing i enjoyed the exploration of the thick gray between right and wrong and the questions about humanity at its core this was rogan's first novel and based on what i read here i would definitely pick up another from her","459":"a very thought provoking book in the vain of lord of the flies i was a little put off in the beginning by the pacing of the novel but knew that because the shortness of the book things would have to pick up eventually maybe this was a short story stretched out into a novel this would make a great book discussion choice","460":"slow and boring felt like it was three times as long as it really was the premise was interesting and i should have loved it but i really didn't care about anything or anyone at all","461":"what makes for a survivor according to grace the narrator of this gripping novel admirable traits are often exactly the same as negative ones only expressed in a different way read my qu0026amp a with the author at http annegoodwin weebly com charlot","462":"i had been wanting to read this book for some time but was a bit disapointed in it kept my interest but felt i didn't really get to know the main character very well","463":"i was really looking forward to reading this book but to be honest i was disappointed the characters were not well developed and i did not like or feel sympathy for any of them the ending also left something to be desired again i had high hopes","464":" yet another book that grows on you it's exactly the story you think 40 folks on a lifeboat and rescue doesn't come as told by a 24 year old newly married woman much stronger psychologically physically emotionally than she lets on to the reader she tells the story in her own voice at one key point she says of another character and to the reader if i had not felt so sorry for him i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know","465":"when we are babies we need an authoritative figure to guide and take care of us we ask no questions about that authority and imagine that the small circumference of our family life is the limit of the universe and that what we see before us is what exists everywhere and also that it is all as it should be as we mature our horizon expands and we begin to question this continues until we either throw over our creators our parents for good and take their place as the creative force in our own lives or find replacements for them because the terror and responsibility are too great people go one way or the other and this accounts for all of the great personal and political divides throughout history ~ mr sinclair","466":"\"i wondered if all a person could hope for was illusion and luck for i was forced to conclude that the world was fundamentally and appallingly dangerous it is a lesson i will never forget \" the lifeboat by charlotte rogan is a book about basic human nature and the things we are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive the contrast between nature and culture civilization and isolation is central to this novel rogan explores the social structures and power struggles that can arise in an isolated environment where the main rule is 'survival of the fittest' in fact this story takes us back to the raw brutal and simplistic primal forces that lies within us all while this most certainly is an interesting topic it has been written many times before with much more insight and depth i would rather pick golding's lord of the flies up again than read this rogan adds nothing new to her subject she uses an absurd amount of pages on something we've all heard before and she comes to no conclusion at all a book with such a strong topic ought to make an impact on you but this really didn't at all the book has no building suspense no unpredictability and it keeps repeating the same pattern over and over and over again mr hardie's brutal strength is dwelled upon several times his personality is constantly contrasted with mrs grant's moral compass and the eventual power struggle between those two characters is inevitable whenever a character died or was murdered i felt nothing at all rogan's characters leaves no impression on the reader they are faceless inventions and they can't really be separated from each other the result is a mere 'oh well' every time something dramatic concurs for a while i thought the book would take an uexpected turn in the style of martel's life of pi but it never did it ended as weak and timidly as it began and that was it no symbolic complexity no profound conclusion just an ending with a sure guarantee of everlasting oblivion","467":"an explosion on a luxury liner sends passengers scrambling for lifeboats grace and several other passengers overcrowd a lifeboat where they remain adrift for many days treacherous ocean storms death hunger and thirst plague them forcing life and death decisions and sacrifices and after all the bittersweet life and death situations ended grace ultimately finds herself on trial for her life sending the reader swirling into conflict once more with highly detailed fast paced writing the author literally made me feel as if i was on that boat i suffered through the poignant moments the desperation and the unfailing determination to survive by the heroine the lifeboat had scenes that were so poignant so tragic it gripped me from start to finish this is a story that will make you feel as anguished as the passengers an unusual fascinating novel of historical fiction absolutely enjoyable","468":"the lifeboat was a dramatic story of a young new bride who escapes a sinking ship along with 39 other passengers their 21 day journey is filled with a gamut of emotion faith abandonment horror despair and a bit of hope a heart wrenching story this tale gives rise to many moral and ethical issues that people must cross in the face of mortal peril this was not a feel good story but is packed full of great discussion questions and the unpredictability of human nature this was a quick read for me only because i couldn't put it down","469":" two stars perhaps is a bit harsh perhaps two and a half it was a well written book but i kept floating away from it i had to re read bits when loosing the thread of what was happening though i'm not sure why it was completely different from anything i've read before probably because i avoid stories set in what would be a nightmare for me i have a phobia of the sea especially being stranded also i didn't care very much for the character which was a shame a well written book but it failed to hold my attention","470":"great survivor story in the victorian era","471":"it's hard to imagine how a book set almost entirely in a small lifeboat could hold your attention for hundreds of pages but it does i was sucked in from the very first pages definitely a testament to rogan's smooth and engaging writing style","472":"so boring i barely got through it 219 pages and it took me two weeks the writing was choppy disjointed and slow grace was possibly the most unsypathetic character in any book i have ever read i really wanted her to jump overboard around page 80","473":" if you want to know what you are made of or know the character of others and yourself just be out to sea in a rescue boat after your cruise boat sinks the narrative is done by grace who is young woman recently married set right after several years after the sinking of the titanic suspicions run wild as you put your life in the hands of others a rescue boat that should hold 40 people but in actuality can hold safely about 20 what do you do the writer is very graphic in this tale of humanity for a fight for survival the story goes in the life before grace's sea adventure and her relationship with others in her boat grace in herself is a character that you are not sure of is she decisive manipulative or a victim of herself i thought the book was written quite well however i did not connect to the characters as much as i would like one strong attribute of this tale was the writing i think this tale makes a better book than it would a movie","474":"i really enjoyed this book the main character is so difficult i swung from liking her strength to being so frustrated by her complete submission there is a continual suspense throughout the book which i really enjoyed at the end i was left with so many questions this would be a great book club read the subtext running throughout would make a great discussion","475":"i vacillated back and forth with whether to give this three stars because the story sort of faltered a bit the last 60 pages or so or four stars because the writing was really quite brilliant in the end i settle on four because a debut novel this well written deserves a star bump the narration of the ships accident and subsequent lifeboat ordeal was very compelling there are some mystery intrigue suspense type teasers that didn't really pan out i don't think and i'm not really sure i bought that the main character and narrator grace was a mere 22 years of age the voice sounded much older and more mature and nothing in her revelations about herself suggested that she'd endured the life experience necessary to have the resolve strength or determination that she exhibited if the writing were not as strong as it was i'd be forced to deduct a star for this breech in authenticity quick read i don't think you'd at all regret spending the day or two it will take to read it","476":"wishing i could have been there for the discussion of this one a fascinating narrator who i am not sure was entirely reliable and i'm not sure that it can possibly be certain that her intention was to be unreliable or as honest as she possibly could","477":"a must read you will read this in one day","478":"boring i should have stopped reading but just had to know if they got rescued after reading unbroken's lifeboat drama this book pales in comparison","479":"in 1914 two years after the titanic was lost and in the early days of the great war the liner `empress alexandra' set sail from liverpool to new york in the middle of the atlantic there was an explosion causing fires to break out and irreparable damage in the ensuing chaos just half of the lifeboats were launched grace winter had been a young bride on her way to meet her new husband's family for the first time but she found herself on lifeboat 14 without her husband but one of the lucky ones who got away but getting away getting the lifeboat clear of the wreckage was only the beginning the thirty one women six men and one child on lifeboat 14 needed a ship to come to their rescue but nothing came i knew that there would be a rescue the opening chapter had told me that grace and two other women were on trial for their lives as a consequence of events on the lifeboat and yet the story of what happened was utterly utterly compelling one ship's officer mr hardie was assigned to the lifeboat and he takes command at first his knowledge and his skills are respected but as days pass as food and water supplies diminish he becomes more authoritarian difficult decisions have to be made and mr hardie's authority is challenged by ursula grant and hannah west two strong and capable women relationships begin to break down and conditions become more and more difficult as a psychological novel the lifeboat is a tour de force showing how some will crumble but others will survive when faced with such a terrible situation showing how easily perceptions are altered as rumours and gossip spread like wildfire through the boat showing how communities and relationships can crack under pressure the evocation of life on lifeboat 14 really is extraordinary and the proximity the vastness the power of the ocean is tangible and grace's narration was a masterstroke she was clearly an unreliable narrators missing many significant points changing her interpretation of events changing her loyalties she lacked empathy with others and so i found it difficult to care about her but she was intriguing nonetheless one thing was certain grace was a survivor there was so much to think about some very big questions about life and humanity and some smaller more specific questions how did grace's husband get her onto the boat what was in the box that mr hardie guarded so closely what happened in the radio room of the empress alexandra why is mr hardie so determined to avoid the only other lifeboat ever sighted and mr blake the ship's officer responsible for it inevitably but still disappointingly there would be no answers and the ending was not quite as strong as what had come before it spoke of the role and position of women in society of what actions might or might not be justified in such extreme circumstances very clearly picking up on ideas planted earlier in the story but it felt just a little bit rushed just a little bit contrived but that was the only time the story lost its grip the only time i was a little less than completely captivated by this intelligent compelling and beautifully written debut novel i suspect that the story of lifeboat 14 will stay with me for a long long time","480":"i don't have much to recommend about this book i had difficulty bonding or identifying with any of the characters which made it difficult to keep track of them in the story line the notions of there being multiple truths and that ethical issues need to be considered within a contextual framework are not particularly new ideas and the author's approach to both these issues is frankly quite ho hum","481":"hooked me from the start a story of survivors of a shipwreck and how they coped with 21 days at sea will very little water and food was surprised by the happenings near the end of the book","482":"this book was a better read than i expected people surviving a shipwreck by escaping in a lifeboat isn't a story that i am usually excited to read but i am glad that i stepped outside my comfort zone and read the lifeboat this is yet another tale of relationships and how people cope with their circumstances and how they survive mainly how grace survives grace the survivor watches waits and evaluates her options before she acts she chose to pursue her henry that way and got her man the man who would rescue her from the circumstances of her unforeseen poverty and the need to work as a governess in the lifeboat she first cast her lot as all 39 survivors did with hardie he was the strongest most experienced person in the boat someone who could actually help them survive until rescued grace resisted the other women in the boat who were trying to take control until it became clear that hardie's power had diminished to the point that the others felt he had to die it was at that point that she submitted to the power of the other women and participated in the murder of hardie it seemed that she acted rashly but i believe she did exactly what she thought she had to do in order to survive and maintain her position in the power hierarchy of the lifeboat at the trial with the other two women being tried she survived and was acquitted by behaving in a way that the jury would view with the most sympathy the other two women were viewed as more forceful more powerful and less attractive and thus with less sympathy for their dire circumstances in the lifeboat they were found guilty in my opinion grace got away with murder she did not have to act at all in the boat there were many that did not act and they were not in danger after the murder grace was drawn to power and seemed unable to resist it even if it meant participating in throwing overboard the person who had kept most of them alive up to that point she walked away to her new life without look back although i thought she lacked character i admired her ability to survive","483":"i had hoped fro more from this book the online description seemed irresistible to me yetthroughout the book i found my interest waning while it did not captivate me it did a very reasonable job of showing what we might do in order to survive no why's needed just survival an interesting thought when we are babies \" he said \"we need an authoritative figure to guide and take care of us we ask no questions about that authority and imagine that the small circumference of our family life is the limit of the universe and that what we see before us is what exists everywhere and also that it is all as it should be as we mature our horizon expands and we begin to question this continues until we either throw over our creators--our parents--for good and take their place as the creative force in our own lives or find replacements for them because the terror and responsibility are too great people go one way or the other and this accounts for all of the great personal and political divides throughout history","484":"the premise for this book sounded great survivors of a ship sinking adrift on a lifeboat but i just couldn't get into the story or develop any caring for the characters i couldn't wait for it to end","485":"i thought the story was interesting but what troubled me was the main character i simply didn't like her it appeared that she married for money despite her protestations to the contrary and was barely phased by deaths of others within close proximity as a survival story life of pi is much better","486":"well i absolutely loved it in fact even though i finished it about three minutes ago i still want to pick the book right back up again and read it cover to cover because i know there will be something else in it that i failed to grasp the first time around","487":"i was impressed by charlotte rogan's first novel it was a great read with at times very beautiful writing it's not often that i stop to admire a sentence or paragraph for how lovely it's written and that happened a few times in this book","488":"whine whine whine ya i know they're on a lifeboat and i'd whine too but it was a slog to read about this from grace's selfish point of view 2 s means 'it was okay' i'm not totally dissing the book and it will be interesting to see what my fellow book clubbers say on monday but my feelings whilst reading were that it was a slog","489":" after a ship sinks 39 survivors are left adrift in one lifeboat waiting for rescue i wanted to like this book but the more i think about it the more i can only think about its flaws the flow of the story was totally messed up starting in the present day then going to the lifeboat for 16 days then back to the present day and then back to the boat for the final rescue because you already pretty much know who lives and who dies there's not really any suspense to the lifeboat plus there were lots of times that a character would say something like i wish i knew if my husband was alive and then the next sentence would be we later found out he was dead so yeah no suspense at all the main character had a really cold and distant tone which kept her unlikeable the number of people in the boat simply kept many of them as unnameable bodies so i didn't care one way or another what happened to them even though i knew i should a lot of times i felt like things weren't happening the way that they really would although i've never been shipwrecked so what do i know and really hitchcock did it better unbroken a world war ii story of survival resilience and redemption also was pretty amazing","490":"how can you write a story about 39 people in a lifeboat for 21 days conventional wisdom would say that not much can happen in the middle of the ocean... ahh... but the unique manner charlotte rogan details the breakdown of civility will cause you to cling to each page as the occupants held on to the boat rogan leaves lots of questions unanswered by design it appears she desires the reader to formulate their own opinions did anyone else wait for the preverbal \"shoe\" to drop during the end of the novel i was waiting for a chris bohjalain or jody picoult revelation that grace really was schizophrenic","491":"can't say enough how much i loved this book never thought i would care for a story about being stuck on a lifeboat but charlotte rogan made me care excellent","492":"the premise was better than the execution not a bad book but could have been better","493":"this would be a good book club choice there are lots of discussion points","494":" i enjoyed the first part of the narrative and the sense of being trapped in a metaphorical prison stuck with me the days stretching on and on the interminable boredom that took over once the fear had abated was well conveyed as were a couple of the characters and the relationships that developed between them sadly i found the latter part of the book surrounding the court case unrealistic and unfulfilling and i was left with a sense of disappointment by the end were we supposed to warm to grace over the course of the novel something that has stuck in my mind is her thought which accompanied the look exchanged with the captain of the boat on the quayside it cemented my view that by the end of the book i didn't really like her much at all","495":"this is most certainly an original and intriguing topic with a particular focus on a woman's 'place' within society in the early 1900's this historic placement alone made it difficult to judge the extremely intriguing protagonist grace who at 22 years old is secured a spot on a lifeboat by her new husband as their ship is sinking and she is cast to sea with a host of characters alas too many for the undersized vessel is she a fragile young bride or a staunchly intelligent manipulator or simply an ordinary woman pushed to the edge of madness by such unimaginably horrific circumstances i believe we see the feral side of human nature far too much in our daily lives now when we are not in fact truly starving and desperate to survive so the extremes that the characters on this boat under the blazing sun and the relentless waves are pushed to did not shock me as much as make me question what i would do myself hopefully i will never be in a position to answer those questions what i loved the most about this book was the underlying tension and intrigue about the main character herself and about what had actually occurred prior to the boat's sinking both of whic for many may not be adequately answered personally i liked the reality of that that we can never really know another person's true nature as we may never truly know our own and that most often we will never be given perfectly adequate explanations for the greatest disasters in our lives and perhaps this is exactly as it must be this is definitely a book that will pop back into your mind again and again long after you have turned the final page","496":" after looking forward to reading this book for months i was sadly disappointed with it the book has potential to be fantastic it just missed the mark grace the main character is not well developed therefore i as the reader never connected with her and didn't care if she decided to hop on over the edge of the boat into the arms of the sea maybe it is because the reader is experiencing the days in the lifeboat through a diary written once the main character is back on land but i never got the sense of dread and doom that you think would be a part of this experience as my friend jen said in her review of this book i have read unbroken which gives a much more believe account of surviving an ordeal on a lifeboat","497":"the premise of the story captivated me and who can help but wonder what they might do if placed in a similar situation the story caught my attention from the very start though near the end i began to find the narration almost too tedious to muddle through and was ready for it to conclude well before it's conclusion i cannot say that i cared for the narrator's character at all though my sympathies did go out to some of the other characters both victims and survivors i will make it a point to read this one again someday","498":" i loved this book i originally saw a review for it in people magazine i love all things titanic and though this is not about the titanic i still thought it was a story line i would enjoy i kind of put it off because i saw it didn't have the best reviews on good reads amazon etc but i just got around to it and i could not stop listening audiobook i finished it in a day i really enjoyed the story of survival and it really does make you think about how people will turn against each other when their own survival lies in the balance the ending was nothing special but i definitely would recommend it","499":"nearly impossible to keep reading but equally impossible to stop a story about our most basic human nature and survival","500":" for any to live some must die rogan gives readers much more than a timely novel about the 39 survivors on a lifeboat during the anniversary year of the titanic she deftly combines elements of struggle in society for class power and redemption from god and covers it with the thin veil of innocence and demure nature that being the fragile mess that is 22 year old newly married and widowed grace with elements readers will recognize from lord of the flies life of pi and moby dick rogan asks the question of the surviving members of the once overcrowded lifeboat can you be alive and still innocent","501":" in the summer of 1914 grace elopes with henry winter and they are traveling home on an elegant ocean liner when there is an explosion on the ship henry gets grace a last minute spot on a lifeboat the lifeboat is overloaded and soon a power struggle occurs among the passengers both for leadership and survival grace is a very interesting narrator who sees the power struggles in a very unconventional manner she is not your typical heroine but a complex woman who has had her own struggles very good book club choice","502":"you're trapped in a lifeboat with 38 other people and although it says it takes 40 the only member of the crew admits it's really only suitable for 32 what do you do assuming you're going to be rescued in few short hours or at most a couple of days you all sit tight and hope a big wave doesn't capsize you but as the days pass with no sign of rescue there needs to be a plan if anyone's going to survive you've got to start making some decisions and some choices and that includes who lives and who dies that's the premise of the lifeboat it's told from the viewpoint of grace a passenger on the probably torpedoed empress alexandra as she looks back on the days adrift in the lifeboat and the struggle amongst its occupants for survival both physical and mental and tries to explain her actions and participation in events that led to the death on the only crew member on the boat as it's written from her point of view you think you know exactly what happened to grace and what part she took in the proceedings but despite her seemingly secondary role if they'd be stranded at sea for many more days would she have been the final survivor was grace the ultimate survivor try looking at this way grace had already survived the destruction of her family her father's ruin in business and suicide her mother's descent into madness by finding salvation in marrying henry she's now adrift in the lifeboat where it becomes apparent they can't all survive but as others die struggle to maintain their sanity or nobly go overboard to save the majority grace survives a seeming oasis of calm amongst her disintegrating fellows on trial for her life for murder grace again seems to be outside on the conniving and manipulating that led to the seaman's death though she was party to the act that killed him again she survives and is freed as she didn't drive the act but was merely caught up in it by others now it's all over she's about to marry her lawyer and is again saved from poverty and a life of toiling drudgery ask yourself the question is grace the luckiest woman alive or is she the ultimate survivor a sociopath with compunction about sacrificing others to save herself a great read and although you know there are 39 people in the boat some of them never come to forefront which i imagine is true in any situation some people just sit still do as their told and just fade quietly without anyone noticing you have to question and question again the opinions you form of the characters who's weak and who's strong the only difficulty i had with it was those who chose to throw themselves overboard to save the lifeboat is any one that good surely the will to survive is too strong to let you do that i know i couldn't","503":"lots of promise and it does hold up but i felt a little let down by the ending still worth your time and a writer to watch","504":"about the time the members of lifeboat 14 at just over max capacity start beating the straggling survivors who are clinging to the side of their boat you know that charlotte rogan means business with her debut novel \"the lifeboat \" this story is not about some hiccup in a three hour tour this is closer to \"the lord of the flies \" the result is a delicious evil fun wrapped in think y moments you're going to have to dust off your most sinister chuckle while you blow through it it's the late 1910s and the empress alexandra is headed to america when there is a fire on board and the ship sinks some of the passengers escape onto lifeboats including the lovely grace winter whose back story becomes increasingly more complicated as the story goes on the gist she was on the ship with her new husband who is was ridiculously wealthy they still have to tell his mother and his former fiance that they've wed their time aboard the ship had been lovely but included some curious moments between her husband and business contacts and unexplained alliances as the ship sank she was tossed into a lifeboat at the last second also under unusual circumstances now here she is with 38 other survivors orbiting the area where the boat sank and waiting for rescue mr hardie who was part of the ship's crew takes charge of the lifeboat with a like it or lump it philosophy sure they can pick up the toddler in the water who is clutching his mother's dead body but who wants to trade places with him so they leave the kid hardie repositions the passengers for optimal weight distribution he doles out assignments rowing bailing and horizon scanning he rations water and kills fish until that luck runs out meanwhile another leader is emerging mrs grant provides one on one comfort and questions the tactics of this self promoted captain as days pass and a few passengers die she becomes stronger soon the boat has divided loyalties that comes to a fever pitch when grace has to decide which side she is on you know that grace survives all of this when the story opens she is on trial and her lawyers are kicking around her level of sanity the reason for the trial is revealed at the height of the story and it's a dizzying scene grace winter is such a great character she's cunning and a survivalist she's done some naughty things in her day in order to stay in the game after a family tragedy also things just happen to her and the muffin always lands butter side up she's got some wonky ideas about male superiority but it's more a symptom of the time period in a setting that is ripe for hallucinations and confusion truth is hard to discern which totally adds to the intrigue like any novel where most of it happens on the ocean there are big metaphors in play and lots of morality and mortality questions come into play rogan handles the unraveling of civilized behavior in a super subtle way","505":"a quick read but i found the characters very flat i don't feel like i really got to know any of them the author told you hannah and mrs grant were significant but i didn't feel it it was if the author was trying to create a background plot that never really materialized","506":"i have a bit of obsession with shipwreck stories and this one did not disappoint the look into human nature and what happens when the will to survive surpasses morality seems true to form not bad for a first novel","507":" in 1914 grace winter and her new husband are returning to the united states when a mysterious explosion causes their ship the empress alexandra to sink in the icy waters of the atlantic grace survives the shipwreck and three harrowing weeks aboard an overcrowded lifeboat but upon rescue she and two other women are charged with murder as part of her defence grace's lawyer requests her to recount her experiences aboard the lifeboat when starvation dehydration shock and dissension between the passengers pushed her beyond the limits of human civility the lifeboat examines the moral dilemma at the heart of survival of the fittest grace is a survivor a twenty two year old woman who has quickly learned how to take care of herself in a man's world she is manipulative in her life before during and after the shipwreck and her account of the events on the lifeboat is periodically vague emotionally detached and highly questionable the narrative style makes the story interesting from a psychological perspective but it limits a connection to any of the characters even grace who seemed very cold and calculating because the emotional attachment wasn't there i didn't feel as invested in the story the characters or the moral dilemma i always find it harder to enjoy a story if i don't really connect with any of the characters however i enjoyed the bare bones of the writing the visual imagery of the ocean especially and the plot though not terribly gripping was compelling enough to read the story very quickly","508":"it was fantastic i am a big fan of the trapped in lifeboat and dying slowly contemplating cannibalism genre and this is definitely a new account of it","509":"not super fast moving but truly intriguing","510":"this book was a disappointment i was hyped up for this story but then was left hanging in some areas a little bit of a let down it feels like the story was a little rushed and then the rest was sort of fill in the blanks i liked the concept and the idea of the story and there were some good descriptions and analyses of different situations but some of these situations came out of nowhere at times without much further explanation bottom line i was surprised at the lack of connections i'm not sure i would recommend it at this point but go ahead and dive in so to speak if you see fit","511":" i'm so excited to get this one in the mail and start reading thank you first read giveaways wow the first hundred pages were like a punch in the face shock and surprise i wanted to get in there and fight back i couldn't turn away and from there it became more of a fascination of physical and mental survival and of the judgement of society which even after the boat continued to play into both overall i really liked how vivid and straightforward the narration is the perfect blend not too flowery or oversimplified the woman grace cuts straight to the heart of the situation undercurrents of thoughts assumptions and actions and blends it perfectly to give color to the situation it's like being fully aware of current consciousness and the future all at the same time","512":"although the story of survival was gripping it was drawn out to the point of boredom i found myself skimming through the second half of this book it bored me simple as that","513":" it seems like an unthinkable situation to be in that no one could predict what they would do but the author creates an entirely believable sequence of events this book fits in well with others i've recently read it is a well crafted examination of human nature in unfathomable circumstances unlike the dinner it told a tale you wanted to continue reading about to find out what the characters do and whether or not you are on their side it is not a true story like five days at memorial but it creates a sympathy that makes adds to my enjoyment of five days","514":"what a great though dark novel certainly gives one pause to consider what anyone myself included would do in similar circumstances here's hoping to never having to find out a compelling look at the way in which the forces of gender faith personality morality and the will to survive come together in a particular place and moment in time definitely worth the read","515":"this book had me sucked in from the beginning the main character is on trial for murder after being in a lifeboat for 21 days how could you not keep reading now that i'm finished i've realized that this book was less about the experience in the lifeboat itself but more about people and relationships it was interesting watching the characters unfold and the alliances on the lifeboat form the story had some etraxeous details that were not necessary in the overall scheme of things but i think the author put them in to show the personality of the main character and how she really wasn't as strong of a woman as she believed herself to be all in all i enjoyed the book and some of the incidents in it were surprising this would be a great book for a book club to read as i'm confident it would lead to much discussion","516":"good easy read with interesting characters and twists in the story","517":"good story nice character development and well written","518":" when grace winter finds herself in the middle of the atlantic ocean with people she barely knows on a lifeboat she begins to see how even the most well mannered people can change in such a situation mourning her husbands death she also discovers a bit more about her true self i thought the novel would be better in the way that i felt as though the first half of the book lacked in drama and really understanding grace with saying that the lifeboat was very well written and a wonderful debut for charlotte rogan i'd read it just under two days and it was a nice break from the mystery plots i usually enjoy i'd recommend it to almost anybody because i think it could be a tale that most people would enjoy","519":"ugh this was a horribly slow read i felt like i was on a lifeboat slowly dying of boredom","520":"could have been so much better","521":"there was no redeeming qualities to any of the characters in this story lets all really pray that 39 people stuck together anywhere in any situation have none of the non qualities of these people sure i finished the book because basically she started the book at the end and yes i was curious to see what the verdict would be but and a big but it is this book left me really curious as to why the author made everyone ugly in character or weak and pathetic oh well","522":" uggh this was a difficult book to read at times probably because the subject matter was rather disturbing it did make me wonder what i would do if i were in the lifeboat or even worse what if my kids were with me too how far would i go to stay alive would i compromise my values beliefs i also couldn't help but wonder how reactions conclusions would be different if the worldview of those on the boat were more faith driven definitely makes you think about humanity and just how far some are willing to go to survive","523":"i was disappointed by this book i thought it was going to be a fictional enactment of the ethical dilemmas facing a group fighting for survival while c r partially represented that she focused more on the legal rather than ethical implications of the actions of the main character although she had reason to cast the main character as a dispassionate and submissive woman i did not like her and had a harder time getting into the story because i did not connect to the characters overall i had hoped this book could lead to an interesting and passionate discussion in book club the general concept will do that but i don't think the book was well enough written to spark the intense emotion a story like this could have entailed","524":"do circumstances determine what's right and what's wrong there's the real 50 shades of grey makes you wonder how you would handle the same situation","525":"i was a little disappointed in the ending otherwise it was very good","526":"this was an interesting book very intriguing as you are in the lifeboat right away and finding about the people on the lifeboat they come from all walks of life and each have different views on what they should do there are too many people on the boat and they see other lifeboats once in a while but not often it's is told from the point of view of grace who has recently been married she is traveling with her husband when the boat starts sinking and he gets her on the lifeboat some of the women are very frail mentally and there are two who are definitely not and want things to go their way near the end grace seems out of it part of the time and other times seems like she knows what is going on the man in charge is a man who worked on the boat but people aren't sure they can trust him the end part of the book is about the trial of three women one being grace for their acts on the boat i really enjoyed it","527":"it could have been a great book but ended up just being so so","528":"this was a very good study of the human instinct to survive in a life threatening situation i thought the characters were complex and well written i think she also did a good job of letting the reader decide who the real villains were","529":"i liked the author's writing style it really pulled me in story is a bit dark but overall enjoyable","530":"i enjoyed it very much","531":"i could not put this boat down","532":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here 20 days in a lifeboat much of the book i'd give 3 stars but the event leading to the trial didn't ring true seemed contrived the attempt to give the book a kind of lord of the flies allegorical message failed for me","533":" it's 1914 the empress alexandria has sunk and grace is on trial for her part in the events that took place on an overcrowded lifeboat in the middle of the atlantic the story of what happened unfolds through a journal of grace's account that she is to provide her defense attorney with and as such isn't entirely reliable obviously grace wants to make herself look good and we get the definite impression that she knows more than she's willing to admit it's not that she's lying but she's definitely concealing things things like how did her husband secure her place on that lifeboat and what did hardie keep in that box and maybe even what happened to mary ann grace is manipulative we can see that through her story of how she met and eventually married her husband newlyweds at the time of the sinking so this book is unsettling actually i nearly put it down after reading the first couple of pages because it seemed too bleak and terrible human nature when it comes to survival can be ugly and all of that ugliness is aboard the lifeboat but i kept on and i'm glad i did because this book was fascinating i wish i had all of the answers i wish i knew just how much deception grace put into her journal but i'll be thinking about this book for a while precisely because i don't have all the answers or any of the answers actually","534":"very slow moving with poor character development actually the whole book was the ramblings of one of the characters with questionable reliability and motivation so it is really unclear about what happened on the lifeboat so much could have been done with the story line but was not","535":"a bit disappointed at the end many unanswered questions that i think could have added a little umph to the overall ending good though","536":"great premise and the first half was really well done the second half was a bit of a let down","537":"the book started off interesting and captured me fairly quickly at times it was hard to put down while the ending was somewhat disappointing the overall book was a good read i didn't exactly like the ending the last two chapters of the book didn't have the same feel to it and i was disappointed how the book ended especially the one characters fate it didn't work for me and it was one of those wait what why moments as for the rest of the book it was incredibly well written i wouldn't call it a engaging book but i definitely was captured by it i enjoyed the way the author chose to tell the story the narrator is somewhat unreliable but that is what i like about the book is that because she's such an unreliable character you're not sure how much of her story is the truth or is she lying to herself and the readers i loved the parts while they were on the lifeboat they were raw horrific and showed humanity at its best and worse this part of the book really makes you think how you'd react in the situation and i think the author wrote it wonderfully overall a surprisingly good read also found on my book review blog jules' book reviews the lifeboat","538":"i liked the premise a lot but i was disappointed by the writing and the story to me it was weak and became boring the ending was no better a let down","539":"i agree with the other reviews i read this book very quickly and got to the end and thought that's it the character has an interesting dynamic on the subject being an upper class widow in a boat full of middle class working people during that time frame we chose this book for book club and i do believe it will be a good discussion","540":" i'm not a big fan of boats i've only been on one cruise not counting annual booze cruises in aruba i have however read two unforgettable yarns set in lifeboats in the past few months the first one was unbroken which i read and liked earlier this year and now this one it is a remarkable achievement the story unfolds during a trans atlantic voyage a few days after those fateful shots were fired in sarajevo in 1914 henry and grace newlyweds are separated during the chaotic moments after their ship catches fire grace ends up in a lifeboat which is overcrowded and lacks sufficient supplies without knowing her husband's fate she is our unreliable trusted narrator and it is through her that we come to know the other passengers hardee one of the ship's crew takes charge until his initial assurances of a speedy rescue prove false and discontent spreads dissatisfaction drives disaster as fear and frustration morph into famine and dissolution eventually a couple of women stage a mutiny as dead and not yet dead bodies go overboard it would all seem predictable if grace wasn't such a compelling character we learn about her troubled past and her ephemeral dreams of happiness as she tries to stave off madness along with hunger and dehydration we know that she survives because we first meet her during her trial but it isn't clear until the end what her alleged crime was ms rogan employs a simple and robust prose style that is worthy of ernest hemingway she raises questions about moral ambiguity and the imperfection of memory i felt as if i was sitting next to grace whom i found captivating despite her lack of personal hygiene this sort of creeped me out view spoiler bring on the booze i wanted to shout hide spoiler","541":"this book bored me frustrated me rarely entertained and only occasionally challenged me the 3 stars are awarded only because some valid points about life and right and wrong were made and part 3 was almost enthralling but it was the longest 274 pages i think i've ever read","542":" i could not put this book down i was restless when getting my 22 month old daughter to sleep which can take up to two hours some nights i just wanted to get back to reading this book while some parts are pretty horrific i felt like some kind of voyeur while reading this book unable to pull my gaze away the characters were a motley crew with sinister undercurrents running rampant i also enjoyed how interpretation of the narrator's character is left in the hands of the reader is grace all she seems","543":" in the late 19th century a large number of shipwrecks led to tales of atrocities committed by those who survived many were put on trial under charges of murder and cannibalism charlotte rogan recalls these accounts and marries them with the early 20th century ocean liner disasters of the titanic and lusitania to create a harrowing exposition of human behavior in 1914 en route from britain to american an ocean liner capsizes after a mysterious on board explosion several life boats are filled and launched in one is grace winter the story's narrator grace a newlywed fears for the fate of her husband henry from whom she was separated in the chaos as the ship capsized she joins thirty eight other survivors in a lifeboat that is designed to hold half that number these passengers literally adrift become psychologically and morally so as the days pass and the odds of surviving dwindle we know from the opening prologue that grace is rescued and is now on trial for her life the story's tension therefore is not a matter of if but how and who rogan masterfully maintains this tension by revealing the story through grace's wobbly perspective the reader has an unshakeable sense that this young woman cultivates a naive and winsome appearance to disguise the cunning and narcissism she has honed to survive life's misfortunes but who are we to judge who knows which sides of ourselves we may be forced to call upon when our lives depend upon it and the author does not judge she creates a claustrophobic and haunting world set upon a merciless sea and lets fate and the survivors' shifting morals shape events she allows paranoia to seep into the cutty hinting at greater plots afoot but restricts the reader's vision to grace's self serving memories as compact as this story is it drags in the middle as if the author was seeking to stretch the narrative out to reach a full length novel minimum word count there is a limit to the dramatic impact of scenes of bailing water and huddling together for warmth but that is a faint complaint of an otherwise compelling and well crafted thriller","544":"great premise i was thoroughly engaged although i found the ending to be anti climactic super interesting heroine","545":"yuck i just didn't give a hoot for anyone in this book i was bored and i hate to say that","546":"although i enjoyed this book and couldn't wait until the end hoping i would find out the outcome sooner there were still a lot of unanswered questions which i suppose was intentional on the author's part yet still frustrating considering she spent so much of the book making the reader think certain details were essential to the story","547":" this was a surprisingly interesting and gripping book completely away from the kinds of stories i usually read which is good to do of course with echoes of the titanic disaster at its core the lifeboat is about a group of people who survive the sinking of a cruise liner in the ocean and end up aboard a small lifeboat that's way too small for all of them set in 1914 at the outbreak of war what follows is a kind of study of human desperation versus the reserved and well mannered social interactions of the time there is a lot of thinking time and not a huge amount of action but this does lead us through the main character's prosecution when they are rescued as she allegedly help murder some of the passengers to make room for people to live the writing is good and kept me interested but it was slightly removed and objective but i think this was the author's attempt at keeping it in the feeling of the period what i didn't like was the revelation that we knew almost everything that was coming from the beginning with the courtroom scenes think it would have been better to just start with the ship sinking personally otherwise a good book for those who like period dramas","548":"throughout the entire book i felt as if the author was trying to make significant points but they didn't quite work for me","549":"boring","550":"i loved the idea but not execution of this book i wish the author had spent more time developing the characters on the boat before final incident that lands the protagonist in jail i also felt there could have been more of an explanation as to the trial's results the verdict seemed to come in so quickly and lacked depth again the idea for this book was great i just wish there had been more action character development on the boat","551":"now i know why i don't like cruises returning to the united states on the empress alexandra passenger grace winter is one of the lifeboat's survivors in the summer of 1941 when her ship sinks good portrayal by charlotte rogan of what occurs when their lifeboat is in danger of sinking from too many people aboard who lives and who dies in such a situation the narrative deals with survival of the fittest and then their ultimate court trial once started the lifeboat was hard to put down","552":" charlotte rogan is clearly a talented writer tackling a difficult subject 39 people in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean not a very broad canvas to work with but she accomplishes it admirably the story is told from the point of view of grace winters a bride of two weeks on her way home from europe to the us with her husband henry on the luxury liner empress alexandra early in the story grace is shown as a strong and determined woman not willing to let her newly straitened circumstances dictate her fate she has deliberately set out to meet win and marry henry winters a wealthy banker though she has clearly come to genuinely love her new husband the reader nonetheless sees grace as a cool and calculating woman and these are the very characteristics that allow grace to survive the ordeal of the lifeboat the personalities of the other thirty nine survivors and the trial she is subjected to after rescue for me the book misses five stars because at times it bogged down under the weight of such a limited scope and i found the philosophizing and law debate of the trial hard to get through i couldn't help feeling this part of the story could have been told a bit more interestingly the ending seemed a bit abrupt as well in some ways nonetheless i can recommend this book to anyone who doesn't need sugary female characters and who can read the realistic accounts of the deprivations and trials of being in a lifeboat for three weeks it is a first novel we can hope that ms rogan will keep writing and that her next novel will show her growth and progression as an author","553":" i orginally picked up this book because it was on all those 'books to look out for 2012' lists i was also captivated by the synopsis as well after the empress alexandra sinks on its way to new york the story follows a group of survivors in a lifeboat and their survival not only from the sinking of the ship but also their survival within the lifeboat think life of pi meets the story of titanic what i loved most about this book was that it jumped straight in no introductions to characters or surroundings the sinking has happened and the reader is put directly in the boat with the survivors now you want to know who they are how they got there and will they all survive we find out early on that the protaginst grace winter survives and all the way through you want to know how they get rescued but the story turns into a 'lord of the flies' scenario a pull of powers between the various characters and a fight for heirachy within the boat read the rest of the review here http booksumustread tumblr com post","554":"this book was boring and repetitive","555":"in the summer of 1914 the empress alexandra sinks this elegant ocean liner suffers from a mysterious explosion and all the passengers scramble for safety henry winters managers to secure a place on a lifeboat for his new bride grace but when the people on the lifeboat soon realise they are over capacity the real struggle for survival begins the lifeboat is an elegant and thrilling novel with many complex issues weaved into it for any to live some must die but the hard choice of survival can be taken too far at what point does the struggle for survival turn into manslaughter and can you really live with your actions with personality clashes between characters like john hardie and mrs grant this book is just a stimulating and thought provoking read my first thought with this book was that this was just playing out a novel based on ecologist garrett hardin's metaphor for resource distribution hardin's metaphor describes a lifeboat bearing 50 people with room for ten more the lifeboat is in an ocean surrounded by a hundred swimmers the \"ethics\" of the situation stem from the dilemma of whether swimmers should be taken aboard the lifeboat but when i read this book there was more of a focus on the moral dilemma in regards to an overcrowded lifeboat this book is a highly emotional novel and while you do get some character development this mainly focuses on grace and her take on the situation at hand i must admit to hating mrs grant throughout the entire book she was bossy and always plotting against the others while john hardie seems to always try to do what was best for the people in the lifeboat and he seemed strong and determined it was interesting to see how the pressure got to him another aspect this book dealt with was the one of social class the sinking of the empress alexandra brought people from all different social backgrounds onto the lifeboat so it is interesting when they need to throw people off the lifeboat for survival how important class is to the people wanting to survive as if that would be have importance at a time like this i think charlotte rogan did a great job setting the novel in 1914 you have the sinking of the titanic not too long before in 1912 and the time and age is perfect to look at the issue of social class as well as morals the lifeboat is a stunning debut novel from charlotte rogan while it could use a bit more development with some of the characters this booked worked well with exploring the issues it set out to explore i think rogan has a worthy example of well crafted contemporary fiction with the dilemmas the characters face and the pace the novel keeps i really am impressed with the way this novel turned out and i hope charlotte rogan has an equally impressive sophomore novel this review originally appeared on my blog http literary exploration com 2013","556":"like a few other readers i really struggled to get through this short book i finally skimmed the last chapters because well life is too short i did not like any of the characters and even though the writing made me keep turning the pages in the end i really just didn't care","557":"this was a beach read for me and as such was fine i was left with questions at the end if you are looking for a fascinating read don't bother","558":"read the whole bbok in three days i guess that says something","559":" it is the summer of 1914 and europe is on the brink of war but grace winter's future finally seems secure as she and her new husband set sail for new york where she hopes to win over a disapproving and status conscious mother in law when a mysterious explosion sinks their ship grace is thrust into a lifeboat by a quick witted crew member who climbs in after her even though the boat is already filled beyond capacity i love situational crises in films and books the more claustrophobic and uncomfortable the better i find it fascinating how individual personalities respond to group trauma and how they answer the social and moral questions that are bound to be raised...how far would you go to survive...kill or be killed...women and children first this fabulous debut novel gave me all this plus an unreliable manipulative narrator or is she a fascinating plank of carneades dilemma to ponder and the affirmation that none of us are fully prepared to deal with violent or traumatic events as valerie martin said \"the lifeboat is a richly rewarding novel psychologically acute and morally complex it can and should be read on many levels but it is first and foremost a harrowing tale of survival \"","560":"started out good but just dragged on and on i think they were in the boat for 3 years kind of a strange ending too not a fan","561":"it's 1914 and a cross atlantic steamship goes down 39 people end up in a lifeboat together grace winter narrates her time in the lifeboat followed by her rescue 10 days later and then her following arrest the story is somewhat lacking in emotions considering there are people getting thrown overboard left right and center but i will bear in mind it is 1914 and grace is a recently married lady of high society however the book is wishy washy jumping from character to character and it is only the last quarter of the book that saves this book from becoming a sinking ship","562":" rating 3 875 of five the book report the book description says \"grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes \"my review this is charlotte rogan's first novel i do not expect it will excepting only her own lack of interest in pursuing a writing career be her last it has the voice and the control of a fourth or fifth novel one long chewed over and considered and drafted which then is utterly transformed by some magical alchemy of fresh insight rogan's forty person lifeboat is almost entirely filled when it hits the cold cold north atlantic in 1914 hardie a seaman of the doomed luxury liner the empress alexandra named for the equally doomed russian czarina who was herself to founder in a few short years has hustled himself and our narrator grace winter aboard at the last possible instant as the lifeboat was about to hit the sea the narrator we know from page one is creating the story we're reading for her lawyers those defending her from a murder charge leveled against her for in the course of a mutiny against the morally suspect hardie killing him by pitching him overboard what is it about this story then with its not new outlines that merits the busy overbooked reader's attention grace she is an unreliable narrator she is even aware of her unreliable perceptions and yet she is in this tale weaving a myth as subtle as any out of the greek sacred tradition grace doesn't ponder or study on anything grace floats above the sea whether the literal north atlantic or the metaphorical subconscious in a dangerously unreliable craft loaded with people who don't seem real to her don't seem like actual flesh and blood don't exist in full four dimensional spacetime for her grace is in shock probably grace is manipulative and selfish probably grace is a sociopath quite possibly but grace above all things is a survivor view spoiler by the end of the book she's not only been acquitted of the crime she actually committed but has found another husband although she ruminates detachedly that she doesn't seem to feel anything strong for him either like she didn't for her first husband hide spoiler so what is grace in the end victim or victor the cast of characters includes some stock people the bluff and hearty military man the iron willed older matron the brainless helpless girlie girl but also has some really interesting people too grace herself thank goodness also the anglican priest a useless and vapid nithing who is there it seems to make rogan's point that god will not be the help and succor of the lifeboaties still less their savior the able seaman the tough decision maker hardie is deliciously nasty admirably strong and likely as not guilty of taking the bribe grace's husband offered him to save her and himself which one senses he would've done no matter what as the lifeboat cast accuses him of he's up against it from the beginning with the passengers because he beats away survivors trying to get into their already over capacity boat everyone assumes that like the titanic a mere two years before the survivors of the empress alexandra will be rescued within hours therefore having a few extra people on board will be okay hardie no one's fool refuses on behalf of all of them to play dice with god he is proven right as the days stretch on but the initial brutality is what stays in the passengers's minds thus his doom is sealed the setting and the harshness of the crisis the characters face and the inevitable results of being trapped in an unforgiving situation all work together to make the book gripping it's tense and it's exciting and there is a cracking good helping of sea specific action and it's this point that allows rogan the full scope of her talent she gives grace the gift of a poet's eye in a thriller writer's head there is as there statutorily must be in sea rescue takes a storm grace thinks as the storm approaches that the water was bluish black and rolled past us like an unending herd of whales the lifeboat alternately rose high on their broad backs and slid down into the deep depressions between them above clouds hurtled through the sky before the wind i shivered and for the first time since the day of the shipwreck i felt profoundly afraid we were doomed there now if that doesn't make you want to invest five or six hours of your reading life in the book then nothing i can say will change your mind","563":"i liked this book in the beginning and the middle but then it just sort of ended i almost felt like the author got tired of writing it and just wanted to wrap it up i expected there to be some deep secrets revealed at the end but there really wasn't 3 stars since i enjoyed 3 4 of it","564":" this book initially reminded me of life of pi the more i read though the more i realized it was no life of pi life of pi gives a complete story and then gives a completely different story and it is up to you to decide which one you want to believe either way the story is complete the lifeboat is not complete i had a lot of unanswered questions and couldn't decide if i liked the main character or not it's good from standpoint that it makes you think but at same time i hate unanswered questions","565":"this book started strong it kept my attention the whole time although it flagged a little in the middle along with the group's energy however while i thought i might be able to read this on a metaphorical level it was too hard to keep track of all the characters and figure out what they were supposed to represent in the end while the details of the boat and ocean were interesting this didn't rise above other similar stories of survival the whole story seemed almost sedate particularly during what ought to be a brutal climactic scene this book does remind me a little of twelve angry men in the way loyalties shift that part seemed as though it could be compared to how corporations are often led not surprising given how often it is said that ceos are steering a ship none of the feminist and vaguely lesbian subtext interested me much frankly i wish i had liked this better than i did","566":"i have really enjoyed books by female writers such as tea obreht karen russel sara gruen marisha pessl jumpa lahiri now i can add charlotte rogan i loved the lifeboat amazing that she almost did not publish it engaging character in grace modern and at the same time a product of her early 20th century time","567":"quality writing but very dreary","568":"i thought the book was really well written with an interesting story line the presentation of the main character grace winter provoked me to really analyze her personality then on a wider scale think about how people interact with each other in general without even knowing it to achieve their status in life or even short term goals i guess that john steinbeck wrote a short story about people on a lifeboat and how they survived or didn't survive it alfred hitchcock made it into a movie but steinbeck didn't even want his name put in the credits","569":" goodreads description grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes this book had a fresh approach to a very tough story the question how do you survive at sea in an overfilled lifeboat after the ship you are on to start a new life in america with your new husband blows up the answers aren't pretty and could minimally land the newly widowed grace in jail for the rest of her life if she is lucky i truly enjoyed this story and the examination of the human psyche which to be quite honest was sometimes quite upsetting the book did start off slow but it soon began to take off the characterization the writer used to allow the reader to see the weak and the strong while under great stress is a testament to her brilliant writing ability and her ability to describe the baser elements of being a human however once the survivors were rescued i think the author erred in trying to end the book too neatly the entire time that the characters spent on the lifeboat was dark ugly and base and the ending was just to happy it didn't seem to match the mood of the rest of the novel i think the author should have taken a risk and wrote an ending more true to life which in my humble opinion is that no one could possibly understand what the lifeboat's survivors had gone through no one could understand the choices they had to make or the emotional and physical exhaustion that led to these decisions the inablity to understand what these women did i think would ultimately have led to a much harsher judgement by those who had not lived through the experience this book is quite a read and is quite short but the story held within it's 260 something pages is an insightful exploration of being human and what decisions humans can and will make under great duress facing life and death 4 stars","570":"i really did not enjoy this book the chapters in the lifeboat which are the majority of the book were very boring after awhile i really didn't care about any of the characters very disappointing","571":"one of the most interesting female protagonists i've read in a long time a real page turner which isn't easy given that so much of it takes place on a lifeboat hence the title masterful plotting","572":"lack of character development that's the first thought that comes to my mind after closing this book what drew me into the book were the descriptions of surviving and living on a lifeboat in the middle of the sea i was able to use my imagination and sense these what drew me away from enjoying it was any reason to bind myself to the main character or any of the other characters for that matter i never felt like i had to get back to the book to see what had happened or if they were going to survive there was only a sense of feeling that if i kept reading it might get better","573":"interesting would probably make a good book club selection","574":" this was a very interesting book in the summer of 1914 grace elopes with henry winter on the boat voyage back to america there is an explosion on their boat and henry sacrifices himself to secure a spot for grace on a lifeboat grace along with 38 others spends day after day adrift at sea waiting for rescue eventually there is a division among the lifeboat survivors and grace must choose a side her choice and her decisions will come back to haunt her as grace observed we were stripped of all decency i couldn't see that there was anything good or noble left once food and shelter were taken away this was a very well written book i really liked that the author had grace remembering her ordeal instead of telling the story in a strictly chronological way she also makes the reader think about how they might react in a similar situation and how in life and death situations often people's animal instincts come out and humanity is quickly forgotten i was even more impressed that this was the author's first novel definitely a book that makes you think","575":"what a strange book i cannot say i enjoyed reading it but i doubt i will forget it i would love to discuss it with someone else who has read it the main character grace totally eluded me very well done technically extremely dark","576":"the heroine is not very likable but the book brings up psychological and ethical dilemmas","577":"i was convinced i'd be giving this book at least 4 stars until i got to the part where grace talks about the trial i'm always hesitant to say anything bad about a book because i truly appreciate the blood sweat and tears most authors put into their work but reading about the trial was so boring it totally killed my enthusiasm love for the story and i even fell asleep twice while trying to get through it it's funny because you'd think reading about people stuck in the middle of a big boring ocean would be less interesting but it was definitely the best part i wish i could rate each section of the book separately because the trial was the only part i didn't like","578":" i liked the writing the style of the main character narrating the story was good i felt like i was reading her journal i didn't really think that the characters were developed as deeply as in some other books but that may have been because it was from one point of view i don't usually read survival stories but found this interesting it makes you wonder about what choices or decisions you might make if faced with some of the choices in the book i will be looking for more books by this author","579":"i'll give this book three and a half stars it brought up some interesting thinking points and questions while it was no life of pi it was still equally interesting life of pi took on the idea of story telling this was more the traditional aspects of what you expect for people being in a life boat and questions of who should could and was able to survive while it is difficult to fully understand what you yourself would do in this situation unless you were actually in a situation like it while i think the first two parts of the book while in lifeboat were actually interesting the book lost it's edge in the final part while on trial","580":"an entertaining read that does touch on the horrors of an unimaginable life and death situation but does not delve deeply enough to make it a fulfilling experience there are two parts that will haunt me for quite some time and a profound statement on our relationship with god and our creators that i will always treasure","581":"come aboard we're expecting you the looove boat well the love boat this aint and with no sign of tallulah bankhead or captain stubing in site you just know end well this will not newlywed grace winter shares her story of survival after the luxury boat she and her husband henry were sailing to america on sinks henry bribes a salty seaman ha ha i wrote seaman to put grace on an over crowded lifeboat this begins our journey across the river styx because seriously being stuck on a lifeboat for an indeterminable amount of time with a bunch of strangers that you can't get away from and drinks are not included in the price of admission is the exact definition of a cruise through hell from the start of the boat's launch we are faced with questions of morality and of self preservation grace and two other passengers go on trial for the murder of seaman john hardie shortly after their rescue hardie is the salty old dog that man hating hannah read lesbian she wears trousers to court people trousers and matronly mrs ursula grant sexuality also put under question but in a more subtle way whom also suffers from penis envy don't like much after so many days without food and water tensions and resentments reach boiling point and mrs grant and hannah decide hardie has to go a vote is taken among the remaining passengers and the two sea hags somehow enlist grace's help to throw hardie overboard so does this make grace hannah and mrs grant murderers if so wouldn't that make everyone who voted in agreement a murderer as well even though they did not physically participate isn't allowing a child to drown and drawing a lottery to see who gets thrown overboard not murder doesn't passively standing by to allow these events play out make one an accomplice to murder well does it i don't know as grace's story unfolds we see that she herself is a shifty character who is not worthy of our complete trust and her motives become more questionable further out to sea they drift even though the moral questions and just exactly who grace is are never answered rogan still gets all of the points for making hardie sound like the sea captain from the simpsons","582":"plot line drew me in 1914 39 people on a lifeboat that is slowly sinking rescue comes three weeks later some must die for others to survive however i found the character of the protagonist grace a bit thin too many questions remain which is a shame as rogan writes well","583":"potential huge but did not deliver as was boring unconvincing and shallow a waste of a good idea","584":"four 1 2 stars simply because of the very good character development a page turning book with depth and believable characters that really makes you question human nature","585":"who can judge morality and especially when there is a life or death situation involved human nature wants to self preserve and will do anything to live of course if one has the will to live here we have grace winter a newly wed traveling to see her in laws for the first time when something happens to the ship and it starts to sink she finds herself on a life boat with 38 other scared passengers and now they have to survive until the are rescued we find grace at the beginning of the book talking to her lawyers because she is on trail for the things that perspired on that lifeboat now after being at sea barely hanging on for life she must prove her innocence and truly be free from the lifeboat i congratulate charlotte rogan for penning her first book i wish this wasn't your first book because i would grab another book that you wrote that just means that i will have to wait for your next one if you are thinking of reading this book then yes by all means pick this up and be lost at sea","586":"not bad it did make me think about what i would do in an overcrowded lifeboat it might not be pretty","587":"wow this story grabs the reader immediately u0026amp never lets go it is food for thought on so many levels so much more than a survival story which it is it examines what humans will do to survive think a sophisticated lord of the flies and grace winter is a most enigmatic character loved it","588":"a lucid narrative about survival and ethics it is also a perplexing character study","589":" grace is a young woman newly married and on her way back to america with her husband on a luxurious ocean liner which sinks in the middle of the atlantic grace finds herself adrift on a small lifeboat with an assortment of other survivors it all starts off very civilised but when hunger thirst etc set in things get a bit desperate the novel is told in the first person so we experience it all through grace's eyes this really adds to the intensity of the situation but is grace a reliable narrator this book was a good read but didn't have the 'wow' factor for me i think maybe it was because i didn't really care at the end if grace survived or not","590":"about what i expected have read a few of these lifeboat books over the years this was interesting until about half way through nothing stands out about this book the writing was pretty good and the character development was great","591":"very engaging story i loved the writing style current time to bouncing back to the time on the boat read this while vacationing on lake mi and it was crazy to look up and think about a tiny boat adrift on a big body of water","592":" i guess i was expecting a mystery revealed about the events leading to the passengers occupying the lifeboat or more about the character of mr hardie or maybe even a surprising plot twist instead i think the novel's point was to show that the self serving maybe even frivolous character of grace winter turned out to be nature suited to survival she survives her family's economic and social downfall by capturing henry winter's heart she survives the shipwreck when henry buys her passage onto the lifeboat she survives the 21 days at sea in the lifeboat by skillfully appearing to form alliances and not forming them she survives the murder trial by seeming to be a confused indecisive accomplice and thereby being the only murderess acquitted of murder in the end grace concludes that life at that moment again seemed like a game to me a game i might even win mainly because i had been acquitted and i hadn't made any other irrevocable choices yet no doubt i soon would one couldn't inhabit the knife edge cusp of possibility for long without stepping off on one side or the other as my experiences in the life boat had unambiguously shown if i had not felt so sorry for him dr cole her psychiatrist i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know","593":"a riveting read but a little frustrating coming from such a shrewd and veiled narrator as much as the drama focused around the grim account of survival at sea the uncertainty of the account as the story unfolds is the bigger intrigue behind this novel i liked grace even if i didn't particularly trust her i enjoyed this book and think i'd like to reread it because i'm betting grace is like an optical illusion and i just may see another version of her in a completely different light","594":"i thought this was a really good read it brought up moral issues of survival class right and wrong along with the unraveling of a story and a trial good book for discussion","595":"this book seemed to be capitalizing on the titanic anniversary it just never seemed convincing in terms of its psychology the motivation behind the central conflict isn't sufficiently developed and it's hard to identify with the main character","596":"this is a riveting story of people on a lifeboat afer there ship sinks survival is the most important goal but the existential situation also demands attention a thought provoking page turner","597":"i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the lifeboat given it takes place in the middle of the ocean in one boat with only a few characters but the story is wonderful i love that it leaves you guessing about the main character's intentions and motives and throughout i found myself wondering who would i be on this boat","598":"received as a good reads giveaway i liked the book but i feel that so much more could have been done with it the great elements were there shipwrecked class tensions a courtroom but there was a lot of strings left loose and not in a way that left you thinking deep thoughts but that made you feel like the author got lazy the lead character grace is a complex character but more could have been written that would have coaxed more out of her and created even more depth also i would have liked more of the backstory of her and henry there were teasers slipped in that were never elaborated upon and i think this could have created some great context i liked the structure of the book which made you feel the way grace might have felt with her mind leaping around her memories and forgetting some things it's an alright read but if you want shipwrecks read life of pi if you want social constructs read to kill a mocking bird and if you want courtroom watch 12 angry men don't waste you time on this there was absolutely no suspense could be a good book club read as you could have a discussion about right and wrong within crisis situations","599":"this will make a better movie than a novel the novel was set in 1914 grace winter was a 22 year old woman whose wealthy family had hit on hard times for several years unfortunately for the reader the language in the novel was current and not convincing of its period despite the limitations of the book the author has talent","600":"i kept hoping the book would get better but it never did i was highly disappointed","601":"2 5 the first half was really good but it became tiresome toe towards the end it was an interesting story which kept me awake at night i have no desire to ever travel the ocean","602":" i would rate this book as 2 1 2 stars but the ratings don't allow that this book was well written about and i looked forward to it it's about a ship going to america from europe that sinks it takes place a couple of years after the titanic the survivors 39 of them are in a lifeboat for 21 days during that time the survivors deal with lack of food and water some dying of exposure some commit suicide some are killed to make room for the ones left the foundation of the story is about a survivor who is on trial after having been saved for her life it sounds like a good story but i was put off by the writing which i couldn't feel the horror of the situation never hit home and while i understood the situation i didn't feel distressed for the people all in all i was disappointed it was just ok","603":"good book for a discussion group as deals with many issues an easy read","604":"there are moments in the book that grab the reader's full attention however those moments are few and far between in addition it is very hard to connect with the main character grace her nature is not defined well and her penultimate act seems disconnected from what we know of her this was overall a disappointing read","605":"this book was somewhat engaging but the overreaching and overly vague writing style kept intruding i think the author was trying to achieve too much with her first novel not only attempting a period flavor the story occurs during world war i but also using an unreliable narrator who tries too often to describe the ineffable but just ends being frustratingly muddled","606":"very disappointed in this one interesting premise that absolutely did not feel like a fascinating psychological study re reading turn of the screw would be a much better use of time","607":" i just loved this book well told and the lead character is fascinating how much is manipulation and how much is genuine it is told from the first person perspective and the reader is not allowed to know much more than the character herself knows so well executed and extra kudos for the brilliantly captured voice the language is consistent with how you expect a 19th century genteel woman would express herself consistent and well thought out it is a compelling story with existentialist overtones a joy to read","608":" this book is well written and was emotionally draining to read being terrified of water i focused not on their plight but on the relationships that developed from the beginning i was interested in why grace was in prison and had to read thru to find out i was also interested in the rescue so i kept reading it seems that the depicted character flaws are inside all of us and can emerge under pressure and stress even within an office situation that seems to be drowning in confusion and miscommunication long ago a friend described our ability to survive thru turmoil as grace under fire how appropriate that the lead character in the lifeboat was named grace","609":"thirty nine people vie for survival on an overcrowded lifeboat told from the viewpoint of one young woman we watch as some give up and some find ways to fight fate off this quick read is a first novel from an author who shows much promise","610":" i had high hopes for this novel especially after meeting and liking the author the story was good but filled with way too many characters and too much detail to be believable the psychological play was glossed over by the main character's cloying narration i slogged through because i hoped for a shocking twist in the end but there was none i did keep thinking of my favorite survival on a lifeboat novel the life of pi while i was reading this so perhaps i unfairly compared the two which truly are apples and oranges while i found martel's prose entrancing and lyrical in the life of pi rogan's voice through the character of grace would have benefitted from more editing all that said i wouldn't not recommend this book in fact i passed it along to my mother after i finished it stories about survival have a way of showing human nature in its more raw and ugly senses think lord of the flies and people who are interested in that will still soak up this book in a short time","611":"http www catsandabook blogspot com","612":" charlotte rogan's the lifeboat is a survival story but the focus is on the psychological drama of being stranded with too many other survivors in too small a boat how will the characters respond to the reality of their situation grace winter the protagonist and narrator is a young newlywed who relates the events of the sinking of the empress alexandra in 1914 in the atlantic ocean grace appears to be a reliable narrator attempting to wade through memory and recollection to arrive at the truth of why the ship sank why her husband was able to get her on the lifeboat and why she survived when others did not the text on each page is dense and while reading i kept thinking about plato's allegory of the cave what is real and what is shadow is grace telling the truth or merely the shadow of what she believes is true while this may sound dry and dull i was intrigued by the story telling and structure of the plot the reader knows grace survives because at the opening of the book she is in prison awaiting trial for events that took place in the lifeboat her lawyer asks her to write a diary which of course is the text of the book the strength of the story comes as more of grace's personality is revealed as she endures the hardships of survival it's clear she played one role in life what's not clear is if she is playing another role in order to survive on the lifeboat and in court grace's possible dual nature is slowly revealed when she states admirable traits are often exactly the same as negative ones only expressed in a different way' 66 it seems clear that grace is willing to interpret in her diary her actions in a positive light anything in order to survive another glimpse into grace's mind comes when she wonders if all a person could hope for was illusion and luck and she concludes that the world was fundamentally and appallingly dangerous 71 if that is the case how will the adversity of survival affect her and can we the readers believe her recounting of the events my only disappointment is in the ending which leaves many unanswered questions but grace would have laughed out loud at my desire to pin everything down at my naivete at my childish desire to know if you enjoy psychological drama with an almost claustrophobic feel the lifeboat is for you if you are looking for high sea adventure skip it","613":"this book began well and at first held my attention some of the descriptions of the conditions on the boat and survival at sea were well written but the more i read the less developed i found the characters to the point that i wanted the book to end i lost interest in who lived or died and felt the ending to be rushed","614":"an interesting look at a life or death situation i started reading and did not put it down until it ended it really pulls you in and you want to keep reading more","615":"quick read that i couldn't put down even though i didn't necessarily like the characters and felt like some questions were left unanswered","616":"touching survival story","617":" 3 5 stars this was an interesting psychological thriller about the choices a group of people made while stranded on a lifeboat desperation and power struggles lead to inhumane actions but ones that most of us would understand and accept under the conditions the characters were living the narrator tries to paint herself as a passive character but it is slowly revealed that she is far more crafty than originally believed it ends without really giving definitive answers about key questions but otherwise this was a great read recommended especially for those who enjoy books like lord of the flies","618":" the plot was interesting but grace the main character was not she just thinks and thinks and thinks and thinks and thinks enough already she's a bystander who does nothing unless told to do so there's an implication that she's stronger than everyone else because she observes and doesn't feel she doesn't think she's subject to anyone's influence and therefore can switch sides whenever it benefits her everyone else is a little weaker and goes at least a little crazy but grace gets over the trauma and loss even before her psychiatrist she's got a super human psyche and she's prettier than everyone else then because she has no substance we have to hope that her looks save her bleh i wanted to know what happened when she met her mother in law and how she was with her sister and mother upon her return and i really didn't care for the marriage mentioned at the end of the book that seemed thrown in there to reinforce the fact that she's above everyone and beautiful who cares luckily the plot kept me interested enough to save this book from receiving one star","619":"read this one quickly and it kept me up past 2am two nights in a row excellent job portraying a complex character through narration and observation i was left questioning her self knowledge i e how calculating vs how innocent which is always fun for 5 stars i would have enjoyed a stronger female protagonist again calculating or innocent but this is more of a personal preference than comment on the quality of writing recommended","620":"was a super easy read and started out very well kept expecting some kind of mystery or discovery and it just ended kind of a blah second half","621":"i wanted to like this book more than i did which isn't to say i didn't like it at all i just found all of the people stranded in the lifeboat to be pretty awful human beings and it was hard to root for anyone's survival which might have been the point entirely","622":"this was a good read it slowed a bit at the end but generally an engaging story","623":"this would be a good book for a book club it draws you in immediately and keeps your attention the narrator is very unreliable so you are always guessing at what the truth is and even once the book is finished you can't help but wonder if there isn't more to the story than what was told","624":"picked this book up on a whim at the library very fast and entertaining read i had a few issues with some of the plot lines some questions left unanswered but basically a good summer book one question who the hell is william","625":"couldn't even finish this one and i hate not being able to finish a book just didn't capture my attention","626":"it took me a long time to read this because i never felt engaged with any characters it's a good idea though","627":"hard to follow sometimes didn't know when the location was the boat or the courtroom narrator was good but i think i might have missed some of the excellent language by listening rather than reading","628":"ocean liner sinks people in a lifeboat clinging to survival i found the storytelling oddly detached and without emphasis in the flow of things it holds no surprises and leaves me with the impression of a very conventional story about people fighting for survival","629":"an interesting but ultimately unsatisfying novel about a group of victims of a shipwreck some fine writing but both the plot and the characters were very weak","630":"very engaging but the end fell flat for me","631":"the lifeboat by charlotte rogan is a fascinating and exciting book the book is about a shipwreck in 1914 the book is set on one lifeboat after a shipwreck the boat is made up of all different personalities few characters have ever met before before they find themselves on this lifeboat they all come from different economic and personal backgrounds and need to figure out a way to work together during the book the author outlines the struggles joys and suffering the castaways go through the book shows what can happen to the human race when we become desperate and what some people will do to others to save themselves one great talent charlotte rogan possesses is her use of metaphors throughout the book for example when describing a castaway she stated \"hannah's face was a terrible sight bloodless except for the crimson gash where the knife had sliced into it the colorless eyes the black snakes of her hair 191 \" the word snake has a scary and dangerous connotation to many people and imagining her hair as \"black snakes \" makes the reader grasp not only how disheveled and dirty hannah is but what a dangerous and horrifying situation the castaways are in another great talent of rogan's work is to make the reader feel like they are experiencing the tension in the tiny lifeboat she uses dialogue different perspectives and different types of characters to portray the events that unfold on the lifeboat at the start of the book the castaways are rowing away from all of the wreckage and while they are rowing away from the shipwreck they pass many dead bodies throughout all of the wreckage the castaways spot a little boy who is being clutched in his dead mother's arms \"a little more this way and we can get to the child ' but mr hardie replied \"fine and which one of you wants to switch places with him 12 \" by making it a child that the castaways decide to leave stranded gives the reader an even better appreciation of what a dangerous situation they were all in children are a symbol of innocence and vulnerability and if the castaways had any opportunity to help someone it would have been a child children are also so lightweight that it makes the reader able to grasp how low and overcrowed the boat was adults aren't viewed as helpless as children and they heavier so the character choice in that particular situation was extremely powerful to the reader rogan also uses characters' thoughts to portray different ideas after two sisters perish on the lifeboat the main character grace thinks to herself \"of course we're going to die the sisters are the lucky ones for them it is over 152 \" by having grace keep this thought to herself makes the situation seem even more grim in some ways because there is no other opinion to contradict her own if grace had shown her despair in front of her fellow castaways there would have been people on the boat who would have tried to reassure grace and convince her that her thoughts weren't true she might have believed them and changed her mind i would recommend the lifeboat to anyone who loves books about shipwrecks or survival stories the one challenge of this book was there at least 30 different castaways who each played a different role in the lifeboat's success having so many personalities was hard to keep track of and i would sometimes forget which character was which i would suggest to readers to make a character map to help keep track of all of the characters another small critique i have is the beginning is slow however once the reader gets past the first 50 pages or so the rest is a page turner overall this book was very good and i would rate it 3 5 stars","632":"i found this book to be very disturbing mostly because i couldn't decide whether the main character was a sociopath or really together kind of leaning to the first","633":"this book had all of the earmarks of a psychological thriller but it turned out to be a psychological snoozer i was more than ready for the life boat to sink taking all of the dreary characters to the bottom of the ocean but it did not it sailed on and on and on and on i didn't finish the book","634":"this story was set in the time of about one year after the titanic sank a cruise liner sinks in the middle of the ocean and people are cast out onto lifeboats the story follows one particular girl grace in one of the lifeboats it's a story of survival at sea for 3 weeks and the horrid things that happen to people i could imagine myself in the boat as i was reading the story and wondered how i would have coped when unimaginable choices are made in order to survive it was a story of facing ones own mortality and fear and faith it's not a feel good story but i enjoyed it and would recommend it","635":"a great read about survivors of a shipwreck","636":"the premise was promising a group of people trapped on a lifeboat having been moved from a sinking large ship will they be saved how will they behave with each other a cross section of individuals not knowing each other learning how to help each other however i found the flow of the story monotonous and kind of got sea sick so to speak would not really recommend","637":"it had interesting moments i didn't feel the want to keep picking up the book","638":"the story of grace and her fellow passengers in a life boat was suspenseful enough for me to read it in one sitting the writing is excellent 22 year old grace is a great unreliable narrator and the woes of the miserable survivors are realistically described oh so that's the correct peeing on a lifeboat etiquette it's a good book i just didn't enjoy reading it that much for some reason","639":"i was so so so excited about this ans maybe i souped it up too much because i'm a little disappointed i suppose it was well written though it droned on and on and on and on sometimes i expected it to be more lord of the flies than it was oh well 2 5 5 stars","640":" here's the funny thing i wasn't that much interested in reading this book i like audiobooks because i'm always on the road but my car stereo is pretty much fried i've been struggling to find a way to use overdrive for weeks because my ipod has more miles on it than my car i finally figured out how to gain access on my android last week and started sifting through to get a book and try it out i chose the lifeboat as less odious then the other available choices i was riveted i was even glad when i had to spend several hours stuffing envelopes at work because i could get more of this story through my bluetooth one theme i haven't seen anyone discuss is the clash of feminine and masculine deities that i thought ran through the story how do they help or hurt us how do we appease them which shall we worship can we fool them i think the line that some reviewers have drawn between grace winter and becky sharp is telling i rather liked becky and i rather like grace if she smothered mary ann with her wadded up snood fine if she snared the lawyer more fool him meanwhile i don't know whether to be glad or sorry about mrs grant and hannah did they deserve their sentence were they more evil and manipulative as grace or were they punished for not being as pretty and heterosexual","641":"this is a book that i think i will be thinking about for a long time a good book for reflection makes one think about what they would do or how they would react in a similar situation thankfully most of us won't find ourselves is such a situation overall i felt the story was well done","642":"starts out great but loses steam around day 14 unreliable narrator makes it difficult to figure out what actually happened some parts are questionable as a result","643":"three and a half stars interesting premise a 22 year old woman married 10 weeks and widowed 6 weeks is being tried for murder after surviving 3 weeks adrift at sea in an overloaded lifeboat well written but it lacked mystery and suspense and in the end i just didn't care for the protagonist grace","644":"very deep and thoughtful book there were so many layers i just wish i understood more of the layers humanity strength human spirit charlotte rogan touched on all","645":"it was a good read rather different i'd say","646":"as a debut novel very impressive would love to read her next work","647":"wow a riveting book although with a group of shipwreck survivors stranded on a lifeboat and simultaneously starving to death losing their minds and turning on each other it's no surprise that the resulting novel very well written too is hard to put down granted a tad disturbing honestly but still i can't wait until they make it into a movie except honestly i think anne hathaway is poorly cast","648":"not as good as i thought it was going to be like being in the lifeboat it was sometimes harrowing sometimes confusing and sometimes tedious i felt a distance from all of the characters perhaps because the situation was completely divorced from the period context and yet the manners language and attitudes were of course those of 1914 the ending seemed weak as well","649":" murder on the high seasthe blurb reviews that rogan's editors chose to include on the covers front u0026amp back depicted the lifeboat as a taut psychological thriller a harrowing tale of survival occurring simultaneously on a multitude of levels well to be fair it was a story about survival u0026amp it was exceptionally well written rogan creates for the most part fully fleshed out characters who respond to the pressures of being lost at sea in a lifeboat filled to capacity in those typical ways one might expect in fact if one just spreads the characters out on a tableau with little identity tags beneath each of the characters we quickly see they correspond to the archetypal personalities that just might populate a boat adrift u0026amp lost there's the ship's mate mysterious u0026amp tense that the passengers survivors from a destroyed ocean liner must depend upon for their very survival there's the screaming hysterical woman so terrorized she can't control herself add to the mix your intellectually effete males pompous overbearing former military types smattering of other recognizable tv personalities along with the stoic matronly older matriarch u0026amp already one can imagine the type of dynamics that might play out and of course there is the protagonist who propels the story forward she is the one we rely upon to learn what has happened u0026amp what will happen we know from the outset that some on the boat survive because in the prologue's first three pages we learn that our heroine or is she is on trial for her life based on what may have occurred during this vessel's tenuous days at sea so rogan definitely does not want the reader to dwell on whether or not the boat makes it back to shore - that is never in question what is clearly in question is what transpires on this voyage that makes it a taut thriller if making it a taut thriller is what rogan intended and to that point i must reply that i don't know if that is what she meant to convey rather i think rogan's real focus was on the very nature of survival how is it that different individuals respond to catastrophic events when stress is beyond the breaking point what personality traits emerge are they the essence of the person's true character or something else then within these group environments who u0026amp what personality types rise to the occasion to seek power yield influence for those who don't how do they respond do they scamper to the periphery hiding in the shadows or do they willingly succumb to the powerful influence of the charismatic leader regardless of the legitimacy to that claim that is what i believe rogan's novel was really about - a treatise on the salient characteristics of survival - a noble u0026amp worthy topic to explore however that is not what the publisher's advertised u0026amp to that extent i felt let down from a story more an autopsy that a morally complex whodunit","650":"different kind of book for me but i enjoyed it not much conversation at all in the entire book but the dialog was quite engaging i would recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction or just a good book","651":" my motivation to continue reading this was that so many glowing reviews promised greater satisfaction to come alas that was not my experience for me suspense or a plot's arc is not created by adding at crucial points namely the end of chapters but worse was yet to come nor should symbolism or psychological analysis necessitate parsing all is spelled out by the conclusion accompanied by a twisty and ambiguously happy ending on a brighter note i appreciated the author's attempt to render a complex woman in all her manifestations some venal some worthy of moral outrage to place readers in an environment where individuals' actions are understandable if not ethical had to challenge the author a first book like this will undoubtedly mean rogan's devotees will expect more","652":"i'm on a roll with sinking ships and the tales they weave","653":"even though this is a short book it took me a little while to read it i liked the idea of the book but i really wish there was more physical description in it i would read it again if i were to discuss it in a book club the web has some good discussion questions and i could think of additional questions would be a good discussion book but the writing isn't that expert","654":"i put this in the food for thought category throughout our schooling i imagine each of us has encountered the lifeboat scenario at least once the author brings that scenario to a novel written in the style of a journal the journal is the viewpoint of grace who was a fortunate soul to escape a sinking ship in the early 1900s the author portrays several conflicts men vs women wealth vs labor and most especially the conflict between several forms of natural law i though she did a good job of portraying a hobbesian scenario but was surprised when hobbes actually popped up later in the book perhaps she felt she needed to include it as an a ha moment not good but not bad worth a looksee at least","655":"interesting story it really grabbed me in the begining but lost me at the end","656":"loved the writing found the story itself disturbing but read on anyway so much philosophical and ethical content that i felt it would be an excellent required reading text for a undergraduate philosophy class","657":"an interesting concept i never quite knew how sincere grace was through the whole book lots of moral questions would be a perfect book club book","658":" two years after the titanic another ocean liner sinks leaving our narrator grace and 38 other people left adrift in a lifeboat grace is telling her story after her rescue and in response to her lawyer's request that she write a diary about her travails to help in her defense at her murder trial no spoiler here this is revealed at the very beginning the writing is quite good and i read the book in two sittings it would get a better star rating if the story hadn't faltered so much in the last third the writing continued to be strong but the author got bogged down in her own storyline set ups and wasn't thoroughly successful in bringing everything together anyway what i really really loved about this book was how fascinating grace was and how challenging and intriguing it was to try to discern what was true about what she related and what was self serving under the circumstances rogan did a great job at just being vague enough at times to keep her reader guessing about grace loved the first two thirds disappointed in the last third and in balance it's a better book to think about afterwards than it was to read if that makes any sense","659":" i was disappointed with this novel it had such promise due to its interesting premise but i thought the execution fell short of the mark the pace was too slow it lacked a real sense of urgency and terror and it seemed a bit repetitive at times the characters weren't very well developed aside from grace and even she could have been better portrayed having said all that it does provide food for thought though in terms of human nature and survival of the fittest so it wasn't completely without merit i was just hoping for more","660":"read my full review of this book on my blog summer reading project at the lifeboat by charlotte rogan","661":"a strange story","662":"not much action it was hard to get through the end","663":"1914 39 people on lifeboat after cruise ship sinks","664":"i enjoyed the book and couldn't imagine how i would have survived such an ordeal well written surprising that they tried three of the survivors for the murder of one of the other people on the boat felt the pain cold hunger and anguish of those on the boat the story stayed with me for a few days after","665":"definitely a page turner though the last 60 pages or so are something of a let down still i loved the idea survival on a lifeboat shortly after an ocean liner catastrophe then told via flashbacks and how the protagonists survives one calamity later to find herself on trial for her actions","666":"an explosion at sea forces 39 people into a lifeboat which is too small for that many people during their days at sea people's personalities emerge grace winter newly married is the central character in this fascinating book we are left with the question is she an opportunist or an innocent victim","667":"really loved the writing u0026amp extremely suspenseful pages whizzed by but i'd like to hear from other readers about the ending u0026amp what they ultimately took away from this book it felt like it was building to a massive metaphor but i didn't quite get that payoff of course i may have missed it","668":"depressing and generally pretty dull","669":"wow wasn't expecting to find thomas hobbes life on the lifeboat was a war of all against all where life was solitary poor nasty brutish and short except for those with the strength and cleverness to take power","670":" the central character of the book is cool as a cucumber she also left me cold not that this wasn't an interesting read even gripping but i felt removed from the characters perhaps because it was grace who was narrating her own story of survival and her view was often intentionally opaque was she guilty in her role of dumping the crewman hardie out of the lifeboat certainly she was set up to do so in a way and yet i wished at times i could have seen the events related and grace through other eyes sometimes a first person narration is just too narrow for my taste i want the more rounded storytelling of omniscient narration","671":"this was such a good read it involves a rather raw look at humanity when all of society's restraints are taken away at times it was a bit disturbing but it worked to increase my fascination with the decisions that those in lifeboat were making the writing was beautiful and i couldn't help but read some sections aloud to myself this is a solid debut by the author and i'll definitely be looking for her next book","672":"started out well had some good substance in most chapters but just sort of fizzled out at the end it was unsatisfying","673":" the lifeboat tells the story of grace winter a survivor on a lifeboat the first chapter begins with day one of life on the lifeboat slowly the author reveals more details of the ship's sinking 2 years after the titanic the shift from present time to exposition of grace's past kept the story moving so that the reader wants to know what happened to the ship and how and when they might get rescued the lifeboat holds 39 passengers some of whom have very strong personalities and become leaders the author does a good job of developing some of the minor characters as well i was a bit disappointed in the ending as the author wraps up the story rather quickly after spending so much time on the lifeboat survival","674":"more like 3 1 2 stars some great moments early details fantastic","675":"when her ocean liner sinks in the atlantic newly wed grace winter finds herself adrift in an overcrowded lifeboat grace is a survivor not only in the lifeboat but as we learn in life before and after her ordeal if you meet this woman and have something she wants be very very careful","676":"i was suprised by this book the concept of the book didn't sound like something i'd like but it was so well written it grabs you and makes you unable to put it down i read this in one day it makes you question what you would do in these situations and what that says about us","677":"great book loved her style of writing","678":"i chose to read this book because i saw it on a best books list of 2012 it was by turns very exciting and by others repetitive which i think captured the monotony of being stuck on a lifeboat for weeks it is hard to imagine what a person would do in an overloaded lifeboat once the passengers start turning on each other if you like tidy endings this isn't really a good book choice the characters and their motivations are not deeply drawn other than the instinct to survive at all costs","679":"grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die while this was nowhere near as good as hitchcock's movie it has some great moments","680":"no wonder this book is causing a stir first of all i wasn't sure i liked the chief protagonist 22 year old grace winter at least to start with but after a while it didn't seem to matter 39 people adrift on a lifeboat for three weeks is going provide its own form of tension and drama the point of the book is the moral ambiguity that runs through it there are many questions to which i don't know the answer would i have acted as this or that character did the writing is beautiful and the plot convincing even though there is no easy to resolution at the end highly recommended for book groups","681":"i couldn't put it down made me think a lot about group psychology and what people will do under life threatening circumstances","682":"a terrifying premise with a narrative that whips along though i did feel it lost its edge towards the end a cracking debut novel and will keep an eye out for future novels","683":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the premise of this novel is pretty interesting and what originally made this book a must read now novel for me a newlywed is separated from her husband on a sinking ship in 1914 and placed on a lifeboat which remains adrift at sea for many days in the days following the shipwreck the castaways must make life or death decisions to ensure their survival in light of all of the news about titanic lately with its 100th anniversary it's easy to wonder what if the carpathia didn't arrive as qui the premise of this novel is pretty interesting and what originally made this book a must read now novel for me a newlywed is separated from

of this novel covers the story from grace's placement on the boat through about 10 days at sea just after the crux of the story happens the remainder of the book is about the trial afterwards not a spoiler as this is revealed in the prologue of the novel and grace's role in the murder the diary portion of the novel moves fairly quickly while the remainder of the story is somewhat muddled and slow to move along the rescue of the lifeboat again not a spoiler as you find out that grace survives as soon as you begin the book is told in disjointed fashion sprinkled throughout the rest of the book i think my main issue with this book is that there is a million and one loose ends i know that in life there are many ends that are never neatly tied up but if you are writing a novel to tell a story then one should finish that story spoilers now ok my beef what was all of henry's secret whisperings about while they were on board was the chest of gold on that other lifeboat were other lifeboats people rescued it says they were but never goes into much detail about it why were the women being prosecuted when the one seaman made people jump off his boat and he apparently survived from the news article why did grace save the said article and make a big stink about that guy surviving if they never went anywhere with that thread henry dies but we're never told how she finds out and if she tries to find out if he made it onto a lifeboat or not did he bribe the officers to let her on what was in the case did she ever meet with her mother in law and did she receive the telegram what did the telegram actually say why was he reluctant to send it if her mother in law did not receive a telegram what did she want to speak with grace about ugh i feel that this novel had a great chance to be amazing had the story been more flushed out i found it hard to attach myself to grace and henry's love story without being given much to go on outside of a few snippets of their romance here and there i wish more time was spent with them on the ship before it sank so we got an idea of their love and why henry was so in love with grace enough to elope with her and chance the wrath of his family then the loose ends if even some of them were tied up i think i'd have been more settled with this book rather than the ambiguous ending we were given she supposes she'll marry but she doesn't know where she'll go and so forth if she's marrying it's doubtful that at that time she would be able to go wherever she wanted etc ugh again more","684":"what would you do on an over crowded lifeboat in order to save your life","685":"very well written and interesting unpredictable","686":"the ship you are traveling on sinks you are fortunate enough to have a space on one of the lifeboats but it is over crowded people are desperate hard choices are made people die rescue comes after twenty one agonizing days and when you are finally on dry land you and two other women are on trial for murder that is the book told as dispassionately as the author wrote it i have read other books with the lifeboat premise and they were pretty good what happened to this one i do not know but i would have been better yo skip this one","687":" musical chairs lifeboat lottery too many people on board so who goes examines the willingness to murder under duress the peculiar ethical dilemmas the survivors face and the consequences of their difficult choices the anti hero grace winter is a chilling individual taking actions making choices to rise from poverty to become rich and independent matter not the cost on the overcrowded lifeboat she manipulates situations to prevent herself from being one of those chosen to thrown overboard later she is put on trial for this and the verdict is the conclusion of the novel the description of the sea in the book is compelling the atmosphere desolate a first novel i thought this quite fine","688":" a maze in gracesometimes i wonder whether i should not spend more time reading contemporary novels instead of sticking to the classics in most cases even to the point of rereading books for the umpteenth time but in most cases i come back from my rare forays into the often rather crappy fields where modern literature dwells with the hungry feeling of having wasted my time on sloppy syntax and limited vocabulary or on a contrived semblance of depth achieved by an extremely reader unfriendly style which is meant to disguise the triviality of the author's thoughts charlotte rogan's novel the lifeboat was to me an exception to this rule of disappointment and had it not been for my watching the half forgotten movie abandon ship starring tyrone power i would never have come across this novel in the first place some of my friends recommended julian barnes's novel a sense of an ending to me as an example of how unreliable the human mind is and of how memories tend to change according to the psyche's needs this may all be very true but nevertheless the incidents described in that novel seemed so boring and irrelevant to me that the lesson was not worth the taking it was alfred hitchcock who said that he would not want any of his films to be a piece of daily life because why should people go into the cinema to watch a piece of daily life if they can have daily life for free and that instead a film should be a piece of cake - and he was absolutely right reading about how people mow their lawns or make a sandwich and eat it is not any more gratifying than mowing one's own lawn and eating one's own sandwiches reading charlotte rogan's novel is way better than eating sandwiches and this would be very high praise for quite a lot of contemporary novels whereas it hardly does justice to the lifeboat where we have not only an interesting gripping conflict but also an underlying idea or to be more precise a whole lot of them which takes the reader's attention well beyond the events that are given apart from that the narrative voice is unusual and intriguing and the style goes well with the tale the first person narrator grace winter as well as two other women faces a charge of murder after being rescued from the shipwreck of the liner \"empress alexandra\" in 1912 during several weeks on a lifeboat which carried far too many passengers tensions had run high view spoiler and grace has participated in throwing overboard the seaman mr hardie who had been in charge of the lifeboat hide spoiler grace's lawyers ask her to write a journal of the events in the lifeboat and it is this journal which makes the bulk of the novel telling us from grace's point of view how alliances were formed among the passengers and how the threat of being among those who would have to sacrifice themselves for the survival of the others caused them to take the desperate remedy resulting in the murder charge i will not go further into plot details here in order not to spoil the reading experience which is very exciting in itself even if not all the loose ends of the story are tied up to the satisfaction of the friend of the straight story line the numerous ambiguities though - e g why does the seaman hardie seem to avoid the lifeboat that is under the command of a crew member named blake how did grace get her place in the lifeboat what was in that little package that hardie concealed from the others whatever happened to mr hoffmann - are never really explained but this is in line with the effect produced by grace as an extremely unreliable narrator and it also enhances the haunting power of the tale inviting us to come to our own conclusions about the characters and their motives it is also admirable how many different discussions this relatively short novel can spark off the unreliable narrator muses on memory and how it might conveniently fail a person in situations that one might think quite important to remember the lifeboat situation is of course not very far from utilitarian questions such as the lifeboat dilemma - which is the subject of the film i mentioned above - and the thought experiment known as \"the plank of carneades\" and there are also references to thomas hobbes and his pessimistic outlook on man and the laws of society are the tenets of civilization and what we regard as human behaviour just a thin veneer that is bound to flake off in a case of existential distress and leave man as hardly any better than a brute nevertheless rogan does not limit her attention to these philosophical and ethical questions but she also broaches the subject of gender roles are mrs grant and hannah west the two other women who face a charge of murder a threat to society because they did not conform to the general concepts of how a woman had to behave in those days then there is also the shy and reticent mrs forester who will later give some insight into the martyrdom of her married life all these questions will arise in the course of reading the lifeboat which is why this book will probably be an excellent choice for a reading circle or for a teacher who wants to provide older students with some food for thought some people argue that it would have been better if rogan had chosen different narrators instead of confining the perspective to that of grace but i do not agree with this criticism at all because all the ambiguities add to the richness of the tale grace is a calculating and opportunistic woman always seeking the eye of those people who are in power in a certain situation and trying to establish some common bond between herself and them she wormed herself into her future husband's confidence and she will do so with regard to several people on the lifeboat feeling nothing but contempt for some of the women's weakness she still uses a semblance of weakness and \"femaleness\" to achieve her own aims to survive and to prosper she has no scruples about suggesting to one of the women that she throw herself into the sea and she is definitely not as innocent as she makes herself out to be yet can we fully and justly blame her for behaving the way she does and above all is her account of the events trustworthy or just a bunch of lies in order to answer some of these questions to myself i immediately started to reread certain passages of her narration after finishing the book and this is probably one of the best compliments one can make about a novel - that after you have finished it it will not necessarily have finished with you as to me i will certainly not have finished with charlotte rogan yet and i am looking forward to her next novel hoping that it will prove as haunting as fascinating and as disturbing an adventure in thought as the lifeboat","689":"i read this because i found it on one of those lists you know 10 books that one you start reading think not be able to put down or something like that i could have put it down it was okay i suppose but the main character seemed vapid but conniving a combination that i particularly dislike","690":" a quick engaging read though by the end i had somewhat luke warm feelings for 39 people are trapped on a lifeboat once their titantic like ocean liner goes down in the middle of the atlantic left to die on the lifeboat for almost 2 weeks survival instincts kick in and morality goes out the window however i felt like the last few sections were sort of a snooze i liked the chapters on the boat so much better and after awhile it was just too many musings of the protagonist who got a bit annoying by the end but overall a short and faced pace read","691":"most of the reviews i read mentioned the ending was weak i have to agree the premise of the book was intriguing and it raised some interesting questions made me think about the struggle to survive while trying to remain morally upright but the end was weak and blah this was the ms rogan's first novel not a bad first effort i expect she will get stronger in her plot themes with her next book","692":"really wanted to give it three and a half stars very interesting story well written but seemed to have left a some loose ends","693":"feel like this could have been a great book but it wasn't at the beginning there was so much detail_~ too much at times but then the story just ends with very little detail","694":"http readhammysmind blogspot com 20","695":"a beautifully written book about memory and recollection and how we like to put our own actions in the best possible light which might not always ever match other narratives","696":"well written with an interesting plot and style of writing good story with fine narration","697":" in the first few pages you meet grace and her attorney and learn that after several days on a lifeboat she is now on trial for her life the story is written from grace's point of view it is her retelling her story for her attorney it is 1914 two years after the titanic sunk and the empress alexandra is sailing from england to america when an explosion causes it to sink grace is one of the fortunate ones who finds space on a lifeboat but as the days on the overloaded lifeboat continue supplies run out weather presents challenges and tempers flare a power struggle emerges and vastly differing opinions exist about what is necessary to survive grace's narrative is influenced by hindsight and offers insight into grace's life before the ill fated empress alexandra voyage the lifeboat is a compelling story of difficult decisions and survival but i wanted some deeper revelations","698":" this was an interesting book about a ship that was lost and the lifeboats that escaped the author examined the human nature and what issues pervaded while the characters were stuck in the lifeboat for 21 days it was interesting that there was a trial for some of the occupants that threw someone overboard i never really understood why mrs grant and hannah felt they needed to overthrow the crew man they didn't always agree on everything but that is bound to happen with 39 people in a small lifeboat interesting read","699":"the thing that preoccupied me that night was the notion that a person's choices are only rarely between good and evil i saw very clearly that people were mostly faced with much murkier options and that there were no clear signposts marking the better path to take","700":"should have been awesome i didn't feel connected to nor invested in the characters i felt like the narrator was an idiot to be honest i was side tracked by 3 other books and just couldn't be bothered to finish it","701":"meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh thing 1 pretty much everything you need to know about this book is in the title there's a lifeboat yup ok thing 2 because of the novel starting where it does it's disorientating it is not exactly clear what time period it is i actually thought it was the present just because there weren't any ye olde past cues in the first chapter specifically until it talks about the threats of war in europe and the lusitania obviously once the boat to lifeboat thing happens it's clear but that first chapter is way out in the weeds thing 3 i don't even really understand the point of the trial which you know about from the first chapter so that's not a spoiler because there were several deaths that could've been held against the survivors why that one specifically thing 4 i didn't buy grace's self reflection i didn't care about her relationship with henry i just didn't with anything in this book","702":"i really had a difficult time deciding between rating this 3 or 4 stars this was a bit of a strained read for me i have a devastating fear of boats and dark water eeeeeeep i found i was always questioning grace's moral character what exactly were her decisions and which we're influenced even by the end i wasn't sure where to stand on it while i enjoyed much of the philosophical discussions i found it also hard to deal with the role feminism seemed to want to play throughout i think perhaps there was a message there that didn't quite make it or perhaps my own fears combined with grace's constant state of disorientation served to cause my own confusion","703":" this book completely possessed me as someone who has always been fascinated by the titanic story i loved the premise but what really stunned me about this book was the main character and my ambivalence toward her in spite of the truly hideous circumstances she was in i'm certain one of the author's intentions was to toy with readers' feelings about the character and i find myself thinking about her and this book months later wanting to go back and figure her out it's a quick read and well worth it","704":"didin't hold my attention it's not you it's me","705":"not my cup of tea","706":" read for my january 2014 book group this book was a very quick read main character grace winter finds herself in lifeboat 14 as a shipwreck survivor the story is told from grace's point of view as she is preparing to stand trial for murder so the reader immediately realizes that grace survived her ordeal in the lifeboat the story unfolds with grace alternating between the day to day experience of the lifeboat and then her being in jail awaiting trial grace is not always the most likeable character and the reader is not always sure she is being truthful as grace reports on the lifeboat experience and parts of her life before the lifeboat the reader has to wonder that the truth lies somewhere in between the lines the story was fast paced and compelling as a reader you wanted to find out what would happen next for the survivors it was not so much a guide for the physical aspects of survival as an introspection on the mental processes of survival among a group of people with their own agendas and motives recommended","707":"a great portrait of a self serving coincided heroine who gets away with even murder","708":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here spoilers is it me i wanted more i felt like there was more to the story and there were too many unanswered questions i feel like i have created a subplot in my head was grace a murderer not of mr hardie we know how that went down but did she kill marianne or did marianne simply succumb like so many others it was interesting to me that the last conversation grace had with marianne was marianne threatening to reveal not only grace's participation in mr hardie's death but also henry's p spoilers is it me i wanted more i felt like there was more to the story and there were too many unanswered questions i feel like i have created a subplot in my head was grace a murderer not of mr hardie we know how that went down but did she kill marianne or did marianne simply succumb like so many others it was interesting to me that the last conversation grace had with marianne was marianne threatening to reveal not only grace's participation in mr hardie's death but also henry's possible bribery to secure grace a place on the lifeboat i also wanted answers as to why the ship sank what was in the box and what henry was up to while on board the ship it was a well told beautifully written book but i felt there was more going on and i wished the author would have shared more with us readers more","709":" this was a piece of stale toast when i wanted a hot fudge sundae ugh it was the equivalent of those tedious weird pretentious movies where all they do is sit around u0026amp talk u0026amp the plot goes nowhere blah blah blah this was tragically boring considering this is about a shipwreck u0026amp survival i was expecting so much more one of the worst things a book can be for me is boring just plain boring i would rather loathe a book than be outright disinterested in it i was all for the premise but the execution left much to be desired the story did not have any emotion the writing lacked passion the pov was flat u0026amp i was ready to jump from this sinking ship u0026amp move onto something else","710":"i had hoped for better it was a little disjointed at the end","711":"wow couldn't put it down very thought provoking","712":"77 pages into this book i gave up on it i had high hopes for it and i see so did quite a few other readers because of the plot outline the narrative and prose of the author her debut novel is good but i found the first person grace very heavy going and that the story bogs down for far too long before any real action about the incident takes place in the courtroom","713":"interesting account of survival at sea","714":"i like this book a lot very compelling","715":" set in 1914 at the beginning of the first world war after the sinking of the empress alexandra a group of 39 people are left adrift in a lifeboat built to hold far less in the middle of the atlantic ocean for 21 days this tale is told retrospectively from the point of view of grace winter a 22 year old newlywed who manages to find a place on a lifeboat but the lifeboat she's found herself on is overloaded and in danger of sinking there isn't enough food and water for everyone on board soon some of the passengers are discussing volunteers to go overboard some may need to die if the rest are to survive the lifeboat is the debut novel of author charlotte rogan it is a compelling gripping and extremely thought provoking tale this novel tells the story of survival at its most basic level it explores human nature and morality it shows what happens to people while they are fighting to stay alive the novel is a psychological thriller really the book is very well written i really loved the author's writing style i was completely engrossed in this novel from the very first page the way in which charlotte rogan describes the moral decisions the characters have to make is quiet chilling with everyone weak from hunger in despair over their situation on the lifeboat fearing they won't be rescued and they'll die out there all the characters find their behaviour beliefs and morals being tested to the limit it's extremely terrifying you can't help but finding yourself wondering would i do the same in that situation grace was an unreliable narrator which i thought added to the story by making it all the more shocking even by the end of the novel i wasn't sure what to make of grace was she as innocent as she appeared to be or was she frighteningly manipulative in parts of the novel grace seems to be surprisingly honest in revealing her negative thoughts and feelings about the other passengers in the lifeboat along with her worries about her husband's survival you are left wondering if what grace is telling you is the whole truth deliberate lies or the effects that shock starvation and exhaustion are having on her mind she's a very complicated character i'm sure we all hope we'd behave better if we were in a similar situation but this novel poses some interesting moral questions if you're own survival was at stake how far would you go to ensure you were the last one left standing i can't wait to read more from this author four stars","716":"for a completely random book selection this one was surprising the plot was creative and the story held the reader's interest i was curious to find out how things would play out even when clues to the eventual conclusion were dropped throughout the book","717":"quick read interesting story and had a message that wasn't hard to fathom nor was it a beat you over the head kind of message liked this book","718":"the book came highly recommended to me but i just didn't get wrapped up in it i plowed through thinking something must happen to make this book so good but whatever it was i didn't discover it","719":"was not what i had expected but it was an ok read had to read it for book club the writing was just ok and i did not care for the main character","720":"not a read that had me rushing to open the book at night well written but it's a long read with long stretches that were fairly uninteresting","721":"this was a really hypnotic book about a bunch of people stuck in a lifeboat after their boat sinks set in 1914 and what happens on the lifeboat over the next few weeks as circumstances become more dire basically it's a morality tale that really makes you think about what you would do in the same situation the writing was just hypnotic and i don't know why i describe it that way but that is how it seemed to me it was just very much in the time period and very much in the situation of being on the lifeboat and just being impossibly stuck and desperate in the end i don't think i would have done what the narrator did but who am i to say it's easy to say from the comfort of your living room and not in such a desperate situation and that is the point of the book to make you think","722":" this is an excellent debut novel by charlotte rogan especially as she taught herself to write staying at home to bring up her triplets you could tell she had childhood experiences involving her family of sailors which obviously provided inspiration there is always something compelling about survival and this book is a fastinating portrait of the many characters she invented for her lifeboat it is an easy read and a bit of a page turner as you negotiate the dynamics of the personalities on board i love the era in which it is set 1914 and i was quite enthralled by the fear and claustrophibia of what it would be like to live for many weeks on a lifeboat full of strangers you could really imagine being there but i was usnsure of what my actions would be in a similiar position how far would be go to survive would we have acted differently it is dark at times and her observation of the characters on board is honest and insiteful as she sets about understanding and conveying the different personalities and what a puzzle that can be i highly reccommend it","723":"3 1 2 stars this book was a fast read and i liked the storyline however i was disappointed there were so many loose ends at the end of this book","724":"will complete review after book club meeting","725":"great concept but for some reason i just wanted this to end plodding draining but maybe that was the point","726":" when we are babies ... we need an authoritative figure to guide and take care of us we ask no questions about that authority and imagine that the small circumference of our family life is the limit of the universe and that what we see before us is what exists everywhere and also that it is all as it should be as we mature our horizon expands and we begin to question this continues until we either throw over our creators - our parents - for good and take their place as the creative force in our own lives or find replacements for them because the terror and responsibility are too great people go one way or the other and this accounts for all of the great personal and political divides throughout history sometimes a book falls into your lap at the right moment i believe firmly in the magic of books and the transformative power of good writing which is why i read as much as i do and write about what i read but i also believe the line between a good book and an amazing book can be defined by what is going on in your own life at the time you are reading said book i am writing this review in the midst of an ocean going adventure - i'm on a cruise around cape horn - and i could think of no place more appropriate to read a book about a shipwreck and the subsequent horrors for survivors in a lifeboat than now much better than the non fiction anthology disasters at sea which i read when i was on a cruise in 2007 but anyway i know that part of why the lifeboat resonated with me in the way it did is because i am on this cruise because i have been pushing myself outside my comfort zone on this cruise and yes going on adventures on this cruise the main character in rogan's superb work grace winter is also on an adventure ... of a different sort mind you but an adventure still reading the tribulations of grace as she tries to survive 21 days in a lifeboat after her ship catches fire and sinks is obviously not akin to my own experiences but since the book is more about the psychological power of survival versus the physical then in that way it is grace is newly married and she and her husband are traveling aboard the empress alexandra when a fire breaks out and the passengers are forced to take to the lifeboats grace finds herself in a boat with 38 other survivors including one of the ship's crew members and thus the adventure truly starts the 39 survivors try to stay alive and cope with their situation in fascinating and complex psychological ways there is the harried crew member who takes a tyrannical and dictatorial stance since he has the oceangoing experience and he knows what he is doing and there is the small contingent of anti crew member survivors led by one of the ship's 1st class female passengers who plot and scheme to remove the crew member from his position of power grace finds herself caught in the middle she is grateful to the crew member for saving her life but as her own psyche weakens in the struggle to survive she starts to question what is right and wrong she starts to question the existence of god and she starts to question her role in the developing hierarchy of the lifeboat it is a fascinating psychological read to say the least first there is the question of how grace came to be in the lifeboat in the first place in the trauma of the fire she doesn't remember herself but one of her fellow survivors with whom she bonds in a rather unconventional way claims through most of the book that grace's late husband \"bought her place in the lifeboat\" with family jewels then there is the question of grace's relationship with her fellow survivors as she herself admits she is captivated in a way with the crew member because she attributes her survival to his skill as a leader but she is also intrigued by the anti crew member faction and comes to believe as they do that the officer is the reason they have not been rescued ... that he is hoarding food and water ... and if they are to survive then he must go and then there is the character of grace herself a survivor no doubt who married her husband because he saved her from an ultimate fate of life as a governess ... but whom she loves nonetheless and she is one who can face the harsh realities of the situation in front of her as the book develops the question of who survives and who dies comes up again and again and grace faces the reality with a deliberate and methodical certainty for some to live some must die she accepts it and understands it but ultimately the part that remains with me even to this moment is that grace viewed her 21 days in the lifeboat as an adventure and after she is rescued which believe me is not a spoiler alert since the book opens with grace walking to an unidentified courthouse with her lawyers for her trial the charge shall remain unnamed since that is a spoiler alert but trust me - you know from page 1 that grace is rescued her life can start fresh it can start anew will she have that chance is also a spoiler alert which i will not reveal but i personally responded to this idea life is a series of adventures - when one adventures ends a new one can begin thank you charlotte rogan for crafting your novel around that idea since i have been thinking a lot about my own personal adventures as of late i am probably slightly biased in writing this review but i do believe that rogan crafted a superb novel i love how the work was formatted - you learn right from the get go that grace survived the lifeboat so the question is not if but how ... and rogan returns enough to the \"present day\" i e after the rescue to make you wonder why on earth after surviving 21 days in a lifeboat grace is on trial beautifully beautifully crafted what could easily become disjointed plot points flow together like water and that takes a very skilled writer indeed regardless of the perception of the reader but i thank you again charlotte rogan your book has led me on a quest a quest to find the adventure in everything i do thank you thank you for opening that world to me","727":"somewhere between 2 3 stars i'll give it 3 because the writing was good great premise but failed to deliver absolutely not one character to root for way too much introspection and at times just plain boring which is hard to believe considering the circumstances","728":"i didn't enjoy this read as much as i'd hoped i had a hard time connecting or caring about the characters normally death drowning murder should excite some type of emotional response but i just felt indifferent i think that perhaps it would make a better movie than book after reading other reviews on here i'm going to watch the hitchcock film and see how the two compare","729":"really different quick but satisfyingly deep","730":" this novel is set in a lifeboat foundering somewhere in the atlantic a few years after the sinking of the titanic grace winter the narrator of the tale begins the novel in jail for murder along with two other women also from her lifeboat at the beginning grace seems a very easy character to know - a young woman in nyc who needed to marry money managed to do so on the opposite side of the ocean who was then thrown into the chaos of her boat's sinking and the ensuing death of her new husband she seems innocent and afraid suddenly however power and politics in the lifeboat begin to shift and grace seeing the shifting of the tide assists in choking the life out of the only ship's officer on the boat his body is thrown over the side and the women's \"ringleader\" begins to order the lifeboat i felt adrift myself unable to grasp onto who or what grace was and when the novel ended she had been acquitted of the officer's murder while her companions were found guilty and she is contemplating marriage to her attorney the book felt as fluid and liquid as its subject to me and i couldn't ever quite manage to hold on to the characters","731":"the lifeboat by charlotte rogan - this writer's first novel was a national bestseller about survival at sea set shortly after the titanic disaster this book concerns a group of survivors who spend long days and nights in a lifeboat i consider grace the lead character who narrates the story scarlett o'hara in a boat i had to admire her cleverness and pragmatism while at the same time not liking her very much i liked the way the author took us into grace's mind as she dealt with her ordeal and the other characters in the book this will be the may selection for the chinn park chats book club april 22 2013...","732":"fairly gripping and engaging read shame that the darker elements hinted at were not explored further but i definitely enjoyed","733":"couldn't put the book down had me from the very beginning overall enjoyed reading it couldn't wait to unravel the story but lots of loose ends intentionally leaving the reader to decide the ambiguity works but is made more difficult to deal with afterwards since the main character is so unsympathetic so you are left with numerous theories about the unresolved questions worth a read","734":"boring","735":"this is a well crafted survival tale that does not attain the level of genuine literary fiction rogan is a competent writer who does a number of things fairly well such as a classic conflict driven pyramid plot readable prose a somewhat distinctive central character the infinitely adaptable grace winter questions of law and morality questions about the reliability of the narrative process a study in group dynamics a study in leadership styles an atmosphere of dread and a feminist re imagining of the survivor's tale but the novel doesn't really mean anything does it","736":"taking it back to the library just can't get into it too many other good books to read","737":"ever wonder what you would do if you were stranded in a lifeboat read this and you'll never be the same superb writing a definite recommended read","738":" i deliberated between giving this book three or four stars and though i marked it as three it's really somewhere in between the plot and characters were nicely developed but what made this book different from most was that the author used them to deeply explore human nature and the way morals tend to dissolve in life or death situations it seemed to accurately portray the way some people tend to sit back throw up their hands and give up while others rise to the situation the power struggles present in the life boat were also interesting my biggest complaint was that i did not connect with the main character quite as strongly as i would have liked and there was not as much emotion as there could have been however overall i liked this book and i would recommend it to those looking for a well written and thought provoking book","739":" this book was an odd read but it fascinated me so i kept with it until the end it is about a group of survivors in a lifeboat following an accident similar to the titanic same time period there are approximately 40 people in the lifeboat and many of them survive for approximately 3 weeks the book follows their trials as they try to survive the ocean and its conditions as well as the lack of food and water there is a lot of tension among the survivors as they decide who is going to lead them i just found it interesting how they all related to one another but i really didn't feel connected to any of them i didn't even like the main character by the end it was definitely not writing at its best but the subject matter was intriguing","740":"i liked the first half of the story the second half seemed rushed and pasted together all in all a bit dissapointing","741":"i too like many others had high hopes for this book while the premise was good the plot was just a little flat i think there were so many good ideas that rogan threw into the story but did not expand did grace's husband pay for her passage into the lifeboat did hardie and blake steal what was in the casks what did hardie put in his pocket rogan left too many loose ends and really didn't explain enough not bad for a debut though i am not sure i will read another one of hers","742":"i don't know if i read anything revolutionary but i couldn't put it down also i'm never taking a cruise","743":"hmmm this book was ok but i wouldn't describe it as unputdownable if it had been any longer i'm not sure i'd have got to the end it was a good story but didn't grab me as it were nothing more to say really","744":"i thought i was going to like this book but never got into it i kept waiting for something else to be revealed and felt like i did not get the whole story","745":"i couldn't really connect with the characters in this book none of them seemed fully formed and didn't react to the horrific situations the way one would expect there was a coldness in the writing that didn't seem to match the story","746":"i can't put this book down loving it","747":"good read but she should have thrown in some cannibalism bit anticlimactic at end","748":" grace winter and her new husband henry are traveling across the atlantic to new york on the empress alexandra when a mysterious explosion sinks the ship grace manages to obtain a spot on a lifeboat but her husband was not and she presumes he is dead the story begins though with ' the mind can work to suppress traumatic experiences and i suppose that is true but sometimes i think the failure to remember is not so much a pathological tendency as a natural consequence of necessity 'grace winter and her new husband henry are traveling across the atlantic to new york on the empress alexandra when a mysterious explosion sinks the ship grace manages to obtain a spot on a lifeboat but her husband was not and she presumes he is dead the story begins though with grace no longer in the lifeboat saved after 21 days at sea but currently on trial for murder being stranded in the middle of the atlantic is a horrifying enough though but the lifeboat's extreme focus on the suffering and the change in mentality that the individuals undergo truly make you wonder if earning a spot on that lifeboat was actually a blessing we learn the details of what occurred on the lifeboat from grace directly as she's been instructed to do by her lawyer in an attempt to find someway of exonerating her grace is a deceptively simple woman that is actually far more manipulative than i think anyone gave her credit for her sense of self preservation is strong and when rehashing the sequence of events which took place on the lifeboat she always finds a way to reinterpret her actions so as to always come out 'right' as you learn more of her story you'll begin to start questioning her actions and realize how unreliable a narrator she has been the entire time was bluish black and rolled past us like an unending herd of whales the lifeboat alternately rose high on their broad backs and slid down into the deep depressions between them above clouds hurtled through the sky before the wind... i shivered and for the first time since the day of the shipwreck i felt profoundly afraid we were doomed the traumatic situation these individuals found themselves in was only made worse as time progressed and the rapid reduction of food and water quantities only succeeded in speeding up the hysteria fear begins warping mentalities and speculations arise creating more danger inside the boat than the sea itself this story of survival is fascinating and appalling but put in a similar situation who knows what lengths you would go to in order to ensure your own survival","749":" wow this book was amazing at first it took me a bit to get into the book because it felt disjointed and a bit scattered however i realized about 70 pages in this was rogan's exact intention the book was focused on the 2 weeks in a lifeboat from a shipwreck right at the start of world war 1 the narrator of the book was one woman who was standing trial for murder the story was heavy and depressing at times because rogan captured the sheer terror and hopelessness at endless days in a tiny lifeboat adrift in the sea the beauty of her writing was that she showed the worst and the best of human nature i found myself really considering my own actions what would i do who would i be in a desperate situation i hope and pray i would not be as calculating and selfish as some of these characters were","750":"fictional story loosely based on sinking of a luxury ocean liner like the titanic in 1914 i e too many people not enough lifeboats rich people pushed poor people out of the boats etc in which a shallow rich young bride grace is put on trial along with 2 other women for the murder of a sailor in the lifeboat in which she survived among 39 others in a boat made for 32 people for 21 days not only did i not find grace very likable she was by turns flaky shallow and manipulative i found the idea that 30 people including a small child could survive that long in open water with minimal food and water pretty unrealistic i would think the child would have starved and everyone else would be severely sunburned have blistered hands from rowing and infected feet from ~3 weeks of being submerged in a few inches of water in the bottom of the boat despite constant bailing there always seemed to be a bit of water in the boat still the author does raise a few interesting moral conundrums such how much responsibility does the average person on the street have to try to save another person's life when doing so could jeopardize their own is it ok to not row over to save someone in the water nearby because picking up another person would capsize the boat so that everyone would die is it self defense to push away someone who is trying to climb into the boat for the same reason","751":"this is an interesting perspective on life and survival shows the darker side of human nature","752":" the plot sounds very intriguing and i really enjoyed the first few chapters but as i progressed through the novel i became bored especially by the narrator's grace's view points which with their lack of emotion and calculation bordered on the psychotic grace is consoled by having married a rich banker which seems to be her main achievement by the end of the novel i rather hoped grace would be condemned for murder having pushed overboard another member of the lifeboat but of course she had a brilliant lawyer who got her off and the outcome psychotic beauty marries immoral lawyer too bad as she swanned off into the sunset in a new silk dress and how boring","753":" {this review originally appeared on clear eyes full shelves }charlotte rogan's much hyped debut the lifeboat is one of my biggest reading disappointments of the year and i feel like a complete jackass for saying that rogan has a wonderful story of writing for years and years before the lifeboat was published and in a publishing climate where precocious twenty somethings are getting all sorts of attention it's wonderful to see someone's dream of being a published novelist become a reality after years of work on her craft however with its singular focus on big questions about morality i was left wanting more of everything plot character development tension grace is a newlywed when in 1914 the ship she's traveling on from england to the u s with her new husband suffers from an unexplained explosion sinking the ship grace ends up on a lifeboat there weren't enough to go around--think the titanic perhaps thanks to some wheeling and dealing on the part of her husband henry as the 39 survivors on the over capacity lifeboat are adrift at sea as the events on the lifeboat unfolds while simultaneously the story flashes back to grace and henry's courtship and sudden marriage herein lies my problem with the lifeboat it's trying to do a lot--too much for a 278 page novel we've got the mystery of the ship's explosion and the exploration of human nature and the back story with grace and henry and how they came to meet and marry and henry's family and the creepiness around the seaman hardie the most interesting character by far who takes command of lifeboat 14 yet with all that promise we're bogged down in details of the toilet habits of the passengers and grace's rumination on humanity instead of an exploration of the sheer terror of floating in the ocean alone at sea uncertain if rescue will ever arrive even the horrifying moments and there are some truly disturbing moments throughout felt flat through grace's eyes as she ruminates about how this makes grace feel how this changes grace's view on humanity and what this makes grace think about seriously i would not have been surprised if grace had started speaking of herself in the third person ala lebron james i had been allowed to believe in man's innate goodness for the twenty two years of my life and i had hoped to carry the belief with me to my grave i wanted to think that all people could have what they wanted that there was no inherent conflict between competing interests and that if tragedies had to happen they were not something mere human beings could control i suspect view spoiler that rogan may written the story this way because she intended for readers to believe grace is a sociopath selfish and opportunistic and wholly unaffected by normal human emotion but she just read as flat hide spoiler if this had been effective in its execution my opinion on the novel would likely be quite different as i headed toward the end of the lifeboat i found myself just wanting grace to fall overboard because she's just so vapid sadly since the story's framed in the context of grace telling her story as she's on trial for murder i knew from the beginning that she survives her ordeal at sea without that keeping me going this was very nearly a did not finish for me the only thing that kept me reading was that i'm a sucker for a mystery and i was extremely curious about the circumstances under which grace wound up on the lifeboat and a number of the other twists in the story except... by the final pages there are still many many ends left untied this isn't a case of leaving it up to the reader to decide for themselves what happens but there are key plot points from the beginning particularly regarding grace's husband's family that are completely dropped leaving the story confused and unfinished there's a part of me that wonders if perhaps the publication of the lifeboat was rushed to coincide with the re release of titanic this spring because there are some points at which the novel could have really benefited from some content editing to wrap up those important questions i'm guessing that the lifeboat will be extremely popular with book clubs not mine--we avoid serious literature and i think there are people we will adore this novel if you enjoy books about morality and ethics that ask big questions as book clubs often enjoy as these types of books generate good discussion the lifeboat may be more appealing for you rogan is a very good writer even if her writing style isn't my favorite--it's more what you usually read in books classified as \"women's fiction \" a term that bothers me on a number of levels and i particularly enjoyed her depiction of the details of sailing and the maritime details i prefer my survival stories to include at least one character whose survival i actually find myself rooting for and a decent dose of drama and tension since that's one of the reasons survival stories are some compelling when well executed unfortunately the lifeboat had next to none of that ultimately the storytelling in this novel just wasn't there for me perhaps it will be for you fnl character rating mara that drunk girl from east dillon who hits on vince and gets passed around like a ragdoll in an internet video and resists tami's wise intervention it is extremely distressing that movies that were popular when i was in high school are being re released as \"classics \" screw that","754":"did not read heard not so good","755":"it was a pretty good book but i was just kind of disappointed in the ending there was a lot of build up to the end and then it was over","756":" the year is 1914 grace and her newly married husband henry boarded the empress alexandra they were heading from the atlantic to america things were going well until the cruise liner starting sinking like another famous cruise ship the titanic henry saves grace and ensures that she gets a seat in a life boat this is just the beginning of the rest of grace's life some of grace's boat mates include john hardie one of empress alexandra's ship mates and mrs grant a bossy woman as each passing day goes by some people will die who will be left grace survives but what she has to experience afterwards she may wish she had died in the ocean i was entralled by this book grace was such a good narrator i fell for her as a person this is very important in a story like this where there is not a lot of action and the whole time the characters are stuck in a boat in the middle of the ocean the story has to be character driven which it was i actually did not care so much about grace and henry's story and how they met so much as i did the current story where grace was trying to survive in the life boat it was like i was sitting next to her in the boat charlotte rogan did a good job with her first book i will be keeping an eye on her check out the lifeboat before it sails off the book shelves","757":"at first we like grace but then her reportage seems too neat and self favouring when doubts take root in our mind we have to think harder about all that we read we want to know how the story ends despite grace's unreliability however the book leaves us with loose ends a sense of injustice and a distaste for grace the slippery fish","758":"interesting read definitely like life of pi better for a lost at sea book main character was strong or was she","759":"meh i like the hitchcock movie based on the steinbeck story better this one left me wanting more back story and character development but it was okay","760":"painful read with few moments of excitement i couldnt really connect with the characters there seemed to be many underlying plot lines which were never developed","761":"3 1 2 starshalfway through this novel i was trying to decide if i was going to rate it 4 or 5 stars however i was practically seething when i finished it... i was left with so many unanswered questions here is an excerpt from an interview with the author explaining why this was intentional mild spoiler to follow view spoiler gr the reader begins to notice clues that grace winter may be an unreliable narrator how did you decide what to reveal and with so many moral questions at play how did you avoid passing judgment on your characters cr i am interested in your phrasing of the question--you zero in exactly on the relationship between passing judgment and revelation i think that if i had revealed everything that grace did and didn't do i would almost necessarily have come across as judgmental the fact that we don't really know what she did or why is part of what allows us to engage so fully with her and her story what to reveal what to hint at and what to explicitly state is a careful balance for a writer too many unresolved mysteries can be frustrating for the reader but books that spend the final pages tying up all the loose ends always seem anticlimactic to me this can leave a final impression of dissociation rather than engagement completely undoing the imaginative connection that was made in everything that went before i tend to dislike pages of exposition and explanation at the beginning and end of the books my bias was against doing that in the lifeboat this also gets at something of my process as a writer both the characters and the story develop organically for me it is only through writing the story that i come to know my characters and often i am surprised by what they decide to do i remember being so excited when i first thought to myself oh my goodness grace isn't telling the truth this was closely followed by the thought well who does and it is that line--between the usual sort of prevarication and a more extreme sort of lying--that i find so fascinating i was thoroughly enjoying this right up to part iii day 14 after finishing part iv my rating fell to 3 1 2 it's a shame that a novel with such a promising beginning should have completely lost its way at the end hide spoiler it is of course the author's right to write so nebulously it is my right not to like it note i can wholeheartedly recommended 'the lifeboat' to book clubs there were layers and layers to this story and it promoted quite a lot of discussion for good or for bad everyone in my book club thought it was an excellent choice here is a link if you would like to read the entire interview with the author https www goodreads com interviews read with sbc september 2014","762":"it was a very interesting story but very emotional to read as well","763":"wow a story of survival it was not the typical survival stories where the main characters can hunt for food and shelter the individuals in the lifeboat by charlotte rogan find themselves prisoners of the sea after teetering to get a firm foot on the lifeboat thirty nine people find they have nothing in common but the desire to escape the sinking ship and stay alive the occupants soon learn that the boat is filled over capacity grace winter a newlywed is the last person that was shoved aboard by her husband henry grace was placed into the lifeboat just before it was lowered the occupants must learn to adjust to the unending rocking while dealing with the daily and nightly bodily needs of eating sleeping and relieving themselves these things must be addressed along with constantly bailing the sea water that splashes into the boat the cruise ship they were on had experienced mysterious explosions and began to list was a distress signal sent before the cruise ship sunk was a passenger responsible for the explosion the narrative is told through grace winter as she deals with the unpredictable elements and diverse personalities this was a dynamic description of 21 days afloat the unknowing sea and weather is not the only suspense in this book the book is a page turner","764":"i just started this novel and so fsr i can't put it down it really delves into the desire to survive when faced with a catastrotic event also how quickly we engage in self preservation when neccesary i am really looking forward to the last page","765":"a great story about survival in a lifeboat after a disaster at sea and the impact on the human spirit as time goes by and the situation becomes desperate underlying is the story of the main character and what compels her to feel and act the way she does an excellent metaphor for life under desperate conditions hard to put down once you've started","766":"hmmm in a life death situation do humans always revert to their worst traits it seems that way and this book is no exception too many people in a life boat too many egos women vs men strong willed vs passive a murder trail for those that tossed someone overboard and the thoughts and contemplations of the main characters views on women in early 20th century america","767":"helpful insight from a womans point of view how to survive a castrophe","768":" the premise of this story is great grace winter finds herself on a lifeboat with 38 other people after their luxury liner sinks the lifeboat is too small to hold all those people the emergency food and water supplies begin to dwindle as the days pass by soon people begin looking at their neighbours differently reduced to their most base instincts with scattered thoughts floating in their heads the survivors begin to assess their shipmates' weaknesses i loved the beginning and the end of this book it was the middle part where things began to drag for me i believe this was partly because the whole story is told from grace's perspective she isn't the most interesting character in the book i think the story would have had a greater emotional impact if the motivations of other passengers were more clearly defined the book does make you think and would be a great discussion piece for a book club this is charlotte rogan's first novel and it is an impressive debut","769":"i was so excited about this book in the beginning it's really dark and a little depressing and it doesn't really answer your questions","770":"good but the ending could have used a bit of work the rest was engaging but the end dragged by comparison","771":"the book is about a woman who spends 21 days on a lifeboat after the ship she and her new husband were traveling on sinks most of the book is about the time on the lifeboat but in the last few chapters it gets much better as it delves into the motivations for certain actions of those on the boat and looks more into life and death","772":"gah this book made me queasy and incredibly thankful that i read it after going on a cruise with my family last month it's well done if you enjoy never really knowing the truth but for people like me it can make you anxious definitely a good book club book i'm sure it will make the rounds i need to go read something soothing now","773":" umpteen days adrift in in a lifeboat peopled with a variety of characters is good material for a story full of description and internal thoughts sadly i never quite got to grips with this book mrs grant and her sidekick hannah remained shadowy for me when they are pivotal to the story of course part of the point is that they are shadowy we don't know why they are so closely bound to one another or why they have such power over others i found it hard to take grace's account the minute details one moment but the boat occupants not realising some of their number were dead understandable and rotting not so much it is probably quite realistic especially in extreme situations that one would be hyperaware of some things and not consciously aware of others but sometimes realism doesn't work in fiction she was an interesting character i found the comparisons between the decisions made by her sister and herself about how to get through life and their attitudes more absorbing than who dies and who is saved and how in the book there are arguments that she is a strong woman in a passive enduring getting by way contrasted with the conscious manipulations of hardie the sailor or the mysterious mrs grant who seems to be on some kind of feminist crusade of the man hating variety the mother in the boat is another very successful 'endurer'mary ann was almost enjoyably annoying with her child like innocent whining combined with her nasty speculations the wonder is that she didn't go over the side long before the book had a cleverly period feel although i kept having to remind myself it was set immediately pre wwi and not victorian there are passages of 'deep' stuff reminiscent of works written much longer ago for example paraphrasing hobbes on power and the will to live fundamentally my objection to a perfectly decent book is the continual sense of being manipulated not of grace trying to persuade us of her innocence of the crime for which she stands trial but because of all the mystery and suspense strands that are continually laboured ultimately without good reason as if rogan lacked the conviction that we'd keep turning the pages otherwise there's plenty to keep a reading group discussion happy but ultimately unsatisfying","774":"this book is a riveting page turner and keeps you contemplating the entire time it is a tale about survival through and through and will be a quick yet fulfilling read with an interesting plot complex characters and a little conspiracy sprinkled in the lifeboat is the perfect read for a rainy day thank you goodreads for my favorite giveaway book yet","775":"lifeboat by rogan is an amazing book it's well written and keeps your interest the author places 29 people in a lifeboat and follows their stories and their will to survive this leads to differing perceptions morals and spirituality it's a book i'd read again","776":"there is a disaster at sea and a group of mostly strangers is forced to try to survive in a lifeboat that is over capacity this book could bring up a lot of discussion do we ever know what we would do in a situation until we've been there how would you react how far would you go to survive but with that said it was a little too much for me i didn't love the character and found myself not sure if i wanted her to be convicted or not but maybe that's the point who are we to judge","777":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a very thought provoking book from the very first page you are gripped by the story and it does not let you go until the last page and even then it leaves you with plenty to think about these people on the lifeboat are thrown together having little in common and trying to survive what is happening to them until they can be rescued in a confined space even the most basic human necessities are not available and they try and maintain their sense of modesty and manners but as time goes this was a very thought provoking book from the very first page you are gripped by the story and it does not let you go until the last page and even then it leaves you with plenty to think about these people on the lifeboat are thrown together having little in common and trying to survive what is happening to them until they can be rescued in a confined space even the most basic human necessities are not available and they try and maintain their sense of modesty and manners but as time goes on these are stretched to the limits and something has to give the story builds steadily and it is very hard to leave this book once you begin the people on the boat are fascinating and the dynamics there are interesting to read leaders quickly push themselves forward leading the group of weary travellers but in these circumstances nothing is certain and people become pushed to their limits of patience for their want to survive no one can be certain of their survival more","778":"i listened to the audiobook and was caught up pretty quickly in the story of 39 shipwrecked people fighting for survival in a lifeboat the story is told solely through grace a 22 year old newlywed who was aboard ship with her husband returning to new york at the outbreak of wwi i like stories with unreliable narrators and as the story unfolds grace definitely becomes that although whether through manipulation or circumstance is difficult to determine there are unanswered questions in this book some of which i found frustrating and contributed to my 3 star review","779":"just could not get into reading this book it was really boring to me and i just read a few chapters","780":" 3 5 starsthis really was a page turner not an edge of your seat intense action filled page turner but one that quietly sneaks up on you and captivates you nevertheless it was a captivating tale of survival grace is on trial and must tell the tale of what happened when 39 people were crammed on a lifeboat afloat for days after the ocean liner they were on sinks after an explosion this is a tale of what happens when too many people are on a lifeboat with very little food and water a realistic tale of survival they must fight against the ocean the elements and each other to survive","781":"first book for rogan and it is a good read when your survival depends on the sacrifice of others what is right and what is wrong","782":"post titanic another large ship sinks during a trans atlantic voyage only a handful of its passengers make it onto the lifeboats the narrator lost her husband when the ship sunk and narrates the time spent on the lifeboat great imagery i was tasting saltwater and picturing chapped lips and stinging wounds throughout i thought this would be more suspenseful than it was and it didn't keep my attention very well","783":"one of those books that i just wasn't sure if i liked it but there were sections where i couldn't put the book down interesting look at human nature the fine line between insanity and reality many questions of what if and what would you do fast read","784":"a well written tale of the vagaries of human nature under duress","785":"boring plot did not have an exciting or interesting climax the resolution could have been more related to the actual plot complications","786":" i really liked this book it's somewhat in its own head like the toni morrison book i read for this book a day funness but in this case i found it captivating and intriguing i should not have finished this book last night i was so tired but i couldn't put it down this is a book i would like to read again maybe with a notepad to take some notes even one thing that i have mixed feelings about is that this book raised a lot of questions and did not necessarily answer them why did the boat sink what was in the box did henry bribe um someone could have been one of two people i think to get grace on the boat but in truth those questions though maddening are irrelevant this book's strength lies in the tone of the book sad recovering from tragedy hovering on the brink of war trying to move on after the tragedy and yes the protagonist is a bit mercenary but really you can't blame her and i think that part of the books strength is in her strength strength of will flexibility of character and passionate desire to survive this book's strength also lies in the larger the grand questions it asks what is reasonable on a lifeboat in the open sea what happens and what can be expected and what can be shoehorned into a law that doesn't contemplate this situation is it murder to row the boat away from a drowning child is it still murder if trying to save that child will kill 38 other people including another child is it murder to beat and break hands reaching for the salvation of a boat to float upon is it still murder if those hands will drag all into the depths is it murder to ask people to sacrifice themselves for the rest is it a courageous sacrifice if those people do in fact sacrifice themselves but do so unwillingly and filled with terror how do people in this position make these kinds of decisions how do they feel while making them how do they rationalize to themselves what deep down causes some people to survive a situation like this and others to die finally one very odd feeling i had despite the heroine's obvious flaws but i was almost jealous of her experience of the opportunity she had to go through this privation and terror and really know herself without the trappings of civilization to tell her what was a good thought and a bad thought and good behavior and bad behavior when these people got off that lifeboat barely clinging to life as some of them were they had no further illusions about themselves it's not comfortable to think about one's illusions of themselves it's not pretty and we really can't ever know how we will react in such a situation as i said this book kept me up very late at night and i still found it difficult to sleep afterwards book of the day january 4 5 2014 weekends count as one day","787":"i couldn't tell if this was a metaphor or not through the entire story the trial was unrealistic no prosecutor would bring those charges i enjoyed the water sea motif but that was not enough to salvage this novel for me","788":"this was ok but i kept waiting for it to get interesting grace the main character and narrator seems too passive and it all became rather tedious mrs p","789":"this was not my favorite book i felt like this author didn't have a clear idea of what this story should encompass so it was very uneven","790":"was dissapointed expected more action","791":" this book made me very tense for a number of reasons some good and some bad the writing a very fast and intriguing when describing the action at sea the storms and the dire straights in which these people were forced to live the main character was very flawed to the point she was annoying and unlikeable but i still wanted her to live to tell more about the perils at sea unfortunately there were all these great seeds of mystery planted that were never resolved as an action disaster book it was great as a mystery sadly this lacked resolution to major questions on the whole i still enjoyed it finished it in one day","792":"this was a 2 5 star book for me one other reviewer said it well the premise sounded so interesting but the book just didn't live up to the premise for me and left me wanting more","793":"a gripping and thought provoking story with a complex female lead character thoroughly enjoyed it","794":"exceptionally written and beautifully detailed account of class distinction man versus woman man against the sea and the struggle for authority in an overcrowded lifeboat following the sinking of a luxury ocean liner in 1914 i savored every page","795":"stories of stranding and shipwreck appeal to me and this novel takes this theme and runs with it i got the sense that i wasn't catching all the nuances and levels of meaning it contains it deserves close re readings there's an underlying background mystery that i never quite wrapped my brain around and having finished the book i have that squirmy feeling that the author is asking me to come up with some answers as to what was going on the main character grace is quite likeable and most definitely a survivor","796":"i had read about this book and jumped at the chance to read it although the premise was intriguing and the events cover the gamut of emotions of people in peril i was left unsatisfied many loose ends were left although that may have been intentional it just left me a bit cold","797":"beautifully written story i felt like i was also adrift on the lifeboat hoping to be rescued against impossible odds the gradual emaciation of the body due to dehydration and lack of food contributes to the delusional reality of those on the boat at first the majority of women trust the men on board to make decisions but that confidence erodes as the male officer in charge exhibits fallibility and confusion the strongest women must act a survival story that is not the typical lost at sea novel charlotte rogan is a classical author similar to anne patchett with a unique voice of her own","798":" interesting premise but the characters were underdeveloped and the writing a bit murky i got to the end and was disappointed not because i was through with the book but because the book seemed to be lacking in many ways the first person narrator is so dislikeable that she is hard to empathize with and the two women on trial with the narrator were just ciphers to me maybe we are supposed to not understand what really happened on the lifeboat but too many questions unanswered makes for a very unsatisfying read","799":"i wanted this to be so much more than it was was really hoping to get involved with the emotions of the survivors on the lifeboat and what they were going through but it was strange instead weird personalities that i couldn't relate to and the author jumped around at the end instead of explaining more about how they got rescued i guess i kept reading hoping for it to get better and it didn't","800":" i fluctuate between 3 and 4 stars for this one while it's not my favorite and i wouldn't recommend it to everyone it is intense and interesting it's got a horrible side to it something like lord of the flies hunger games had a similar feel although i think in the hunger games you found katniss to be a sympathetic character in this book it was so interesting to try and figure out if grace was a sympathetic character or if she was manipulative i saw this on a list of good book club books and i would say this does definitely fit the bill it would be a really interesting discussion","801":"3 1 2 stars this was a suspenseful story of survivors of a luxury cruise liner that sank in 1914 i liked charlotte rogan's writing and she included a lot of fascinating sea lore however the pacing of the novel felt a little slow in spots a good book club discussion choice overall though","802":"a fascinating exploration of how humanity stands up in desperate circumstances","803":"didn't love this one but didn't hate it either i was feeling like there should be more to the story maybe there was and i missed it","804":"surprising engaging story told from the point of view of a shipping disaster survivor the first time author was amazing in her characterization and placed you right in the middle of the lifeboat recommend trying this","805":"i waffled between 3 and 4 stars this book is the poster child for the need for half stars it's really a 3 5 for me i enjoyed the writing style and the character development but it didn't grip me and i felt no great emotion when the outcome was revealed","806":" 3 stars or 4 i was never sure if i liked or could trust the narrator grace as she was calculating in her pursuit of henry so might she also be in her journal written for the lawyers her motivation in helping mrs grant and hannah in the moment they attacked mr hardie is never clear did she help throw him overboard because he could corroborate that henry had bought her way onto the lifeboat what was hannah's motivation in aligning herself with mrs grant the presentation of survival aboard the lifeboat is visceral and well written and the most compelling part of the story","807":"a group of people are stranded together on a lifeboat after a ship sinks there's not enough water food or room for everyone ruthless ness begins and how does it end here is that story told from the viewpoint of one of the survivors","808":"loved the premise but the book didn't deliver hard to read a book about being stranded in a lifeboat without comparing it unfavorably to unbroken","809":"i expected to like it more than i did different though and i found it to be an easy read","810":"some interesting twists when your life is threatened how far would you go to survive engrossing read into human nature would like to see this author write another book","811":"i couldn't put it down very good can't get it out of my mind","812":"good fast read was good for book club discussion","813":" it is the early 20th century and grace winter is on trial after having survived on a lifeboat after the steamship the empress alexandra sank in the atlantic ocean the premise is certainly promising it seems like this novel could be a riveting suspenseful tale of adventure and survival it could be a philosophical tale with exciting moral quandaries it could be an inspirational story to lift us out of our mundane lives unfortunately it is none of those it's a dull drab waste of time one of the rules of fiction writing is that authors ought to show rather than tell as a reader i think this should be the foremost rule of writers i want to be transported from my living room into the lifeboat i want to feel like i am one of the passengers i want to see the world through the eyes of grace winter unfortunately the entire book is told to me nothing is shown plot developments are not broken down into scenes there are virtually no dialogue exchanges i don't recall the last published book i read without dialogue exchanges yes there are quotation marks but there are almost no scenes that play out with two or more characters exchanging words it's excruciatingly boring since the story is told to me by grace winter i also didn't get a solid sense of any character definition let alone development from anyone aside from grace winter further she does not undergo any development and i hope rogan didn't intend for us to view grace winter as the heroine of this story for surviving because yes she survives but not in an admirable way beyond that i don't know what charlotte rogan was aiming for in this book what's the point of this book i don't know it's not an inspiring story it's not a philosophical story and it's not a fun tale of suspenseful adventure i'm not saying the novel is entirely devoid of merit the premise is promising and charlotte rogan is capable of constructing some nice sentences but more work should have been done more showing less telling more character definition more dialogue and more thought on the overall theme and goal of the novel","814":"the trial at the end kept me listening until i finished it the places where the people on the lifeboat were interacting were good and held my interest unfortunately it was interspersed with long periods where nothing much was happening much like being stranded in the middle of the ocean in a lifeboat would be small periods of activity with a lot of just boring floating around in between","815":"i was originally going to give this book five stars however that all changed near the last 100 pages i felt that the plot was well developed and in a sense you feel as if you are on the lifeboat with them i enjoyed how after a few chapters about the scenario on the lifeboat it would cross cut to what had happened on the boat before it has sunk the author dealt well with how the characters would have coped with all the ethical decisions that they had to make part five was when the book began to decline as she did not finish the story about what had happened on the life boat and instead spent a good fifty seventy pages on the events afterwards it left me hanging not in suspense but more just wishing the book had continued the way it had originally been only the last 20 odd pages were about how they had been rescued and i felt that they were too rushed overall the book was satisfactory but it does need quite a few improvements","816":"this is challenging for an author because of the title as the reader you feel you know everything there is to know about this novel been there seen and read this kind of tale many times before but ms rogan is able to get past that definitely a worthy read what would being stranded on the ocean in a lifeboat full of strangers teach you about yourself","817":"if i could do a half star i would say 2 5 not nearly as riveting as it could should have been considering the drama that could unfold after 3 weeks stuck in a lifeboat one problem i think was way too many people in that boat i couldn't get a sense of the characters or keep them straight but i really didn't even care to there were some interesting even gripping moments but they were too few and too fleeting if you want to read an edge of your seat lifeboat story read life of pi and unbroken this book was more of a character study than an adventure story and it was a character study of people that i really didn't care for or care about","818":"enjoyed this book its about a group of people stranded on a lifeboat after the cruise liner sinks the majority of the book is seen from the point of view of grace a young woman recently married but her husband is not with her it was a battle of will at times and vert athmospheric as well the ending was a bit disapointing but a book well worth the read from a firse time author","819":"i finished this book in record time because once i started reading i could not put it down the story takes place after the sinking of the titanic it is told from the perspective of grace a twenty four year old newlywed who finds herself in a lifeboat with thirty eight other souls when their ship is unexpectedly sunk in the middle of the ocean unfortunately for grace and ship mates the life boat is a teensy bit overcrowded and there is no rescue in site as the days go on the tension ratchets up as people come undone mentally and physically eventually some very disturbing things take place on the lifeboat requiring the survivors to answer for their actions i know some people probably won't like grace but i admire her tenacity i also enjoyed the skipping around of time periods at times the action went from the lifeboat to the previous time when grace met her husband henry to the time after the survivors reached land this was a quick enjoyable read and i would highly recommend it to everyone this would make an especially fun beach read","820":" this book received quite a bit of hype last summer so when i was looking for a quick beach read it came to mind unfortunately for me if just didn't live up to its promise the early days on the lifeboat dragged the other lifeboat survivors were never developed well enough for me to care what happened to them narrator and presumptive protagonist grace was a difficult figure to embrace and the book's later court scenes which should have been dramatic and climactic seemed perfunctory if you want a great mix of drama on the high seas and skillful legal maneuvering skip this and read herman wouk's the caine mutiny instead","821":"simply but well written and a superb tale a grown up lord of the flies adrift on the ocean well worth the read","822":"enjoyed the first half","823":" there's something innate in us that makes us slow down as we drive by an accident or makes us stare unable to act in the face of someone else's tragedy i don't know if it's fear shock or even a profound sense of thank god it's not me i suppose that's why i like reading survivor novels i like delving into a person's mindset when they're faced with the end or the possibility of the end movies like open water 1 and 2 buried frozen they're disturbing and frightening and such interesting glimpses into the human psyche this book tries to do that it takes a look at the survivors of a ship's explosion as they struggle on a lifeboat the premise is intriguing how will they survive who will be strong weak powerful etc told through the diary and reflections of grace the story is delivered in a way that keeps you reading it's a fast read and interesting but it's really just not enough it only glosses the surface and then abruptly ends with a confused psychiatrist i wanted more more of the lifeboat drama more of the dilemma just more quick review it's fun quick but also forgetable","824":"a charity shop buy which turned into a compelling and exciting read i felt wet tired hungry and thirsty whilst reading this book it also provides a brilliant thesis on the what would you do to survive argument i must add though i was slightly disappointed by the very end of the novel i craved answers and truths and was smugly told this was wrong if i had not felt so sorry for him i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know grrr i wanted to know","825":" silly me i chose to read this on a cruise ship actually it didn't frighten me it made me think about all the people on the ship and how would the group react who was assigned to my lifeboat during the safety drill bringing a group of people together brings out behaviors we wouldn't expect including an action that could be seen as murder 1914 is the setting for this book in which newly married grace is one of the few who survived a ship disaster i think the author has studied human behavior to create a cast of characters who either take leadership roles or followers or the totally despairing behavior of people who fault most actions but do nothing to help with survival it is a study in how roles change in a life or death situation and how one reacts to return to civilization finding themselves accused of murder i admired the strength of grace and the intricacies of relationships","826":"quotable i t is never a good idea to form any hard and fast opinions at nighttime","827":"forced myself to finish this just to see what the outcome of the trial was so i skimmed the last third written in an abreviated victorian style which was appropriate for a fictional autobiography of the 1900's it gets tiresome after awhile it did remind me of the old chales laughtin greta garbo movie lifeboat with an interesting twist","828":"i enjoyed the book but it felt just a tad bit too long","829":" i feel decidedly meh about this one i have trouble understanding what's going on with unreliable narrators and this one is a doozy there is not much action most of the book is the thoughts going on in the main character's head i think this one could have potential as a good discussion book because it may provoke interesting dialogue about morality and memory maybe i am just a slave to plot but as stephen king has said the story is everything without a lively tale i lose interest although it is short i found mysef plodding to get to the end","830":"this was a book which relied on telling not showing although since grace seemed to be a bit of an unrelieable narrator sometimes that was not telling or changing what was told it certainly conveyed a sense of claustrophobia i was ready to get out of the boat and even abandon the book sometimes but i didn't sense the desperation i think i would have felt under the circumstances none of the characters were particularly interesting even grace they all seemed resigned to their fate both in the boat and on trial i just felt this book missed the mark","831":"i had a problem believing this 1st person historical fiction she the narrator sounded too proper and formal when describing the harshness of being lost at sea in a lifeboat i was ready to suspend my disbelief but most of it was just ridiculous not in an over the top way but like really that's all and the climax was stupid and then there was a long anti climax i would believe maybe one person jumping over but over and over people just dove into the water and disappeared","832":"trying to pinpoint why this book only got 2 stars i think it boils down to the main character not being dislikeable enough she's self centred self opinionated and calculating but only enough to make her someone i'd avoid rather than someone i'd have happily pushed overboard","833":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was so nearly a very good book it was gripping initially i was intrigued by the character of grace an unreliable narrator and a manipulator of those around her i expected during the trial sequence to see grace's character and actions through the filter of the other survivors eyes but this didn't happen more irritating still were the many mysteries set up by the author what was in the box what was the relationship and history between hardie and blake did henry strike a bargain wit this was so nearly a very good book it was gripping initially i was intrigued by the character of grace an unreliable narrator and a manipulator of those around her i expected during the trial sequence to see grace's character and actions through the filter of the other survivors eyes but this didn't happen more irritating still were the many mysteries set up by the author what was in the box what was the relationship and history between hardie and blake did henry strike a bargain with hardie was grace as she claimed truly in love with henry or was he like her lawyer merely convenient for her self preservation was the distress signal sent why did hardy insist on staying close to the wreck and so on and so on i expected at least some of the question marks to be answered by the end of the book but the fact that none of the loose ends were tied up seemed to me to be rather lazy writing on the part of the author more","834":" this was an interesting book while not quite as compelling as the reviews have made it out to be it's also a very quick read the central question whether it is possible to be good and still survive and what society thinks of those who do survive is pretty fascinating one of the characters in the book makes the point that it's the witch trial conundrum if you sink and drown you're not a witch but if you survive you are you can't win given the enormity of that dilemma i expected a bit more drama but the book is quiet and pretty subtle in its pulling together the character of the narrator it leaves you wanting to know more and then at the end pokes fun at you because you do but sometimes ambiguity is not clever or cool sometimes it's just a lack of development the triumph of style over substance ultimately while it's a really good debut and i look forward to more from this author i wanted it to be a little more intense","835":"i wouldn't have thought that a story that mostly takes place in a tiny boat adrift at sea could be so involving and fascinating so well written the vividly portrayed characters kept me gripped even when not much else was 'happening' in particular grace the narrator is such a strong and interesting character her voice just draws you in to the story great book hard to believe that it's the author's first","836":"i couldn't even finish this book which is extremely rare the narrator drove me crazy and it was surprisingly uneventful for a survival story","837":"ugh this was barely even ok it was a short novel to begin with and i still found myself skmming through most of it","838":"after being recommended this book by a couple of fellow book club members i had to read it particularly on the synopsis alone the fight for survival in a lifeboat for passengers of a shipwreck is reminiscent of the titanic disaster and completely enthralling although some of the characters are hard to like it explores challenging circumstances honestly and with depth","839":"loved this book a one or two day read a gripping tale about human nature what would i do in this situation i have no idea but it is interesting to think about two weeks plus in a lifeboat with 38 other people i'd probably go crazy","840":"the oft told tale of the survivors of a shipwreck adrift in a lifeboat on the open ocean with the twist of a group of women on trial for murdering the crewman who had been in charge of the lifeboat interesting and well written if not particularly novel","841":"i can't exactly pinpoint what was such a turn off for me about this book survival stories are one of my favorite genres but maybe it was due to the fictional nature of this book that it didn't live up to my expectations it was actually much more than a survival book i think the author wanted the reader to also think about woman's rights and the quandary one is faced when losing your life will save another is it right to sacrifice one life for another and which ones are deemed worthy in this case the book did well to make you ponder this situation the voice of the main character didn't seem very real to me i never felt like i could really get into her head and pinpoint who she was some of the things brought up in the story seemed out of place or difficult to believe not because it was fiction but because the author described the character to be one way and then they did something uncharacteristly that threw you off without much explanation there was also some dialogue from some female characters that a feminist would scoff at but i understand that this was attempting to set the tone for how some women actually thought in the time period this book was set it just rubbed me the wrong way how some of it was presented it seemed that the stronger of the women were punished for being stronger although many of the weak women were punished in other ways as well the take home message of this book is lost to me but it was a short read and i did make it to the end because the author did a great job in keeping you in suspense","842":"i agree with many of the previous reviewers that this book misses a four star rating due to the faltering of the last 50 or so pages however it kept me intrigued until the end and is a worthwhile read","843":" when my friend jolynn recommended this book to me i hadn't heard of it so i had the all too rare pleasure of knowing absolutely nothing about it before i started reading it and having no expectations the setup is fantastic a frame tale of a young woman in 1914 grace who is on trial for an unspecified crime that's connected to her time on a lifeboat after the cross atlantic ship she and her new husband are on sinks her lawyers encourage her to write out the story of her experiences so they can decide her best defense and the central section of the lifeboat is this account because of the framing the already interesting story of how the passengers on the lifeboat survive is made even more fascinating the reader knows that at least some of them will survive but because rescue seems unlikely the mystery of how is always hanging around more importantly because the reader knows grace is charged with a crime the questions of what the alleged crime will be and whether grace is telling the story honestly add extra layers of depth to the reading experience with that setup the boat setting and the potential for different layers of knowledge and perception i was put in the mind of life of pi and the cat's table both set on boats both recounted at some distance of time by the narrator and both including major shifts in the reader's understanding of what happened on the boat that enrich the experience they're fantastic books but those fledgling comparisons in my mind put an end to me not having any expectations and the lifeboat isn't the same kind of novel it doesn't try to make a major shift in the reader's perceptions and it doesn't try to surprise with anything that you couldn't have ever seen coming the focus is on the shifting relationships and competing feelings about responsibility among the members of the lifeboat unfortunately for me that focus wasn't as interesting and the last third of the novel felt like a closing down of the possibilities that the first third had opened up in that way rogan's book suffers by my comparing them with martel's and ondaatje's the revelation of the crime and especially the resolution of the trial couldn't help but be less interesting than the mysteries that the opening establishes","844":" there is enough substance in the lifeboat to keep you reading but not enough sympathy from the voice of the main character to really feel connected to her story a life boat overstuffed with people glimpses of only a few and a climax that could certainly be made into a movie but the overall story and the emotional attachment to characters that would really suck a reader into this tale are lacking it certainly has its high moments and it's certainly a quick read but you won't be finding characters or dramatic situations that linger with you afterward","845":" this is a wonderfully thought provoking novel the main character grace is the epitome of the unreliable narrator telling the story as best she can remmeber of coiurse of her time on an overcrowded lifeboat after the ship she is on sinks during a trans atlantic crossing for three weeks the 39 survivors truly fioght for their lives and sometimes for the sacrifice of others the story begins in the middle of things for grace who finds herself on trial for murder since mr hardie the only seamen on the boat was voted off the boat and forced overboard grace finds herself in this position along with two other women in this predicament because of their involvement in and bringing about the event of mr hardie's death the novel explores grace's experience in the lifeboat and she does admit to not necessarily knowing the truth of what happened out in the open sea ms rogan does an admirable job of writing a ridiculously compelling read","846":"intense and powerful wow","847":" one of the books of 2012 which i was keen to read i wasn't disappointed by this debut novel either which seeks to convey the outcome of surviving in a lifeboat set just after the sinking of the titanic and on the eve of world war one the book stays faithful to it's time and explores the will to survive the art of recollection as against what one choices to remember and places some of the survivors in court based on events in the lifeboat this is a gripping read devoid of cliche and stereotype presenting a varied cast of people in the overcrowded lifeboat in an interesting and realistic way seen through the recollections of grace winter we learn of the initial hopes for rescue the doubts and despair that grows as water and food run out it is both fascinating and compelling to read and measure up to the characters set adrift at the mercy of the sea that threatens to engulf them and should you invite death by throwing yourself out of the boat or wait for starvation or a huge wave to end your existence while seeking to draw on your inner strengths and the courage of others can you survive against the odds this is made more painful as you wonder on the fate of loved ones did they make it off the sinking vessel can you fight the sense of loss of a child or partner is your life worth saving the book covers all these topics and so much more to make it a terrific novel and worthy of all the praise heaped on it already i enjoyed it in an unsettling way as it makes you think and reflect however it is the sense of place and time that make this novel work for me as the role of women who can't even vote and are viewed as an attachment of their men folk the spirit of grace shines through and the voice of the author remains with you long after you finish the book i sincerely recommend it to everyone and look for to future novels from charlotte rogan","848":" one of the more interesting and exciting books i have read this year set in the 19teens on the eve of wwi it explores what happens when a ship sinks in the atlantic and the survivors are in a too small lifeboat for much longer than they anticipated aside from the purely fascinating aspects of exploring human survival most of the book is a treatise on morals it certainly led to my thinking a great deal about what i would do in the same situation one thing that i think would have made the book better it opens with the mc on her way to court post shipwreck so you go through the entire book knowing that she survives i think it would have been slightly more gripping if they left that to the 3 4 point of the book regardless a book i zoomed through eager to see what happened next","849":" grace is just twenty two and newly married to rich banker henry when sailing to new york in 1914 their liner sinks forcing the women crew and some men into lifeboats overcrowded with only limited water and crackers for food and no sign of rescue it becomes a fight for survival with three weeks stranded at sea the chances of rescue are becoming more and more distant i found it easy to picture the story in my head as i was reading although i was a bit confused at the end and had to reread the last pages several times 3 5","850":"very very dull and the main character was unlikable and passive not at all what i expected or wanted from this book it was a struggle to make it through and i only did so because i hoped for an ending that would have revealed something to make the slog worthwhile unfortunately that didn't happen","851":"this book was a little hard to get into caught up in a ship wreck its fascinating to see how people react to helplessness darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest came to mind but other than that i didn't get much out of the book","852":"the story the main character grace recollects about her time on the lifeboat are incredibly interesting but i didn't enjoy her story of the trial as much","853":"i think i was expecting something more akin to hitchcock's lifeboat i probably shoulda just watched hitchcock's lifeboat","854":"the novel is just what i expected and was hoping for basically the author asks is it ethically acceptable to allow or compel the weakest to die so the majority may live i loved this one","855":"this did not have much action the writing was very good i wondered after i finished was i suppose to read into it things that were not said i would not necessarily recommend this to anyone","856":"after a third of the book i was thinking just another lifeboat story but the story is better than that and moves on well to make it much more unique people living in close proximity to each other beware rogan mixes the two time periods extremely well and it's another successful lifeboat tale the others being life of pi and the best of the 3 jamrach's menagerie no doubt there are more","857":"grace winter is sailing on the empress alexandra with her new husband henry when the ship goes down after an explosion henry mysteriously secures grace's position in the lifeboat and there begins our story the story of 38 people in a lifeboat designed to hold less then 40 a story about 1 crew member and the remaining passengers who survive at sea for more than 3 weeks we are told in the beginning that grace is on trial for murder but are left without any details the story is based upon a journal grace kept while on the lifeboat the writing is eloquent as corny as that sounds it was smooth flowing and beautifully written while the story was gripping the writing is what really kept me reading this book","858":" i was hestitant to read this for quite the funny reason back when i was a newlywed i took a communications class so i could be at school with my husband when he was taking night classes in the communications class we did one of those what if scenarios where we had a lifeboat with room for 8 people but we had 11 people or something like that we had to decide which people to 'allow' to survive by keeping the people who we thought would make the most positive and useful contributions i have had that exercise come to mind lately and have come to the painful realization that i have reached an age where i would most likely be voted off the lifeboat this book brought out some interesting though not novel points about survival and human nature but i really didn't like it very much there were times i wanted to volunteer to jump off of the lifeboat if i ever found myself in such a situation i would hope to find myself in the company of people who shared my beliefs in an afterlife so that the difficulty of sacrificing for someone else would be preferable to being selfish and surviving but having to utltimately answer for our selfishness but there is a way we like to think we would react in certain situations and then there's reality the book touched on this my main problem with the book was i didn't really like the main character i felt like when all was said and done she wasn't really changed by her experiences in the ways one would think or hope","859":"this book grabbed me from the beginning and i finished it on the second day it was riveting and hard to put down but i found the ending to be blah and flat and written in a rush to give closure to the story thus 4 stars instead of 5","860":" this story is told from the perspective of grace a twenty four year old newlywed who finds herself in a lifeboat with thirty eight other people when their ship unexpectedly sinks in the middle of the ocean unfortunately for grace and the others the life boat is a teensy bit overcrowded and there is no rescue in site as the days go on the tension ratchets up as people come undone mentally and physically eventually some very disturbing things take place on the lifeboat requiring the survivors to answer for their actions i didn't care for any of the characters which made it hard to get into the book people died people lived i honestly didn't care i just kept reading to see if something was going to happen the book contains plenty of drama and events considering it takes place in a lifeboat for days but it just didn't read well for me i found it a bit boring not boring exactly just not interesting grace the main character just didn't seem relatable to at all she tricks an engaged man into falling in love with her and only seems to care about herself hard to pity her i think if i had found the characters more likable i would have enjoyed this book much more","861":"this is an oddly disturbing story about randomly thrown together lifeboat survivors whose motivations and loyalties shift and coalesce as their survival is more and more in doubt it begs the question of what survival is worth and what we owe to others in such a harrowing situation an interesting read but i got impatient with the details of the lifeboat days at the same time that i wished for more transition details and follow up of the subsequent events","862":"twas good but that that good","863":" i read the lifeboat somewhat on a whim an acquaintance of mine had just finished it and was raving about it i had just finished a book and was looking for something to read it was short ish and had big print so i bumped it to the top of my reading queue so with all that in mind i liked it it's the type of book you read on a road trip or during your 3 day stay at a beach cottage you read it think hmm put it aside and forget about it this was charlotte rogan's first book and for that i give her credit she does an admirable job of creating an interesting setup castaways in a too small lifeboat an unexplained mystery of how they all got there and whether a crime was committed the dramas of man versus man man versus nature and survival ethics not to mention the side dramas of class struggle feminism and the question of god's existence whether he should be blamed for putting them in a lifeboat and us here on earth in the first place in fact rogan did such a good job of creating an interesting story with so many plot elements to explore that i hold it against her that it didn't turn out better view spoiler 1 grace is an intriguing narrator but i never knew how to take her is she a manipulator or a victim are we being lied to or is she telling the truth is she weak and naive or is she the strongest person in the boat rogan doesn't play this out as much as she could so instead of drawing any good conclusions or even being teased but left wanting i felt that it was done almost accidentally i ended up wondering did rogan even intend for those questions to be raised by the reader 2 too many of the characters were flat mary ann and hannah especially blended together and so did mrs grant and mrs mccain so did a number of the male passengers they felt two dimensional and formulaic especially at the end when we got absolutely no reaction or drama from grace turning against the other two defendants we only get one scene hannah staring at grace as she walks away 3 too many parts seemed full of meaning like the meaningful looks that mrs grant hannah and mr hardie gave grace but were never developed by the narrative why were they staring at grace so often were they impressed with her depth or intelligence we never really know 4 rogan never tells us what caused the accident what was up between hardie blake the banker and henry you might argue that this is true to life and quite indie of rogan to leave us hanging i felt that it was poor writing 5 the biggest disappointment though was that those really interesting themes the book touched on about god nature society and survival ethics were never really developed or resolved taking the most obvious one as an example we never know what we are to feel about them killing hardie did they make the right decision did they make the wrong decision we don't know and we don't even explore the question that much since gracie never even thought about it she just got caught up in the action she was told to help she helped he died she got off it would have been much more interesting if gracie had made the decision to kill hardie or been part of the conspiracy instead she's just an outsider as are we hide spoiler","864":"as someone fascinated with the titanic i enjoyed this fictionalized version it's a read that causes you to think about how far you would go to save yourself at the expense of others","865":"ok a little slow story predictible 1912 and a ship sinks this story is about those in an overfull lifeboat jumps around a bit from before to during to being in prison not good flow to story has to many gaps","866":"i really wanted to like this more it was heading in an interesting direction and i was curious to see how it would resolve itself but in the end i felt unsatisfied and not even sure i ever liked or cared about the protagonist","867":"a little stilted and slow for me but i think that was the style certainly didn't match the accolades of the book as one to be read in one sitting","868":"this book had more promise than what was actually delivered if not for the final 40 50 pages i would have given it 2 stars the premise is fantastic 39 people in a lifeboat together after their ship sinks it seemed the perfect situation for some in depth character development and interaction but the story fell far short of making me care for these people even the main character who is telling the story instead the plot just sort of drifts along and lacks the intensity for the most part that it should have carried throughout in such a situation the introspection insights while the trial was going on was the best part of the book","869":"i know it sounds creepy but reading about the survival or lack thereof of 39 people on a small lifeboat was really entertaining this was a debut for charlotte rogan and i'm duly impressed her characters are intense and seem true albeit this is hard to know since i've never really been in a situation even remotely like this one she uses an interesting device for framing the story flashbacks as the narrator stands trial for a crime its sometimes slow sometimes too wavering and sometimes gets lost in the mind of the narrator but overall a great first novel i'm particularly fond of debut novels","870":"couldn't get interested enough to finish it","871":"i thought this book to be an absolute page turner grace the narrator is both unobtrusive to the reader imagination and perfectly personal in experience grace's emotions about every event rings clear and characteristic yet allows for the reader to form an opinion that renders him or her included in every harrowing suffering and triumphant turn it's an examination into human survival and strength that you'll never forget","872":"i found this book very easy to read i simply could't get enought of this book and just kept turning its pages this book can be looked at as a personal diary transformed into a well written story","873":"i enjoyed this book it was interesting to think about the difficulties of being stuck in a lifeboat i wanted more answers from the ending than i got but it was still good not one that i would own to read again but definitely worth a trip to the library","874":"this book though well written didn't imprint upon me in the least usually when i finish a book i feel something for the characters and the events that occurred be it sorrow that the book finished despair over a difficult ending joy that all was resolved happily and even a keen feeling to seek out more from a talented author sometimes that feeling analyzing possibly reminiscing sticks with me for days if the book was a powerfully moving one not so here there were so many loose ends that were never resolved i spent the entire book thinking well that will be explained by the end but it wasn't as for grace i couldn't quite pin down whether i liked her or not i couldn't tell you if she was a good person or an opportunist given her initial meeting with henry i would lean towards scheming opportunist this book is well written shallow in some regards it was descriptive of the boat related incidents not a bad book but i wouldn't read it if given the chance again the quotes on the cover inside jacket are greatly exaggerated i did not find this book unbearably exciting or gripping you may want to give it a pass","875":"grace winter is on her honeymoon when the empress alexander sinks a few years after the titanic went down grace has a place on an over crowded lifeboat and the novel is her accounting of the trials and tribulations faced by the survivors i won't spoil the story by saying more about it read it","876":"moral dilemma brings an intense story to readers reminds me of crime and punishment but shorter a good read","877":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view

at what he did but he was still a man and men rarely knew what decisions a woman had or hadn't made p 245 and i sometimes believe i was forced or chosen to endure twenty one days in a lifeboat so that i wold never again think of nature as a garden for man and so that i would never again think of power as the thing henry possessed when he pocketed the keys to the vault or the authority wielded by judge potter who was the magistrate in charge of our case p 251 more","878":"it is the classic conundrum of the overcrowded lifeboat and the value of a life the stakes here involve not just a tale of surviving the shipwreck and the sea but also of surviving murder charges congratulations you survived go to jail go directly to jail do not pass go grace winter newly married must consider her own will to live and balance it with what she believes about people and their base natures she survives two weeks adrift in a lifeboat with 30 odd people i'm not giving anything away there then she must face the charge of murder because of choices made or not made during the struggle to stay alive what would you do","879":"i'll give the lifeboat two and a half stars though my reading may have been influenced by a break i took in the middle of the book for a few weeks for better or worse at times early on i felt like i was dragging along a little bit but again that could be influenced by my split reading in the end things picked up for me a little bit and i enjoyed it the story wasn't transcendent and i wouldn't go as far as to describe it as moving but it was entertaining and had moments that definitely stuck with me and it certainly brought up interesting discussions of human nature and how we act in extreme situations and who and what we're responsible for","880":"compelling suspense some drama nice if excessive if necessary use of foreshadowing wish she'd tied out all the threads neatly at the end but i'm compulsive like that i still want to know what blew up the world in the road","881":"for what should have been a thrilling plot a boat crash survivors lost at sea life and death on the line i was bored","882":"multi layered and captivating story of survival that examines what it means to be human what responsibilities we have to each other and whether one can be blamed for choices made to stay alive","883":"i think i would have liked this more had anyone but grace been the narrator","884":" while this book is short for me and the premise is great i found that it took a good while longer than i anticipated to finish this book it also wasn't what i thought it would be i thought the events would be contained to the boat and the people on that boat but this was not the case and the narrative swiftly shifts between the boat the trial for grace's life and other scenarios i felt this didn't really track with what i thought the book was trying to say also this isn't really popular fiction it's more like literature and worth a few reads i think to get all the characters motivations and symbols down unfortunately i don't have time to do that either way the book gets three stars for telling a reasonably entertaining story and also making some fresh insights into human character i had a bit of a feminist epiphany when the narrator grace observes that perhaps she and the others would not be on trial if she were a man for instance worth more than one read just to keep everything straight and figure out the details","885":"i'd swear that i've seen an old b u0026amp w movie so similar to this book that it even included a particular scene involving a knife","886":"i'll reserve by review until after book club","887":"great concept and interesting story but i didn't like any of the characters at all which kept me from being fully engaged in the book","888":"very strange book almost not sure why i finished odd situation of characters trying to survive","889":"i bought this book because i read several good reviews about it but what a disappointment i cannot find anything good to say about it except that it eventually came to an end i didn't find one character that i could empathise with or like frankly i would have been quite happy if the lifeboat had sunk with all survivors aboard","890":"good book for book clubs","891":"'the dressmaker' was much better than this read slightly dreary read","892":" this was very impressive first novel as the story opens grace is on trial for murder but it's unclear why her attorney asks her to write down her story and it's a harrowing account of three weeks on an overcrowded lifeboat in the atlantic following the sinking of a cruise ship it's 1914 and newlywed grace faces many moral dilemmas as she and her 38 fellow passengers struggle to survive the descriptions of hunger thirst sun and storms are brutal and real the weather and the eerie unpredictable sea become main characters is twenty two year old grace shrewd and ruthless or is she pragmatic and strong the primal effort to survive and thrive is explored shades of lord of the flies and the belief in god is questioned waiting for godot the novel is thick with symbolism birds drop from the sky deacons make sacrifices and fish are speared by hand it is well written and well paced and explores not only man vs nature but also the roles of women and the class structure of the early 20th century","893":"this debut is a riveting thought provoking survival story the narrator grace is a complex and well written character the themes of power weakness sacrifice morality and dishonesty explored in this remarkable tale make the lifeboat the perfect book club novel","894":"it is an interesting ethics dilemma and i will enjoy discussing with my book group i disliked the main character and feel she could have acted differently","895":"not the best book i've ever read but certainly not the worst it gets a little monotonous after awhile","896":"you basically start out right in the life boat as it is being lowered into the ocean the story is being told from the main characters perspective bringing in what brought her to be on the boat in the first place to where she ends up a good read","897":" the main character and narrator grace winters is a 22 year old lifeboat survivor i found this first person narrative to be very distant hence i didn't have much empathy for the survivors or those who perished without a connection to the characters i wasn't drawn into the story it just felt really long there were lots of thoughts in grace's mind e g grappling with one's true nature when in survival mode and pushed to their limits told rather matter of factly and unemotionally the characters didn't grab me and not much action to grab my attention either so if this wasn't my book club's read i would've put it down before finishing it","898":"rogan's debut novel written in her fifties imagines another ocean liner disaster between the titanic and the lusitania her empress alexandria catches fire and sinks in 1914 leaving half the passengers stranded in lifeboats on the atlantic the book is presented as the diary account of grace winter a newly married first class passenger whose husband finagles her a last minute seat on an already overcrowded lifeboat captained by crew member mr hardie predictable squabbles break out onboard as people are asked - or forced - to volunteer to sacrifice themselves so the leaks will not get worse and the food and water supply will hold out readers know from the start that grace is on trial but it is not until later that we learn why view spoiler she and two other women are charged with murdering mr hardie whom they forced overboard because of his 'threatening' presence hide spoiler as the confession of a supposed female criminal the lifeboat somewhat resembles gillespie and i or alias grace and that shared name can hardly be a coincidence but doesn't have the warmth and verve of those novels' unreliable narrators the novel also reminded me strongly of jamrach's menagerie with its intense evocation of the claustrophobic physically gruelling experience of being lost at sea but again the lifeboat lacks the same vitality grace's narrative is quite dull and flat which means that even the kind of climactic experiences she has to recount end up sounding ordinary rogan has a definite talent but needs to find a better voice for her next novel perhaps an omniscient narrator or a narrative split between various characters including grace would have been more suitable","899":"i was really excited about this book and it was pretty riveting for the first half or so however i started losing my connection with the main character after her actions became confusing and unexpected the author did little to explain the heroine's underlying emotional state and while perhaps she was trying to be enigmatic she lost me the ending was also a bit vague and anticlimactic anyway definitely some potential great writing vivid imagery and interesting plot but not what i was hoping for","900":"i wanted to like this much more than i did based on stellar reviews the first third was entrancing and so i thought here we go but somewhere along the line it lost me it's extremely well written characterization is excellent and yet i didn't feel for these characters the way i wanted to i'm sure many others will love it whereas i respected it but can't say i totally enjoyed it","901":"interesting by the time i got to the end of the book i was definitely less sympathetic grace i'm curious how others felt","902":" with the 100 year anniversary of the disaster known as the titanic quickly approaching i thought it would be fitting to read a book somewhat based on a similar story a huge ocean liner the empress alexandra suffers a terrible explosion and many are lost at sea and some lucky enough to be in a lifeboat are still struggling to survive especially since these lifeboats are over capacity and someone must give up their life so the others can survive this is the situation newlywed grace winter finds herself in in the summer of 1914 two years after the devastating disaster of the rms titanic what is worse weeks after having survived she is put on trial for murder right away we are swept into the present day of 1914 with grace on trial and her relating her memories of her time on the life boat and her struggles to survive with 38 other passengers a lifeboat that is way too heavy and slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as her memories unfold we also learn about how she met her husband henry a husband that she doesn't even know where he is in the water or even if he even made it off the ocean liner a husband that put her safety first over his own to secure her place on a lifeboat assuming she would be safe from harm not knowing what horrors would occur for her there i think this is a great portrayal of how being in a crisis a life or death situation can change someone it can bring the worst out in some the strength in others and weakness in even more some become leaders and many followers i think grace saw a side of herself and others she didn't know existed she did things she never would have even considered before all to just survive this story was odd at times raw and a little gritty even but i liked it i was constantly wondering what would happen next who would die who would live it was a compelling tale and nicely done","903":" i've always been fascinated by the titanic and shipwreck survival stories and was delighted to discover that the lifeboat was an interesting story though more focused on the characters than the survival part in 1914 newlywed grace winters finds herself on an overcrowded lifeboat trying with 38 others to survive after their ocean liner sinks what story gripping is that we know part of the outcome going into the story the prologue introduces us to grace and two other women who are on trial for their lives after three weeks in a lifeboat but more than that we don't know it fills the story with a sense of urgency knowing that something must occur but what i found grace likable and fairly pragmatic given her situation while at the same time there's an undercurrent of not knowing if her recollections are accurate i found myself thinking back to alfred hitchcock's lifeboat which i've seen only a few clips of in the context of studying groupthink and group dynamics so for me personally i enjoyed picking out the changing group dynamics of this novel as well an arc was provided through goodreads' first reads program","904":"did not really enjoy this book seemed not to flow very well kind of disjointed","905":" two years after that other famous shipwreck newly married grace finds herself in a lifeboat with 38 other people after the ship she was on explodes it ain't a picnic think 'lord of the flies' on a crowded lifeboat in the early 20th century it reminded me of 'life of pi' which i've been meaning to reread so reading this kind of held off the craving of reading that one a while too many books 'the lifeboat' is crammed with a ton of people rather than 'life of pi's one person in a boat both books are very psychological but not enough for me to understand some of the motives of the characters in 'the lifeboat' that would be my main complaint with this well written book but to be fair these were people thirsty starving and delusional in a lifeboat maybe the point is they didn't have motives grace is an unreliable narrator which makes sense in this situation as well i'll look forward to the movie something new in the back of this book is a list of the author's favorite books i haven't seen this before but it's like taking a peek at a writer's bookshelf i wish other writers would make lists like this some good books on that list which shows why this one is so well written","906":"this book was a page turner i had to control myself from skipping ahead to see how it ends rogan's first published fictional account of a ship's sinking post titanic and the ensuing drama on one of the lifeboats is a pleasure to read due to her tight writing and the subtle surprises that she inserts into the flowing narrative","907":" plenty of philosophical dreft to ruminate on as a survivor of a life threatening event i was interested in the different characters responses to their plight you never know how you will react when in real danger i've had plenty of people tell me how they would have handled my situation differently but they have no context for this assumption the truth is a person cannot know how they will react to the distinct possibility of immediate death one line sums it up for me the sea wasn't cruel the people were","908":"grace winter and her newly married husband henry are crossing the atlantic in 1914 when their boat sinks after suffering a mysterious explosion very few survivors make it onto the lifeboats because the ship was tilting at such an awkward angle grace survives the ship's sinking but he does not we learn early on grace is on trial for her life but we're not sure exactly what happened until quite late in the book the book switches from the perilous days in the lifeboat to grace reminiscing her family's misfortunate and how she met and married henry the lifeboat is overcrowded and the one male ship's employee mr hardie takes charge as the days go on without rescue food and water individual personalities threaten his authority","909":"this did not disappoint for some reason i found it quite gripping you want to know what happened and how the main character ends up accussed of murder that is not spoiling the story as you know it from the start what is life like at sea drifting in a lifeboat well having never experienced i can only say that the author possibly got it right i will be looking for other books by charlotte rogan","910":"fascinating but i still have a few questions","911":"this was ok nothing amazing about it not sure what all the buzz was about actually it was the type of book that really didn't know what it wanted to be physcological adventure thriller interesting premise but didn't really live up to potential","912":" this was a novel about a young woman who survives a shipwreck and 21 days in an overcrowded lifeboat contending with hunger and thirst and treacherous fellow passengers and yet this was boring i couldn't wait for it to end so i could move on to my next book there were a few different angles that this book seemed to be going for a survival story a courtroom drama a weird coming of age feminist awakening story but it fell short of all of them i think the main reason for this was the passive first person narrative despite spending almost 300 pages in grace's head i don't know her at all it almost seems like there was nothing to know this wasn't horrible but i'm glad it was a short read and i wouldn't recommend it 2016 reading challenge a debut novel","913":" i enjoyed the style grace writes a diary journal of events and her style is very simple and straightforward the parts on the lifeboat were a little life of pi ish for example in order to survive they catch fish and birds to eat so it's the same event experience as life of pi but without the beauty of the writing of life of pi grace is writing the journal after the fact while she sits in prison waiting for her trial the parts about the trial were interesting but made grace seem a little mercenary and manipulative so as a reader i'm not sure she was really likable and i found myself frustrated with her at the end it was a good book that had me asking many questions but it isn't one i would read again","914":"i know this book is receiving all sorts of critical acclaim but i found it to be quite dull the characters were unappealing and not terribly well developed i forced myself to finish it","915":"i was disappointed with this book it follows the story of grace a woman who survives the sinking of the ship she is on only to be stranded in the lifeboat for weeks while waiting to be rescued it sounded like an interesting story for a book but i kept reading waiting for it to get interesting","916":"while i thought the writing was exceptional the story left so many unanswered questions was her husband involved with the gold on board did he bribe mr hardie to put her on the boat was mr hardie involved with some underhanded plot why did her mother in law pay for her defense what happened to the other lifeboats i felt that there could have been so much more development and character analysis maybe she needs to do a sequel just left me cold and unwilling to take a cruise","917":"best at permitting the reader to see the complete evolution of human behaviors as life sustaining supplies diminish and hunger fatigue and loss of hope surface","918":"i liked reading this book i just wanted more from it it took me a while to get into it but i thought it picked up once they were on the boat i found the dynamics of the characters in the boat to be interesting but then i felt it fizzled out a bit at the end of the book","919":"timely read in light of the titanic anniversary portrays the tug of war for survival","920":"read in a 24 hour period the survival tale moved along easily but it was the intriguing character study that made it hard to put down","921":"a real page turner i think i read it in two days not much of a payoff at the end but i liked the central character","922":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here spoiler alert the story is set around a group of people in a life boat the central issue being that there are too many people in the lifeboat and some will have to go for the rest to survive grace a young recently married woman is

is particularly manipulative we only get to see events throu spoiler alert the story is set around a group of people in a life boat the central issue being that there are too many people in the

in some sense any narrator is manipulative in terms of creating emotion and perspective but grace is particularly manipulative we only get to see events through her eyes as they affect her her behavior is filtered and justified and maybe even modified to suit the emotion and perspective she wishes to portray she is definitely not a disinterested observer the author's gradual reveal of grace's image of wide eyed and innocent bride at the beginning of the book to her post lifeboat self calculating and heartless widow is quite a journey i am still not completely certain how much of that person was there all along and how much was a result of the lifeboat this story might not make my most memorable reads list but it was definitely interesting it should make a great book club discussion more","923":"this book sounded like it had so much potential but i found it to be dull boring uneventful and seriously lacking in character development i would not recommend this book to anyone","924":"finished it but didn't really enjoy it","925":"i t was very realistically and intense the characters took second place to the action and were never very developed i enjoyed the book","926":" with the lifeboat debut author charlotte rogan has created a quiet masterpiece in the first few pages we learn that grace winter has survived a shipwreck but is now on trial for her life in 1914 the empress alexandra sinks after an unidentified explosion some passengers including newlywed grace are lucky enough to get into lifeboats although grace's boat is overloaded with 38 passengers and one crew member mr hardie as the sole sailor among them immediately takes control of the lifeboat and through some questionable actions allows the shocked passengers to survive the initial days drifting at sea when rescue does not appear and the overloaded lifeboat reaches crisis point literally and figuratively divisions start to emerge within the survivors largely along gender lines the women the majority begin to side with the enigmatic mrs grant while the men align themselves with mr hardie grace our narrator seems to hang back and observe which way the wind is blowing before committing herself with disastrous results to either side after three desperate weeks at sea the surviving passengers are rescued but grace and two other women are charged with murder for their actions this is a story about human nature and the instinct we have for self preservation and how far some people will go to ensure their own survival it questions how morality should fare under extreme pressure and examines through grace our own propensity for self deception despite the subject matter this is not an action packed or sensationalised story and rogan has avoided the temptation to dwell on depictions of the horrors experienced on the lifeboat highly recommended for readers who like their fiction to stretch them a little and make them think what would i have done in that situation","927":"waited for a surprise a twist or an epiphany but it never came","928":" to set the stage it is 1914 and 39 people including our narrator grace are adrift in the atlantic in a life boat that was not designed to hold so many their provisions are scant and the possibility of imminent rescue is at best uncertain but for the reader this story actually begins some time later when grace our narrator is about to stand trial for her life in preparation for this grace must recall as much as possible about what happened on that lifeboat and when what follows is a captivating believable harrowing tale of survival imagine 39 separate personalities thrown together in uncomfortably cramped quarters quarters that brook little movement now colour them hungry thirsty and terrified for their loved ones whose fates are unknown colour them fighting both physically and psychologically for their very own lives imagine yourself and perhaps others you may or may not know in that boat stephen king says when it comes to the past everyone writes fiction i could not look away this is gasp and breathe superb storytelling i was also about to say that this is three for three but on second thought it is actually four and i am sure there will be more i'm talking of course about the number of excellent books that karen has led me to so it is then that with an outward sweep of my arms that i do bow down and say thank you","929":"wow i thought i was in for a hackneyed discussion but the nuances and relationships on the boat seemed raw a real and the book was hard to put down this book had a total alias grace vibe where you do something for survival and when you are no loner fighting for survival you are put on trial for it","930":"it was a decent book but not one i would rave about","931":"i was prepared for a life of pi like adventure tale with perhaps a legal spin what i got instead was a very dreary and dull account of uninteresting flat people in a lifeboat the whole story told through the eyes of a boring and not very believable character i skimmed the last half because i wanted to see if there was a twist awaiting me that would have made it worth it and there wasn't","932":"although my husband joked that the description sounded like titanic meets survivor i had higher hopes for the book sounded like an interesting premise but disappointed in final result","933":"real page turner phychology abounds and character development is great","934":"half the way through this book i was ready to write it off but i made it to the end and it made me reevaluate the final pages managed to give the rest of the book resonance the narrator is a mystery but ultimately she reveals enough to make you re think everything that's happened","935":"i'm not sure i liked it but i finished it only because i didn't understand why she was being convicted","936":"i'll be watching for more books by this author","937":"a compelling read but leaves some questions unanswered i guess that's to do with the way the story is told but i found it somewhat frustrating too many loose ends for me still an interesting look at human nature under pressure","938":" this story of survival of the fittest or smartest more manipulative type person was good it was a bit slow to get into but once the empress alexandra had sunk and they were actually in survival mode then it gained speed i was a bit miffed that the survivors were treated as they were and that they weren't allowed to go on and try to live their lives as though something bad had happened and they are now getting past it i think this book showed that strength shows up in many different ways in different people and to survive we all need to be accepting of that and to work with what we have i was a bit disappointed about the absence of sharks since they were out there for 21 days and were prey i know it was more of a psychological book but even one shark would've created a cool tense moment","939":"well written and interesting tale of survival in a life boat post a ship exploding and sinking two years after the titanic leads to a trial of three of the passengers in the life boat who should live who should die conundrum and a nice take on how women who in that era might be priority number one with children in getting into lifeboats were very much second in day to day life behind men here though the women especially a mrs grant refuse to obey those rules vis a vis cow towing to the men in the boat and herein lies the reason for their trial central character narrator is excellent as she is hard to fathom is she the innocent impressionable young ingenue bride or is she somewhat more sinister and is in fact an arch manipulator its an excellent read unlike the vessel it is ship shape","940":"grace has just married wealthy banker henry winter in london and how the two are making their way back to america to announce their news to his family it is 1914 and henry has booked passage on the empress alexandra en route to new york an explosion rocks the ship which suffers such catastrophic damage that there's no chance it isn't going down everyone must get themselves to lifeboats and quickly henry secures safe passage for grace aboard one of the boats being lowered into the water and that is the last she ever sees of him on board with nearly 40 other people grace and her fellow passengers soon realise their lifeboat is drastically overloaded and could sink in the rough choppy seas at any moment it seems that in order for some of them to live some of them must also die at first they can wait it out distributing the weight in the boat in ways that make it easier to stay afloat fortunately for them they have one of the ship's crew on board a man who knows about boats sailing direction and the weather but as the days pass by and their food and water dwindles and they drift further from the wreck it seems that rescue is less and less likely and that they may have to make some difficult decisions if they are to survive i requested the lifeboat from the library because of the cover which i find spectacular that moody sea and sky almost melding into one where you can't define where one ends and the other begins and dotted upon it a tiny boat with figures a lonely desolate scene that make me immediately want to read the book and see what happened to the people in the boat the book begins in 'present day' which is after grace has been rescued and now faces a jury to determine if she's a cold blooded murder and then takes us back to grace's time in the lifeboat a day at a time grace herself is an interesting character and whilst my sympathies should've been with her and her difficult situation she was a very cool remote woman and it was obvious she wore many hats played many roles and that made it hard to feel for her on a personal level she was a good observer but she was also skillful at manipulation and deception and at times i did wonder how reliable she was there's no doubt that she was clever the more we learn of her backstory the more this becomes apparent the lifeboat is essentially a story of moral dilemma what would you do in this situation are the actions taken justifiable there are nearly 40 people in the boat it's actually built for significantly less in the first few days when they are closer to the wreck and the weather fine they are able to negotiate this handicap quite well but when the weather changes and the wind whips up the swirling sea and sends huge waves into the boat it becomes apparent that they need to... lighten their load in some cases natural selection takes care of things for them but there are also cases in which it does not in the beginning although gossipy and occasionally argumentative most of the characters are calm and possess a firm belief that their lifeboat time is just a waiting game and that they will soon be rescued they have enough food and water for a few days their crew member is adept at catching fish out of the ocean a ship will come along and find them but as the days go by and there's no sign of any ships on the horizon and no sign of rescue at all the hopes begin to fade and the hysteria begins to rise the deconstruction of humanity is fascinating to read as the people in the boat squabble fight and threaten each other about who should be in charge who should live and who should sacrifice themselves for the greater good it's chilling the way that tragedy and impending death sends everyone immediately putting their own needs above all others and valuing their own lives a lot more than that of the lives around them with some people more than willing to back their needs up with the actions to make them come to pass it did make me wonder what i'd do in the same situation - would i lose my sanity as some of the more delicate ladies did would i be grace a remote observer staying on the downlow and playing the roles that she thought suited the situation best would i be clamouring for the men to sacrifice themselves to the sea so that the remaining women might have a chance to survive or would it be better to sacrifice the weaker women and keep the men who could be of some use i'm aware that back in 1914 it was the way for women and children into the boats first followed by elderly men etc and there was a different mindset back then but it still posed an interesting question i think that it's probably impossible to know just how you would react the situation being too difficult to replicate accurately in your mind charlotte rogan does an amazing job though of slowly whittling away at the peace in the boat raising suspicions and secrets until no one knows who they can trust to lead or who might be sabotaging people are bullied belittled one moment and soothed and comforted the next as the dynamics in the boat shift and change almost with the tides","941":"an interesting concept but it didn't grab my attention as much as i was hoping not a bad read but not enthralling either","942":"i was so excited to read this book based on the description it started off very strong but died quickly i thought the story was about survival on a lifeboat - but the history of its passengers distracted me from loving it gave up a third the way through... there's better fish in the sea for me pun intended","943":"interesting book but kind of strange","944":"anticlimactic i was waiting for this amazing story and it was a disappointment","945":"this is more a 3 1 2 stars book it definitely kept me reading i think the flow and pacing could have been better however i feel the author did a good job of depicting the personalities of the characters and the way people acted and reacted to their situation felt real i would be inlined to read a second book by charlotte this was a very good first novel","946":"good book by a new writer sorta of like a gothic mystery thriller","947":"i guess this is a good book for book clubs because there is so much to discuss each character on the lifeboat deals with the big question of survival in his or her own way and there are many open ended questions having said that i found this to be the most boring tale of survival at sea that i can imagine it seems like this would be somebody's type of book but disappointing to me","948":"this was a page turner for me until the last part of the book which i found kind of unsatisfying","949":"very good book it is fiction that feels like an account of a true event the ending was ambiguous which is annoying but other than that a very good read","950":"this is going to be a good one to discuss at book club grace's final comments to her psychiatrist sum up the feel of the book and the author's intent toward her readers if i had not felt so sorry for him i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know the book is told in first person from the perception of grace winters one of the few survivors not only of the original sinking of the ocean liner but also of the lifeboat i was left to wonder how reliable the perceptions of one person could be and am tantalized to puzzle over what parts of the story might be discovered if other perspectives were available is grace truly as innocent as her narrative makes her appear this is definitely an engaging book with the ability to pull the reader in and kept me quickly turning pages seeking for answers","951":"3 5 rounded down while an interesting and solid read i would not describe it as almost unbearably exciting you'll gulp it down in a single sitting like it states on the cover full review to come","952":"forced into an overcrowded lifeboat after a mysterious explosion on their trans atlantic ocean liner newly widowed grace winter battles the elements and her fellow survivors and remembers her husband henry who set his own safety aside to ensure grace's this book had a good storyline and started out well but petered out about 3 4 of the way through and ended lamely with a lot of philosophical prattle","953":" i was not as deeply enthralled by this book as i had hoped it is a very intriguing premise of course too many people adrift in a too small lifeboat can bring forth all kinds of human dilemmas and i was eager to read this book certainly parallels can be drawn with lord of the flies in the sense that the veneer of civilization runs pretty thin when faced with such extreme and punishing adversity but that book gripped me and this one not so much perhaps it is the voice of the narrator grace a newlywed separated from her husband when the ship they are on mysteriously explodes that does not reach me this story takes place in the summer of 1914 not long after the disaster of the titanic many of the book's questions and mysteries are left unanswered but many interesting questions regarding religion survival and ethical choices are raised","954":"very boring but could have been so interesting","955":"a gripping story of a lifeboat adrift at sea for weeks in 1914 the period detail was amazing and the characters adeptly drawn i found it fascinating","956":" up until about 3 4th the way through i'd planned to give the story a 4 rating however due to the weak ending i gave it 3 stars the relationships and characters revealed their basic nature when faced with starvation and death this alone makes it a good story and the author does a good job identifying different personas reacting according to their survival capability i was surprised though when the progression of the story skipped a major event and came back to it later on with such a weak storyline i was really expecting this event to be played up much more i still hope to read another book by rogan and hopefully she'll release one soon","957":"i bought this book based on the terrific ratings i saw however i was underwhelmed by both the story and the writing","958":"had to put this one down it started off great and then it just got boring i found myself wishing i were mowing the lawn instead which is not a good thing","959":"really enjoyed quite fast paced but also an easy read","960":" i debated between three and four stars i really enjoyed this book the ending less so i thought it fizzled out a bit at the end when an ocean liner sinks in 1914 some of the women and men find themselves in a lifeboat which is over capacity the choices they make in order to survive and the consequences they face are told by grace winter one of the survivors of the ship well written and fast moving just when you think you can't read about one more day aboard the lifeboat grace shifts to the present and the new predicament in which she finds herself definitely worth reading","961":"the ship grace was honeymooning on goes down henry makes sure she gets into a lifeboat with 30 others the story of her days in the lifeboat are the journal she creates as she stands trial for murder after being rescued","962":"i don't get it i'm afraid i feel like dr cole at the end of the book perhaps the authors reaction to me would be the same as grace's reaction to dr cole in the very last line of the book 'i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know'","963":" it's a pretty simple story the empress alexandra has sunk and there are 39 people afloat on an overcrowded lifeboat for 21 days three of the survivors are on trial for murder while the lifeboat passengers are mostly women the crew member in charge is a man and a real force our main character grace is a cool customer for sure she's a survivor in her life prior to her honeymoon on the cruise ship and she's certainly one after this novel was listed as one of the best reads for women published in the last five years i agree i thought it was great","964":"this book started out great and i was in to the novel until it went completely dead midway through i wish it had lived up to it's potential instead of losing steam and ending up at a very odd and unfulfilling ending","965":"i loved this book and won't forget it anytime soon it was entertaining haunting thought provoking and downright scary there were a few plot issues that were never resolved but unfortunately this was done intentionally the main character grace at one point teasingly acknowledges a fellow character's desire to know everything about her story and lets the reader know in no uncertain terms that that desire is going to have to go unfulfilled not cool ms rogan anyway read it","966":"22 year old grace winters never dreamed her life would turn out so well newly married to the rich and handsome henry winters she is now on a big beautiful ocean liner crossing the atlantic on her way to meet his family and on her way to a new and better life when a mysterious explosion causes the ship to sink grace is placed in a lifeboat secured by her husband along with 39 other people she can only believe that henry certainly found a way off the boat as well and they will meet again once they are safely back on dry land wherever that may be for three weeks they are adrift and a lot can happen when you are in a small boat that long with no privacy slowly as every once of dignity is stripped away the little food and water they have is gone one must look for other ways to survive a little over two years after the titanic comes the lifeboat sound a little familiar perhaps i will admit on this the 100th anniversary since the titanic sunk i was intrigued by a book that took on a similar story line around the same time frame as titanic while titanic was in 1912 this is 1914 the story line starts after they are rescued in the first opening lines you learn that grace is now in new york she has just survived this major trauma and she is on trial for murder interesting plot line you bet i listened to this on audio and enjoyed the retelling by grace as she looked back over what had happened the weeks before from the time she was placed into the lifeboat alongside an assortment of men and women of various backgrounds status and age including one man mr hardie who is the only member of the ship's crew what ensues over the three weeks is what i can only describe as the slow breaking down of the human mind three weeks is a long time to be in any kind of boat let alone a life boat designed for 40 people and as time goes on everyone involved would agree 40 people was way too many so what does happen in three weeks that i can not tell you i can tell you that grace's narration is sometimes vague sometimes left me feeling that there were more holes in her story than in the ship this could be credited to either poor character development or the brilliance of an author who has decided that over developing characters in this situation would have come across as false i will let you be the judge of that would i recommend the lifeboat fans ugh that seems like a harsh word of titanic like tales i believe will walk away with something positive out of this book but don't expect to be blown away while a good story i personally was looking for something more","967":"reminded me of the 1940s movie lifeboat but i have only a vague recollection of that film the narrator was excellent and faultlessly took me through the story in an entertaining way the subject matter is quite thought provoking what would i do what would you dd@phila","968":"i liked the way the book opened with the main character on trial for murder after surviving 22 days in a lifeboat then we gradually found out about her life and what happened on the boat however i ended the story not really understanding the main character's motivations and beliefs and i found that frustrating","969":"it was ok the situation was frightening and sometimes well evoked narrator is complex indeed but to me not that interesting","970":"couldn't put it down read the last 90% of this book all in one sitting insightful loved the language and the people felt real and fully formed to me shades and shades of meaning the ending left me a little lost which is i suppose fitting","971":"an ocean liner traveling from england to the u s sinks midway across the ocean 39 people are in a lifeboat built to hold quite a few less their ordeal is told by grace one of the passengers the story is riveting in the first 3 4 of the book i felt the author lost the string of things towards the end but a good read i was caught up in the passengers' struggles to survive","972":" goodness this book was grim it starts out in prison where a young woman is charged with murder she was in a lifeboat on the atlantic on the outbreak of world war i her ship blew up the story is told through her reconstructed diary of the ordeal as encouraged to write by her lawyer so you're getting one person's viewpoint a person who was traumatized by the explosion and the loss of her new husband and the death and destruction of the wreck wracked with starvation and thirst and psychologically battered by the dynamics of the crowded lifeboat yet you wonder what really happened is what she is saying the truth i like that she was an ambiguous character strong and not giving in to peer pressure not bowed by her family's bankruptcy and loss of fortune yet cloyingly attached to a possibly cold hearted husband the wet and the cold and the gray of the waters off the outer banks the swells and storm and endless horizon it was a dismal picture and a dreadful experience but still kind of an interesting book","973":"devoured this at the beach last summer and was thrilled my buddy caroline is a fast enough reader to buzz through it too and discuss it with me by the pool it's a great beach read for english majors well written to satisfy my thirst for language but fast moving and just complex enough felt like a very appropriate read for the centennial of the titanic's sinking","974":" this book isn't an easy one to review because in a general sense it's an effective case study in human nature when intensely tragic and dangerous circumstances rear their heads however looking at it in terms of the protagonist and her story specifically things take a disappointing turn for the reader beginning with the positive side of things the book truly does make you think about human nature and what actions you would be willing to take under the direst of circumstances when you're operating almost solely under the basest of instincts i e survival decisions are made as events unfold that may seem to be less than ideal even horrifying but the story begs the question of the lengths to which a person will go when his her life is on the line and priorities and perceptions become so radically altered and skewed social conventions and mores and even the concepts of right and wrong fall by the wayside as survival of the fittest comes to the fore though it is not always comfortable to read and can in fact be quite disturbing it does provide ample food for thought and it is this aspect of the story that makes the book a page turner unfortunately when the scope changes from the general to the specific things begin to fall apart the protagonist grace is not someone who in my view is particularly likable she manages to embody a personality that is by turns manipulative and frustratingly passive she is self centered easily annoyed sometimes even coldly mean spirited and frequently exhibits a tendency to be overly judgmental she is also not the most reliable of narrators as she all too often qualifies her recollections by stating that things may or may not have happened in just that way or she may or may not have said exactly that further as other reviewers have pointed out she reveals events and raises questions that all too often don't go anywhere and or are never satisfactorily addressed or answered regardless of whether these things are loose threads or red herrings it's aggravating to be made to wonder about so many actions statements and perceptions only to find that they are summarily dropped finally for those readers who prize things like character development you won't be able to find that here the characters are actually little more than plot point driven caricatures the reader is never made privy to any of their motivations or why some of their personalities change with much frequency as for grace herself she is an infuriatingly static character she simply does not change at all much less grow as a person so if you're a demanding reader one who favors well executed plots finely drawn characters who respond appropriately to the events in their lives and grow and change as a result and a decided lack of plot holes you may want to avoid this one however i would say that the general premise of what happens on the lifeboat and how it challenges one's convictions and morality makes the book worth a read","975":"this was a tough book to read initially as was filled with anxiety and fear trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean after the sinking of a ship i thought the author did a great job describing the character's personalities as well as the human condition in the aftermath and during the need for survival no donner party incidents but similar situations in which the characters react in ways they might not normally in attempts at survival the main character grace was multi faceted and makes for a great book group discussion","976":" rather boring dragged on and on as other reviewers have mentioned character development is basically nonexistent i actually wished it was more of a fight for survival story but the actual narration of the 21 days on the boat were somehow glazed over in 200 some pages i was looking forward to an adventure story but this read like an elementary school textbook author goes into a lot of detail about the sunset the ocean the sky etc the fact that the author attempts to inject the subplot of the main character being on trial for murder seemed way out of left field to me nope did not like this one at all","977":"very fast read","978":"not the best book i ever read but i was stuck reading it on vacation i can't fully recommend it","979":"i enjoyed reading this book but was hoping for a better ending","980":"really compelling the last part got a bit sloggy but overall a really exciting book","981":"i've always been intrigued by the titanic so when i was told this book is set around that same time and is also about a luxury liner sinking my interest was piqued it is a good read although i really was never quite sure what it was leading up to and i could never quite decide if grace was an innocent victim or a great manipulator until the end you'll have to be the judge when you read it it's short so it could be done on a good beach day","982":"i didn't know what at all to expect with this novel and was really surprised at the gravity of it's message when a ship sinks we are left to focus on the occupants of lifeboat 14 and the anarchy that eventually befalls them if i could sum it up easily i would say it is lord of the flies in a lifeboat","983":"i liked this book four stars interesting read easy read makes you think cool approach to the way the author presented the story in the three distinct parts would probably read another book by rogan","984":"interesting concept what is the right thing to do in an extreme circumstance the story in the lifeboat was mostly interesting and well developed it lacked a beginning though i think this was deliberate the latter bits in time the after really didn't work for me too many who what where when left missing i guess the point is she was an unreliable narrator but it's actually a little too subtle good book just missing a little bit more bite for my tastes","985":"the premise for this book holds a lot of promise lost at sea overcrowded boat crazy sailor on board it could have been an action packed thriller instead it was the most boring survivor story i've ever read i kept hoping for an exciting climax but no the only murder that definitely took place was that of a potentially great plotline","986":"a strange book but one that made me think how would i respond to several weeks in a lifeboat","987":"this was an interesting read but the ending was just ok it was kind of like watching a whole movie that held your interest but then just ends and you're left thinking what was the point","988":"i liked the interaction between characters good story make you question how you would react if you were stranded on a lifeboat for 23 days with strangers it was a bit slow at times","989":"disappointing whilst a page turner and read in couple of days really did not like or care for any of the characters not sure if it was intentional but characters were not developed sufficiently for me some interesting moral dilemmas but because relationships were not developed this meant i did not really care who got thrown over","990":"well i've enjoyed this weakened a bit at the end but it's a wonderful exploration of survival weakness and morals at a period when people where challenging stuff like god gender class etc when the balance of power was being about to be blown away by world war one wanted to push mrs grant into the sea though","991":"i admire the author's adroit weaving of several themes into this compact tale of shipwreck and survival on the literal level it is a simple narrative of a harrowing experience on the ocean and in the legal system as the first chapter begins at the end in jail and in the courtroom it isn't a spoiler to say so on an existential level it is an exploration of the human capacity for self deception power taken and relinquished the psychological and economical condition of women in 1910 and the monumental effort to understand ones own motives intellectually it is 5 stars but i've rated it 4 stars because it is a work of fiction that did not move me emotionally","992":"best work of fiction that i have read in a long time interesting little story of shipwreck survivors in a lifeboat","993":"i did not enjoy this as much as i was expecting to the premise of what happens on a lifeboat adrift in the atlantic ocean was interesting to me but i found the main character grace way too passive and the rest of the cast of characters one dimensional","994":"i'm going to leave it others to tell you what this book is about the story is about pretty much what it says on the box a lifeboat i was really into this like paver's 'dark matter' it was building up all this claustrophobia but then somewhere over half way the narrative became flat and i was wondering if i was reading a different book anyway i finished reading this and had to read other people's take on it before i realised it was supposed to be ambiguous looking back on the events of the story yeah okay i can see it but i have to admit at the time of reading it i was wondering if anything was actually going on however i do remember the narrator grace making all these passing remarks just casually slipped and so small that for me there just wasn't enough to feel that ambiguity because it was a really good read for the first half of the novel it gets 3 stars from me","995":"i don't know what to think of this novel my expectations were high and i am sorry to say that they were not met the story is fascinating but i don't feel involved with it it could have been so good but in its present form it is just okay","996":"a real let down i found myself reading on purely because i was convinced that something amazing must be about to happen or to uncover a twist in the tale no such luck bland boring unconvincing and one dimensional not good","997":"if you want to know what it would be like to be on a lifeboat this book will give you a good idea i liked it i was glad to finish and move on to something else","998":"flat i felt it was lifeless with a great deal left to assume and if you want me to make assumptions give me something to work with it would lend itself well to the stage and will have book clubs analyzing to no end","999":" who could have thought that three weeks being stranded in a lifeboat with forty others going nowhere could be so absolutely riveting and engrossing surely you remember as a youngster doing one of those ethical problems where the world is about to end there are only spaces for say eight people to survive to carry on the future of the human race but there are twelve people vying for places the priest the farmer the young woman in her twenties the doctor the teacher the musician the writer the athlete the artist and so on how do you choose one over the other who is going to make the greatest contribution to human survival reading this book is much like that youthful exercise in the 100th year since the sinking of the titanic it is hardly surprising that stories of sinking ships are being written from the very first few pages we know that grace is on trial as a party to murder of some of the people she shared a lifeboat with after their cruise ship unexpectedly sank we also quickly find out that she is very recently married and very probably now widowed as a result of the explosion on the ship that resulted in the survivors adrift in lifeboats somewhere in the atlantic in this boat there are a mixture of men and women young and old strong and weak those you suspect are going to be survivors and those you suspect you won't last the distance as in any situation where strangers are thrust together the leaders very quickly emerge alliances are formed conflicts develop and have to be resolved grace as narrator is determined to survive three weeks stuck in a lifeboat limited food limited water sun heat severe storm it is hardly surprising those on the boat precariously walk the edge of reason including grace as well as being an account of such a terrible ordeal this book is more a psychological thriller grace constantly moves between reality and illusion delusion in her personal struggle for survival we never really know if she was party to a murder because she never really knows herself after all how would we behave in such a desperate situation and this perhaps is why this book is so good the author taps so strongly into our need to survive at all costs and makes us face up to our own mortality right to the end grace knows what she needs to do to ensure her own future and she never deviates from that one of the strengths of this book is the author's ability to write about life at sea she comes from a family with a strong boating sailing background and it shows in her writing her descriptions of the boredom the power of a storm at sea the isolation and vulnerability are very powerfully depicted this is a real page turner of a book but don't read this while contemplating a day out boating or a cruise","1000":"i really liked the concept for this story but it didn't quite hit the mark i did enjoy reading it up to the end it fell flat many issues were unresolved","1001":"3 5the premise keeps you reading turning the pages oh for the love of plot which has been back in my life lately she doesn't quite have the skillz to really pull it off and it doesn't make me admire what she tried less it just makes me admire writers who really can add depth to good ideas it's not in the details the biggest weakness was the lack of concrete detail you didn't feel the salt or the water or the waves just the human behaviour and deceit","1002":"i struggled to get through this book while the premise of the story was interesting there were too many characters to keep track of and the time on the actual lifeboat dragged on i found the end of the story about the trial the most interesting part of the book","1003":"this is an interesting read that i will be discussing in my book worms book club today it should make for a great discussion a definite what do i think i would do in all honesty as with so many things in life we don't really know unless the situation is actually presented to us if i was in a lifeboat fighting for survival i hope i would act honorably but would i","1004":" 39 people are stranded in a lifeboat after a ship explodes just on the cusp of wwi the story is told from the point of view of grace a newlywed now a widow there is a crew member who takes command vs an older dominant woman who challenges him for leadership and the rest make aliances it ends up being a fight for survival to the death the story is told by grace who is on trial for murder after they are rescued grace is more complicated than she lets on and we can see how she can manipulate situations for her own benefit pretty good book i thought","1005":"had high hopes for this starting out but as it progressed i liked the main character less and less wondered when it would all end and not because of the human suffering in the boat did not like the many loose ends that seemed to just be forgotten or ignored","1006":"a wonderful debut novel from charlotte rogan it's 1914 grace winters is in an overcrowded lifeboat following the sinking of a trans atlantic liner the inevitable tensions and fight for survival make for a tense but thoughtful tale of human frailty","1007":"was an interesting read i was curious to find out what was going to happen but had to force myself to read lower so i'd remember what happened when our book club met there were lots of unanswered questions but i think that's really how life turns out","1008":"a good book different and would be a good book club choice as it raises questions about survival","1009":"great book it was so different from my usually fare but very enjoyable","1010":"3 5 stars by no means a perfect novel but an impressive debut by charlotte rogan","1011":"i liked the story but the writing was a bit boring","1012":"this was an ok book i feel like it could have been so much more","1013":"i loved this book i looked forward to each time i could pick it up again i found the story captivating and the author's writing to be great it kept me enthrall end throughout i did find the end to be a little rushed and full of too much activity though overall the book was well worth the time to read","1014":" this was a good quick read i listened to the audiobook during my commutes to work it examines the microcosms of human society and how justice morality and self preservation break down when the what would you do if becomes what will you do next two years after the sinking of the titanic a steamship goes down in the middle of the atlantic stranding 39 people in a lifeboat equipped for less and the struggle towards land and life begins the book alternates between the main character's recounting of the 21 days spent in the lifeboat and the present day as she faces trial with several other lifeboat occupants for actions taken while at sea it was a good study on the human nature and the lengths one will go to in order to ensure safety and ultimately the rest of one's life","1015":"suggested by oprah's book editor i found myself flying through the pages of this book to see what would happen on the next day on the lifeboat while there were almost 40 people on the lifeboat i do think the author could have developed some of the characters more which would have added more to the story in my opinion but overall a good and quick read","1016":"no matter what anyone says grace should have been locked up too on the other hand how can anyone be held accountable fire their actions after spending 21 days at seas with little or no water and food exposure and shock 1914 was a scary time","1017":"really a horror novel masquerading as historical fiction i loved it","1018":"didn't finish lost interest","1019":"just as much as i disliked the particular sadness of lemon cake i liked the lifeboat it begins with a good mystery why is the main character on trial after being in a lifeboat for 20 days good story good characters and very well written one of the few books i have read recently where i had to read every single word","1020":"i'd actually give this a 3 1 2 quick and easy read which i always like","1021":" this was a pretty good book the language gets a little confusing at points and i found myself rereading some passages but overall i liked it view spoiler grace seems like a gold digger though even though she says she ends up falling in love with henry she orginally went to him because he was rich and getting remarried right after henry dies without meeting henry's family first to a laywer weird but on the lifeboat she sounds better just a little snappy like when she told mary ann it would be easy to jump over why not go yourself don't tell another person to hide spoiler","1022":"i enjoyed this book as i was reading it but it wasn't fantastic","1023":"i was really hoping grace would eventually fall into the ocean but that never happened","1024":"this was a great book good writing and well fleshed out characters","1025":"an excellent quick read i read it in 24 hours and enjoyed it very much liked the flashback method of the storytelling and the main character grace for a first novel this was extremely well written and thought provoking hope she writes more","1026":"overall it wasn't awful it did show the different personalities that emerge while on a lifeboat someone has to take charge and inevitably someone resents it the writing was simple but easy to follow","1027":"an amazing start one of the best first chapters i have ever read just bored me so much after that see more deailed review on my bloghttp bleachhouselibray blogspot ie","1028":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a good story however how did civilization find out about hardie and why not be charged in the death of the others who were manipulated when their lottery was drawn is the other two women were convicted how did grace get away when she had involvement","1029":"3 5 stars is really what i'd give this book if allowed i actually found it enjoyable it didn't blow me away but it was easy to read and the story line and characters were interesting enough to make you either like or dislike them i enjoyed the parallels between life on the boat and real life and enjoyed the realizations of the heroine didn't blow me away but worth reading for sure","1030":" recommended by barb s debut novelist rogan sets the reader on a perilous journey along with the main character grace winter in the summer of 1914 newlywed grace age 22 and her husband henry are on a luxury ocean liner in the atlantic when a mysterious explosion causes the vessel to sink henry secures grace a seat on an overcrowded lifeboat as the story begins you learn that grace now a widow is on trial for her life along with two other lifeboat survivors as part of her defense strategy grace's attorneys have her write an account of her harrowing days in the lifeboat the forces of nature and the complexities of human nature are revealed this is an excellent novel with many underlying moral issues this novel is on the list of \"21 books from the last 5 years that every woman should read\" huffington post may 19 2015http www huffingtonpost com 2015 05","1031":"3 5 i don't know i feel very conflicted about this book the mc wasn't very likable but the writing was good","1032":"yet another book i had high hopes for and once again i saw my hopes sink faster than the titanic or the empress alexandra i found it intriguing at the start and was able to look past the fact that 60% of it seemed to be a rip off of the 1957 film abandon ship at a certain point it seemed the author ran out of new ways to have the characters spew the same dialogue i do think it would have been more apt to say that the characters were dying of thirst instead of saying they were starving to death you cannot starve to death in 3 weeks or what have you unless you are scary thin to begin with or have some kind of disease people on month long water fasts eat nothing and they are not typically found to be dying in 30 days the courtroom scenes were headache inducing at the end i didn't have a single care to give about any of it","1033":"good but i still have questions and i need answers","1034":"although an interesting read i was somewhat disappointed in the never ending introspection of life family love faith morality judgment blah blah blah i guess i'm more of a pragmatic guy who would like more details of those events such as the actual sinking the rescue the trial and issues leading up to them why was a trial even necessary did someone make official legal charges or accusations what evidence was produced granted most of the book covers endless days of survival and what else is there to do but be introspective hey if that's your thing this is the book for you","1035":" i finished reading the lifeboat last night upon finishing i wanted to talk with someone else who had read the book now i just want to move on to the next read i am strangely unaffected by this novel i don't like it but i don't dislike it it is just a book that i read and am now leaving behind the characters are easily forgettable the writing is not resonating with me and i do not think that i will actively look for another book by this author it might be a good read to recommend to patrons but i think i would suggest martel's life of pi first","1036":"this is a relatively short book just 274 i found the plot to be a bit slow moving at times but otherwise a good read","1037":"i was looking forward to reading the lifeboat and had high expectations of the intriguing concept of 39 people stuck in a lifeboat for 21 days grace the protagonist made it onto the boat and the daily events and her companions various strengths and flaws is told from her viewpoint although the onset of the book held my interest as the story unfolded the characters didn't do anything for me and i was willing them to all jump in the cold atlantic sea on the whole i found the book a tedious repetitive chore that left me cold","1038":"the dynamics of human relationships both good and bad played out in a lifeboat good story","1039":"meh not a bad book but nothing special i was absorbed enough while reading it but at the end finished and moved on without a second thought it leaves no lasting imppression but is not an unpleasant way to spend the afternoon","1040":"my review is here","1041":"the ending was far better than the rest of the book it took some pushing to force myself to finish it as the narrator didn't much interest me and many of the other character seemed relatively one sided but it was well written and it was interesting to read strictly from the point of view of the narrator her opinions were questionable at times which left you to wonder what was actually going on throughout the story which was curious","1042":"3 5 stars i've been wanting to read this book for quite some time but when i borrowed a copy from the library mr pingwing read it first when he was finished i was so eager to read this that i got through the book in a single day it's not a big book it was fun to talk about a book we'd both read here is the summary from the kobo store grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying grace and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize has exceeded capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it i loved the premise and since i recently read the raft another stranded at sea tale that i really enjoyed i was very much looking forward to this book what was equally intriguing and frustrating about this book was that grace was an unreliable narrator because i knew from the outset that she was on trial and that she was recounting many of the events on the lifeboat with the understanding that someone was going to be reading it i was skeptical of some of what was said and i felt very sure that much most of what grace recounted was done in such a way to show herself in a better light with an aim to exonerate herself from any charges maybe that's why i felt that some elements of grace's story were introduced but never fully explained or forgotten about altogether it felt at times as though i was trying to put together a puzzle that was missing some pieces but every time i had a complaint about the story e g not spending more time talking about the deaths of some people on the lifeboat i wondered if those incidents were addressed so briefly because that's exactly how grace wanted it giving any more detail might not have been in her best interest given her present circumstances it is also entirely possible that grace was not being as manipulative as i thought she was - perhaps it was an effect of the events on the ocean liner and then on the lifeboat that made her unable to recall certain moments i had to keep reminding myself that she was without much if any food water shelter etc and that it was just as likely that rather than manipulating the reader she was being as honest as she could be and that gaps in her memory could be attributed to the trauma both physical and emotional that anyone in her position would have experienced slight spoilers - skip this paragraph if you don't want them there were other things that i wish i had been able to learn more about e g what caused the boat to sink what was grace doing when she learned the boat was sinking what happened to henry what about the gold on board what was the true relationship between blake and hardie did henry pay for grace's place on the lifeboat did grace play any part in mary ann's death etc but i felt able to piece together some of those answers although i would certainly love to hear what other readers thought end of spoilers as i said though since all information the reader got was filtered in a sense by grace i felt that i was only able to know the things that she wanted me to know as perhaps an extension of grace's narration i never felt that i really connected with the characters in this book while there were some people on the lifeboat who were more prominent people in grace's tale there were an awful lot of them who i couldn't really tell apart from the others keeping in mind though that there were 39 characters on the lifeboat therefore the deaths of many of these characters didn't particularly touch or affect me and it seemed to me that these deaths for the most part didn't seem to have much impact on grace if grace didn't feel any connection to many of these other passengers i didn't expect myself to either since i was 'seeing' events through grace's eyes for all my complaints though i thought the book was very well written and once i started reading i couldn't put it down there are other things i haven't touched on charlotte's life pre lifeboat her relationship with henry whether she was dependent on others for survival or whether she was someone who could help herself that i find myself still thinking about and i plan to spend some time checking out other reviews and discussions to see what other readers thought and how they reacted to this book i would definitely be interested in reading something else by charlotte rogan i believe this is her debut novel and i recommend this to fans of historical fiction survival stories or people who like complex narrators from www pingwings ca","1043":"story was interesting hated the main character but it wasn't what i expected when i started to read it","1044":"read it in a couple days was a quick read but a crappy book","1045":"while this survival story certainly kept my interest it didn't leave me with much to think about at the end","1046":"a bit grueling didn't much care for our heroine grace very sly that one and found the story overall tedious","1047":" this story is part survival story part murder mystery - sort of the narrator grace is a survivor from a cross continent shipwreck but at the start of the novel we learn that she is to go to trial for murder listening to her recount the nearly two weeks that she and almost thirty others at least at the beginning there are thirty lived on a rescue boat from the sunken ship we wonder where this murder comes in as for me i wondered if there was truly a murder at all or if it was a judgment in how this group managed to make it through so much time on not enough food or water i enjoyed trying to determine if grace was a reliable narrator or not and while i enjoyed her observation of communications and relationships amongst key characters on the lifeboat i was ultimately a little bit let down in how the story unfolded towards the end this was a story that kept me fairly interested but in the end did not quite pull off a denouement to keep it a memorable one","1048":" i did not like it at all the incidents in the lifeboat were boring nothing was happening there was no climax in the story grace was a horrible character at the end of the book she is supposed to have gone through a transformation but honestly i saw none also i can not understand why anyone would want to get rid of the only person in the boat who knew anything about surviving at sea how the hell mrs grant managed the mutiny is beyond me the only interest i found was in grace's past that we partially saw at times what happened with henry and why his mother shows herself at the end smiling at her how she changed her mind about her what the hell happened with the trial we never find out who blamed grace and the others for murder this book is so all over the place that at times it makes no sense at all","1049":"this book sucked me in much like the unforgiving sea pulling the bodies of the deceased beneath its surface really enjoyed the lifeboat i was surprised that i did not like the narrator grace at all but had trouble putting her story down","1050":"it is a thriller with an age old question what would you do to survive and makes it feel fresh and riveting its the 1920s and a group of survivors from a ship crash drift in a lifeboat as the days go by with no sign of rescue the passengers get increasingly desperate virtually all the action takes place in the lifeboat which keep the suspense tight and appropriately claustrophobic","1051":"not as good as i anticipated it to be","1052":"the lifeboat by charlotte rogan is a well written tense debut novel about 39 people in 1914 after the sinking of their ocean liner the empress alexandra too many people too little boat for way too many days these characters are truly at sea drifting away from their former selves and their humanity alliances form and life hangs in the balance as they try to survive day after brutal day a page turner of the literary kind","1053":"probably should not have read this book just prior to leaving on a cruise","1054":"i didn't like the main character in this story i suppose she wasn't meant to be especially likeable but i find it hard to enjoy books with no likeable characters i was glad to get to the end","1055":"intense and morally challenging it was difficult to put this book down a very good read","1056":"cant believe this book got such high ratings and is still climbing the charts yawn this challenged me to read it but thats it and in truth i kept reading cause of the high ratings i thought something significant was going to happen and it didnt yawn","1057":"i enjoyed this book thoroughly during the part that focused on life within the lifeboat this was brilliantly the courtroom stuff was less compelling for me and the protagonist's self reflection by the end left me unsatisfied","1058":"story of three women on trial for murder they were passengers on a ship that either wrecked or somehow exploded 1914 39 people get on a lifeboat and begin to 'survive' i enjoyed the book very much and was somewhat let down by the ending the writing was well done but i admit to getting confused with the characters would you push someone overboard to save yourself","1059":"loooooooooved this book very interesting a lot od wisdom in this book","1060":"i liked this enough to give it 3 5 stars if i could lots of thought provoking issuess","1061":"fast read good concept gritty book","1062":"after the ship's explosion too many people find themselves on a lifeboat tough choices are made when the boat is damaged and cannot hold everyone should any of the survivors be held accountable","1063":"the first half of the book was pretty good the second half jumped around from present to past too much for me","1064":"this book was a compelling character study but a little dry in some spots","1065":" compelling short novel you will feel the waves the cruel sun the drenched salty clothing you will also live through the choices made to survive as seen through the eyes of one of the survivors and if not truly accept them at least understand how they came to be the survivor whose point of view is the focus of this novel is a survivor in many senses i will be thinking of how choices made have ripples throughout one's life and a book that makes you think about choices like that is a book to recommend","1066":" i felt this book did not live up to its potential and i attribute this mainly to the poor writing involved with the main character grace she was so horribly characterized that she came off as a sort of bland sociopath who didn't care for or about others beyond serving her own purposes but also a wasn't willing to act on her coldness making for a quite boring book in my honest opinion the author did try very hard to make grace appear completely ambivalent in regards to all situations that required her to take a side and this was a massive mistake life boat would have 10x more compelling if grace had had an actual spine but she didn't she was just a simpering self involved bore i think the premise should have revolved around secondary character hannah who was much more layered and complex i love survival fiction and am often disappointed in the lack of novels that focus on situations similar to the one presented here in life boat so was looking forward to reading this while i won't go as far as to say this was a waste of money it's hardly a novel i would highly recommend","1067":"although i did struggle to warm to the main character i was still bewitched by this book it takes a compelling 'what if' scenario and runs with it a haunting novel that makes you want to dig through archives and read all about real sea survival adventures spot on cover too","1068":"a good quick summer read","1069":"politics in a life boat while deaths happened right and left i expected suffering sun wind salt water storms hunger thirst to be the key emotion for these poor souls nope they were too busy scheming allying soothing bailing not believable the author did do a fabulous job with the voice of the self focused simpleton main character however","1070":" the classic moral delemma who gets thrown off the lifeboat and who gets to stay this is the premise of charlotte rogan's first novel set after the sinking of the titanic we never know what causes the transatlantic ship to explode and sink on its way to boston grace winter a new bride is the voice of the story and is put on trial for murder when they are finally rescued an excellent portrayal of what can happen to ordinary folks under extreme duress and the power ofstrong personalities to take over the weak should make for interesting book club discussion","1071":"grace is a character you won't soon forget is she manipulative innocent naive good bad smart independent or dependent the power struggle is fascinating especially from the narrator's point of view a very good read and exceptionally thought provoking","1072":"i was really disappointed i had high hopes for the story lines the writer and my love for this book but was sadly rushing through it just wanting it to end there were far too many characters that just seemed to pop up and not contribute anything i didnt connect with anyone not even grace i felt that the descriptiveness were focused on the wrong details and it was dragged out for the first 3 4s only to be rushed at the end not a good end to 2012 good start to 2013 reading list","1073":"i've got a soft spot for stories set in rafts and lifeboats but i'm deducting a star from this smart debut for its unsatisfying ending","1074":"slow read didn't ring true characters dull under developed at times boring","1075":" while i enjoyed reading this book i didn't love it i don't even know if i really liked it it was difficult to connect to the main character and i found it difficult to connect with the story that might be because i have never been stranded in a lifeboat but i had a hard time believing parts of the story the main character wanted to get married so she wouldn't have to work and she picked a wealthy man and he was already engaged but he married the main character and then something happened on the ship i don't know maybe parts of the story are meant to be ambiguous because the characters don't know or understand some of the things that happened to them but if there was a point or purpose to the ambiguity i missed it an interesting read but i will leave it at that","1076":"could have been more interesting too stream of consciousness for me the characters are kind of unlikable but not fleshed out enough to make them interesting it dragged at many points i finished it but didn't really love it all","1077":"the lifeboat begins with a prologue grace is on trial and when she leaves the courthouse at lunch with the lawyers it is raining the reader is introduced to a flashback of day 10 in the lifeboat when it rained and this is our first intimation of the trauma endured by herself and fellow lifeboat passengers her actions in the rain lead the lawyers to conclude that grace may be able to please insanity they ask her to write an account of her time in the lifeboat grace is our narrator during the days and nights and the aftermath that occurs after rescue as the days progress we not only spend time alongside grace but we also find out more about her backstory and how she came to be on the empress alexandra straight away the passengers form themselves into roles - roles we would expect in a team situation that depends on skills and knowledge for survival those of a like mind collaborate and the women remembering the time period the story is set in are either weak or strong there are two warring leaders which adds conflict to the already tense situation on the first day in amongst the wreckage heartbreaking decisions are made by the leader that not all passengers agree with there are several poignant moments as the days progress the isolation amplifies everything with grace reading the timbre and conviction in voices to make judgements everyday things are given meaning out of proportion to reality introspection leads grace to consider things about herself and to question the natural world and religion the fear and then euphoria of survival is replaced by hope of rescue and then as they grow weaker grace accepts that the lifeboat is her life all the way through we know grace is on trial for something but it is not until day 14 that we find out the tragedy that led to this conviction this intrigue makes you want to turn the pages to find out what could possibly have been worse than the privations all the passengers endured grace's account of being in prison time spent with the psychiatrist and where her life may lead afterwards gives the final structure to the story the writing style and rhythm suits the story perfectly there is more intrigue with how grace managed to be on this lifeboat and questions about the gold on board the empress alexandra i'm still trying to work out my own theories the lifeboat fascinated me as i love to look below the surface grace is such a resilient character with hidden resources and depths we know she has manipulated events in her past which made me wonder just how honest she was being in her recounting of the tragedy it's our experiences in life that colour our perceptions of the world and for grace having had a secure childhood then family disaster and now the shipwreck we watch as she once again modifies her beliefs in the epilogue the lifeboat is a testament to the complexities of human nature and existence in all its layers it lays bare just how far we are prepared to go to secure our own survival the truths we think we know and those we are willing to accept i have no hesitation in recommending this debut novel for your reading list i would like to thank the publishers for providing a copy in exchange for an honest review","1078":"i couldn't put it down","1079":" audiobook as i read more and more of this book i thought it was alternately a thriller at sea an agatha christie type mystery at sea a legal drama or a book whose entire storyline is turned on its head by a shocking revelation in the last chapter she was the murderer the whole time etc now that i'm finished i realize that it was kinda just a story there is a central conflict but gosh darn it if it's not clear what that central conflict is nay was until the book is almost over i have so many unanswered questions what caused the ship to sink what did henry give mr hardy to take grace on the lifeboat what was in that box did mr hardy survive what was all that nonsense about the marconi not working was henry telling the truth when he said he sent the telegram don't try to tell me these points don't matter when you harp on them as many times as the narrator did during the course of this book they do matter regardless of the intent of the author add this to the list of i should have picked out a related wikipedia article and read that instead books the lusitania one will do nicely i think","1080":"super intense it gave me lots to think about","1081":"great character study what really happened","1082":"good suspenseful somehow not great but it is a worthwhile read","1083":"psychological survival god helps those who help themselves","1084":"i was very disappointed in this book it sounded like it would be exciting a lifeboat full of survivors of a passenger ship during the titanic era which caught on fire actually it was about as exciting as watching paint dry the book takes the reader through 21 days of the trails and tribulations of the passengers but at such a boring low level that the reader keeps waiting for something interesting to happen after the rescue we suffer through a court trail interspersed with grace the main character talking to a therapist about her experiences the ending leaves the reader hanging with no real since of closure","1085":"painful read with few moments of engaging excitement","1086":"really quick read interesting plot","1087":"this book did not live up to my expectations i never grew to like the main character i did find some of the observations about gender at the beginning of the 20th century to be interesting and that so much of the novel is ultimately shrouded in mystery that isn't resolved is at once realistic but frustrating all in all though not terribly gripping","1088":"was more impressed with the premise of the story than the actual telling of it fell a little flat in keeping my interest ad the main character was forgettable bummer","1089":"i enjoyed it felt pretty forced and a little predictable but its well written and the sense of time place and motive carries the reader with it","1090":"some interesting exploration of human nature what makes a leader the intersection of the struggle for power and the struggle to survive it was often slow and ambiguous but i think that was by design","1091":"the opening of the lifeboat is definitely an attention grabber the prologue is set in the future with grace winter alive and somewhat safe although the reader knows she survived the harrowing events on the lifeboat it's also very apparent that something serious went down on that boat why because she and some other folks are on trial for what happened in the boat now you have to read the whole book to know what happened on lifeboat 14 more than anything the lifeboat is about what people become when their survival is on the line just like in a dystopia hardships bring out both the best and worst in people some will sacrifice themselves to save others some destroy others to save themselves perhaps even when it's unnecessary all of the people on the lifeboat are victims of circumstance they were on a ship and that ship sunk leaving them stranded with limited resources on an overcrowded lifeboat all alone and surrounded by people they don't know or trust what is it acceptable to do to ensure one's survival in such a circumstance do crimes committed in the name of the survival of the group count when back in the real world for me the lifeboat was a good but not an outstanding read largely because i could not connect to grace's character she is indecisive and reliant upon the strength of men however the ethical questions were certainly fascinating","1092":"great book club choice lots to discuss","1093":" i read the book very quickly and enjoyed it as i read it and then i got to the end and i thought huh just huh it left me with no other thought except a certain neutral feeling that i was glad that was over and i could read the next book this was how one of the reviews of this book began in thinking about a review myself i was so undecided about what i wanted to say that i did what i rarely do check other people's reviews before i write my own this was pretty much it for me also i found the main character grace full of anything but grace1 scheming manipulative deluded and entirely unpleasant though the portrayal was a little insipid to evoke such strong statements other characters could have been explored more deeply in some way to fill it out they were all just a bit flat and one dimensional the whole thing was a little psychodrama that was pretty shallow all round when the context might have provided much more at times i felt that the level of angst approximated that of a slightly boring cocktail party not really up or out there as the situation portrayed might suggest great idea just didn't quite get there","1094":"when the ocean liner 'empress alexandra' sinks panic ensues and everyone desperately tries to scramble for safety the relief the passengers undergo when they realise they have secured a seat in the sanctuary of lifeboat 14 is encountered with mixed emotion with loved ones missing and the fear of uncertainty as to whether they will ever reach land looms over the overcrowded lifeboat the nightmare however does not end when some of the voyagers arrive home a very haunting story i could feel the cold chill of the sea and death lurking in every wave","1095":"life and death decisions about people on a lifeboat from the early 1900's disturbing","1096":"i found this book very interesting and a fast book to read under 300 pages it keeps you hooked from the start i would like to say more about it but it is our next book club discussion book and some of the club members might see my review i will need to post more after the club meeting in april","1097":"a good book that leaves behind a lot of thinking who would i be in the boat who would i like to be you have to take in the facts of the time 1914 to understand the mindsets of the people in the boat the end of the book drug a little because of all the intospection but it was necessary","1098":" meh it was just alright about halfway through i started to skip and skim paragraphs as the days on the boat were running together and i honestly didn't care which characters survived the whole thing was a bit too claustrophobic for my tastes i know that's the point but a great writer can make life in a box interesting see room put this way back when life of pi came out i resisted reading it despite rave reviews because the confined setting sounded like a bore i ended up loving it but this book reminds me of what i thought life of pi would have been had it not lived up to the hype","1099":" this was a fast gripping read it's 274 pages in paperback and i read it in three days i've always loved survival tales and this is a good exploration as to what happens to human nature in the face of possible life and death there were some similarities to other books i've read and liked unbroken and the reader but generally it was a good story of a disaster at sea and the group dynamics that occur when you have 39 people on a 23 foot boat the leader who emerges john hardie is an interesting character as are the two women who become his adversaries hannah west and ursula grant the protaganist is grace winter a newly married 22 year old woman who has married up to a young man of means set in the early 1900's she portrays a woman who is looking for a secure standing in the world after losing her parents to unfortunate circumstances i think charlotte rogan does a good job with character development which draws you deeper into this book i would recommend it as a good book to bring on an airplane or beach during your vacation","1100":"a well thought out story of a group of survivors on a lifeboat and the questions of life and death that they encounter daily","1101":"this could have been so good","1102":"grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat grace spends 21 days in the lifeboat before rescue comes when they reach land she is accused of murder and a trial takes place","1103":"an ok book story moved at a good pace but you felt there is more going on than what the author reveals","1104":"tedious but very suspenseful","1105":" the cover is breathtaking i must have stared at it for ages before actually opening the book another thing i quite liked about the cover is that it hinted at what the story would be about and the cover gave out so many emotions with it eeriness loneliness struggle - and this just added to my eagerness to read it set at the start of the first world war he story opens with 22 year old grace winters having lunch with her lawyers we quickly learn that she is currently standing trial for events that happened during three weeks in a lifeboat after the empress alexandra a liner on the way from europe to new york sinks in the middle of the ocean the lawyers encourage grace to write a diary of what went on during those weeks out at sea and what follows next is grace's account of her time in the lifeboat wow that is how i would sum up this book - wow this is one of the most thought provoking books i have read this year and it is fascinating from grace's first words all the way through until the very end i was gripped i could not put this book down and even when i had to stop reading to cook the dinner my mind was buzzing with so many questions would they be rescued shortly after with 39 people in one tiny boat what would happen would there be disagreements mutiny what would they do for food would all of them get out alive or would a few be lost along the way this book would be perfect for book clubs reading groups reading with your friends because as soon as you have finished the book you will definitely want someone to discuss it with there are so many parts where opinions will be divided or scenes that are so thought provoking and trust me you will need to talk to someone about this book i particularly loved that the book was written in a diary form it made me feel so much more involved with what was happening it reminded me very much of celia rees \"witch child\" which is also written in a diary style and if you haven't read it then i really would recommend that also the writing style really helped me connect emotionally with grace i felt i understood her better as i had an insight into her personal thoughts and feelings and i must admit i liked her from the start even throughout the story there are a few moments where perhaps grace's choices and motives could be questioned but even so i liked her for who she was to me she represented a real woman in a real situation who was trying to make the best of what she had and overall she just wanted to survive the characters are really what makes this book so fantastic the story is literally set within the lifeboat for most of the book but don't let that put you off at all the characters more than make up for it as we learn about each characters actions and words through grace's account leaving us as readers to work out what their motives are and whether or not we should trust them i won't name any so not to give away any of my own personal thoughts about them as when you read the book you will come up with your own opinions there are some very strong characters in the boat and it quickly becomes apparent who the weaker people are and it is riveting to read grace's tale of the scenes being played out between the characters what happens when there are disagreements what alliances may be forming and what hidden agendas and motives some of them may have the lifeboat is a complex and gripping story about what lengths a group of people will go to when they are fighting for survival it is thought provoking - throughout the book i was constantly contemplating what i would be doing or how would i be acting if i was in their shoes and desperately needed to survive the lifeboat is intense it is truly terrifying and it will have you on the edge of your seat desperate to know who if any make it out alive this is definitely one of my favourite books that i have read this year i cannot fault a single piece of the book a brilliantly written book and i can not wait for charlotte rogan's future releases","1106":"ugh kept waiting for something exciting to happen but all my hopes just drown in the sea along with the boring annoying characters","1107":"emma donoghue's blurb notes that she read this book in one go i read it in two 3 1 2 stars giving it 4 because of how it grabbed my attention and held it","1108":"not the usual book i read during 1914 grace is crossing the atlantic with her new husband their boat sinks and she is on a life boat with 38 other people not her husband not all survive","1109":"i enjoyed the book until the ending rather than matching the fleshed out chapters of the time spent in the lifeboat the ending seemed to be more of an outline","1110":"i read this after reading the hunt and the prey by abdrew fukuda fictional novels that are the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of style i found it dull slow and boring i think it would be great as the basis of a philosophical debate but i certainly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is reading purely for pleasure disappointing and could have been told in half the number of pages","1111":"first i enjoyed the story i read it rather quickly as i continuously wanted to learn more of what happened to them but i found much of the story to be a bit too wordy i skimmed over a lot of paragraphs i had to go back several times to remind myself of who was who normally i wouldn't have continued reading a book that i felt that way about but the story line kept me reading","1112":"the first 30 pages of the book were really good then it stopped being good","1113":"this story didn't really grab me i think because if the number of characters and the lack of any real climax","1114":" i wafted between 3 and 4 stars with this book but it is sthg i'd recommend to others so i'm giving it 4 it's very well written and tight it's got a lot of moral issues as people are crowded into this lifeboat that's too crowded and if some are to survive some need to jump or get thrown out the protagonist is this woman who narrates and yet you are never quite sure if she's someone who is just a victim or whether she's a shrewd schemer sometimes i found some of the plot not believable which was my main criticism but overall it was very interesting","1115":"many layers and great foreshadowing make lifeboat a complex and suspenseful read","1116":"how much value do we place on one's life an absolute thriller i was skeptical at first because the blurb made it sound like this was a ripoff of the titanic disaster it wasn't so at all an absolute thriller","1117":"started slow but got moving not far in a very interesting main character i was not sure what to think of her for most of the book even now i am conflicted as to if i like her or not overall a good read","1118":"this book had so much potential great premise of a bunch of people on an over crowded life boat following a titanic era trans atlantic boat sinking to do the story justice the book needed to be about 100 pages longer would have lent itself to better development of more of the characters and better tying up of lots of loose plot lines to be fair lots of people in my book club liked it more than i did","1119":"i agree with the reviews that found the book interesting and then the ending just was a bit damp","1120":" this is an incredible story more so because you are never quite sure about the main character and her motives or lack of motives i spent most of my time reading this short book trying to figure out if i liked grace and wanted her to survive or if i distrusted her and did not care if she survived the story is remarkably detailed and at times you can get bogged down but really that is just because you want to know what happens this would be a great book club book especially if people in the club took different characters to follow their time before during and for some after the lifeboat","1121":"it's an intriguing concept and i wanted to like the book more than i did maybe because i didn't find grace to be a particularly sympathetic heroine and i don't think she was meant to be you know she survives the ordeal in the lifeboat but the majority of the book where every day is described in detail left me thinking when are they ever going to get off this $ ing boat the middle dragged on a bit too much for me","1122":" a fantastic premise for a novel having read and loved life of pi this became my 'must have' book as soon as i had heard about it set in 1914 just before the outbreak of war and pre emancipation it is a fascinating insight into how polite society quickly breaks down when it becomes survival of the fittest should individual lives be sacrificed to save the majority grace is a 22 year old newly wed just widowed a woman whose family have hit hard times and who is determined to chose her own destiny and not become a lowly governess like her sister when her honeymoon is ended by the sinking of the ship grace finds herself on a lifeboat of 39 predominantly women we follow one story with life on the boat as it becomes clear that rescue is not imminent and alternatively leap forward to where grace and 2 others are about to face trial for murder there are power struggles secrets misdirection sacrifice and ultimately murder this is a tense novel made increasingly so as the members realise that the boat is overloaded and that some may need to make way if the rest are to survive does the end justify the means grace is an unreliable narrator and as we learn more of her we discover she has hidden depths and is not perhaps the innocent bride we had at first taken her for for me this makes the novel far more interesting there are some unanswered question what was it with the small box what happened to blake's boat did grace's husband bribe hardie and perhaps just in my imagination but is there a question mark over grace and maryann so if you enjoy novels where you are left with perhaps as many questions as answers and everything is not wrapped up with a tidy bow then this is the book for you definately a book to make you think about the bigger issues and ultimately can any of us really ever know what we would be willing to do a gripping read","1123":"but wouldn't you want to live anyway i asked astonished by his vehemence don't you want to live for yourself so asks 22 year old grace winter of mr preston who sits beside her in an overcrowded lifeboat after the princess alexandra sinks in the atlantic ocean it is 1914 and grace finds herself suddenly both newlywed and widow adrift and waiting for rescue in charlotte rogan's the lifeboat but when the hardtack is gone and the drinking water run dry the days wear on with neither land nor salvation in sight a strange and mysterious separation emerges between passengers with the will to live and lead at any price and those made weak or noble by their circumstances this menacing rift swells and dangerously divides the passengers from the only person among us who knew anything about boats and currents and the boiling sea a tension of opposing forces builds to one of the few decisive acts that grace will take in her young life to preserve her chances in the lifeboat any choice will be a terrible one leaving many questions unanswered that no doctor's analysis or judgment day could ever resolve a dark and masterful meditation on power guilt sacrifice and survival","1124":" 'i wondered not for the first time if some of life's tragedy arose when people put themselves in situations they were not by nature suited for 'it is 1914 and newly married grace winter aged 22 and her wealthy husband henry are on board the empress alexandra and destined for new york having set sail from liverpool then tragedy strikes the ship in the form of an explosion and in the chaos that ensues henry secures a place for grace on one of the lifeboats being launched primarily through journal entries which are made retrospectively at the behest of her lawyers whilst she is imprisoned awaiting trial grace recounts to us her memories of the twenty one days she spent on board lifeboat 14 which left the ill fated empress alexandra carrying 39 people the tumultuous relationships that ensue between those on board the lifeboat are gradually revealed to us there is one crew member from the ship on board the lifeboat mr hardie who seems to naturally take charge of them at first after all 'he knew about this world of water ' the passengers on the lifeboat at first hope to 'preserve civility' however the diverse personalities on board the lifeboat don't remain calm and compliant for long though and there are numerous clashes and disagreements as the people realise the severity of their situation on the open seas and the terrible decisions that will have to be made as the lifeboat is clearly over capacity grace was a first class passenger on board the ship enjoying all the luxuries that such a status offered to her she recalls dining at the captain's table where the talk was of war amongst the men and of weddings amongst the women grace recollects how she met henry and how she might otherwise have had a very different destiny had she not married him as she reveals her background to us and the sadness that lies therein this is a compelling story which had me wondering what would happen to grace and how life on the lifeboat would change over the days those on board spent on it i wondered how reliable a narrator grace is and what would befall her how do people behave under such physical and psychological strain enduring such a terrifying ordeal on the surface this is a story of tragedy and survival but it goes deeper and explores human nature memory and morality and it leaves you with much to ponder another read for me from the waterstones 11 selection for 2012 and another impressive debut","1125":"i liked this book i really enjoyed the way the story jumped from the lifeboat story to the background story of the main character","1126":"a good premise but ultimately disappointing","1127":" an easy book to read the story rarely bogs down the descriptions are efficient the characters are interesting this story could have gotten bogged down with extraneous information but that does not happen the reader gets enough back story slowly revealed to create a picture but not too much so that the interest stays piqued and curiousity pulls the reader along the story is framed by the present court case which again reveals enough but never too much this would make an excellent book club read or a comparative read with life of pi because both books ask questions about life death religion or worldview and how people deal with very challenging circumstances","1128":"it reminded me of life of pi but not quite as good","1129":"a good first effort","1130":"ugh so disappointing what started off as an interesting and compelling read left me with more questions than answers i absolutely cannot stand stories that introduce a mystery suspicious box secret conversations covert relationships just to name a few and leave it unsolved i believe this story would have been much better were it told from the point of view of multiple people in the lifeboat","1131":"kept my interest but probably because i've spent a lot of time on the water","1132":"was almost too embarrassed to admit i'd read this drivel great marketing terrible book","1133":"it was alright kept me interested as i read very titanic esque only focusing on the survivors in an overpacked lifeboat didn't love the ending so much and sometimes that weighs into my liking of the whole book it passed the time but wasn't life changing","1134":"i am truly enjoying this book for the simple adventure that it is the character development is not extensive but you get the idea with the constant and simple repetition of the names by our main protagonist this is truly a lovely novel about lost love","1135":" i enjoyed the sense of foreboding and tension on the lifeboat as the days passed and the way the story was constructed so the truth is gradually revealed grace is an unreliable narrator however and there was a certain amount of unsolved mystery surrounding the events which took place i didn't mind that but i was disappointed with the ending i don't think the characters were fully developed and there were lots of them to remember i also didn't quite 'get' the relationship between the three main women i enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second not a bad read but i was a little disappointed when i finished as it didn't quite live up to expectations","1136":"i am still pondering how innocent grace really was i found her personality complex and wonder if she used her beauty and innocence to her advantage it took me awhile to read it but i did finish and glad i did in the end i realized grace was really very smart and turned every situation to her advantage","1137":"part psychological thriller part historical drama doesn't matter you won't put it down it is actually a very simple story wrapped up in very complex questions not an easy thing to pull off it will leave you thinking about dark side of what one is willing to do to survive how far you would go to save your own life","1138":"didn't like a single character in this book it did make me think about whether or not i could maintain my humanity if my life was on the line answer probably not","1139":"this story of people thrown together on a tiny lifeboat struggling to survive set around the time of the titanic sinking was fascinating to me at first the narrative voice a wily young woman determined to survive is extremely consistent and strong the plot gave out at the end for me when the focus shifted to a court case a differently structured ending might have elevated this story from good to great","1140":"like 'survivor' on a boat great writing and suspenseful storytelling","1141":"interesting adventure story descriptive","1142":"may have set my expectations a little high the jacket read wonderfully the book itself fell a little flat for me i didn't relate to any of the characters the style of the language seemed too contemporary for the setting which was distracting and the ending was disappointing i believe that this was the author's debut novel i would try something by rogan again just probably wouldn't rush out for it like i did with this","1143":" i read this book for a book club i found it interesting and an easy read the premise of what it's like to survive a ship catastrophe and then have to survive the lifeboat was very plausible especially for the period in which the story is set it is a narrative on human nature and the will to survive seen through the eyes of a young woman it has suspense that unfolds in a unique manner the writing of a journal and glimpses of character's present situation worth reading and somewhat timely if you follow titanic history and wonder what the period between iceberg and rescue may have felt like for the survivors","1144":"this book was a bit of a surprise to me i really liked the way it was written with a lot of foreshadowing and flashbacks i also like the perspective of the main female charter in the early 1900's the book was something that was a bit different and well written","1145":" this slender novel about strangers in a lifeboat after their transatlantic ship sinks really captivated me the main character grace winter is returning to new york on her honeymoon and becomes separated from her husband and put in the lifeboat after an explosion this is very much about survival but is also a psychological study of human nature as first food then water become scarce charlotte rogan writes beautifully appearing to capture the feelings of the survivors as they wait for rescue or perhaps death","1146":"the story was good and the writing wasn't bad but i got the impression that she could have done so much more with it than she did the protagonist i found quite well written in that i didn't like her at all but at the same time she had the right sort of voice to be narrating with i can't put my finger on why i didn't love it i was just not pulled in it took me a week to read which is ridiculously long given it's only round about 300 pages and i had no problem putting it down in the middle of a chapter and continuing at some later point it wasn't as utterly engulfing as i feel it could have been but the characters were very vivid and hateful enough to keep me reading just to know who would die next overall i'd recommend this to someone who doesn't have a lot of free time it's fairly good to just carry around and open up when you're waiting in line or on the underground but not a i have got to finish this now type of book really","1147":"this book got good reviews but i had a hard time getting into it","1148":"quick riveting read but stressful i felt like i was trapped on the lifeboat","1149":"confusing left me blah","1150":"this could have been awesome the idea was great delivery not so much i heard the voice of an exhausted weak survivor telling the story but that made it dry i think revealing what happened not a retell would have been so much better for me more show not tell in the writing i loved the plot's idea but the characters and writing style fell short","1151":"really stunning great anti heroine","1152":"excellent book hard to put down","1153":"wow don't start this one unless you have time to read it straight through it is mesmerizing grace a newlywed finds herself escaping a doomed passenger liner in an overcrowded lifeboat under the direction of a mysterious crewman and shared by a disparate group of virtual strangers over the next two weeks characters are tested and the passengers are stripped down to their core as they attempt to survive at sea incredible novel highly recommend","1154":"needed cannibalism","1155":" i loved this book in the beginning and could not put it down it was fascinating to read the main character's observation of the horrific events that were happening around her babies being thrown overboard as the ocean liner sank desperate people trying to climb into the lifeboat and being beaten away with oars occupants of the lifeboat desperate to know the fate of their loved ones who did not make it onto the lifeboat etc however as it went on i began to feel sort of removed from the narrator as if she was keeping the reader at arm's length i realize this was probably intentional as we are not supposed to believe everything the narrator says as she has an agenda in re telling her recollection of the events on the lifeboat i still found the distance between myself and the narrator to be an impediment to truly enjoying the book the story also started to drag as time went on these people were in the lifeboat for weeks so it makes sense there weren't a whole lot of events to write about but still i found the story dragged unnecessarily the ending wasn't anything spectacular this book had a ton of potential and i feel it fell a little short it was still worthwhile to read for anyone interested in the titanic and that time period in history","1156":"the beginning and middle of this was very interesting and i read it quickly the ending kind of bored me but all in all worth a read","1157":"loved this held my interest from the very beginning very well written as well","1158":"this book by charlotte rogan makes one think of the stories about survivors of the titanic only the group in this lifeboat is not rescued for a very long time it is a microcosm of the world at large with bullies and those who are willing to be bullied people who lack self esteem and those who have too much self esteem underdog types and leaders it makes one think a lot about what you would do yourself if put in the situation of the survivors in the boat","1159":"with such an enticing back cover summary i expected more from this book i didn't feel pulled into the writing and i never developed a feeling towards grace neither pity admiration or dislike i actually felt like the author was chiding the audience with her last sentence because she clearly didn't answer many questions we're they married what was in the box why did it sink what was the story with blake etc it was well constructed but didn't wow me","1160":"did not read heard not so good","1161":"this book started out strong and seemed interesting it ended on a meh kind of note would have benefitted from a better editor maybe but i did read the whole thing","1162":"reminded me a lot of lord of the flies in its exploration of the ugly underside of human nature in the face of survival and brief absence of institutional justice","1163":"great but i didn't read it in just 1 sitting","1164":"this was an intriguing novel that kept me reading cover to cover great plot characters and tension fine writing i think the readers who gave this book less than 4 stars are probably fans of 'commercial' fiction and don't appreciate a classic work of literature a job well done and certainly the first of many fine works to come from this author","1165":"lost at sea 39 members of a lifeboat survive in the north atlantic on the cusp of wwi i enjoyed it for the social dynamics and the commentary on the role of women as leaders but taking it to my assisted living book group i found that i was the only one who read it from this point of view","1166":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a great debut novel the writing is good meaning it's vague on purpose at times as it's told by a survivor's viewpoint could i really trust what grace was writing was the truth or was it just something she was telling her attorney but my devious mind kept thinking grace was up to more than not remembering the truth for the 21 days on the lifeboat due to her not wanting to be a governess she purposely runs into henry a wealthy man whose engagement she reads in the newspaper and a few wee a great debut novel the writing is good meaning it's vague on purpose at times as it's told by a survivor's viewpoint could i really trust what grace was writing was the truth or was it just something she was telling her attorney but my devious mind kept thinking grace was up to more than not remembering the truth for the 21 days on the lifeboat due to her not wanting to be a governess she purposely runs into henry a wealthy man whose engagement she reads in the newspaper and a few weeks later is secretly married to him what if she really didn't marry him but just told people she had without her future mother in law's finances to pay for the attorney her fate would have been similiar to mrs grant and hannah or in any case she would have been penniless interesting how she got her next husband as well i suspect she and hardie forced their way into the lifeboat on their own and there was no henry paying for her seat on the boat after all why didn't henry also grab a seat on that boat since there were other men there and it wasn't a matter of women and children first i also suspect that the whining mary ann didn't have a natural death but then again maybe not more","1167":"tough when you don't really like the heroine","1168":"s collision with iceberg grace winter is simple young woman which has nothing interesting to say except the telling of the whole story we can see the rest of the passengers and their mind changes through her my expectations of this book were greater than what showed up later a story of a young lady who survived in a lifeboat with another about 39 passengers when transatlantic liner went under after unspecified explosion is set up at the beginning of the 20th century a few years after titanic's collision with iceberg grace winter is simple young woman which has nothing interesting to say except the telling of the whole story we can see the rest of the passengers and their mind changes through her eyes but it isn't as interesting as it seems yes all characters are very realistic but i miss some kind of freshness in her narration in conclusion for me that was a very good material with a chance to become bestseller but author missed the opportunity and did not utilize all the potential of a theme and that's a pity","1169":"grace is tossed to the fates in this book when the ship suddenly sinks and she scrambles into a life raft terror turns to questions and back to terror as she thinks about her life and about the very real probability that she will not survive what makes this book so interesting though in that reality is supplanted by perception as the days stretch over the boat's inhabitants there is not much to see or hear and not much energy to do anything or the firm belief that anything can change fate so perceptions of the real are subsumed in the perceptions of the possible the probable and by perceptions of others' perceptions the mind makes its own amusement thoughts build upon thoughts comments become reality perceptions become increasingly questionable actions are taken that make no sense grace is an interesting if possibly unreliable narrator making this book so much more complex than a simple narrative of a bunch of people on a boat","1170":"if you enjoy an unreliable narrator this is the book for you however it left me unclear on exactly what happened and disappointed that the more i got to know the narrator the less i liked her","1171":"the premise seemed interesting but i couldn't care less for the heroine narrator or the storytelling maybe i'm in one of those book slumps where i just hate everything","1172":"i will probably revisit this there's a lot going on here what a complex main character i'm not sure how i feel about her my recent lord of the flies read kept resurfaces in my mind grace are you a survivor because of your inner strength or selfishness","1173":"this was a good book but dealt with hard decisions that sometimes must be made for survival and then the consequences","1174":"this was an interesting read which would be fun to discuss with peeps i rather enjoyed reading it i was surprised happily at what was actually occurring on that boat pretty exciting but i would have hated writing it the inner struggle the not knowing what to do or what i would do the bleakness of it all and possible unjust would have been hard to put down on paper so kudos to the author for a pretty well written novel albeit not without some inconsistencies and perhaps some glossing over i kept thinking how seasick i would have been and would most likely have been the first to kick the bucket but fortunately my pluck would have kicked in and i would have been strong like grace","1175":"hmmmmm what would you do how would you handle being stranded in a lifeboat for weeks with almost no food or water what are the dynamics of forty people who don't know if they are to live or die that is what i thought about while reading the lifeboat extreme survivor","1176":"this book is good for discussion about topics of class difference in the sexes the will some people have to survive and the psychological effects of being stuck in such a small space under life and death circumstances the problem i had is that i could not relate with or empathize with any of the characters i just wanted them all to drown","1177":"this book was selected for my book club this book had potential but didn't live up to my expectations i prefer not to read books which switch back and forth from the past and present furthermore there were too many characters to follow in the book so by the time people started dying i just didn't care however i did love the main character's brutal honesty she didn't try to sugar coat her feelings about the other people in the boat her frame of mind was appropriate for the situation","1178":"if there were half stars i would have rated this book 3 1 2 stars it was a great read for a first time novelist","1179":"i thought this book got off to a slow start but ended up liking it more and more as i read be careful if you're reading on kindle mine sent me right into the first chapter but there's a prologue you ought to read first","1180":"waste of time there was no depth to the characters you don't really get to know them which makes it hard to care if they live or die you keep waiting for something to happen some excitement or action...and when the moment comes it is brief and make no sense","1181":"it was eh","1182":"interesting narrative strategy and makes you think about life death survival power struggles etc drug a little bit for me and i kept waiting for some exciting twist at the end that didn't happen","1183":"i liked the basic premise and the style of writing i did not like grace the narrator but i don't think you were supposed to like her i did want to find out more about how she trapped her husband and what happened with the in laws after she survived an interesting plot","1184":"meh i seem to be reading a lot of books lately that remind me of other books but that are not nearly as good as those other books this was one of those it's a similar premise to life of pi but nowhere nearly as well done unsatisfying","1185":" i'll be mulling over this story for awhile read in one sitting i was beginning to think such a thing was of the past yay that it's not a deceptively simple story whose moral dilemmas and unflinching inner debate revelatory struggles sometimes made my head spin due to a rigorous work schedule that's left me sleep deprived i felt an unsettling understanding of grace's automaton thinking actions and her doubts as to whether some things were said aloud or had occurred i cannot even begin to imagine throwing myself overboard to drown so others can live were these martyrs motivated by a conviction they would die irregardless this narrative had a lot to say question about societal norms and proscribed roles sadly i think a lot of the questions raised about choices free to women are still timely eg war on women's medical choices in uslike i said i'll be thinking about this book for awhile","1186":"what would you do if you were stranded on a lifeboat that was slowly sinking would you sacrifice yourself for the sake of the others would you tell others to sacrifice themselves should you be held accountable if when you're rescued such are the running themes to this little book which really isn't a little book after all","1187":"3 5 actually i liked the premise a lot and it moved quickly but the end was flat and unsatisfying","1188":"i am not sure why i didn't like this book more or read it quicker for that matter the basic story seemed interesting to me and i liked the 1st person narrative from grace but so little action it was sooo slow how did she and the other 2 women even get put on trial i must have missed that when i was skimming to get through the book then the story ends and i was left just thinking huh","1189":" interesting enough but i think this ground has been covered and better the psychiatrist being employed by the prison is not very likely as at this time psychiatry was a very new science so it seems to me to be a bit anachronistic i'm not sure how to think of grace she seems definitely to be very manipulative and almost sociopathic and still somehow i found myself hoping she would be acquitted overall an interesting read but i suspect that i'll be hard pressed to remember it in a year","1190":" the story of a sunken ship and 39 people that are lucky enough of to get into a lifeboat the lifeboat passengers see people drowning in the sea and asking for help but mr hardie the crew member that is in the lifeboat prevents them from helping anyone as the lifeboat is already overcrowded and trying to help other people could lead to their own death so they have to move on as they see a little kid is dying in the sea the story is narrated by a woman named grace that was recently married to a rich banker henry and was on her honeymoon with her new husband henry helps her get into the lifeboat when the ship was starting to sink but there is no room for himself and grace just hopes he will survive as well the passengers in the lifeboat now have to deal with storms starvation and no water to drink they remain hopeful somebody will rescue them but this takes more than three weeks during these three weeks lofts of events happen and you can see how human can do anything to survive two women mrs grant and hanna try to grab the power from mr hardie as they suspect mr hardie is hiding something and is compromising their safety for his own advantages so they ask the passengers to vote on who should be in charge in the boat mrs grant or mr hardie and if mrs grant wins they will throw mr hardie in the water grace is hesitant about this as she sees mr hardie as a powerful captain who has been very helpful in this situation so her vote is neutral in the end the resolution passes and mrs grant and hanna try to take mr hardie and throw him out of the boat they ask grace to help them and grace weak and scared moves through the boat and helps them in murdering hardie i would say i expect this kind of behavior from grace as she is the kind of character that wants to survive and cooperate with whoever has the power earlier in the book she tells the story of how she had seen henry's engagement news with some other girl in a newspaper and that he is very rich so she decides to try to meet him and make him fall in love with her maybe every human has an animal side that just wants to survive or wants to be powerful rich etc","1191":"the premise intrigued me but i disliked the execution everyone view spoiler except the two men who threw themselves off the lifeboat to save the others hide spoiler was despicable while i do think some horrendous human behavior would result from being stranded in a lifeboat i also think there could have been some beautiful human behavior as well reading all the grim with no light wasn't very enjoyable plus i hated the main character even before she committed the crime she was tried for view spoiler she was completely guilty and should have gone to prison in my opinion hide spoiler the other characters felt poorly sketched and i barely felt that i knew them overall this was a hard book to finish 2 stars","1192":"loved it to think this is what we may of gone through if we were stuck in a boat in that period of time with none of the emergency controls we have today but well written and a great story that you can not put down even if you had too","1193":"good gripping but somehow not as overwhelming as i kinda thought a lost at sea tale should be something about the style was odd... a bit anachronistic book's set in 1914 still the strains of feminism were appreciated","1194":"good book thought the ending needed more but overall worth the read","1195":"forget the hype you can admire all the great publicity this novel is getting but leave it at that i got pulled in by a great first chapter but it was downhill from there i couldn't wait to get off the lifeboat but that took well over 100 pages and my reward was a leaden trial told from the perspective of an irritating narrator who i was totally sick of by then i think that some of the book's claim to impressiveness is supposed to lie in the first person narrator's off putting selr absorption but too off putting for me well enough written to deserve two stars but give it a pass","1196":"based on a review copy from netgalley review originally posted here http irisonbooks com 2012 04 14 the in the summer of 1914 an ocean liner carrying newlyweds grace and henry across the atlantic to meet henry's family sinks grace manages to get on a lifeboat with the help of henry soon the rescued find out that although the lifeboats are said to have a capacity of 40 it cannot hold the 38 people on there here grace faces another three weeks of survival as for any of the survivors to live some must die at the beginning of the book the reader finds out that grace along with two other women that were on the lifeboat is on trial for murder on account of the weeks she spent on the lifeboat the story of grace's life on the boat is the account written from her personal memories that is to be used as evidence in court and so the lifeboat is not just the story of the horror of a shipwreck life on a lifeboat loss and the length humans will go to to survive although that is very much part of the novel instead it is the added layer of grace's narration that makes this book so fascinating grace is not exactly a trustworthy or likeable character she falls firmly in the category of unreliable narrators which the reader finds out throughout the novel as she leaves out details rewrites previously mentioned stories and repeatedly infers discussions about the nature of memories and remembrance as a reader you constantly need to readjust your image of grace and the events on the lifeboat is she an innocent girl or a master manipulator and what exactly happened all of it makes that reading the lifeboat is a fascinating experience but also a little creepy at times another element that i enjoyed is that the story of the power struggle between mrs grant and mr hardie a ship's crewman mirrors women's struggle for emancipation grace is caught up in the middle of this power struggle in which her decision to cast in her lot with one or the other might directly affect her chance of survival it is interesting that mrs grant and hannah hold on to their belief of equal rights for woman to such an extent that they may diminish their chances of surviving the trial grace is more calculating she seems to realise that while circumstances on the lifeboat with a higher ratio of women compared to men and its isolatedness from the world outside may have favoured mrs grant's influence from time to time back in the \"real world\" it are men who judge whether they are guilty or not so grace relents and wears feminine attire while hannah insists on wearing trousers unwilling to give in to convention but this does not mean that grace is not aware of what she is doing \"from the beginning the press and others were more sympathetic to me than they were to mrs grant and hannah who early on pointed this out saying 'let's be honest grace you're just innocent enough to get away with it ' whenever anyone tells you a thing like that you're bound to try to defend yourself and i responded that she and mrs grant were the ones who were playing to an audience by insisting on going so far against the grain of the public's expectations but eventually i had the realization that we all had to decide when to fight convention and when to accede to it and in that the three of us were not so different after all \"\"sometimes i wonder if they would have been incarcerated if mrs grant had been a man \"nor that she agrees with a subordinate position for women she is aware that women's chances of fair treatment are tied up with men's expectations and repeatedly reflects on her and women's position throughout the story grace's story and the story of her fellow passengers on the lifeboat is not just a story of how far humans are willing to go to survive but it is also a story of survival as a woman in a world that is defined by men highly recommended","1197":"overall i enjoyed this book it was an entertaining story despite the similarities to the titanic disaster","1198":"fantastic read a real page turner grace is an honest and believable character loved her attitude to the psychiatrist who tries to help her come to terms with her experiences but has way too much of his own baggage to be of any use","1199":"interesting but a bit slow","1200":"i enjoyed this book i guess i always wondered how someone could survive a shipwreck what makes some people survivors while others give up the writing wasn't anything to write home about but i liked the storyline the trial part of the book was pretty thought provoking","1201":"starts off with a good idea but the end is a little unsatisfying","1202":"actually i'd give this a 3 1 2 stars it probes the moral ethical issue of should lives be sacrificed to save the majority set before world war i and following an explosion that sinks their ship the passengers of a lone lifeboat deal with the life and death issues of survival their decisions end in three women on trial for their lives as the story of their days in the lifeboat unwind the reader is drawn into psychological questions which have no definitive answer kept me engaged throughout","1203":"i really was looking forward to this book but i struggled from the very beginning the idea of the story interested me but i'm afraid i couldn't warm to any of the characters i'm sorry that i continued to read it as i just didn't enjoy the experience","1204":"debut novelist rogan sets the reader on a perilous journey along with the main character grace winter aboard the luxury liner carrying newlywed grace age 22 and her husband henry a mysterious explosion causes the vessel to sink henry secures grace a seat on an overcrowded lifeboat as the story begins you learn that grace now a widow is on trial for her life a story which reveals the many layers of human nature","1205":"after a luxury liner sinks in 1914 the passengers of an overcrowded understocked lifeboat face dehydration starvation and mutiny a trial after they are rescued asks what is it acceptable to do to save your own life or the lives of the majority and does it make a difference if the choices are made by a man or a woman told by a narrator who it becomes obvious doesnt understand or doesnt realize things about her husband that may or may not have been instrumental in the ships sinking and even in her escape plenty to think about for a fairly short novel","1206":"this book really didn't have a point it was incredibly boring to me","1207":" i loved this book the novel is taken from the titanic disaster it takes place on board a lifeboat in 1914 after an ocean liner has sunk in the atlantic on its way to new york the main character grace has just recently been married and is returning to new york to meet her husband's family her husband never makes it on the lifeboat the story revolves around the people in the lifeboat how they survive day by day how they create a society within themselves etc there is a trial which weaves in and out of the story which is told in hindsight really exciting thought provoking and enjoyable","1208":"dreadful i think i'd rather die in the chilly water that to have to read this book again","1209":"a page turner it starts with a trial that we can't understand but it is evident that the heroine survived the perils of the lifeboat the rest of the story is the lifeboat experience how the time goes what relationships and attitudes develop","1210":"about s ship wreck in 1914 not long after the titanic sank 39 people get aboard a lifeboat making it too heavy tells how the passengers deal with the situation sometimes getting along and sometimes don't food and water runs out some make it and some do not ok but not as good as i thought it would be","1211":"the novel left me in a state of confusion as to what really happened on the lifeboat was grace guilty and calculating or simply innocent both sides can be argued with ease i picked up the novel because it reminded me of the novel the life of pi however it was nothing like it it lacked detail and emotion it was very psychological in some respects which took away from the entertaining factors of a reading experience","1212":"i really wanted to like this it has many elements that i enjoy but i just could not get into it it was really just one of those that i wanted to finish as soon as possible all the fuzzy morality that they were trying to explore just did not work in my opinion because it was so hard to connect to any of the characters they were all just so unlikable","1213":"i cannot make up my mind about this book while it did keep me turning the pages i really could not warm up to any of the characters it is told from the point of view of one person in the lifeboat perhaps some other voices would have added to the drama there has been a lot of hype about it and the author is speaking at my library book club so perhaps i will get a different take on it we shall see","1214":"the story initially kept me pretty captivated but as it progressed i felt more and more ambivalent towards grace by the end i wasn't really sure what to make of her or what i even wanted to happen","1215":"hmmmm i have to say that i could not wait to turn on my nook and read this book it was definitely a page turner the last 50 or so pages left me a bit flat maybe i wanted a few questions answered that were left intentionally vague what a horrific circumstance to find yourself in personalities change and reality is altered i would say 3 5 stars","1216":"fascinating and thought provoking","1217":" i was really looking forward to this book some high seas action and adventure characters to love and characters to despise and cheer for their demise but i was left feeling flat i really didn't know much about the characters on the lifeboat what they were doing on the empress alexandra nothing i felt like i was reading lord of the flies on the ocean at any minute a teacher was going to point to me and say what do you think the author meant by that ack i think it may be a good book for book clubs lots to discuss but not my cup of tea sorry","1218":"while it did hold my attention i felt unsatisfied at the end because of many unanswered questions i also thought it would have more to do with the trial than it actually did it did pose good questions about humanity and survival","1219":"one of the characters aptly puts the theme of this book beautifully when he say to the main character grace but you must admit that it is in lonely and challenging circumstances that our true natures show through as the reader you follow 40 survivors of the sunk empress alexandra as they await and hope for their rescue in lifeboat 14 a clever premise and well executed characters make this a consuming read i love books that force me to think about why people act the way they do","1220":"a boat sinks and there are not enough lifeboats for all of the passengers the boat that the narrator is on is over capacity so natural or more appropriately unnatural consequences ensue a good read and the first published book by charlotte rogan","1221":"i'm not sure why the media reviews on this prompted me to read it u0026amp i am not sure what i was expecting now that i finished it i am disapointed what should i have expected when the premise is people strandes on a lifeboat in the ocean some die few live and so forth if you are considering this book don't bother not much drama or plot twists the back and forth between the trial and the boat was tiring","1222":"not the page turner i wanted it to be it was ok but i was hoping for so much more it was lackluster could have had much more character development","1223":"sometimes i liked it sometimes i didn't it went from boring to confusing to intriguing there are quite a few topics i can't wait to bring up with the book club one thing is for sure as much as i always want to like the narrator especially since they are the only ones the reader is able to know the innermost thoughts of i could not like her","1224":"kind of life of pi lite an interesting way to delve into the 'what would i do' in the same scenario quandry a decent read but not a you must read this book a beach read happy summer","1225":"i listened to this on cd in the car on my recent trip to nj and really enjoyed it i definitely recommend particularly on cd","1226":" i read the book very quickly and enjoyed it as i read it and then i got to the end and i thought huh just huh it left me with no other thought except a certain neutral feeling that i was glad that was over and i could read the next book so is it enough for a book to be entertaining while you read it and then forgettable i guess that should be enough only this was ground that has been covered better before by alfred hitchcock but where alfred hitchcock's film is visceral and tense in this book because the narrator has every reason to hold things back from the reader there is a certain distance set up between her and the reader this narrative choice makes it hard to care about the story much beyond the time it takes to turn the pages to the end the climax in particular felt flat because of this distancing effect of the narrative voice in spite of these flaws i really admire the skill of this first time author and i hope she takes more chances with her next book which i plan to try","1227":"debated whether or not to give this a 3 or a 4 love the moral dilemmas faced and the discussion of what life really is like it just didn't grip me as much as i hoped","1228":"compelling story with great characters you love and hate all entrenched in a survival story aboard a small lifeboat first book for charlotte rogan well done read it in two days really less because i made myself put it down so that it would last longer","1229":"good different subject matter would be a pretty good discussion book not a quick read but i did find it thought provoking","1230":" thought provoking and intriguing this lifeboat takes you on an intense emotional journey i grew weary towards the end as did the characters but kept going to find out what had happened the delayed impact of the story took me by surprise the course of events on the boat was somewhat predictable as the author wisely avoided the trap of spicing up the tedium of being cast adrift by becoming too lurid but i foresee another reading sometime soon after all this is a demonstrably unreliable narrator though aren't all narrators unreliable the irony of her actions would be tragic if you felt more sympathy for her and yet isn't part of this lack of sympathy stemming from my desire to think myself morally better than she is so skilfully does the author place the reader personally at the very heart of the issue that drives the story i want to see what i think of this crew on a second reading after my subconscious has had at them for a while","1231":"i had high hopes for this novel and it did have moments where it provoked thought but mostly i was disappointed","1232":" i just finished this book last night if i had seen it at the library i may not have picked it up it's not really my genre but i have to say it was really very good the concept of the lifeboat as a metaphor for society was great i found the psychological drama very interesting and it made me consider many questions as i read that this was the main focus over the physicality of survival was preferable to me when where and how people loose site of civil society is a difficult topic to address without getting campy this was extremely well written and a thoughtful presentation of isolation and group dynamics grace was an interesting character who describes her own manipulation to marry and then how she becomes manipulated by mob politics i also liked how the beginning was much more clear matching her more alert physical and emotional status with the end where she drifts in and out of consciousness it seems well worth the read","1233":"did not love this read about 1 2 way through then skimmed the rest","1234":"this book got a lot of hype a few years ago and though it was good it wasn't as good as i expected it to be if half stars were an option i would give it 3 and 1 2 it never felt fully shaped i felt like there was a lot more the author could have done to flesh out the characters more i never felt like i knew henry or grace enough nor what happened after grace met her mother in law things just seemed unfinished in some ways","1235":" as the 40th passenger on lifeboat 14 i ultimately enjoyed the ride sure the premise sounds like a cliche from team building or english class but it develops into a legitimate novel not a page turner despite the blurb's claim but neither would 21 days adrift at sea be full of excitement i would imagine that our narrator is a slightly questionable mostly unquestioning young woman is perfect for the story which isn't about action and suspense at all or even ethics and morality she says in the opening chapter \"if i describe what was happening on the starboard side ... i of necessity give the impression that one thousand other dramas were not taking place in the turbulent waters to port and astern \"so if you haven't read this book pick it up for the promise of a small human drama dilemmas do include which passengers should \"volunteer\" to throw themselves overboard and whether to trust mr hardie or mrs grant but also predicaments i'd never thought about how to relieve one's bladder in mixed company at close quarters similarly many questions are answered such as when colonel marsh wonders why \"someone took the trouble to engrave capacity 40 persons into a plaque\" on the boat when it clearly can't take on even 39 but many other puzzles remain unsolved including the one in the blurb - no spoilers there surely ultimately these types of detail add realism to a story that's plausible but that one hopes never becomes reality","1236":" a horrifying story of a group of people adrift on a lifeboat after a ship sinks not long after the titanic's sinking the story moves painfully slowly through the trial of the main character a trial based on a murder on the lifeboat and then through the weeks of drifting with little water and food it takes great will power not to skim ahead to see what happens but it's worth the wait beautiful writing and a haunting existential main character who seems to drift through life grasping onto what is convenient or will solve a problem for her she's not likable but is unforgettable","1237":"the thought of surviving in a lifeboat after my cruise ship sank made me wonder what i would do to survive grace who is coming back to america is a newlywed and widow she is writing her story while on trial for murder her motto is god helps those who help themselves she proves this in how she met henry her husband and what she did on the lifeboat the ending leaves you wondering what all she did to survive both on the boat and now after the trial i liked that about the book because it made me think about how far some people will go to survive and how others will let fate decide","1238":"this book was fascinating but i would have preferred everything to be tied up a bit more","1239":"okay not sure why i finished this a little slow and boring for me","1240":"our library did this book as part of east of the river reads really good story well written many layered and well paced it was interesting how my attitude toward the protagonist changed as the story unfolded","1241":"this is a riveting book about 39 passengers on a lifeboat after their ship sinks and the personalities involved including the main character who along with 2 other women are arrested and go to trial afterwards i couldn't put it down","1242":"actually 3 1 2 stars great story with a unique point of view enjoyed this book a great deal","1243":"a book that i didn't enjoy while i was reading it but continued to think about a long time after","1244":"the lifeboatby charlotte roganin the summer of 1914 grace winter is on her way across the atlantic with her new husband to meet her new in laws though in the middle of the voyage there is a mysterious explosion that leaves the ship she was on at the bottom of the ocean with half of the lifeboats engulfed in flames people rush to the ones remaining only to realize that the plaque stating a capacity for forty passengers is a lie if they are to survive others must perish but how does one decide such a thing this was such an interesting novel it starts with a trial and you have no clue as to what the trial is for except that it had to do with the main character's time spent trapped on the lifeboat the events that occur during this book bring a strange light to the survival instinct the author manages to write a beautiful and terrifying novel without using ghosts or goblins but simple human behavior and survival instinct this is definitely an interesting read as the survivor's minds begin to become the true monster of this story the more immersed we become with the tale i just wish there had been more to the epilogue but that is simple greed on my part for more reviews be sure to visit my blogs at http reflectionsofabookworm wordpre http bookwormrflects8 blogspot com","1245":"i got almost to the middle of the book and still waiting for something to happen something that would keep my interest so far im not impressed just don't want to admit to myself yet that it wasn't the best choice interesting enough i guess a lot of potential that wasn't fully realized many questions left open","1246":"excellent book that gives you a lot to think about and how you would act in such a situation","1247":"wow ie my mind is still jumbled and i finished reading the lifeboat two days ago","1248":" the lifeboat is compelling shocking and extremely thought provoking the story is of survival at its most basic level it explores human nature and morality it shows what can happen to people who are are fighting to stay alive the novel is a psychological thriller with a complex and unreliable narrator i was left wondering if grace was telling the whole truth deliberate lies or re telling based on the effects that shock starvation and exhaustion had on her mind this novel poses some interesting moral questions if your survival was at stake how far would you go to ensure you were one of the last ones left standing a good book club discussion book","1249":"ever wonder what happened in the lifeboats between the lucky people that survived titanic check this book out it's not about titanic but a very similar disaster that is set 2 years after titanic sank the story focuses on drama and politics and survival inside the boat it was a very fun read and i enjoyed the story a lot i think i might enjoy this one more reading it a second time because my complaint was that many characters kind of blended together as they were vague so i didn't know who was important to the long term of the story while reading it still an enjoyable read with some twists along the way 3 5 stars overall","1250":" difficult to read because it was saturated with too many names and too many details of the lifeboat people's minute issues this one was a very slow read for me i had to take notes and mark pages until i was driven to distraction once i realized what i was doing and found i was reluctant to pick the book up to try to get through it i knew it wasn't one i could recommend to my readers sad to say because i really wanted to know how this one ended i however ended up skimming to find out eventually i have to give this book barely a 3 star rating not a strong recommendation to you at all unless you're into too many details that don't seem to matter in the larger picture while i can understand when a book needs to set the scene for us and to give some insight into characters so we get to know and understand their psychological make ups and spirits the lifeboat was just too drawn out and specific to be a good read charlotte rogan missed the mark in that her characters weren't interesting enough to keep a reader moving along i found myself thinking but i already know that about mrs grant she's bossy and over bearing i don't have to hear it ten times over she had me at hello but she lost me at about the 4th chapter am i being redundant see what i mean the premise of the story is a good one and had there been more of the meat of the story up front i would have loved this book it would have worked i think if the book had had more of a flip side that is if the ending had been more prevalent at the beginning of the book too bad her editor didn't suggest that or perhaps it was suggested and a struggle ensued at any rate it didn't work for me","1251":"i got this book off amazon and it looked like a great idea in theory however it was just plain boring i couldn't get into it and i am a huge titanic fan i didn't finish because i just couldn't care less about the characters that were stuck in a life boat together","1252":"what a terrific first novel by rogan when her ship goes down during an atlantic crossing in 1914 newlywed and now newly widowed grace winter finds herself in a lifeboat too small for its 39 passengers let alone those survivors trying to board it there's not enough food not enough water and the rescue that the one crew member aboard assures the others is imminent doesn't seem to be anywhere nearby flash forward some months and grace and two others are on trial for murder as she recounts her tale trying to make sense of the experience for both herself and her attorneys grace contemplates the events and the motivations that brought her to this point the novel is very compelling and a downright riveting tale","1253":"great book but i was expecting an ending with a twist like in the book life of pi it was still very good though","1254":"you can read my thoughts here 2 5 5","1255":"do not read this book if you are expecting a pot boiling page turner where the bad guys are the bad guys and the good guys are well the good guys 'the lifeboat' is a messy amoral not immoral allegory of life in all its complexity amplified by a situation in which every choice may save or end your life right and wrong survival and death all become relative depending on which character you experience it through grace the main character is a smoky glass whose resilience often seems at odds with her ambivalence about what is going on around her victim heroine scapegoat pawn like all the other characters in the book your judgement may be as much about what you bring to the book as what is in it happy reading","1256":"this is the third book i've read this year involving a sea rescue though it's the first fictional story on this topic i am impressed by the survivor minds these people had i am not at all surprised by the actions they took as times turned grim this book doesn't start with a shipwreck and doesn't end with rescue still with all those details the book never felt like it was too long it was just right","1257":"a good read which won't take you long to get through it isn't anywhere near as good as i wanted it to be or as good as the jacket blurb says it is some of the characters are thinner than the paper they are written on which makes caring about their fate a bit of a feat of the imagination","1258":" this was chosen for my book group of which there are six members unusually there was a consensus that this book failed to deliver on every level characterisation plot themes and emotion it was agreed that there was not one thing to commend this novel seeds of potential drama were not developed several threads remained unresolved and the writing itself was unremarkable overall this book was hugely disappointing and we didn't understand the hype the book will remain memorable for all the wrong reasons i'm also glad to note that many others have given this novel one star","1259":"this would be a great book discussion pick fast and intriguing great debut","1260":"my blog post about this book is at this link","1261":"i loved this book it was a good tale of how humans struggle between whats right and what they need to do to survive i even got it signed by the author at the hamilton friends of the library author reading }","1262":"i read this book after reading various articles giving it rave reviews i was thoroughly disappointed i found the book to be very slow and like some other readers relatively pointless i didn't care about any of the characters including the narrator grace i struggled till the end","1263":" originally posted on http ameliagroves wordpress comfrom the blurb this sounds like a magnificent book released in 2012 charlotte rogan's literary debut is probably one that people will have seen or heard of if not read yet the cover is strong the blurb is intriguing especially for those who enjoy psychological and survival based novels like myself and its setting - two years after the titanic sank - even manages to appeal to historians as well this is just one of those books that feels like a masterpiece before you've even started reading it and yet what often happens when a book hypes itself up this much the reader inevitably finds himself let down don't get me wrong this is a great book the concept is solid the narrator grace has a strong voice and the atmosphere created on the claustrophobic lifeboat is just as dark as it promises i was gripped from the second chapter once the lifeboat scenes kicked in properly and didn't find my attention or motivation to read faltering until near the end i greatly enjoyed reading about the time on the lifeboat and would have been happy to spend further time with it unfortunately once part iv hits the narrative gets a bit less interesting not only does grace abruptly end her lifeboat narrative and bring us into the present where she is being held in prison awaiting trial but we also find grace's words to be less full of the wonder and determination they were initially this of course is understandable considering the change in setting but here lies a promise if you have found the narrative uninteresting until now it won't get any better and if you have been finding the narrative interesting like i was then you may just get the rug pulled from under you there were a couple of niggly points that irritated me for one it's obviously part of the story that the lifeboat be so full of people but the limitations of grace's first person narrative means that half the time it seems that there are only a handful of people present the author seems to struggle with making the reader aware of exactly who is there and who even matters to the story there are a lot of characters that hardly do anything who don't even have any purpose when the end comes grace however names the lot of them - and that only adds to the confusion by the end you won't even remember who \"greta\" is let alone what happened with her on the boat finally it's unclear whether or not you're supposed to like grace but i for one was pretty fed up of her by the end she begins as quite a strong independent character but by the end she seems to be entirely void of any emotion or sentimentality this may be to do with the time period or it may be down to poor writing who knows in the end though i still feel the lifeboat is a strong book it may not live up to all expectations but it certainly kept me busy it personifies human survival very well and the first few chapters will leave you questioning your own humanity but it does leave a lot to be desired and doesn't quite earn 5 stars from me i will however be looking out for more from the author","1264":" i had high hopes for this book but it really disappointed it was unrealistic so much didn't make sense and the main character was completely unlikeable the book starts with the main character in jail but i never understood why she and the others were prosecuted in the first place the book vaguely hinted at some intriguing mysteries but doesn't go farther than hinting in fact at the end of the book the main character chides another character and thus the reader for wanting all the answers i get not revealing everything behind these mysteries in some cases but in this case it just made the book boring for a better book on somewhat the same subject try in harm's way the sinking of the u s s indianapolis and the extraordinary story of its survivors or life of pi","1265":"very interesting and well written society breaks down when stuck in a horrible situation and there are too many people for safety","1266":" i discovered this audiobook at the library and thought the synopsis sounded interesting it started out well but it just goes on and on the lenght of it could have been halved and it would still have had the impact there was repetition and it became too much trouble to keep listening to it i did not even get to the climax of the book what the whole thing is about i think they threw someone overboard and are on trial if the author had interspersed the two timelines more often it would have been a much more compelling listen it was instead frustrating even when i started skipping over parts","1267":"i just loved this book exquisitely written fast paced great twists and turns what a wonderful debut novel i will definitely read whatever else this author writes","1268":"an odd little psychological thriller that has you wondering what is the real story behind this grace character and her motivation for stealing her husband henry away from his fiance and improving her status financially and giving herself a new life different but just a thre star at most","1269":"creepily interesting","1270":"time would be better spent watching the alfred hitchcock movie lifeboat","1271":" i don't understand why this book was 1 so highly reviewed and 2 deemed a psychological thriller from the moment you know that grace is on trial it's pretty obvious the reason has to be for something major like murder the whole suspense of the book was extremely boring they did not develop any of the characters enough at all for you to relate to or even like any of them the details of being in the lifeboat were extremely boring the only reason i finished this book and gave it 2 stars was because i invested 3 weeks of my time in trying to get through it","1272":"don't read this if you are looking for an adventure survival story it's much more of aa really intense psychological study and not just of how people behave when facing possible death grace is a very complex and mostly unlikeable narrator but her character is simply riveting this would make a great book club choice for a group who likes intense reads","1273":" i had such high hopes for this book as it sounded like such a good plot for a story this book is about 39 people adrift in the ocean in a lifeboat after a mysterious explosion on their ocean liner think sinking of the titanic grace winter newly wedded and now a widow is one of those on a tiny lifeboat not fit for 39 people how do 39 people survive together with different points of view little water and even less food this was really difficult for me to get through but i plowed my way through it why didn't i like it i'm not sure i would have thought i would have loved a book such as this the writer wrote it as a first person narrative but grace was very passive and the thoughts that poured through her head were not what i wanted to read or expected to read it seemed to just go on and on and on not much action but lots on thoughts of grace would i recommend this to you it depends on what you like if you like books that don't develop the characters very much but discuss ethics morals thoughts of the times go ahead and read it me i wouldn't read it as there are just too many good books out there and so little time","1274":"a sinking ship panicked passengers an overloaded lifeboat and the story begins the bulk of this book is grace winter's retelling of her time aboard the lifeboat which she is writing for her lawyers who may choose to use it in court grace as it turns out is on trial for murder along with two other survivors while the story of what happens on the lifeboat is interesting the real meat of the book is in the philosophical and moral questions that are posed by the story when people are cut off from the rest of the world who is in charge where do they look for authority on moral matters what constitutes a true memory can anyone who wasn't there understand what happened on the lifeboat","1275":"life of pi the lifeboat so i guess i like lost at sea books who knew next up unbroken might as well keep up with the motif admirable traits are often exactly the same as negative ones only expressed in a different way","1276":"this book had more potential than was realized it sounded like it would be great but something was odd about this book the main character grace was unlikeable the mix of personalities in the lifeboat was interesting but i didn't always understand what led people to do what they did would you jump overboard to your death just because someone told you to i was able to finish this book out of semi interest and curiosity but i don't highly recommend it","1277":"i loved this book it begins by plunging the reader into the story with the characters already off the sinking ship and in the lifeboat from there the reader gets a glimpse at how people behave in that awful situation the last 1 3 of the story deals with the trial of what happens at sea i think rogan's language was spot on for people of that time 1914 or so i imagine good story","1278":"the plot was terrific and the moral questions it posed would be perfect for a book club however i was left with more questions than answers about the plot points and don't feel any type of resolution having reached the end it was an interesting read but with so many great books out there this one wouldn't be on my list of recommendations","1279":"the premise of the novel is compelling the execution fails to satisfy i had expected an intense story about the dynamics of strangers being placed together on a lifeboat discussions of the ethics and morality of survival it turned out to be a rather dispassionate narrative from only one passenger's perspective it could have been so much more","1280":" grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes i enjoyed this book it was well written with good character development it was descriptive so that you could place yourself in the lifeboat it does go from present to past which i sometimes enjoy","1281":"unfocused characters potentially interesting unreliable narrator who never adds up to much inexplicable central incident makes no sense and isn't even compelling unsatisfying ending potentially interesting back story abandoned unresolved why is this book getting good reviews","1282":"great book kept my attention the whole time just wished there were more answers at the end of the book i did read it in one weekend cover to cover","1283":"really really enjoyed this book i almost felt like i was on that lifeboat w grace i could not put this book down","1284":"i thought it sounded so good i believe it got rave reviews however it was okay only read about 4 chapters hoping it was going to get better started out slow and finished slow","1285":"i especially liked it because of the discussions it leads to about morality","1286":"charlotte rogan has a unique gift for creating atmosphere the story opens with grace winter awaiting trial for murder and how she got there is the heart of this story the book is not titled the lifeboat for nothing after the ship grace and her husband were sailing on sank she is left on a lifeboat and that lifeboat became grace's whole world as time passes and food water and hope begin to run out so do the norms of society and basic human interaction moods darken and morals shift if they're lost altogether life before the lifeboat is a distant thing a memory of another life that gets farther and father away reading grace's account of what passed on the boat after returning to civilization is like reliving in a bad dream it's fascinating and enthralling but nothing one wants to get too close to monotonous hunger thirst weakness and despair envelop the passengers there is no escape from it there is no escape from each other there is only survival and what one has to do to ensure it this book is beautifully written more and more captivating as it goes along it's amazing what people are capable of given the right circumstances and rogan has created those circumstances with an adroit hand","1287":"this book was recommended to me otherwise i probably never would have read it however i did enjoy it easy to read and an interesting story worth reading","1288":"haven't made up my mind about this one yet but only on page 30 so early days","1289":"i read this for a book group and really wish i had finished it in time to attend though i didn't love it as other people did there was a lot to discuss about the event grace is on trial for and how the group survived after it","1290":" i give rogan credit for an interesting storyline but can't really recommend the book because it didn't live up to its potential and at the end of the day i wouldn't have cared if the main character hadn't survived i'm not sure the trial plot was even necessary here i think we all get that three weeks on a lifeboat with 38 others would be fraught with moral dilemmas death and desperate grasps at survival had the story stayed on the lifeboat and included the rescue in real time we would have been left with far more to chew on than the jury's decision gave us was grace naive conniving weak strong indecisive determined yes but i didn't really care","1291":"well i won't be taking any cruises for awhile after reading this somehow being trapped on an overcrowded lifeboat for 21 days with other humans makes life of pi seem like a breeze if anything this well written book reveals a lot about survivors and their mental states rather than the complexities of human mis behavior","1292":"beautifully written great story up to the last few pages when fizzled a bit","1293":"i liked it i did the quotes on the back made me think i was supposed to get the book on a deeper level and i'm not sure if i did i kind of got it but was waiting for something more when the book ended i just thought oh the book's done hmm so that's why i didn't love it just liked it","1294":"an unsettling look into the true nature of the human sense of self protection this book left me unable to answer the question of what i would do under the same circumstances","1295":"this felt like life of pi meets titanic i like the way the plot line was woven but the text itself dragged and some logic lines stretch a bit grace is a strongly written character but parts of the story need a bit more undergirding with character motivation it was a quick read but not what i thought it would be","1296":"this is more of a strong 3 5 than a 4 but i was feeling generous at the time i rated now having let things marinate a bit i still liked the book but i am a tad bit less enthusiastic all in all a fun interesting fairly fast paced read the story is self explanatory a ship sinks and people get stuck on a lifeboat together a little bit heart of darkness a little bit castaway a little bit lord of the flies and a little bit old victorian the entire book takes place on the boat but rogan peppers their time on the lifeboat in with some bits about the past what was happening on the boat prior to it's sinking a peek into the lives of some of the lifeboatees enough so that we don't ever get too tired of hearing about the experiences on the boat which actually was the best parts for me i liked reading about the peeling away of politeness and human decency and all the other layers that we hide our animal selves with but rather than being scary or sad it felt...scandalous which i liked i had a few complaints but ultimately they were trivial it wasn't the world's greatest piece of literature but it was an entertaining read that kept me hooked till the end bravo","1297":" this was a library book sale grab that was at least worth the buck i paid for it in 1914 an ocean liner sinks in the north atlantic think titanic or lusitania newly wed grace finds herself in an overloaded life boat without her husband and a collection of people mostly women from all walks of life the bulk of the story is how she survives the elements and the interpersonal clashes of her fellow castaways interestingly we know that she survives as the opening chapter starts out with her and a few others on trial for crimes occurring on the boat what could the isolation no food and no water done to take her down such a path interesting read a debut novel for the author 7 10s 10 13 15 f 10 21 15 9 days","1298":" the lifeboat is a tale of desperation guile hope and betrayal it is about 39 people who find themselves in a lifeboat right after their large ship the empress alexandra sinks the story takes place in 1914 two years after the sinking of the great ship the titanic as with the titanic there was insufficient space on the lifeboats for all the passengers supposedly the lifeboats could fit 39 people but at the last minute the manufacturer reduced the capacity of the lifeboats however they did not change the metal tag that said the capacity was 39 people so here we have 39 people jockeying for a place on a lifeboat not made to fit them all a seaman named hardie takes control of one of the boats and is a natural leader though cold and hard he controls everything that happens on the boat as it flounders at sea waiting for days and then weeks for a rescue ship that never comes the survivors eat the fish he spears the birds that fall from the sky into the ship and find themselves not unlike animals the nights were cold and the more emaciated we became the less our bodies worked to keep us warm when i looked at the others i was shocked to notice their sunken eyes and hollow cheeks and i knew we had all retreated into memory in order to escape the harsh realities of our plight fear was their constant companion along with fear their true natures were coming out the bare bones of our natures were showing none of us was worth a spit we were stripped of all decency i couldn't see that there was anything good or noble left once food and shelter were taken away the gray areas of morality were very clear nothing was black or white one thing that was clear though was that i looked around and realized that we were all predators and that we always had been grace is the protagonist of the story and the narrator however we don't know how accurate her rendition of events actually is she keeps her cards close we do know that she tried to take advantage of things in her life prior to finding herself in this boat we know that she chose her husband after reading an article in the social pages of her newspaper knowing he was rich and a good catch stealing him didn't phase her and stealing it was he was engaged to be married shortly to a woman he'd known most of his life in the prologue we find out that grace and two other women on the boat are in jail awaiting trial for their lives that grace's husband is dead and that her lawyer wants her to write a narrative of her time at sea this narrative is the book we read they are on trial for throwing others overboard to save their own lives how can we believe grace's tale completely for she is of shaky moral grounding couldn't this narrative be written to put her in a good light and make others look bad the book reminded me a bit of william golding's `lord of the flies' where a group of boys find themselves stranded on an island and make a government for themselves that subsequently implodes on the rescue ship the leadership of hardie is questioned and after a while two women hannah and mrs grant try a coup things go from bad to worse i was also reminded of the great painting by gericault the raft of the medusa according to wikipedia it depicts the aftermath of a shipwreck where those who survived endured starvation dehydration cannibalism and madness this is a very readable book a page turner grabbing the reader from page one it is a book about morality about the decisions we must make when in dire circumstances and what happens to people when they are placed in life threatening situations it is a book about choices and opportunities faith and fatality how close is a human being to an animal when placed in a dire situation the author charlotte rogan is a fine writer with a wonderful grasp of philosophy and psychology you would never know that this was her first novel","1299":"well this is only the second book i have ever read where i did not like the protagonist the first book was a star called henry by roddy doyle grace came across as a conniving female con artist the other characters in the boat were not given any in depth characterization they all seemed so wooden this was a good story but was badly edited in my opinion allowing the plot to float in a more linear way would have made for a better read still a good book to curl up with when there is nothing better to do","1300":"this one was pretty bleak there were some interesting themes to ponder but overall i didn't love it","1301":"depressing by one third the way through i didn't really want to keep going not because it was boring but because everyones dying enough happened to keep reading but at no moment was there any happiness there were more questions produced than answers and when i finished i didn't feel amazed or satisfied or happy i feel blah if that can be put into a state of being i wouldn't recommend or pick up again","1302":"lord of the flies on the ocean meh","1303":"so i just finished a book of historic fiction about the sinking of the titanic and now this one finds me a bit disappointed not what i had hoped ending left me with the and then what feeling loose ends not tied up and leaves you hanging in many respects","1304":" grace really had me going for awhile i think i will have to read parts of it again our book club will be discussing this next week we have an interesting discussion going about how many people to have in our what i consider to be a very successful fun book club if we add everyone that current members would like to invite will we have some old members jumping out of the book club boat if it aint broke don't fix it comes to mind what was going wrong in the lifeboat the people had to be eliminated wasn't it all perceived","1305":"32nd pick january 2015 ~ chosen by marilyn average rating was 3 6 5 stars meeting highlights ~ we met at brio in attendance nadine kimber robin pam vicki adriane and marilyn the meeting lasted about 2 5 hours pam nominated 3 books and we chose our june 2015 pick the museum of extraordinary things by alice hoffman next meeting will be sunday march 8","1306":"i enjoyed the lifeboat it's a quick read my only criticism is that it is a bit predictable the author does a great job in her characterization of grace a young woman hoping to be saved by a man in several different relationships she first is hoping to be saved by her marriage then by hardie and finally by her lawyer she is a little needy for my tastes","1307":"good story too many characters to keep up with enjoyed the concepts though","1308":"i didn't necessarily enjoy it while i was reading it i think because i couldn't like the main character that being said it will stick with me for a long time interesting view of the interactions of people in an extremely difficult situation","1309":"i really enjoyed parts 1 3 of this book it covers the time of the scramble to lifeboats as the ship goes down to the desperate attempt to stay alive long enough to be rescued the survival instinct battling with morale ethical and personal boundaries while trying to exist with others in the same struggles made for interesting reading part 4 covers the post rescue saga while interesting in its own way it lacks the gripping storytelling of the previous sections","1310":"a two star rating is probably unfair as this book is very well written however it reminded me of something i learned in eigth grade when assigned to read hemingway's the old man and the sea books about people out at sea are boring as hell i always root for characters to survive so stories can go on but i found myself wishing that the surviors of the empress alexandra would just die already so i could be don with this book i also thought this book was trying to make a statement about morality and opportunism but none of the characters were particularly compelling and the book would have been better off if the author just stuck to tellig an interesting less disjointed story","1311":"i struggled to finish this bland boring and overly introspective story of 39 survivors of a shipwreck on a lifeboat the main character is on trial and we get to look back on her experiences on the lifeboat however since she is exceedingly drab lackluster and self centered it's hard to tell about the other cardboard characters her thoughts meander and often are meaningless might have been a better story in someone else's hand","1312":" i really liked this book though i have to say it was misleading i was expecting a story set on the lifeboat describing grace winter's exciting and terrifying survival instead this was a book that looked back on her story from the start you realize that it is being written as if from memory it was quotes like this 'almost unbearably exciting you'll gulp it down in one sitting' the timesthat really shouldn't have been put on the front cover but maybe if you looked only at the chapters where she reviewed her time on the lifeboat then the daily telegraph's quote can be excused 'rogan's rip roaring tale is a chilling reminder of the cost of survival'what this book drew me more to was the concept of how morals really go out the window in situations such as that really though it's easy to see how being selfish and greedy tends to prove effective i love though how the dilemma of some must die for others to live is that it requires people who stay morally good in survival situations other than that i loved how grace was almost trying to figure out if she was mad or not which is why i really wish they had maybe advertised these quotes a bit more 'compelling and disquieting' observer'bold and forceful' daily mail'a thought provoking debut about life death and survival morally complex and devastatingly intense' marie claireand one of my favorites'a subtle study of frail humanity' i","1313":" i am only giving this 3 stars because this book would be fantastic for discussion based on the story alone it would great a resounding 2 stars i really did not care for the characters let alone their choices and nor were they very well developed however the ethical u0026amp moral issues that arise are intriguing i don't know what i would do in the same situation i'd like to think i would be selfless of course it is difficult to speculate overall read it in a book group skip it if not","1314":"i was engrossed until the rescue after that i felt there were too many unanswered storylines and just wanted to finish the book to start another one","1315":"no kidding i inhaled this in a day great book to think about what you might do people are capable of all kinds of things good pick for book club","1316":"i liked this book a lot more when it first started it's bad enough to be in a life and death situation but being in a crowded boat with really annoying people is torture i felt like there might be more than meets the eye with grace but it didn't really go in the direction i thought it would after the really dramatic parts of the book the rest seemed spliced together and of little interest","1317":"loved it fascinating","1318":" what makes us act the way we do in an emergency and why do seemingly moral and upstanding people suddenly lose it when faced with death at the start of the story we find grace winter on trial for her role in the murder of a crew on a lifeboat after the cruise ship capsized grace was a newlywed on the voyage and was put into a lifeboat with other women and a few men and set adrift for days as food runs out water is scarce and the lifeboat develops a leak thoughts turn to their fate tempers flare and mutiny rears its head the crew member mr hardie rules with an iron fist and his decisions are not shared by all on the boat so grace must decide who to side with and what is to be done with mr hardie after reading many books on the survivors of the titanic i was surprised how different this story was and how well charlotte rogan conveyed the terror and despair the survivors must have felt and how this led to their actions","1319":"i didn't love this book as i hoped i would it was enjoyable but not great i didn't really like the narrator because i felt like she was sort of a double agent in the lifeboat never really committing to any of the necessary decisions","1320":"this is the kind of book where i just wanted it to be finished but couldn't stop reading it at the same time i had to know what happened but was never sure if i really liked anyone in it even after i finished i wondered about the main character was she guilty or not does it matter in life and death situations what is the right thing to do very interesting moral issues that i would rather read about then ever have to face","1321":"the reader is all the time expecting that something will happen and nothing happen disappointing","1322":"after reading a lot of reviews of this book i was really excited to read it i was really disappointed at how slowly the book moved and how little i cared about the characters it wasn't until the author jumped ahead to the time after the rescue that i really became interested in what happened unfortunately this was over 2 3 of the way through the book","1323":"an interesting story about what constitutes murder when it means your own life is sacrificed unless someone else dies","1324":"was so excited to read this book i started it yesterday and by dinner time i was nauseated i felt like i was bobbing around on the water too i think she wrote the word bobbed 20 times or more ugh","1325":"engaging at times but mostly ridiculously silly","1326":"this book was recommended in almost every magazine i read it takes place mostly in a lifeboat after the sinking of a small ship in the atlantic in 1914 i wanted to like it more than i did i liked the parts in the lifeboat while they were struggling to survive and decide what to do the power struggles etc not so much the before and after lots of unanswered questions for me glad i read it though i'm sure i will like it more upon further reflection read life of pi if you want to read a really good lifeboat book","1327":"a very interesting character study i don't normally love the formality of language from this time period but i found this to be a page turner and cleverly written jumping back and forth from the lifeboat to court to her relationship with henry","1328":"not sure this book deserves all the hype it held of course an inthralling story of a capsized ship lifeboat malfunctions not enough for everyone conspiracy behind who gets a spot and who doesn't as i read i was held captive waiting for the big crime that happened i'm not sure it really fulfilled i personally was let down slightly disappointed","1329":"wonderful debut novel thought provoking a novel that makes you ask yourself what would you do","1330":" i really liked the premise of this book but i thought the way it skipped around was a little bit confusing to the story i also think having entire chapters devoted to each day in the lifeboat was a poor choice slowly starving to death isn't very entertaining and there are only so many situations that can happen in a boat full of stranded people in 1914 i think the author was trying to get some sort of woman power thing going on and she mentioned women's suffrage briefly i would've liked to see more discussions and opinions about it though i think the deal breaker for me was that i really disliked the main character she was selfish manipulative and wishy washy about important issues she would sit and wait for others to do things for her and she couldn't pick a side until she was sure someone was coming out on top then she sided with the winning team she thought she was better than everyone else and she would look down on them but turn around and act like their best friend to their face she views marriage as nothing more than a status booster and a husband as nothing more than someone who can take care of and do things for her the sad part is that she was a very realistic person she's just not someone i could ever care about or sympathize with","1331":"i have to say i'm disappointed i liked it until about two thirds of the story and then it just didn't hold my attention i am coming down with a cold and am bone tired so that might have something to do with my non appreciation of the book but it surely sort of fizzled out the prison sequence did not add anything in my opinion it did not disprove her diary i think the bunch of people stuck in a kill or be killed situation was described pretty well pity it wasn't told from the point of view of a more interesting protagonist i thought mistakenly i now know that grace was set up to be an unreliable narrator but it turns out that she was pretty reliable after all grace was supposed to be tricky and manipulative but what she was was dull the set up was pretty impressive grace's contrived marriage to the wealthy henry the fact that the empress alexandra's cargo was valuable and that henry was responsible henry being ambivalent about facing his family how grace came to be in the lifeboat hardie and blake's maybe criminal activity it's all shrouded in mystery it all comes to nothing of any meaning ultimately what turned me off the story was grace's passivity hannah would have made a more interesting protagonist or mrs grant also the blurb makes it seem like it's some sort of highly thrilling psychological mystery it's not it is a study of rapid degeneration of civilization in the face of disaster and it does well in that construct but i guess people would not buy such books by debut authors it's not the first time i've been fooled by a jacket blurb it's time i stopped reading them","1332":"high school antics survivor on a lifeboat aptly describes this book what a pain and a burden to finish so much to complain about regarding this book but frankly i don't want to waste any more time on it than i already have","1333":"really engrossing while we are on the lifeboat less so once we get to the trial","1334":" this is a fairly short ostensibly simple story about a group of survivors most of them female who are cast adrift in a lifeboat after their ship the empress alexandra sinks it's narrated by grace winter a young newly wed woman the book opens with the revelation that grace is on trial for her life accused of murder the narrative cuts between her trial and the journal she is asked to write by her lawyer charting her experience in the lifeboat via the journal we discover grace has recently escaped the awful to her mind at least fate of becoming a governess by marrying a wealthy banker henry however in the lifeboat she is without henry and without friends and struggles to bond with her fellow survivors when a hierarchy inevitably starts to emerge grace must choose whether to side with experienced but shifty sailor mr hardie or the imposing mrs grant grace is a fantastic character a devious evasive and untrustworthy person who is an arch manipulator of men but flounders when it comes to female friendships she's not entirely unsympathetic though and it's easy to be swept up in her story one of the strengths of a book like this is you can't help but wonder how you would have fared in the survivors' circumstances who would you have trusted in the lifeboat what would it have been like to find yourself in this situation as a woman in the early 19th century given the attitudes of the time how far would you go to save yourself and can people in this predicament starving and half insane with exhaustion really be held wholly responsible for their actions the flashbacks to grace's past are also intriguing offering a greater sense of her personality and an insight into the unreliability of her personal account the narrative avoids too much repetition by cutting back to grace's trial and her memories of henry every now and again but as her journal is structured in 'day' and 'night' form there's no avoiding the fact that some of the descriptions of her time in the lifeboat are a bit dull conversely in a sense i felt they weren't long and detailed enough so that when grace starts talking about everyone in the lifeboat being emaciated and going mad with hunger it doesn't feel like they've been there long enough for this to be the case i'm nitpicking here i suppose on the whole there's a good balance and this being a short book the story never drags for too long my final criticism is that i didn't feel rogan went as far as she could have with the unreliable narrator trope i felt the flashbacks could have been fleshed out further particularly with regards to what happened on the ship before it sank and i'd have liked some further resolution as to who if anyone was telling the truth the lifeboat is smart thought provoking and keeps you guessing all the way through it's almost everything you could want from historical fiction really and i can understand why it's creating a bit of a buzz at the moment personally i think it could have been a lot meatier but the brevity keeps it readable and compelling recommended a note to other readers who enjoyed this book if you haven't already please please read gillespie and i by jane harris it's also historical fiction told from a female perspective and as twisted devious unreliable narrators go i promise you grace winter has absolutely nothing on harriet baxter","1335":"how would you handle being on a lifeboat with 38 other people for months very good","1336":" what i regretted most was that i was not to die with my view of human nature intact i had been allowed to believe in man's innate goodness for the twenty two years of my life and i had hoped to carry the belief with me to my grave the thing that preoccupied me that night was the notion that a person's choices are only rarely between right and wrong or between good and evil i saw very clearly that people were mostly faced with much murkier options and that there were no clear signposts marking the better path to take the sleep of the saved is the same as the sleep of the damned i don't think anyone thought past the lifeboat we finally accepted it it was where we lived after all i have already taken the measure of my own insignificance and i survived if i had not felt so sorry for him i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know very good book lines blur and you begin to understand their actions and following question yourself in similar circumstance","1337":"powerful story of what people do when faced with life and death choices once their ship goes down and they are in an overcrowded lifeboat this is a fast read that constantly has you second guessing how you would react along with the main character","1338":"this is rogan's first novel it is a bleak look at a lifeboat with 39 survivors of an explosion on a luxury liner before wwi the survivors struggle with survival and each other as the days go by wihtout rescue think lord of the flies the novel centers on a young 22 year old woman now widow who ends up being tried for murder after they are rescued as in all such situations disaster brings out the best in some and the worst in others","1339":"what was the point waste of time","1340":"and this is why i shouldn't buy into the hype of new books i had such high hopes for this book was totally convinced it would lead somewhere i wasn't expecting and offer a big surprise nope don't get me wrong i enjoyed it and actually once i got started i finished in a little over a day but the reviews way overrated this book","1341":"a decent book overall i will check out whatever she writes next mandy adult servicesreserve a library copy","1342":"well this is the first time that i've rated a book with only 1 star mostly likely because usually if i am not enjoying a book this much i stop reading it but i persevered with this one thinking it has to get better it should have been riveting people stranded on a lifeboat for 21 days but i found my mind drifting page after page and kept skipping paragraphs because i was so bored there was a brief period in the middle where it was good but that didn't last the writing just could not hold my interest i forced myself to finish it as soon as possible so i could move on and also in vain hope that the end would be worth it not so much don't like giving negative reviews to authors but i found it hard to see anything redeeming in this book","1343":"really enjoyed it it was interesting to see how the group changed as they struggled to survive good quick read","1344":"this book was recommended on the list 21 books written in the last 5 years that every woman should read maybe this is why i gave it such a low rating i was expecting much more i think there are far better books out there","1345":"this was a fast read i like it but wish the characters would have been better developed the characters were too superficial and you had a lot of holes in the story that should have been closed up","1346":"the events move really slowly and the climax which i expected at the end of the book never really happens so it's been a little disappointing","1347":"it is 1914 when grace elopes with henry and they are returning aboard an ocean liner when a fire occurs and all must abandon ship grace is separated from henry and finds herself in an overloaded lifeboat with a motley group of passengers and one sailor the sailor takes command and over the following weeks rations the water and pieces of fish that he caught with his knife from the sea bailing the water is a constnt chore and finally volunteers are selected by the sailor to draw straws for some to abandon the boat so that it can stay afloat for the others the rest of lhe story involves decisions made by the leading woman passenger to overthrow the sailor who has become less able after a total of 3 weeks an icelandic fishing boat rescues them but because of the decisions made a trial ensues charging murder against the women including our newlywed grace this was a very descriptive story about conditions that affect the human body both mentally as well as physically and a tale of the actions of the ocean","1348":"a shipwreck and grace winter is thrust into the lifeboat however her new husband doesn't make it to survive in the lifeboat tough choices have to be made grace thinks back over her life and the strange way that she met her husband or should i say trapped her husband she is looking forward to a life of privilege but will it happen for her this book just teeters on the edge for me i found the main character unlikeable and self serving","1349":"i couldn't put this book down it makes you think u0026amp the plot moves along at a surprisingly fast speed considering these characters are stuck on a too small lifeboat","1350":"this book was not at all what i expected the description sounded so interesting but the reality was a lame story about a handful of useless people stuck on a boat the mental deterioration is not even very engaging","1351":" after the empress alexandria sinks in 1914 39 people are stuck in a lifeboat for 21 days the novel opens with the ship already sunk and the lifeboats in place waiting for rescue did the sos call get sent or not the survivors spend precious time in the assumption that another vessel is steaming its way toward them but as that hope begins to fade memories begin to come back to grace in bits and pieces grace now a young widow is our guide throughout the story in first person she is as honest with us as she can be about the situation on the lifeboat the power struggles the delirium and hunger the hope in many instances the language and propriety of the time period and as the days wear on grace's struggle to keep her wits about her narrow our intimacy with her especially as she makes a decision that will affect everyone on the boat and their chance for rescue strangely enough i wonder if a third person narrator would have allowed the reader to get closer to grace given these circumstances","1352":"lately i seem to be reading alot about people being stranded in the ocean note to self not to get on a boat or a plane anytime soon i did like this book i really liked how it was written i love those back and forth books between the past and the present not sure what i would have done if i would have been one of those in the boat too many terrible decisions to make","1353":" 1914 the atlantic ocean 39 people one lifeboat where people stop being polite and start being real oh yeah i loved this book it has all the elements of a good survival story with all the furnishings of a well written mystery novel alliances will form motives will be shrouded lies and misdirection will win the day and exposure and deprivation will make even the well intentioned people a little loopy and unreliable it is a great idea for a novel and rogan writes it well the framing device is of a survivor married for ten weeks and a widow for over six standing trial along with two other women for murrrderrrrr but where is the line between murder and what needs to be done in order to come out the other side of extreme circumstances and is anyone at all telling the truth this story is very carefully told hints are dropped here and there peppering the narrative with doubt and revelations of manipulation feigned oblivion and ulterior motives but it is still a pretty harrowing survival story it just happens to also be a clever character study and a meditation on faith vs human agency gender politics and difficult choices all in this tiny little package this is the queen of all unreliable narrators and i found myself wanting to start the whole book over again from the beginning immediately after finishing it i don't want to give anything away but i highly suggest putting it on your to read shelf and snatching it up when it comes out on april 10 i am excited to talk about this book with others","1354":"it was for a time a book that had me in its grip then poof i lost most of the interest okay read but i somehow expected more","1355":"enjoyed the book but the ending was a bit weak","1356":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book until app 2 3 through and then it seemed to lose its way description of the days at sea and survival were excellent but the story then jumped forward won't spoil the book but this would have worked if some of the missing bits had been covered with the same feeling as first half of the book it felt like we rushed to the ending an opportunity missed","1357":" article originally published on www blogcritics comsurvival in a lifeboat may sound like a simple plot line but it astounds in the hands of debut novelist charlotte rogan

secures her a place on a lifeboat she survives three weeks in the overcrowded boat upon rescue she finds herself on trial for murder--another form of survival no spoilers here all of this information is in the prologue 1914 somewhere in the atlantic ocean seaman john hardie takes charge on lifeboat 14 his maritime experience enables him to adjust to changes in their circumstances it also gives him the grit to put a boot in the face of a lost soul trying to climb aboard the already dangerously full lifeboat when he is not giving orders he remains aloof or expounds on scientific maritime facts and lore in this tiny boat adrift in a boundless ocean the author examines whether murder justifies survival the owners of mother ship the empress alexandra saved money by building lifeboats to hold

novel read life of pi if you want a human nature when stranded in a confined space novel read lord of the flies","1359":"how do you make such a good premise so dull \"it was not the sea that was cruel but the people\"","1360":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here generally liked the adventure of being in an over crowded lifeboat the guy who is the self

other women for murder characters are not well brought out but the ideas are good and i hope she has some other stories to tell more","1361":" an astonishingly great book it's right up there with the turn of the screw in its ambiguity creepiness seriousness of purpose intelligence and rip roaring plot but with the added bonus of bracingly clear prose i'm not sure i've ever been so delighted by an unreliable first person narrator is grace a monster a shy observer a scheming social climber a sufferer of ptsd you can't say for sure and ten intelligent readers could make ten different and equally compelling cases about her character that rogan could create such a character and ground her in a novel that's both moral allegory and straightforward thriller is remarkable","1362":"i couldn't put this book down it raised moral questions in an enlightening manner while keeping you on the edge of your seat a must read","1363":"i really liked this book a lot in the beginning but about 2 3 of the way in it lost my interest sad because i was really enjoying it","1364":"what a disappointment this book turned out to be the story idea was so good but it never played out smoothly i found the story to be choppy no flow at all then without realizing it the whole plot shifted gears it was as if the author had no idea what her original plan for the characters were so she pieced together an ending and sent it off to her publisher","1365":"3 5 starsthis novel contains a compelling story line and an insightful look into human nature but there is something about rogan's writing style that keeps me from giving it a higher rating she writes well so i suppose it is simply a personal preference","1366":"could have used some sharks","1367":"a slow read but kept wanting it to pick up reminded me of a cross between titanic lord of the flies life of pi and albatross","1368":"the book grabbed my attention at first but was repetitive i kept waiting for a big reveal of some sort of psychological epiphany but it fizzled out","1369":"i had a hard time deciding whether to give this book a 4 or 5 star rating basically it like life of pi but with people instead of animals around the start of wwi a fancy passenger ship goes down in the ocean then there is a struggle to get into the available lifeboats and the main character grace manages to get in one with the help of her new husband the book is interesting a keeps the reader turning the pages quickly because at the start of the novel it is made clear that grace is now in jail and on trial for something that she is said to have had a hand in on the lifeboat before they were rescued the book alternates between scenes of her trial and imprisonment and flashbacks written in diary form of the nearly 3 weeks where she was stranded at sea with a myriad of other characters the last 1 4 got a little slow for me but i found the question of whether or not the narrator was reliable to be endlessly intriguing and i'm still not sure that i've made a decision about that one all of the characters were interesting and it really made me speculate regarding how i might behave were i to find myself in a similar situation i'm pretty sure i would be thrown overboard by the other passengers by the end of the 3rd day lol this book isn't for everyone but if you think you like the same kinds of things that i like you should definitely read it","1370":"it has never taken me more than a few days to finish a book this novel is terribly slow and extremely dull i thought that pecking away at this book would be worth it at the end but the ending is just as horribly boring as the rest of the book","1371":"book club book","1372":"3 5 i will say that i couldn't put this book down but i was ultimately very disappointed in the ending","1373":"this story is an exploration of the psychology of survival 39 people one lifeboat who has knowledge who do you trust who has faith who is strong and who is weak this was a gripping story told by grace a young woman who survived a terrible ordeal of being at sea in a lifeboat with 38 other people i stayed up reading this novel until it was done moral and human questions challenged me until the last page i love the line paraphrase we are guilty by nature of being human","1374":"it seemed an interesting premise although i had never seen the hitchcock film and the reviews read well the narrators voice was a very sure and individual voice it started well but i have to say unlike some of the reviews my mind did wander at one point i thought it suddenly felt as though it was going to turn into a spine tingling revelation and i thought i'll have to really concentrate instead of meandering off the page but apart from a couple moments it never took fire for me in the way i thought it could have i enjoyed the idea that grace was not what she seemed to be and that she did learn something from her experience or rather grace was clever enough to be a different thing to different people in order to survive still an excellent first novel with some very memorable characters and interesting questions about self survival and morality i thought of life of pi at times","1375":"i really enjoyed the story and the way it made me consider survivalimagine being flung in an already fully lifeboat and then having to survive for days in limited space because if you stand up or move around too much the small boat will fill with waterhow much of your survival depends on mental survival","1376":"i enjoyed reading this book and i thought it was totally believable and could see how being trapped in an overcrowded lifeboat could strip people of their humanity and civility i would hope that i wouldn't act like some of the people acted but until you are actually in that situation you just never know you would hope you wouldn't i am still haunted over the part where they floated by the little boy because they couldn't take on any more weight","1377":" this book got to me so much i was dreaming about it first novel from this author i look forward to more she got into the subtle manipulation a of people and how power within a group shifts grace herself comes across as a sweet helpless young girl but by the end of the book you see how she makes the most of her perceived innocence to manipulate others to have the best outcome for herself this book looks at a time when women were starting to assert themselves within society and this seems evident within the life boat where some women look to lead while others still seem helpless at times it also had yourself wondering what would you do to survive in such conditions the moral issues of leaving someone behind","1378":"it was only ok i didn't really relate to the main character or actually any of the characters i picked it up because i heard an interview of the author on npr around the 100 anniversary of the titanic sinking","1379":" somehow i thought this was going to be a gripping story of survival with some mystery thrown in generally based on in depth characterizations and facing the reader with the over arching question of whether the end of the book would have the survivors being rescued or succumbing to the sea well that might have made a better book because this book contains none of that first of all and this is no spoiler you know from the first page that the narrator survived the ordeal and is now on trial for murder and while there is some sort of mystery about certain boxes which may contain gold or jewels and whether the crewman in the lifeboat knows more about these boxes than he is telling and exactly how the narrator came to be on the lifeboat at all i am sad to tell you that unless i missed something none of these 'mysteries' are resolved by the conclusion of the book and if you are thinking that the murder for which the trial is occurring will provide some interest let me tell you it does not the book could have been redeemed if rogan had explored the characters on the lifeboat so that the reader understood them as well as themselves all of their hopes fears dreams back stories etc but alas the characters including the narrator are as impenetrable by the end of the book as they were when the light dawned on them the first day in the boat there is some hinting by rogan that one woman is a lesbian and that one man has asperbergers which is jarring since she never makes it clear one way or another all in all a waste of time","1380":"when i heard the background story behind this first novel i was intrigued enough to sample its first chapter and i subsequently purchased 'the lifeboat' from ibooks and though i found the first few chapters promising i thought the book just drifted in search of something to rescue it i found the characters uninspired and poorly drawn the chapter introducing grace's husband 'henry' was at best serviceable pablum a disappointment from bow to stern i cannot recommend this book","1381":"as you can imagine 39 people trapped on the ocean for three weeks in a lifeboat sets the scene for some pretty intense inter personal conflicts and group behavior the eroding relationships between some individuals and the creation of factions among others in a situation where every action potentially means life or death was very interesting but in the end i really didn't care about any of the characters in this novel","1382":"who shall live and who shall die this is going to be an interesting book club discussion","1383":"so much potential but i just don't get the whole unreliable narrator thing i never enjoy books when i can't connect with the protagonists and care about them no matter how good the writing this book unfortunately fell into that category for me but lots of people have enjoyed it","1384":"just couldn't get through it it never held my interest writing very good just not my cuppa tea","1385":"i just read this book in a little more than 2 hrs yes it is about the 39 people on the lifeboat and the survival of the fittist and hard choices these people had to make but somehow i feel i overpaid for this hardcover and should've waited tip the paperback came out i read it fast though it is just around 250 or so pages i was expected more","1386":" in 1914 a young bride returning to america is shipwrecked in mysterious circumstances she spends 3 weeks in the lifeboat eventually participating in actual murder on her return to land she is arrested to stand trail for murder the journal she writes to re call events is the story of the lifeboat and the personalities in it intertwined with the story of the trail and its outcome after entrapping her first husband she agrees to marry her 2nd the lawyer who helps her there is much ambiguity about grace grace is revealed at the start as a determined and self sufficient young woman even though the times are changing for women she knows marrying a rich man is her best this she does in spite of his fiance whom she sees off this steeliness stands in good stead through the ordeal although she never seems to acknowledge it to herself hannah and mrs grant are the two other most powerful personalities aside from mr hardie who is not really complicated just a survivor in an unsentimental way the unspoken teamwork between hannah and mrs grant dominates the proceedings eventually and involves grace in the murder of mr hardie it seems hannah is gay but mrs grant is married and seems a naturally independent woman they seem to form a powerfully sinister relationship the other people in the boat form a background to these central characters and eventually no one is particularly likeable as they struggle to survive the most starling thing is that they are arrested and charged with murder even though they have been through such an ordeal and survived i can quite believe people unravel in such a situation and that the strongest people come to the fore while the weakest cave in one way or the other i found the early part of the story in the lifeboat to have a strangely drifting and dreamlike quality to it and as such did not find it too engaging at first it is a slow burner but the sly insinuations about grace being very attractive to men and using it are intriguing the trial exposes all the motivations and personalities of all involved in the murder and speeds up at this point it is clear that grace is calculating and wily in her dealings with her team of lawyers and dr cole this is about basic nature in all its abundant variety and what people will do to survive there wasn't much nobility around and the invocation of god in their situation was portrayed as week - mindedness it is very real and believable i think probably anything would happen in such a situation i would hate to be cast adrift and at the mercy of the sea i have great respect for its power so yes scary i think as well i might start judging whether people are worth saving so i wouldn't like to be tested it was a very equitable ending i wanted grace to walk and hannah and mrs grant were a dangerous partnership a pity henry didn't survive but you feel grace will whatever happens","1387":"it was an intriguing book however there were a lot of unanswered questions","1388":"meh this was a 3 until the epilogue when it became awful i understand this wanted to be about more than strangers thrown together in a lifeboat it could have been if the author had made me care when you throw together a bunch of unlikeable unsympathetic strangers in a lifeboat and set them adrift you better make sure your reader cares if the thing flips over as it was rogan sets up all these interesting class and gender conflicts but i hated everyone and didn't care what their fates were i finally have enough reading experience to know that i can be compelled to invest in unlikable characters rogan doesn't have that skill 2nd point of contention rogan opens all these interesting subplots but never explores any because of the limits of 1st person narrative many of these are left to wither as idle lies perhaps of gossipers what was the relationship of hardie and blake why did the ship sink what was mil's full reaction what of relationship with sister","1389":" this is a fantastic debut novel charlotte rogan clearly gets people and is lucky enough to be able to put it into writing with a rare fluency i happily recommend this book to anybody particularly those who get real pleasure from reading excellently written characters my favorite part of the lifeboat is the way it demonstrates how people when removed from their larger society are so quick to begin constructing their own myths and structures in its place this is a really really amazing book about how human beings work on a variety of levels a common criticism of this book is that the main character is a passive bore i contend that she is simply a reflection of a real person being riddled with self doubt confusion and fear are not flaws they are humanity there are thousands of survival stories written about heroes and villains it's rarer and more difficult to write about a normal person and to do so well","1390":"an oceanliner explodes leaving a lifeboat of 39 people to endure and sacrifice i could not bring myself to care about even one of the 39 people people were stranded on a small boat some people died some didn't it was dark then it was light then dark again a few reviews mentioned this book as a page turner i started turning paragraphs and then pages and then chapters nothing","1391":"re read for bookclub i look forward to discussing with others i've enjoyed reading the account of what is clearly a highly unreliable narrator though agree with some criticisms that some really crucial elements of the story are omitted yes of course that is deliberate but it is no less frustrating","1392":"books like this one and unbroken as well as what i know about carnival cruises teaches me to keep my feet on land at all times","1393":"hmmm this book got under my skin mostly because i found the main character grace to be soo utterly annoying though the concept of the book and much of the discussion that it can create are very interesting the manner from which this book was told rubbed me the wrong way","1394":"i picked up this book because all the comments and write up on the jacket cover made it seem like an interesting plot eh not so much i was disappointed i struggled to finish it and the ending was very anti climatic a bit titanic like as it was a story of a cruise ship in 1914 going down and the people that were together in one of the lifeboats it was not chronologically written and therefore felt scattered and confusing","1395":"2 5 stars my book club pick july 2015","1396":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was an interesting read i liked how the author took us on this journey and how the struggle of survival played out","1397":" imagine a book that starts at the end of the movie titanic and tells you the story of the emotional mental and physical challenges of being on a lifeboat for nearly 4 weeks this was a quick read and i enjoyed the story until it felt like the author just quit we get half way through the book hit the climax and then jump to another time and never finish the main lifeboat story it was disappointing i can rationalize why the author did that in my head but as the reader i wanted to hear the whole story","1398":"this book had me until the end so much left unanswered it was as if the author just gave up or ran out of time to finish the book but up until then it was a fascinating story of what happens to people in a disaster as they become less civilized b","1399":"if only i didn't wish they all drowned","1400":" pretty predictable situational ethics story too many people in the lifeboat which is of course taking on water and let the pecking order begin regarding who has to go and how that's determined there seemed to be a fairly good cross section of people more women than men with a variety of ideals and personalities in the lifeboat to make the story come off as a good social experiment even down to having a disabled guy in a wheelchair in the lifeboat who makes it who doesn't how did they die or survive this ordeal on the sea what are the consequences for decisions made by some i kept thinking of the song lifeboat by steve taylor while i read this book like the song much better","1401":"i loved it this book is a fast read and very engaging interesting characters with unexpected twists and turns of events and i liked the way it ended thanks charlotte","1402":"when the empress alexandria sinks grace is one of the lucky few who finds herself in a lifeboat initially relieved simply to be alive as the days pass and the extent of their predicament begins to dawn on them the passengers of the lifeboat become desperate factions form and many perish but who exactly is responsible for their deaths grace's account is the only one we have of what happened on the lifeboat but can we trust her i love an unreliable narrator and the voice is absolutely sure in this novel the plot is pacey with every day in the lifeboat bringing fresh challenges for the passengers and despite having many characters to keep track of the central characters are rendered with depth and complexity the ethical issues inherent in this scenario would make this a great book club choice","1403":"a shipwreck tale of the early 20th century told by a self possessed perhaps scheming young wife who finds herself in a lifeboat with an assortment of fellow voyagers and one mysterious sailor not all return to land and someone must answer for this an excellent character study taut in places especially on the lifeboat but slack in others","1404":"3 5 i really liked the beginning and i like trying to imagine what i would do if put in a similar situation but for some reason my liking petered out towards the end","1405":"it's a great book to discuss lots of moral issues to go over my only complaint is the lack of sympathetic characters at some points i really didn't care if any of them survived their time on the boat","1406":"great book that kept me intrigued till the last page","1407":"decent book it's two years after the titanic and another ship sinks the story is told almost entirely from a lifeboat carrying survivors some of the things hinted at were not wrapped up so they seemed odd being in the story at the end i think i would say skip this book bc even though it keeps your attention the end result is not worth skipping over other better books out there in the world","1408":"i'm conflicted about the ending but i thought that charlotte rogan did an excellent job of really making me feel like i was in that lifeboat i would definitely like to read more novels by her","1409":"dated a couple years after the titanic an unimaginable journaling of 21 life threatening days one of those stories that make you wonder how your true qualities would emerge","1410":"started slow a lot of charactor building found it a bit boring","1411":"this book just didn't do it for me i never ended up caring for any of the characters and the story rattled on skimmed the last 50 pages","1412":"author's voice fit the period but the line of narrative switch toward the end was unexpected and unpleasant i kept waiting for the big payoff ultimately it fizzled away i wouldn't recommend","1413":"i have an inherit flaw in that i always want to like books about boats more than i actually do the plot was decent the writing solid the main characters detailed but the whole time i felt the ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh of it building more and more in me i just didn't care if anyone survived everyone one of them got on my nerves and within that nugget of investment in one of them at least one of them i couldn't be on board at all","1414":"very interesting book in a 'lord of the flies' sort of way i was not invested in the protagonist at all","1415":"just okay liked it better after our book club discussion but didn't really connect with it","1416":"i am glad it is over it wasn't that exciting to me and didn't keep my interest","1417":" while this was a quick and easy read i found myself only mildly interested in the characters as people and in what would become of them i felt at times the author put me in the lifeboat but more often than not her writing left me a dispassionate observer the power of this book will be in the discussion that results from reading it as a group it was a book club book the author asked plenty of questions with her narrative but i'm not sure answered or provided any significant insight into many if any of them 2 stars for developing the characters putting me in the boat u0026amp providing insight 4 stars for generating discussion 3 stars","1418":"ms rogan writes this story in a captivating style i felt like i was in the lifeboat with the survivors the shoke and horrors felt real grace the main character was a comlex woman that i wanted to know but in the end really never knew her motives and true self","1419":" warning this book is highly disruptive to one's daily routine i just couldn't stop reading it despite the fact that i've exams going on i had to know what happens to grace who is an unforgettable character and the narrator of the book grace is not exactly likable nor is she particularly trustworthy there are many times i doubted the credibility of her words but she is a character who remained with me along with mrs grant and hannah this book has something for everyone it is scary suspenseful and even thought provoking i especially enjoyed the dynamics between those on the lifeboat it made me think about how when it comes to the need to survive all ethical moral codes undergo a complete change the only negative thing about the book is that it increased my phobia of ships boats di will be looking forward to charlotte rogan's future works","1420":"written very well i enjoyed it very much","1421":"the premise of this book the research involved and the ambiguous morality make it worth a reader's time","1422":"good idea but execution is poor so boring that after a point u stop caring who dies and who lives no depth in characters","1423":" i would describe this as a moral drama what would you do under these circumstances i kept expecting more to happen some secret to be revealed that would make me question whether to believe grace and her story but that never happened or if it did it was too subtle for me to get did henry bribe hardie for a seat for grace on that lifeboat did hardie and blake steal some gold i guess like dr cole i'm left wanting answers to questions that don't matter anyway while it started out pretty good and the descriptions of time spent on a lifeboat were interesting this book ultimately disappointed me","1424":"i think i would have enjoyed this more if i had been able to read in one sitting the plot details and characters were somewhat confusing especially in the beginning also not sure if the actions of the surviving women were totally believable for the period maybe a good book discussion title","1425":"i wanted this book to be better and i wanted the protagonist to be compelling in her questionable motivation but this book never really got there for me i kind of finished it just in case it grabbed me by the end but really it was only okay","1426":" the new york review of books described charlotte rogan's the lifeboat as \"an enthralling story of survival at sea ... one hell of a debut \" i concur but to me it was also a surprise i'd never heard of the book until a friend put it in my hands literally the book is the protagonist's narration of her ordeal at sea the book begins with a four page prologue which concludes \"i had been married for ten weeks and a widow for over six \" the newlyweds are aboard the empress alexandra a luxury ocean liner when a mysterious explosion on board dooms the ship grace the book's narrator and protagonist ends up on a lifeboat it is overcrowded tensions arise early hopes for rescue grow increasingly dim the lifeboat's passengers grow emaciated dehydrated and desperate the ordeal is compounded by measures taken to stay alive--and their subsequent consequences grace is an appealing perspicacious woman of her time her ordeal at sea takes place just a few years after the titanic disaster she reads people and situations insightfully she is no less incisive when parsing her own wishes and motives","1427":"this book had a lot of potential but it was just not that great for me for one thing i could not figure out what the main character grace was supposed to be like was she weak and frail and timid or was she strong willed and outspoken because the author kinda made it look like she was both and folks you can't be both and that big decision that was made on the lifeboat toward the end what the heck where in the world did that come from especially grace's part in it i don't get it and the ending oh the ending it was pure drudgery getting to the end of this book i don't get why this was a reader's choice book at the library i'm being pretty generous with those two stars","1428":"not super impressed because mainly i thought it was a little boring everything in the description sounded like my cup of tea but the pacing was slow and i found the aha moment lacking more of a oh hmm ok moment well written and i enjoyed the characters and interactions","1429":"pretty good read i liked the main character she takes no prisoners i loved the early 1900's time frame and the survival story of course","1430":" i found this to be an amazing and powerful novel when the empress alexandra sinks roughly two years after the titanic and three lifeboats full of people hope for rescue they never imagine the small world of the lifeboat to be more than a temporary wait until help arrives what follows is a complicated study of a gallery of characters whose attributes and oddities are on display in a battle for survival i enjoyed it the way i've seen my young female students enjoy the true confessions of charlotte doyle as a story of a woman in this case an observant narrator who captures the shift in personality that occurs once the occupants realize they are struggling for their lives leaders emerge and those who initially seem pure of heart morph and morph again reduced to their essence in challenging circumstances the role of women in society is thoroughly examined through these circumstances as well as group think versus individualism all in the microcosm of the lifeboat i thought this an outstanding novel and i will not soon forget its capacity to mesmerize the reader","1431":"an incredible story of survival on a lifeboat held me captive until the end which just seemed to end rather abruptly","1432":"i was captivated by the first two thirds of the book the interactions and subtle tensions between those on the lifeboat was intriguing the section about the jail sentence and court proceedings seemed rather disjointed and i couldn't be bothered following all the interactions between lawyers etc i'm guessing they were showing a parallel process to the lifeboat interactions but i skipped a fair bit towards the end","1433":"i didn't really enjoy this book it was tedious in the middle","1434":"the book was an interesting idea but it was not well executed and seemed to be cut short at the end disappointing","1435":" this is quite an effort for a first novel the story of a group trapped in an overcrowded lifeboat after a ship explosion in 1914 and also an examination of gender politics the human survival instinct and power struggles the fact that the narrator grace is rather unreliable and we never get a sense of having the whole truth or necessarily truth at all adds intrigue to an already tense situation i'd have given this 4 stars for the writing and situation as i was sucked right into the novel but then after the climactic moment the final third of the book drifted and seemed to me to just plod to an end so three it is but worth the read","1436":"i found this a struggle to get through the storyline intrigued me but it never really came alive when reading most of the people on the lifeboat were just names to me i never got a real feeling of who they were and consequently did not care if they survived or died the main drawback of this story is the lack of dialogue grace recounts details in a very unemotional flat voice and any sense of urgency action or involvement is lost the ending came with as much detachment as the rest of the book and although i didn't hate it i can't say i enjoyed it in any way","1437":"i wish i could give the book a mark closer to 4 stars it was entertaining and i recommend it","1438":"i couldn't stop reading this book had to know what happened to grace winter she was such a piece of work i found myself on her side while hoping i never meet anyone like her great summer read","1439":"although the premise looked interesting this book did not live up to my expectations the characters weren't well developed and i didn't feel empathy for any of them this could have been a much better book in the hands of a more experienced writer not recommended","1440":"i seriously struggled with this book i did plod through it and eventually finished it but the style of narrative was very hard work and the story disappointing i thought the idea was a great one and it was poorly executed","1441":"disturbing story with much in common with william golding's lord of flies it is a must read but a very serious novel","1442":"a young wife tells her account of surviving several weeks in a lifeboat after their ship went down mr hardie a crewmember became almost a tyrant to some on the boat and was dealt with by mrs grant hannah and the women a trial occurred in boston after the rescue","1443":"2 5 this was a tough one i wasn't a fan of the audio and i have mixed feelings on the material at times i was devastated at what was going on and at other times confused if i was put in grace's shoes i don't know what my life would hold i was interested in the thought behind this and just felt it didn't intrigue or hold up for me","1444":" i took my time in reading the lifeboat because there are so many characters to follow and multiple deceptions to decipher the first few pages are indeed an enticement to continue reading then is structured in such a way to keep a nice pace with definite breaks to shift the focus i was totally intrigued by the psychological circumstances and reactions of the characters there's not much character development rather a representation of the range of emotional and physical reactions to the trauma of a shipwreck and survival at sea i think the lifeboat could certainly be read quickly for it's entertainment value but a more in depth read yields all kinds of contemplations and considerations a most excellent story from a debut author i really enjoyed it","1445":"seemed i needed to read this quickly to find out what happened interesting to think about how character traits change when in unbearable situations","1446":"thought is was going to be a better read just skimmed the last hundred pages as it was more of the same grace had luck on her side and was able to survive tough decisions were made but the book lacked any substance for me","1447":"could not put this book down captivating story as seen through the eyes of a survivor faced with unbearable circumstances superb juxtaposition of dealing with that which has been dealt and doing what you can to create your own destiny only to face judgement by your peers loved it","1448":" for such a short book finished in one hot afternoon this was a thought provoking and interesting read a first novel for this author the writing was striking and often harsh ~ fitting for the subject matter a glitzy ocean liner sinks at the onset of wwi and we follow the 40 occupants of lifeboat 14 as they struggle for 21 days awaiting rescue although the author details the dramatic events that would certainly take place in a situation like this it is more the nuances of thought and attitude the power plays and personal intrigue that caught my attention our main character grace newly married sans new husband ponders that admirable traits are often exactly the same as negative ones only expressed in a different way right or that people's choices are only rarely between right and wrong or good and evil people were mostly faced with much murkier options and that there are no clear signposts marking the better path to take right fairly hefty thinking for a 22 year old adrift at sea not soon enough rescue does happen but then several of the main characters are accused of premeditated murder due to certain events on the lifeboat no spoilers here","1449":"i really enjoyed rogan's writing style it was a great story but got a bit overwhelming towards the end all in all a great literary read enjoy","1450":"really enjoyed this book about survival and to what extremes people will go to live","1451":"i loved this book it was very suspenseful and really made me think i'd definitely recommend it","1452":"i was pulled into this story immediately i could easily picture the characters and understand their fears as they struggled to survive the ocean a complex story which confronts morals judgement and faith i will recommend this book for our book club","1453":"$5 and the cover design is beautiful so i bought it yep i'm a sucker like that i thought this book would be really similar to the titanic story it's also about an ocean liner sinking but in this case due to a mysterious explosion but i was surprised at how different the premise was this book was one that i read in one sitting this evening and would definitely pass along it makes you think about the nature of humanity the things w i found this national bestseller at bu0026amp n for like $5 and the cover design is beautiful so i bought it yep i'm a sucker like that i thought this book would be really similar to the titanic story it's also about an ocean liner sinking but in this case due to a mysterious explosion but i was surprised at how different the premise was this book was one that i read in one sitting this evening and would definitely pass along it makes you think about the nature of humanity the things we would do to save ourselves and how selfish we ultimately are it was a quick read fast paced and compelling and well written and definitely worth a read","1454":"this first novel by charlotte rogan was a monthly book club selection which i read in one day grace winter is one of about three dozen survivors of a 1914 ocean liner disaster for three weeks grace and her fellow lifeboat passengers alternately band together and then turn against one another as they struggle to survive the ethical dilemmas faced by the group of shipwreck survivors provide fascinating discussion material for a book club","1455":"captivating","1456":"interesting moral and legal dilemma but tedious reading","1457":" most of the way through this i'd have said this was a four star book but there's something about the end that left me wanting a little more it felt like the last two chapters were really building towards some kind of revelation or development that never quite manifested overall i still have positive feelings about it grace's descriptions which certainly felt unreliable at times intentionally so of the events leading up to the eventual rescue are captivating i stayed up later than intended just to find out what was happening and what alliances would be formed the sense of frustration anxiety and hopelessness that begins to set in as they spend more time at sea is well executed and i think rogan does a great job selling the premise certainly worth taking a look at even if it drifts away instead of ending with a bang","1458":"very good story about strength and survival that comes out when you least expect it kept you very interested","1459":"if i had to choose a color to discribe this book it would be grey a very bland grey there are no splashes of yellow red or orange in this book maybe a murky lifeless blue the best that i can say is that the book is well written","1460":"i picked this book up at the library read the inside of the bock jacket and decided it sounded really good the problem is that there are a lot of books out there that sound good but if the execution isn't well done then it was just a waste of an idea this book was way too slow moving for me and i understand they're in a life boat and so things are going to be slow moving but this was just downright dull absolutely nothing ever happened the first 12 or 13 days are broken down into day and night chapters for each day making you think at the beginning of the book that so much is going to happen that it's going to need to be broken down so often but really nothing happened the most exciting part of the book for me was when the birds fell out of the sky how ridiculous is that i don't even eat meat and i hated hearing about animals dying and yet that was the part that caught my interest everything else is just a blur it was hot it was dry it was wet people were sick people died they were rescued i am so naive that i kept reading hoping it would get better but it did not and when i finally decided that i no longer wanted to finish it i realized that i had suffered through so much of it that i might as well suck it up and finish the rest and quite honestly the ending when the trials began were the best part that was really the only good part it ended as i expected i stuck it out and i finished it and now i'm so glad i don't have to read another page in this book again","1461":"i hate putting a book down unfinished but this bored me to the point of picking up another book and leaving this on the bedside table until it was due back at the library","1462":"the book starts in a lifeboat we know nothing about the passengers or how they came to sail on the ill fated ship we come to know as the empress alexandria i found the writing offered lots of trivial details but failed to reveal their relevance to the predicament the survival or the rescue of those on the lifeboat i finished the book feeling disappointed","1463":"remember the life boat exercise that you did in year one college psychology well someone created a novel around it after a fashion there has been a ship wreck and a man has assured his wife a place in a lifeboat the story surrounding it was a little boring it's all about who lives and dies and the consequences of the decisions made not sure i would read another one","1464":"it was ok it was a good story overall and i liked how the author kept it authentic in the use of her terminology and language to the time period i guess my only criticism is that they could have been more meat to the story maybe more history or some more flashbacks to help us know the character and time period better so anyway not a bad read by any means but not a favorite either","1465":"this book took foreeeeever to read i feel like it'd have made a better movie than book not saying that it wasn't interesting at times and i enjoyed it but it just didn't really grasp me","1466":"the style and language felt true to the time 1920's and the story was honest and well thought out took some patience to slog through though a thoughtful introspective account of survival at sea among other survivors the takeaway might be the realization that people and relationships are more dangerous than nature which is only indifferent and not calculating self serving or malicious","1467":"close to 4 stars just not quite there this was a surprisingly compelling read and i can see why some people read it straight through at one sitting very strong and enjoyable it just didn't quite deliver what i was hoping for in terms of narrative complexity the narrator isn't who she thinks she is and this could have been a deeper more interesting facet of the story","1468":" spotted a copy of the lifeboat by charlotte rogan on the new fiction shelf at the library and it looked interesting enough to give it a go since i didn't have anything else in mind i started it on tuesday the 26th and finished it this morning but i wasn't reading it in a very dedicated manner and for me it wasn't one of those book that you just \"can't put down \"initially i did not realize it was a period piece i was surprised when i encountered the description of the main character wearing a corset and petticoats i looked back at the first few pages to see if it was written anachronistically but i didn't see any particular words or phrasing that would indicate that i just hadn't picked up on the time period from the writing which i think just means that the style was subtle sometimes a historical fiction novel is written with a very forced \"old fashioned\" rhetoric and this book was not like that it was easy to slip in and out of the book so i guess the writing style was comfortable - i want to say it was neutral in regards to time period but i can't quite think of the way to put it \"chronologically neutral\" is what keeps popping into my head so i think i'll go with that i like the mechanism of bringing the reader up to speed gradually by starting off in the present day in a prologue then backtracking to an earlier point in the sequence of events the prologue was just vague enough to worry me initially that i would not be given enough information and that it would be intentionally withheld just to keep the reader interested but enough details were cleared up to satisfy me while still leaving a bit of mystery as to how we got to the events in the prologue i was drawn in rather quickly and the balance of giving withholding was nicely managed throughout the book the journal entry style of the book results in the timeline being a bit jumbled but rather than this being a bad thing i think it adds more realism to the narrator's account of her experience it's a more organic telling of the story than a chronological one there's that word again with one recollection leading to another memory that is related but not necessarily next in the succession of events since the author reveals early on the purpose of the narrator's attempts to record what she remembers of her time in the lifeboat i got a slight impression that i'm meant to question the accuracy and trustworthiness of the narrator's account - and i did question it i found myself wondering not exactly if her memory is to be relied upon but rather if perhaps she has tweaked the details a little or a lot in order to paint herself in a more forgiving light given the circumstances in which she finds herself in the prologue of the book it's very interesting to doubt a narrator in this way i don't often come across this technique if in fact it is intentional but i do enjoy it as it lends an unusual element of suspense to a plot that might otherwise have seemed straightforward that sense of uncertainty continues throughout the book - is the narrator portraying herself honestly is she being honest with herself it's difficult to tell and i enjoyed that the portions of the book that were the narrator's journal entries fit nicely into the context of the rest of the book - i mean that there was not a noticeable difference between the language of those chapters that were memories and those that were more current events in the story there was a difference in another way which is that the chapters that took place in the lifeboat were absolutely riveting for me and the parts of the story that took place outside the lifeboat were far less interesting possibly the reason for the lack of interest was because of the contrast when you know that scenes with far more urgency and excitement might lay in store since the journal and non journal chapters were intermixed it is tempting to speed read through in order to get to the next lifeboat scene that doesn't necessarily mean that the non lifeboat scenes weren't written well and weren't also interesting but they simply couldn't compete the author writes about being in a lifeboat for days as though she has experienced it there is not only thrill and danger but ms rogan expresses the monotony of the endless unchanging hours in a way that induces empathy without a corresponding ennui for the reader i was fascinated by the narrator's accounts of the interpersonal dynamics of the other passengers which seemed utterly believable in the context i would guess that this indicates a deep understanding of human nature on the author's part adding to the intrigue was that ever present undercurrent of ambiguity that small voice of doubt regarding the accuracy of those accounts given that human memory is fallible at the best of times and also knowing that the narrator has a great deal of motivation to draw a sympathetic portrait of herself to those who might read her journal i enjoyed this quite a bit it was a captivating story and one that gets the reader to think about some tough questions of what can be considered moral in some extreme situations it's just unsettling enough to be thought provoking without being disturbing although it occasionally ventures close to that territory this is the author's debut novel and i feel confident in saying that i'd read more from her if i stumbled upon another book of hers in the future but in all honesty i don't think i would seek her out the book sort of petered out for me toward the end and i wasn't very motivated to finish it and write a review since i didn't feel strongly about it one way or another it was a rather quick read though so probably worth the time i invested in it","1469":"sounded like a good premise but i didn't connect at all incredibly slow underdeveloped characters i managed to get through it and it did get a bit more interesting at the end but i wouldn't recommend it","1470":"interesting read however there were too many unanswered questions","1471":"grace winter and 38 others from the empress alexandra are floating in a lifeboat in the middle of the atlantic ocean it is two years after the titanic sunk and war is on the doorsteps of europe the choices they face and the moral dilemmas they are forced to deal with are the basis behind this book it was very interesting to think and compare how i might react in similar circumstances a good read","1472":"21 days 39 people and all the horrors within physical and psychological an account from one survivor","1473":"this was not the book i thought it was going to be but i did like it","1474":"just beginning but it seems really good liked it i must have missed something in the beginning re location the ending worked but was a bit of a letdown","1475":"excellent i loved the story and the way in which it was told mystery simplicity and hunger for survival i read this in less than a day because i was so taken with the plot i agree that it's morally complex and very exciting at the same time","1476":"3 5 stars really atmospheric read with an authentically claustrophobic feel to it and in places a bit of a page turner full review to come after the weekend","1477":"wonderfully written account from a survivor of a shipwrecked transatlantic ocean liner the interactions among the survivors and their experiences was spellbinding i still plan to cruise but will take the lifeboat drills much more serious","1478":"~this is so much more than just a suspenseful story of survival at sea there are so many complexities to it it's definitely going to make you think about which hard choices you might make if you were in that lifeboat and what might drive you to make them","1479":"interesting concept for a story a cruise ship sinks a couple of years after the titanic this is the story of one lifeboat overfilled with survivors of the sinking","1480":"it was a good book but not great i didn't care for her style of jumping back and forth with sometimes confusing results","1481":"i think this book was well written and very atmospheric but ultimately it was not really for me i think i admire it more than i enjoyed reading it","1482":"tortuous read this book should've taken 4 days to read instead it took over 6 weeks just boring author goes round and round blah blah and i have no idea what i just read i think i should go back a re read but i just want it to be over fast i wanted to give up several times but i've had this book on my list for a couple years and had high hopes for it kept waiting for it to kick in it didn't i'm sure this is some amazing piece of deep literature and it was just lost on my simple mind","1483":"it was ok fairly short with a lot going on","1484":"good story well written and only took me a couple of days as i was engrossed however something's stopping me giving it more than 3 stars it may be that i felt it was a bit slow towards the end","1485":"i loved the experience of reading this it was full of suspense and raised a multitude of interesting moral questions but when it ended i felt a little let down there were mysteries in the plot that were left unsolved or else i missed something and there were hints of a big shocking unreliable narrator twist that just didn't materialize nevertheless this would make a great book discussion title and an even better movie","1486":"left a lot of things unfinished","1487":"a bit ian mcewan esque dare i say a fast u0026amp thrilling read a great plot well written but i didn't love it liked it enough but only 3 stars from me","1488":"i enjoyed this it was on the simon mayo book club and i thought that the story sounded interesting and it was","1489":"i was reading this book at the same time as another switching back and forth because i wasn't completely engrossed in either i found this book to be a little boring and slow it bothered me that it seems to be so similar to the movie version of the titanic story the year the insufficient lifeboats etc too coincidental i didn't care for it","1490":"intriguing psychological story about situational morality a bit long and drawn out making it tough to slog through although it was necessary to really give the reader a sense of spending 3 weeks in a lifeboat with decreasing hope of being rescued","1491":"a quick read intriguing there is just not enough depth this book would be a great read for junior high curriculum","1492":"saw the reviews when this first came out and my wonderful local library ordered it in for me on request further confirming my view that libraries are one of life's great gifts the book very much lived up to my expectations cleverly written so that the ordeal of being lost and vulnerable at sea in the boat where personal and social standards are challenged in favour of survival unfolds alongside grace's trial in the backdrop of accepted societal norms motives and actions are challenged the power of 'peer pressure' is explored alliances form and break fortunes and power bases build shift and wane really enjoyed this liked the way that human values were challenged against both the norm and the extreme","1493":"i was very excited to read this book while i enjoyed it it wasn't the page turner i was hoping for i was left asking questions and wanting more answers i'm ok with a few things being left open but this book left too many things open for me","1494":" i enjoyed this tale of a lifeboat full of people and their struggle to survive until their rescue the story is told by grace winter newly married and on her way to boston to meet her husband's family mr hardie a member of the ship's crew heads the lifeboat until other passengers start jockeying for control i appreciate charlotte rogan's portraits of fear and humanity using each passenger to display all of the mixed emotions in the end i'm not sure i was moved by grace's tale but i found the journey in the lifeboat interesting","1495":"i had a very difficult time getting through this i only made it about 60% before i decided to set it aside","1496":"different and interesting","1497":"i liked the book but didn't like that there was so much not wrapped up in the end","1498":"great writing that explores the grey areas of right and wrong in an extreme circumstance","1499":"well written","1500":" \"the lifeboat\" by charlotte rogan...wow i couldn't put this novel down i started it last night in bed after july 4 fireworks i continued reading it first thing in the morning and just finished i haven't done a full sole book review in quite a while so this should also show how much the book impressed me basic plot a group of shipwreck survivors between the times of the titanic and the lusitania struggle to well survive in a lifeboat that can't handle their numbers they're immediately faced with many morally gray decisions for example right after the wreck they don't pick up a child because the boat has no room for him and survivors battle off with their oars people trying to get into the boat the moral grayness only increases in the weeks that follow as they're stranded at sea grace winter in first person narrative tells the story she's a flawed cunning person both before and after the shipwreck her character doesn't really grow nor does it need to grace knows who she is and accepts who she is some other reviewers have noted they found it hard to \"root\" for grace i didn't have this problem at all i was intrigued to see what would happen next what she would do next her mind is one i don't get to read about nearly enough in literature and i loved the insight here she said at one point something like \"you can't be innocent and alive \" that sums up the morality of the book i believe people judge other people with absolutely no insight of what these people have been through and what the judges may have done in their shoes life itself is a moral gamble and morality is situational and relative for another book on moral grayness and being stranded at sea i highly recommend the nonfiction \"in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex\" by nathaniel philbrick","1501":"a great book about being stranded on a lifeboat for a long period of time what happens if or when they are rescued","1502":"quick read but too many unanswered questions why bring up blake and the gold and the mysterious box if it really doesn't add to he story and you aren't going to explain it anyway i think it should have been developed more","1503":"i love unreliable narrators especially when it's possible that they are telling themselves stories and not just pathological liars in 1914 grace is crossing the atlantic ocean on an ocean liner when the ship sinks this book is her journal telling the story of survival on a lifeboat and greater far reaching stories lie hidden between the details she shares i found the book's premise fascinating and grace is a complex if not likeable narrator readers may have a variety of reactions to the author's choice of an ending","1504":" i'm always looking for books that push all the buttons the lifeboat does it's just the right mix of smart and creepy suspenseful yet not constrained by the genre demands of suspense with a capital s literary but not precious or writerly i also love a well done unreliable narrator and grace winter is a wonderful gift in that department you complete believe her as a character without entirely believing her testimony this is historical fiction of the best sort without a whiff of sentimentality or fetishism of the past i very much enjoyed the constraints and particularities the 1914 setting gave the book particularly the canny use of the women's suffrage movement normally so dry no pun intended but i never felt the historicism got in the way of the book's or the characters' depth or the tight plotting read the lifeboat if you wished titanic was directed by roman polanski if you liked the literary creepiness of sarah waters' the little stranger or the manipulative self consciousness of the narrator of we need to talk about kevin than this one is for you in other words the lifeboat is delicious treat and just the sort of beach read that will make you appreciate the dry land at your feet and look at your fellow beach goers with a bit of a shudder","1505":"brutal but fascinating interesting exploration of how civilized people behave when they are thrust into a desperate situation and how society views those actions after the fact can't say i enjoyed it exactly but it's well written and thought provoking","1506":"didn't love or even care for any of the characters found it hard to finish","1507":"i still haven't decided if i liked it or hated it i'm glad i read it though","1508":"i did not enough this book we had to read for bookclub and it was a book i had to force myself to read nothing moving about anyone in this book not well written","1509":"twenty two year old grace winters is one of the few lucky survivors of the sinking of the empress alexandra and is on trial that's all we know for now and then the book takes us to grace in a lifeboat with 40 other people told from grace's point of view we get to know the varying personalities in the boat it was interesting to know what was going on in grace's mind and what happens when human beings are trying to survive anything else i write would be a spoiler but i definitely recommend the book","1510":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is the first book by this author i could not relate to the characters the story is about a group of people stuck on a lifeboat after fourteen days the journal stops although you know that sometime later they were rescued the most vivid memories would logically be the most recent ones but the author ignores the discovery of the lifeboat i had to struggle to finish the book","1511":"this book about a group of people stranded together on a lifeboat circa the titanic era is compulsively readable fascinating characters unpredictable plot and an intriguing female narrator","1512":"liked the layers and how flawed each character was","1513":"interesting book of shipwreck survival from a woman's point of view looks at each character appraisingly the shady crewman the late husband the lawyer the minister the other ladies and of course herself and how she alternately depends on uses and in one case kills watch out for the passive aggressives","1514":"probably a 3 5 i really liked the premis of the story and most of the characters it does give you food for thought how would i handle being in an overcrowded lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with no help insight i don't think i would last long 0","1515":"the story riveted my attention until the very end and then as another reader said the climax and conclusion were rather flat","1516":"this would have made a great short story as a novel i thought it would never end","1517":"first time ever i think i have read a book almost all the way through and quit before the end after decided i would read the ending and the epilogue gave up on them as well i 'slogged' through hoping something would happen and ultimately didn't even care if when it did disappointing","1518":"when i was reading this book i have the feeling i had read this book before many times in many different stories it points out how the social and human rules get broken and modify when a group of people are putting in an extreme situation when life and death are put in the balance and moral standards are lowered or inexistent to grant your survival it wasn't anything new there are lots of questions that are not answered not like some of these stories that you could make your own answer no no answer at all no comment or tip that make you think something could be one way or another i know life doesn't always give you all answers... there is one character that i believe it's meant to sound irish or scottish but in my head and after reading some of the reviews in the heads of some other readers sounded like one of the character for the pirates of the caribbean so it was kind of hard to take seriously... the book overall was ok","1519":"very quick easy read and quite good written by a westport native","1520":"seeing the story events through grace's eyes the narrative voice made it had to follow at times it was all about grace and even having finished the book several days ago i still don't know if i really trused or liked her as some of the other reviewers i too questioned the feasibility of the surveyors facing murder charges once they were rescued interesting concept for a first time writer","1521":"it was interesting but felt like grace was not developed enough too many unexplained parts of the story for my liking","1522":"i don't know how i even finished this book i don't believe it is an honest portrayal of how people would act given the circumstances","1523":"i learned about this book in the book movement newsletter where it was recommended as top selection for book groups great storytelling and multiples themes power tradition role of gender and the complex moral ethical and psychological dynamics that are unearthed as one pursues survival the central moral issue is it ethically acceptable to allow or compel the weakest to die so the majority may live complex as the central character grace chooses survival","1524":"this should have been a quick read however i struggled to get through it the author's writing style caused me to feel very removed u0026amp dispassionate about the fate of the people in the lifeboat","1525":"read it in one go on the plane great read","1526":"i resisted this book for some time because of the plot premise my friend sandy recommended it though so i gave it a chance and found it completely absorbing as an experienced open sea sailor the survival aspects were quite plausible i was a little distracted by the number of characters at first but the people sorted themselves out nicely the main character grace is very well drawn with utterly believable complexities and contradictions that are artfully revealed not perfect but a thumpin' good read","1527":"the storyline of the people in a lifeboat seemed less than lifelike but the moral issues raised and the characters kept my interest and i was entertained this is a great book club kind of book as the issues faced by the survivors would make an interesting discussion","1528":"could have been a great story line but was not","1529":"i found this book hard to continue reading towards the middle because no new information was being provided on the characters situations or lives prior to the lifeboat i continued on but wanted more detail at the end than was given which pretty much sums up my feelings of the whole thing","1530":"novel274 pgsa great novel that can be discussed on many different levels but yet so simple the shipwreck and survival in the lifeboat of a regular person was a refreshing angle there were no superheros just people trying to survive","1531":"i had high hopes for this book but it just seemed to go on and on it wasn't very compelling or dramatic at all","1532":"this had all the right elements to be a great book i loved reading it and it was a great concept but the author dropped the ball big time nothing was tied up at all annoyingly she wrote in little mysteries that kept me reading the whole time and then never answered any of them","1533":" great premise great read right up until the last chapter for me it's clear the reader isn't supposed to want more from the ending but i couldn't help myself which is odd considering how much i generally love open endings still a very well written book conflict to die for characters to consider long after the last page is turned may none of us ever end up in a lifeboat for 21 days on the open sea with a power and gender struggle going on much better to read these things than to experience them firsthand now the night circus that i would love to experience firsthand as long as i got my choice of character to be that last thought actually has nothing to do with the lifeboat does it well deal with it","1534":"made it a third of the way in the writing style was passive and dull lots of telling and not showing decided it wasn't worth finishing","1535":"felt like there could have been a stronger ending","1536":"what did i just read there are so many unanswered questions i did not like grace at all something is very suspicious about her the author hints at it but doesn't give you anything i was hoping for a lot more from this read","1537":"it forces us to ask what we'd do in that situation stuck on a lifeboat facing certain death it's only a matter of time before the survivors start to turn on eachother there's no heroes here no real good guys it's actually hard to root for any of them an unreliable narrator isn't helping things either","1538":"truly unputdownable and exciting not only was the setting fantastic 3 weeks on a lifeboat in the middle of the atlantic ocean but the heroine a slightly mysterious unsettling young woman came out with wonderful words of wisdom and thoughts surrounding the dreadful situation she and the 38 others were in beautifully written the story filled the book from cover to cover and i'd recommend it if nothing else you will feel fortunate that your feet are on solid ground","1539":"pretty disappointed i chose this for my pick this month in book club it could have been a really great book but it never seemed to really take off or close i kept waiting for something but nothing ever happened","1540":" i really thought this would be fascinating it sounds like a compelling story i listened to the audiobook and the narrator was engaging and talented but after 3 or 4 days in the lifeboat i really didn't care what happened while they were at sea i was more interested in following the teaser laid down in the prologue so i skipped ahead a few chapters u0026amp listened from there to the end and was satisfied i think it's a bad sign that the book couldn't hold my interest though spoiler alert saying she just couldn't remember several days when she was trying to reconstruct recollect the journey just seemed like a cop out on the author's part as if to say all the important plot points had happened so there was no point talking about the journey in the lifeboat any more she remembered everything up until that point in agonizing detail that just seemed lazy to me","1541":"great book for book groups made me wonder what i would do in the same situation","1542":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book captured my attention for the first two thirds while all the drama was unfolding in the boat it felt very character and plot driven and i was hooked then it switched part way through to the drama in the prison courtroom side of things and my i felt the pace just stopped for me it became much more philisophical and while this was interesting as well after the intense days in the boat that had just been described it felt lacking good book overall and lots to think about how reli this book captured my attention for the first two thirds while all the drama was unfolding in the boat it felt very character and plot driven and i was hooked then it switched part way through to the drama in the prison courtroom side of things and my i felt the pace just stopped for me it became much more philisophical and while this was interesting as well after the intense days in the boat that had just been described it felt lacking good book overall and lots to think about how reliable is a narrator when does survival outweigh harm to others more","1543":" every bit as compelling as the professional reviews say you're apt to finish it in one sitting its really not as gory or gruesome as i imagined it though ostensibly written by protagonist grace winter as a recollection of events to support her defense at trial for the murder of one of her fellow passengers it's a much more introspective read than one would guess at first glance yes people die drown and there are power struggles during the lifeboat's 21 day saga but these are described by a woman who has a calm detachment who is steady and deliberate and reflective a woman whose recollections bring the reader reason to re think things too to wonder at the culpability and motivation of many a character given their previous and present circumstances i really enjoyed it i suspect that it will play out as a thinking persons book and less so a blockbuster for the masses unless of course they make a major motion picture out of it","1544":"after reading all of the positive reviews i really wanted to like this book but i can't even finish it i'm bored it's just not holding my attention the suspense the author is trying to create feels so fake and after 140 pages i still haven't developed any sort of bond with the main character grace bon voyage lifeboat","1545":"seems so simple a concept 39 people stuck in a lifeboat trying to survive and in the 21 days that follow while awaiting rescue all boundaries of humanity are tested in that lifeboat beautifully written with a simple narrative that tells a story on so many levels this surely will be on the best books of 2012 list","1546":"that was awesome read it","1547":"the author made me feel as though i was part of the drama and hardships that unfolded on the lifeboat at times while reading this book i wondered what i would do in that situation i'm sure the people on the lifeboat never thought that they would be capable of the things they needed to do to survive or in some cases give up i was drawn into the story to the point where at times i felt as though i could be the 40th member","1548":"i very much enjoyed this book overall it was well written and i liked the format in which the story unfolded as a retrospective diary written by grace in preparation for her trial i found her to be 'real' she voiced thoughts that were both honest and a bit contemptible at times but i liked her in spite of it i thought the ending could have been fleshed out a bit more given the detailed description of her thoughts throughout the ending felt somewhat abrupt and lacking in the same depth of thought as the rest of the novel however i didn't dislike the way the story ended overall i would recommend the book as an absorbing thought provoking read","1549":"39 people ended up on a lifeboat after the ship they were sailing on capsized the book depicts how these people fared in such a crisis and how their lives were forever changed i'd give it 3 1 2 stars i liked the story and some of the writing was really beautiful but the characters were a little flat for me except for the main character grace","1550":"every now and again a book seems to leap off the shelf at me at the library this was one that pulled at me until i finally checked it out taking place two years after the sinking of the titanic the lifeboat is the story of a young woman newly married the ship that she and her husband are on sinks and she is thrust on a lifeboat with 38 other people after 21 days those remaining alive are rescued and she along with two other women find themselves accused of murder the author did a superb job of getting into the heads of her characters what happens to your mind when you don't know if you will live or die and have no control over your environment excellent novel","1551":"i've had to really think about what i want to say in my review because i'm so torn was it entertaining i suppose was it a good book that's where i'm not sure the story is about a 22 year old woman freshly married to a rich man who survives a luxury ocean liner's sinking only to be stranded on a lifeboat with nearly forty other people very interesting premise and it's a quick read that a person can fly through but i have some issues with it first no time and i mean no time is spent explaining the characters their motivation what they look like where they're from nothing i struggled to care one way or another about any of the characters simply because i wasn't given any information about them second the main character grace is a wishy washy mess i don't know if she's supposed to be this way or is just a poorly written character she had no emotion never reacting to anything around her even when a woman accused her of being the reason the woman's own daughter had died she just sat there third the character of hardie a shipmate who became the obvious captain of the lifeboat was never given a chance to be interesting the author changed her mind frequently about his character sometimes marking him as odious and saintly within the same page i'm sure this was intentional to show how your mind can go back and forth when in danger but i just found it annoying one more dislike the actual reason behind the sinking was never explained nor what happened to any of the other survivors an idea of gold being on the ship was introduced and then abandoned and i never knew why stories of gold or malevolent crewmen were even introduced if the author didn't plan on following up with them overall i read the book in a couple of sittings and was always excited to pick it back up but i don't know that i actually liked it weird how that works","1552":"i read this book during our cruise vacation it was a very well written book about grace winter newly married and also newly widowed she and fellow shipmates find themselves in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean weighed down by too many people and the real possibility of the lifeboat sinking they are challenged and find that when it comes to survival the human instinct can make us do things we would never do during times of plenty very good book if you like books about surviving in the face of certain death this book is for you","1553":"was tense all the way through","1554":"i listened to this on cd in the car and enjoyed it very much i love stories about people who overcome adversity and this did book not disappoint the reader on the audiobook did a great job i felt like i was there great job to this new author","1555":"pretty good book great idea but i was left with lots of questions at the end","1556":"had high expectations and was disappointed","1557":"1914 grace has secretly married a rich banker and they're heading to new york when their ship sinks she's in a lifeboat that's overloaded some people must go grace is telling the story of the three weeks they spend in the lifeboat a really good story and well written","1558":"this book is such a disappointment it had all the right ingredients to be an amazing book but the author either lacked imagination or wit to carry it through imagine a ship sinks and there are 39 survivors on a lifeboat... there are soo many interesting directions the author could have taken this plot yet she kept us hostage in a substandard plot i am a little upset at rogan i have to admit she really had the right idea but just could not bring it to fruition i felt she should have had two persons doing the narration so the readers would have gotten a more in depth look at the different characters in the boat the protagonist i felt was too weak to take on a narration such as this and i felt it coming to the 5th chapter the characters all lacked depth and were underdeveloped again a great idea but terrible execution","1559":"engaging book and i wanted to know more about the characters and what happened to the ship","1560":"really giving it a 3 5 but wasn't quite enough for me to go with a 4 star rating i enjoyed reading it and will recommend it to friends","1561":"i enjoyed the book as a whole but i felt there were several story lines that were introduced and never followed up i'd definetly recommend the book though","1562":"good use of ambiguity and the unreliable narrator","1563":"well written with plausible characters and scenes although i never felt as if i was 'in' the boat merely looking on i still don't really know why the women did what they did entertaining not enthralling","1564":"definitely found this novel compelling u0026amp couldn't put it down it's written in a very simple and believable manner really enjoyed it","1565":"found this a strange story can't say i would recommend to anyone read through the lifeboat experience expecting a really dramatic ending but it was a bit like a deflated balloon","1566":"this is a vividly and beautifully written book charlotte rogan clearly has talent as a writer however where the narrator was meant to appear complex and conflicted she seemed more to me to be flipping backwards and forwards between extreme thoughts and emotions with no explanation as to how or why she has changed her mind also i felt that the story continually hinted at twists that never came which was very frustrating what it does do very effectively however is examine human beings' reaction to high pressure situations the other characters are often more clearly drawn than the protagonist i'd be very eager to see what charlotte rogan's next book has to offer but for me this one promised a great deal but fell a little flat","1567":"3 5 starsi picked this to read as i recently read unbroken which covers in good part a miraculous story of surviving an extended lifeboat period before being rescued i think it colored my response to this book despite the big differences in setting which include a lifeboat that started out with 39 passengers which meant a great deal more interactions that is reminiscent of lord of the flies except on a boat in the middle of the ocean the narrative jumps around the timeline but very early on we know that the lead character is being tried for murder along with two other women regarding something that happened on the boat with regards to recommendation i would do so because it's likely that others would enjoy it more provided you did not also just read unbroken","1568":"i enjoyed this book it was well written with a flawed protagonist questions abound regarding how to morally survive a life and death situation what sacrifices would you make interesting choices by grace who was deceitful but also indecisive she's a survivor which she realizes near the end","1569":" the review was first posted at my blog http ifnotread wordpress comthe lifeboat is a very good reason why i keep my hand in contemporary fiction i'm not enthusiastic about contemporary fiction i have my tendencies and why shouldn't i read what i'm partial to right contemporary fiction keeps me in the loop i can follow the 'buzz' and bookish discussions online if i've read n w or jasper jones or past the shallows sometimes the experience is serendipitous christos tsiolkas' the slap and sometimes the experience leaves me shaking my head with disappointment jonathan franzen's freedom the lifeboat follows a group of people on a lifeboat after the main ship the empress alexandra catches fire and subsequently sinks initially i could not separate this story from the true disastrous event of the sinking of the titanic especially since this story is set in 1914 two years after the sinking of the titanic rogan does mention the titanic which i think was a good thing it felt like it was the elephant in the room a lifeboat of people like those stranded on an island is a good setting to demonstrate a microcosm of society rogan shines the light on people in a dire situation clearly showing the fight or flight in all of us in discussing the possibility that someone should 'volunteer' themselves to the sea as the lifeboat is overcrowded the narrator grace a young newly wed thinks it seemed to me that someone weak like mary ann or maria would be the obvious choice but when one of the men...pointed out that men were more useful than women in these circumstances and that if anyone should be sacrificed it should be a woman i was horrified yet on some level i agreed with him rogan's strength comes through when she writes about the immensity and the mystery of the sea in the early days of drifting in the lifeboat grace tells us how she feels about the sea ...i put my hand down to touch the water it was very cold and seemed to pull seductively at my fingers though this effect was not really due to anything about the water and was more a product of the motion of our little boat through it and maybe partly the work of my imagination as well it also highlights the tricks that our minds can play on us especially in this situation when both the mind and body are under extreme stress furthermore there is mystery surrounding what really transpired in the boat i didn't particular like grace a product of her generation with the unfortunate circumstances surrounding her mother and father and the subsequent demotion in societal status grace would rather marry a 'successful' man than lower herself to become a governess i was torn with this book like i am with a lot of contemporary fiction i read i certainly couldn't put the book down until i finished it the story was compelling and the pace equally so the setting and 'feel' was intriguing and mysterious it was a good read but it didn't floor me i like to be floored people","1570":"i really want to give this book four stars but three is what it deserves what started out as a great page turner that i couldn't wait to pick up each day turned seriously ho hum by the last third the ending was pretty disappointing bummer","1571":"i was one of the first people to get this at my library and it was good but i expected so much more it wasn't as thrilling as i thought it would be and even though it did psychoanalyze people and there decisions when it comes to survival i wanted more for me it was just kind of blah but had the potential to be so much more the best part was the characters i did get a good feel for them and related to some which is important for me as a reader","1572":"review to follow","1573":" this was an o k book it wasn't mind blowing but i wanted to finish it essentially it's a study of human nature and reactions to tragedies a luxury cruise ship sinks in 1914 on its way from london to new york a group of 39 survivors are stranded on a lifeboat which is at capacity for 21 days after several frustrating days they begin turning on one another what follows is s version of lord of the flies but in tight quarters on a boat when the survivors what's left of them are finally rescued some are put on trial for the atrocities committed on the boat it's unique in that the action primarily takes place on a small boat there are several flashbacks along the way the writing was very good i appreciated that the language was appropriate for 1914 the book could certainly be studied in a literature class or book club for its themes however i didn't find it to be the page turner that others did i wanted to know the end so i kept reading but i still had some questions when i finished it","1574":"i liked this book a lot it's suspenseful and the narrator is so compelling a strong voice a great debut novel the reason i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the courtroom scene near the end where the lawyers argue a theoretical scenario i didn't think it worked as well as it could have but that's just a ding i stayed up late to finish this book and i haven't done that in a long time","1575":"3 5 stars review to follow but was a fast addicting read that i had to force myself to look up and say oh hello world you do exist still and you kept going while i was in a three hour book trap anyhow","1576":"about half way through i would've given this a full 5 stars i was loving the story and charlotte rogan's style of writing and both are definitely worth reading this book for but i think the ending might have been able to 'flow' better with the earlier parts as there seemed quite a sudden disconnection from the main story at such an interesting point which i found a bit frustrating still i really enjoyed the lifeboat its exploration of the human psyche in an extreme survival situation had me flipping through the pages late in to the night","1577":" reason for reading i enjoy survival at sea stories and this immediately brought to my mind both the titanic and the alfred hitchcock movie of the same name i enjoyed this book it is short and a quick read and yet i found it didn't live up to my expectations or perhaps its full potential i found the plot very predictable and kept waiting for a twist or shock to come into play but every time anything of consequence happened it was already something i expected to happen i kept reading though because i couldn't believe that was all there was to the story and that some startling reveal was going to made at any point but it failed to come the story followed its expected outcome and ended quietly on that note as stated i did enjoy the story it is an interesting study in personalities when they are confined together in peril and how they will react grace herself i found to be an unlikeable character from the beginning she is rather cold and calculating in her motives even before the shipwreck she is an unreliable narrator and yet her true character easily shows through which is one point which makes the book so predictable i haven't read any other reviews of this book yet but i have a feeling that this is a book some people will absolutely love while others not so","1578":"charlotte rogan's the lifeboat was the r in my a z of authors my mum had read the book and i was intrigued and excited to have a go i'd never read a book like this but it was the kind of film that i would go and see we meet grace winter recently married and being charged for murder she is the character that leads us through the story from meeting her husband henry to being on the lifeboat and the consequences of what happened i personally did not find her a very likeable character she is strong which is a nice change especially for the time period but she seems to think little of anyone else her choice at the end of the book is really disappointing to me but i'll get onto that later the book goes back and forth from the events on the lifeboat to the trial the lifeboat sections are really exciting i was hooked on every word every action every thought the trial and meetings with her lawyers weren't so gripping i found myself wanting to be back on the boat rogan creates a menagerie of characters all of which are interesting and unique at the beginning it's a bit hard to keep track of them all but as you can probably guess that gets easier over time this is one of the quickest books i've ever read i was travelling back and forth to my home town at the time and i do read more on the train but not this quickly the reason why i only gave this three was honestly because of the ending the book kind of fizzles out there's no twist or sudden surprise it just ends and i was left with that feeling of injustice i wanted there to be something more and there wasn't","1579":"a real page turner who could know how we would react to such dire conditions good character development","1580":"the situation was terrifying the sea faring descriptions the historical panorama and the setting were handled expertly","1581":"crisp writing with a good use of wrenching detail","1582":" reasonably involving from the outset but more a psychological thriller than an action adventure contrary to what the blurb had me believe this dark turbulent tale is centred on 'the notion that a person's choices are only rarely between right and wrong or between good and evil' a notion most poignantly presented in the choice of which passengers to save and which to dump into the icy ocean but the book is marred by an indistinct semi passive narratorial voice and the completely random emergence of the 'plank theory' in the trial at the tale's close these two features cost it two stars i'm sorry to say all the same it's worth the read if the fragility of human life and the daily avoidance of death are issues that at all interest you","1583":"while it was a quick easy read i didn't find it very enjoyable the narrator is a very unlike able character passive and manipulative to the extreme traits which allow her to survive the shipwreck but do not endear her to the reader i thought there would be a bit more focus on the ethical decision of how to decide who survives but while there is some discussion of it in the book it mostly surrounds grace and her passivity in not doing something might be one that others enjoy but i can't recommend it","1584":"waste of time no story and boring characters","1585":"i felt like i was in the lifeboat waiting for this book to end i found it difficult to keep track of who was who on the boat i didn't care for grace or any of the other people in the boat it was ok but i wouldn't recommend it","1586":"it was an okay read i really thought the author could have done so much more with the characters i felt i was left hanging in some areas of the book i am floored to hear that they might make a movie out of this book","1587":"think titanic castaway and lord of the flies all in one slow moving and way too expository for me piggy and ralph are much more entertaining","1588":" grace is in a lifeboat cast off from the sinking ship the empress alexandra she has no idea where her husband henry is but suspects he went down with the ship what happens in this lifeboat is a microcosm of life and a compelling story there are too many people in the boat and decisions have to be made about who stays and who goes the sailor from the ship who is so in charge at the beginning begins to deteriorate and a small group of women take charge grace is caught up in the drama first she sees the sailor as a friend then she begins to identify with the women she contemplates her life with henry and wonders if she would have been really happy with him the beginning of the novel tells us that she and two of the other women in the boat are accused of murdering the sailor in charge how this comes about and how the people in the lifeboat comport themselves is a thoughtful treatise on what is important in life and how we relate to each other in a hostile world very readable","1589":"this review has been hidden

interesting to me when i read the summary but in actuality was boring there was no real action or excitement in the book despite there being several events that should have been exciting or at least interesting a shipwreck a revolution of sorts on a lifeboat and a trial for one's life all of these could have been really intriguing but the way the book was written they just fell flat for me in fact i was bored most of the book was made up of grace the main character recalling her experience in the lifeboat waiting to be rescued to focus on this out of all the aspects of the story the author could have focused on this was a mistake i feel basically all the passengers were just waiting for someone to save them and starving to death eventually there was a mutiny but even that was lackluster and over way too quickly the action in this plot was sorely lacking which made a somewhat exciting premise boring and hard to read in actuality also the way the book was written was just confusing and made no sense at first they were on the ship and recounting all the days on the ship then grace was remembering henry and how they met and then they were in the courtroom after being saved and then she was looking back and we finally find out how they were saved and how they killed hardie i felt the author should have either explained everything linearly or should have set the book as grace in prison recollecting what happened but instead the book was all over the place i had a hard time following it and getting into the book finally i disliked most of the characters in this book most of all grace i felt that she never really loved henry even though she claims she did and i found her to be conniving and a gold digger she saw henry written up in the paper and decided she wanted to marry him because of his fortune and even orchestrated their meeting she did not care for anyone but herself and was also completely guilty of killing hardie merely because in her own words she wanted to side with those who had the power in the lifeboat in order to ensure her own survival she ended up getting away with killing hardie and moved on to marry her lawyer simply because he also had money she was cruel anytime she talked about her sister being a governess and seemed to look down upon her for deciding to work and support herself i found her character to be one that bended the truth to suit her own needs and perhaps that was why she always seemed to be confused by what decisions to make and how to answer a question etc i feel grace was more intelligent and calculating than she let on and was in fact guilty of murder and also probably knew that she got on the lifeboat due to a bribe to begin with i didn't care for the characters of mrs grant and hannah either the only ones i liked being mary ann and hardie and some of the male characters overall i was not a fan of this book and it took me a long time to get through it even though it was only 275 pages not a good read more","1590":" this book started out with great promise the dramatic sinking of the empress alexandra the awkward shock of finding 37 strangers crammed together in a small boat the enforced brutality of having to turn away more desperate passengers in the water from the already overcrowded lifeboat i was interested in the genteel victorian dignity of the women as they had to deal with sanitary issues sitting shoulder to shoulder with so many strangers and i looked forward to getting to know the other individuals on the lifeboat as the days passed and their situation got more and more desperate this early promise quickly died away the characters aboard the lifeboat were not distinct enough and none of them created any real empathy with the reader small stories such as grace's controversial marriage or the mysterious cargo of gold bullion aboard were never explored in enough depth - all of these tantalising leads just faded away before the reader could really engage with them despite the rave reviews from around the world i did not enjoy this book at all i felt that the author merely scratched at the surface of the characters especially the narrator grace so many opportunities excite the reader were missed that by the end all that we were left with was a wandering aimless plot shallow and un empathic characters and lack lustre descriptions of the sea charlotte rogan took her inspiration from reading about 19th century legal cases in which survivors of shipwrecks were tried for their actions at sea but this book had no real historical feel or drama to it others have described it as multi layers and perhaps i am missing some of the subtle drama - but when i turned the last page my overriding feelings were boredom and disappointment","1591":"the buildup was fantastic the pay off was disappointing","1592":" i was to stand trial for my life i was twenty two years old i had been married for ten weeks and a widow for over six grace pg 6 prologue step onto this little lifeboat with our fellow survivor grace and you won't forget it even long after you've disembarked i started rereading the beginning a bit zealously to see if i missed any details i was that hooked i was reminded a bit of life of piwith healthy dollops of hitchcock sarah waters and shirley jackson another tale that comes to mind is in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex this is a ship wreck story but so much more than that what happens when people are reduced to merely surviving how do we rationalize our behavior this kept me guessing and riveted til the end in it's sly understated way if you liked book lord of the flies|7624 you'll thoroughly enjoy this little yarn","1593":"i liked the story to start but just got tired of life on the lifeboat great storyline just lasted a bit too long","1594":"interesting story i hope i am never in such a horrible situation but i do believe that god would see me through it all a good read","1595":"started out slow but eventually caught you wondering how much food was left and water in the bottom","1596":"for a debut novel this really excelled really caught the effects on the human psyche of such a desperate plight a good read page turner with attitude","1597":"i kept feeling like i had read this story before so similar to other stories related to the titanic sinking and what went on in her lifeboats although this takes place two years after the titanic not too original but a quick read disappointed by the ending loose ends not tied up","1598":"picked up from half price books on 12 7 2015 i liked the hardback version of the book with its blue edges and blue bookmark the dynamic between men and women power and value was interesting","1599":"fairly predictable","1600":"at times this book seemed to drag","1601":"ugh i had read a great review about this book in the paper so i was excited to read it unfortunately the book was anything but exciting granted not many stories that take place in a a lifeboat can hold a candle to unbroken but still the only reason i kept reading it and gave it two stars was because the author's use of foreshadowing kept me thinking that there would be more there wasn't","1602":" this a strangely compelling book a few pages in i thought this is gonna take a while the language is quite dense and i thought how on earth will 340 pages on a lifeboat pan out well it just sucks you in and i couldn't put it down this is probably a record time for me reading a book there is so much to it that i can't possibly do it justice the writing the characters the cold of the sea wind and waves this is a story of survival that raises more questions than it answers i thought for a while about whether to give it 3 or 4 stars but in the end it deserved 5 a book that will stay with me for a while and the more i think of it the stronger it becomes","1603":"clear the decks and call in sick once you begin reading this riveting this debut book it's going to be hard to come up for air the narrator aptly named grace appears on the first pages and right away we know a few important plot points we know that grace survived on a lifeboat after her ship like the titanic two years prior goes down we also know that she is now on trial for a murder that took place during the ensuing ordeal but here's what we don't know how reliable is grace as the tale teller is she coldly capable of taking whatever actions are necessary to survive or is she simply a shell shocked bystander susceptible to the slightest suggestion in flashbacks we learn about the harsh reality of lifeboat passenger survival under the direction of one of the sea fellows named hardie the name is likely no accident like thomas hardy's characters hardie and the rest of the survivors are overwhelmingly and overpoweringly in the grip of fate and chance none of us are worth a spit grace ruminates we were stripped of all decency i couldn't see that there was anything good or noble left once food and shelter were taken away indeed as the characters are forced to endure worse and worse conditions decreasing rations of food and water the unexpected squall the weakening of body and spirit the emotional horrors of wondering about loved ones they also form alliances that are crucial in determining who will live and who will die it quickly becomes evident that some must be sacrificed for the majority to live since the lifeboat bears more people than it can safely carry there is an elegiac overlay in this tale hardie is at first regarded as all knowing and godlike in a bible parable he is able to come up with a feast of raw fish and water to feed the hungry but as hope fades and order falls apart the one time prayers become decidedly pagan a prayer of appeasement to the sea and the sea becomes as murky and cold as satan's heart not unlike coleridge's ancient mariner the journey is not just into the deepest waters but into the deepest recesses of one's own mind knowledge of the human condition is hard earned and sobering once i began this page turner it was virtually impossible to put it down the theme weaves around that crucial question during the worst of ordeals is it possible for a person to be both alive and innocent are those who are left standing survivors or murderers or put another way what would each of us do to stay alive thanks to netgalley and little brown for a galley for my kindle the opinions are entirely my own","1604":"this was a quick read i didn't want to put it down because i had to know what had happened this books gives you a lot to think about and you have to wonder how you would behave in grace's situation i finished this book this morning and find myself thinking about it for the rest of the day","1605":" this was a story that kept me reading more to see how it all turned out than from interest in the actual writing and characters it was not a bad book by any means however the main story line was depressing then the characters were depressing though in their circumstance i guess they had the right to be less than sparkling and the going back and forth from boat to trial was a bit put offing for me since it basically gave most of the who if any survives secrets away which before starting i thought would be the big secret could be i should have read the summary better it was a quick read a little blah with not one character that made me give a damn whether they actually made it or not sad to say it's been on my tbr list for a while though so glad i got it out of the way","1606":"am so engrossed in this book that all the heat odors grumbling and jostling on the subway are taking a backseat","1607":"i liked this book but the end felt very empty like the book was wrapped up too quickly it would be a 4 star read for me with a little more substantial ending","1608":" two years after the titanic sank the cross atlantic ship on which the female narrator is a passenger goes down and only a few lifeboats are successfully launched the story moves along quickly with the expected circumstances with the author raising moral existential questions there is a thread of suspense throughout that kept me reading without this hook i may have stopped reading as i found this to be more of the same another sinking ship survival story there was however good character developement which i like","1609":"i expected quite a bit more out of this book to be honest and strangely it never mentioned the titanic which i found very odd though at the end it did mention the lusitania the plot itself was interesting and i imagine the effects of being stuck in a lifeboat for so long were pretty accurate dehydration starvation fatigue dementia but what made me dislike the book was the way it was written in some areas it was circular and hard to keep up with grace's thoughts that's essentially what it was in part a diary written after they were rescued and at other times there was so much prose that it was just plain hard to understand if it was written as a diary she wouldn't have written it in that style it's hard to explain which is why i had such a hard time with the writing style also throw into the mix the fact that the sailor they had on board talked like a pirate which was laughable since the setting is 1914 and everyone spoke very proper english as i said i expected a lot more out of this book","1610":"this book started off strong but just didn't develope also the second book i've read this week with a weak ending","1611":"while this is undoubtedly an original and well written book it just didn't grab me i gave up halfway through as i was finding myself with no inclination to pick it up every time i put it down this may well say more as to my taste mood than the book though","1612":"my mil suggested this book to me for over half the book i was trying to figure out why grace the main character was on trial for murder when that plot point was revealed i was left trying to decide if grace was innocent or not and what should happen to her i think this book would be fantastic for a book club to read because there are so many different aspects to talk about with this book this is a book to talk about for sure","1613":" i saw this book mentioned on another blog shortly before publication and just before the anniversary of the sinking of the titanic the cover and title caught my eye i knew it wasn't about the titanic but still thought it sounded interesting the story starts when we meet grace a young widow and newlywed who is on trial for murder grace has recently married a wealthy young man who was presumably lost at sea weeks after their wedding when the ship they were on exploded and sank her attorney has asked her to journal about her weeks in the lifeboat in order to help him prepare for her trial grace met henry when he was engaged to another women the daughter of his mother's best friend grace is not from the same social strata as henry and he kept his marriage to her a secret from his mother until grace demands he send a wire from the ship that was hours before the ship exploded grace has no idea what kind of reception she will get from her mother in law the book was a little bit of a disappointment to me the largest portion of the book was spent on the journal and the time in the lifeboat this covered some of the events aboard the ship prior to the explosion very little time was spent on the actual trial i'm not sure what i expected in this book but i would have liked to have more insight into grace's life after the trial whether she met with her mother in law etc there is a bit of a hint given but i would have liked to have known more as much as i was disappointed in the book many readers loved it so if it looks interesting to you give it a try and i think it would make an excellent book club choice there are many possible discussion points here murder vs self defense how far do you go to survive would you sacrifice your life to save others i think this is a book that gets better with a good discussion my rating 1 2 2 1 2 starswhy did you choose this book i love the cover and the title caught my eye during my 'titanic' readingwhen did you read this book april 2012who should read this book readers of historical fiction and possibly memoir loverssource library","1614":"creepy and interesting but i felt oddly distant from both story and characters","1615":"this was a good book not a great book and not a tell everyone about it book from the first few pages the reader is let in on the general arc of the story grace snow the main character and narrator is on trial for murder as a newlywed and a widow she tells the story of how she and her groom were on an ocean liner on their return trip from europe to the u s when the ship sank she was quickly deposited in a lifeboat with 38 other people while her husband was left to fend for himself when the entire ship was finally submerged in the murky depths it became clear that there were far fewer lifeboats that passengers and the reality of survival begins to emerge the only questions left to answer were why did the boat sink how did grace secure a place on the lifeboat when it was clearly over capacity who was murdered and how long did grace and the other passengers have to wait before rescue only half of these questions are answered by the end and although this might be revealing too much i will say that the questions you are most curious about are the ones left unanswered still rogan is a good writer and although it sometimes felt like the story was dragging on it did keep my attention there were some places where the book redeemed itself simply in the wording of a few seemingly insignificant places such as when grace says to a fellow lifeboat passenger 'we are all being tested mr sinclair and i hope that my underlying nature which i am sure has been completely bared by now meets with your approval '","1616":"well written and engaging page turner","1617":"maybe my expectations were too high but this book really fell flat for me i think the idea is great and would make a great book unfortunately this book just dragged on it moved so slow","1618":"not what i had hoped fori read this in hopes that it would be a good choice for my book group it had good reviews and i wanted to like it but for me it fell flat my bias is for character driven stories and i hoped that grace would be an interesting character but in order to make her an unreliable narrator there was just too much of her withheld it just wasn't the book for me","1619":"a book about struggles and the human nature something to make you think and ponder about well written easy to read hard to put down we get a glimpse into the nature of grace our heroine and narrator and the human struggle for life against adversity a remarkable novel","1620":"ok slow start gets a little better half way through","1621":"can you be a survivor without realizing it","1622":"i believe that rogan had the idea \"what if the titanic survivors were not rescued so quickly \" which is why the story is set 2 years after the titanic sinking rogan brings to life the experience of that time with the formality class system and sexism all which break down quickly under extreme duress rogan captures the formal dialogue of that time period so well i felt like i was reading an account of a real tragedy from 100 years ago the story of the lifeboat itself isn't as interesting as the main character grace grace is an enigma you are never sure if she is a good person just trying to survive or a heartless person who is using the ship accident as an excuse for evil in any case grace is the narrator and you can't help but be on her side as the story is told thru her eyes and ears only this book makes you ponder two questions first what would you be willing to do to survive and secondly who is grace really","1623":"left me feeling that grace was more responsible than she let on","1624":"this was my summer shipwreck survivor read i imagine the choice was influenced by the titantic anniversary and the media coverage of that the story was good and plausible the the main character was well developed the others not so much i am still trying to decide if that was a writing device or not i was disappointed in the lack of development of the hardie character and unresolved issues involving him mrs grant was another character that left me wanting more","1625":"this was ok but i kept waiting for it to get interesting grace the main character and narrator seems too passive and it all became rather tedious","1626":"great writing and story i was just left wanting a lot more a lot was left out and not sure why the author would leave so many things unexplained","1627":"hmmm i rode the waves stayed with the group the ending lacked the same level of drama","1628":"high high hopes for this one what a let down i kept wishing and waiting and wishing and waiting i'm still waiting boo how did this one make it to a list of top 12 books every woman should read i clearly missed it","1629":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm not sure what to think of this book the book is told through the eyes of grace winter a survivor of the sinking of the transatlantic ship empress alexandra i enjoyed this book because i can't decide if grace is a weak victim of circumstance or the most manipulative character i've been introduced to in a long time the story is a little slow but it keeps the reader engaged because of the circumstances that grace finds herself in","1630":"i rxprcted more from this story and especially a better ending i don't know if i could make some of the decisions made by these survivors and live with myself it would have bee nice to know the back story for each survivor and this would help understand the decisions they made i think the book ended too soon and more could be written about grace's life after rescue","1631":"this book was thrilling i couldn't put it down once i started it i think the reflections on human fallibility are really powerful we all want to say that we'll be heroes in desperate situations but how do we know what we'll do i think the brilliant part of rogan's writing is the honesty with which she depicts her characters all are equally flawed and all contain pieces of ourselves really really good storytelling","1632":"good try but i just didn't like it that well","1633":"riveting and thought provoking","1634":" as the story begins we find out that grace winter 22 is on trial for murder along with two other women who were among the survivors of a shipwreck and three week ordeal aboard a lifeboat grace's attorneys have asked her to write up her recollections of the experience which comprise most of the remainder of the book as we read through what happened we realize something is very very wrong but figuring out what really happened is difficult - a matter that will no doubt have book clubs arguing for a long time grace was on the ocean liner empress alexandra with her new husband henry they were returning from europe because of the outbreak of world war i following an explosion the ship sank and grace and 38 others but not henry were put into a lifeboat with an ostensible capacity for 40 but which actually was meant for fewer persons one ship's officer mr hardie is also on board and takes charge of the group but as days go by without rescue and food and water become scarce mr hardie's authority is soon challenged by two strong women ursula grant and hannah west and the boat divides into factions measures taken for survival became more extreme the bare bones of our natures were showing none of us were worth a pit we were stripped of all decency i couldn't see that there was anything good or noble left once food and shelter were taken away \"since the book begins with the trial we know that at least these three women were eventually rescued but we don't know until almost the end how this happened and if anyone else survived discussion this is one seriously creepy story besides the unpleasantness that happens as each person's survival becomes dependent on fewer other competitors for food and water there is something quite unsettling about grace we find out a bit more about it in the epilogue but for the most part we have a narrator who as in the book liar by justine larbalestier seems to be extremely manipulative and deceptive i couldn't wait to find others who had read the book to talk about it evaluation this is a fascinating study in human behavior under the most challenging circumstances told by a narrator who may be an innocent young girl or may be a psychopath puzzling out who grace really is and what actually happened will keep readers turning the pages of this clever book","1635":"so far this is my best read of 2012 original idea great choice in writing it with a first person narrative and loved the use of flashbacks to flesh out the character grace isn't really a character you really get to know in fact you never really know know what exactly did happen and why we don't know because they are all starving and dehydrating she is at one moment meek and passive the next a gold digging calculating survivor she knows what she wants she goes out to get it and then has it all taken from her 39 people in a lifeboat 39 mouths to feed wondering when rescue is coming 39 whispered mouths gossiping and creating havoc 39 differing senses of what actually happened i loved this book","1636":"an easy read it was an alright story line weak plot and character development but if you want a quick read for a plane ride or trip of some kind this is a good one","1637":"it took such a long time to finish reading this book was the most boring book i have read the plot i guess is fine and how the it has been decided to start end end the book but how its written is very uninteresting you have to force yourself to read there isn't anything new to learn if the court case is interesting then it should have been elaborated if the part where the lifeboat is the important part then it should have been adventurous it was a time killer to read it","1638":"what people think and do when they are in difficult situations a study in survival","1639":"the day to to day hour by hour recount of details make it possible imagine 6 weeks in a life raft with rather inpleasant people what is difficult to accept is the later accusations of murder there is little joy in this tale","1640":"i enjoyed the book and the style first person narrative grace is a survivor of a sinking ship who is in a lifeboat with 39 others in a boat which was not built for 39 people at the opening of the novel she is on trial for what happened in the lifeboat she writes her story for her lawyers to prepare her defense is what she is writing designed with her own defense in mind or is it truly why happens unsure even to the end","1641":"beautiful writing a quick suspenseful read but ultimately only three stars because of the somewhat disappointing ending i finished up with a huh rather than the wow i was hoping for","1642":"i just didn't care enough to read the last 80 pages there are other books callin my name","1643":" it was an interesting story idea but it lost my attention not far into it the author tried to make the first person account of what was happening palpable in her way of presenting it but it left me skimming some pages and wanting more in other places some characters were not developed enough for me to latch onto what was happening the ones i wanted to know more about had far too brief mentions henry henry's mother etc and there were almost too many characters to keep track of throughout the ordeal the last 2 chapters made up for some of the weaknesses but still not enough to make it a good read overall not a bad read but not one i would recommend","1644":"what an anti climatic book the author builds up this story like some huge unbelievable thing is going to happen and then what really happens is not so huge and unbelievable i was so disappointed because i was really liking the book","1645":"i would have given this book four stars but it seemed to fall apart in the end after all of the suspense and going ons on the boat i expected more from the trial that said it will make for an interesting discussion at book club some decisions that were made and what was really happening had me thinking the whole time","1646":"this took me by surprise i was reading it for my book club and it certainly initially did not suck me in however grace's character intrigued me did she marry henry solely for money what was with the ending like others said sometimes it was difficult to follow all the many characters in the life boat definitely was an interesting read overall","1647":"chilling an enviable first novel that delves into what our humanity is really worth under dire circumstances grace winter will stay with you long after the final pages are done","1648":"riveting book with only a slight letdown in the book's drastic change in tone in the final chapters","1649":"i really liked the concept of this book and the way it was written it starts with the trial of a woman accused of murder and goes back to the day the ship sank before the story gets slow going over days and days of nothingness at sea the story turns back to the present the story allows the reader to decide what really happened on the ship and beyond","1650":"i thought this was a great concept for a story while the title implies the traditional got caught in a lifeboat story putting the main character on trial for her actions while in the lifeboat was compelling i enjoyed the book thought a lot about it after i finished it","1651":"the lifeboat is a straight forward simple narrative about 39 people stuck on a lifeboat after their ship has sunk in the middle of the atlantic ocean the narrator grace is a rather shadowy character that you never quite get a feel for strong yet unpersuasive deep yet very simple grace tells an interesting story that drifts between being inspirational at times to downright dark at other times survival stories are always inherently interesting as they inevitably provoke the reader to ask themselves what would i do if i were in the narrator's position aside from that aspect of the book i didn't really love it because i could never connect with any of the characters all of them except mr hardie seemed rather one dimensional and bland i kept wanting to know their motives and background but those details never really came other than in vague hint the imagery of the ocean and their surroundings were o k but nothing that left me truly lost in the setting i never felt as if i may have been on the lifeboat myself on the other hand even though it had been hinted at throughout the book the final part part iv was a nice surprise as i didn't really see it coming i enjoyed the author's choice to leave some of the mysteries unsolved and up to the assumptions of the reader but again even part iv seemed a bit weightless to me in the end because i didn't connect with the players all in all it's a decent story of survival and a study of consequences for the decisions that humans make when their lives are on the line and while it's a decent read with some fascinating questions to ask oneself it could have been so much more with better character development","1652":" while i thought the story was good and the writing was crisp i did not think this book lived up to its premise i did enjoy the one person account of what life or death was like marooned on a lifeboat with a man in charge who acted like a dictator while a very strong woman wrested from him the control of the boat one can't possibly imagine what life is like when all you see is ocean and all you think of is your survival there is much to be said about the human will to survive and even under the worst of circumstances one sees this basic element of man that is the element of survival click in the descriptions of the author arouse enough fear especially in one who does get sea sick to deal emotionally and physically with the plight of these people written from the perspective of one woman it tells the harrowing tale of survival and the ultimate way in which the human spirit fights to live or die we see how in some of us the need to survive outweighs any other need even that aversion to kill a fellow human being so that you might assured a day of two more of your very own survival i do realize that our protagonist tried to present the facts as she saw them however there was a huge sense of detachment granted i did realize that going through an experience such as grace went through is both traumatizing and brings with it a sense of how one reacts can be quite different to the way in which others conduct themselves while this was definitely an interesting read both quick and well written it did not provide me with a sense of connection to any of the characters unfortunately that made the story less than real and more of a what if scenario or perhaps better stated a news report filed by a reporter reporting on events while it is newsworthy at the time it loses the hold it should have on people and the emotional sympathy ones needs in reading of a tragic event","1653":"i started this book enthusiastically enough but reading about people trapped in a lifeboat out at sea made me feel a little anxious it'd be one of my worse nightmares the story was based on the sinking of a ship similar to the titanic story and written by a survivor it had promise but having taken quite a break from reading i found it difficult to return and difficult to summon up any great desire to finish it","1654":"astute and conniving grace winter will use any stratagem to secure her own happy ending after the collapse of her father's business she seduces a rich husband in order to have a wealthy life she becomes separated from her husband after he puts her on a lifeboat after a shipwreck they spend days stranded at sea struggling with resources men and women have to make moral choices fighting to stay alive the book is very well written and interesting from the first page to the last you wonder through this nightmarish situation what would i do","1655":"brilliant felt like i was on the boat too fortunately i wasn't","1656":" the lifeboat completely enthralled me from the first page to the last the premise is very simple an ocean liner sinks and 39 people crowd into a lifeboat that wasn't constructed for so many what lengths will they go to survive it's a story of survival at its core but also a philosophical medication on morality and the human desire to live as well as a character study filled with depth grace our heroine is the quintessential unreliable narrator and a wonderfully complex character i'm completely amazed that this is charlotte rogan's first novel the depth of the character work and the architecture of plot revelations are incredible i was torn between wanting to speed through the book to find out what happened and wanting to slow down and savour every word gorgeous writing that has a lot to say about the human existence and a woman's place in the world","1657":"really liked this one","1658":"a group of people are trapped in a lifeboat and story of how they choose to survive couldn't get into this at all","1659":"i liked this book a lot it helped me to imagine what i might do in their predicament","1660":"similar to life of pi but without the allegory","1661":" oftentimes i am drawn in by a novel description and let down by the novel itself for this book i am in the strange position of thinking that the book sounded terrible but actually finding it to be far more enjoyable than i ever expected this is not merely another stuck in the ocean for a ridiculously long time while people die book it is an interesting look into the human psyche the year is 1914 and the narrator is a complex and interesting woman who doesn't even seem to know her own mind i definitely think one of the reasons i enjoyed this book so much more than i expected to was because there were many characters in it some of the other comments mention being confused but the author i think did an excellent job of only dealing with a few characters at a time so as to mimimize confusion in other books and movies which follow a similar plotline there is often only one character who survives whether it be on an island on a raft or in a boat in this case there is enough interaction between the characters to prevent it from getting repetitive or monotonous i don't think i like the ending though perhaps i'll come around but that's not the point of the book overall the book presents an interesting look into our basic humanity and the struggle between compassion and the survival instinct it causes the reader to question what s he would do in a similar situation with no judgement or clear answers provided by the author is grace likeable most people it seems from the other comments do not think so i'm not sure about that yet either i'll have to think about it some more but again that's not really the point of the book is she to be blamed for her actions i'll let you decide","1662":"great book with interesting insights into what makes people tick in a difficult situation although the majority of the action takes place in a small boat the book never gets boring","1663":"many disturbing elements makes one even more distrustful of people and afraid of boats","1664":"it was honestly a boring book the author took a cool topic and what had the makings to be an interesting plot and placed boring characters into it which made the book well boring frankly i really hated grace how she was more of an observer and a want to be intellectual she tried to hard she was focused on status and even at the end of the book all she cared about was who made the most money she married henry for status and it's questionable whether she ever really loved him as she said she married the lawyer because she gave him butterflies okay so what emotions are supposed to go both ways so overall characters sucked but the plot was good so three stars","1665":" thirty nine people in one lifeboat adrift for many weeks waiting for rescue some strong some not rogan takes what is a relatively simple plot line and than fills it with moral ambiguities and decisions that keeps the reader wondering what will happen next not sure what i think of the main character and narrator grace we are filled in on her back story except to say that i felt she was definitely an opportunist but above all she is a survivor not only of the ship sinking and subsequent trial but in life itself the language used is insightful and well in keeping in what was going on in the lifeboat couldn't help wondering how i would have acted if found in the same situation as these people this will make an interesting book for discussion groups as there are many different aspects of this novel that can be discussed","1666":"i loved the protagonist in this book and the explorations of ethics and survival","1667":"i wish i had someone to talk about this book with actually it might make a good book club book i was intrigued throughout but the assignment of blame lack of blame for crucial events in different instances left me wanting to rehash with a fellow reader","1668":"intriguing story 3 4 of the way the atmospheric reality of being in a life boat for 21 days the physical problems as well as psychological tension are realistically written and interesting but the ending was a bit boring and lacking revelations i had hoped for","1669":"i didn't really enjoy this book i just found it really hard to get in to the heroine was not my favorite","1670":"the premise was intriguing the resulting book was boring i simply did not care about the characters floating around in the lifeboat for 21 days i couldn't keep them straight because i was not invested in their stories the book dragged on from the beginning to the end","1671":"fascinating grim thought provoking","1672":"long on atmosphere but short on action i would have preferred less focus on the courtroom and more on the lifeboat well written and seemed well researched read in a few hours so good for those with short attention spans","1673":"well written story of survival","1674":"slow moving boring","1675":"i liked this book but afterwards wondered what was really behind grace there seemed to be a lot unsaid i enjoyed the pace and writing style of the author","1676":"nice moments lots of potential but just ok in the end a nice read but nothing special","1677":"this book was good but not as interesting as i expected it to be i really didn't like the main character which may be why","1678":"a very well written book really made me think some of the sub plots were quite intriguing though never resolved","1679":"this story pulled me in i wanted to know what was going to happen next to these people in an unfortunate situation i wondered if i was in that sinking boat if i would be a weak link or a survivor hopefully i will never know that answer i did wonder who mentioned what that got these three women charged with murder what a compelling story","1680":"don't start this book unless you can devote the day to it you will not be able to put it down","1681":"i liked this book but i didn't enjoy it i felt that it fell flat with character development and plot it could of gone in a lot more uncharted directions but i felt the author played it too safe also i don't think she had a good enough grasp on her main characters to effectively maintain the suspense","1682":"a pretty good read but a weak ending","1683":"after you've read life of pi you have high standards for lifeboat books read this one to the end mostly to figure out how reliable the narrator was unfortunately it wasn't worth my investment","1684":"excellent vivid and captivating","1685":"current book club selection chosen by me not what i expected but still an interesting read i think i would have liked more character development of grace","1686":"the book was very well written in the technical sense and i was glad to be spared the cringe worthy dialogue and descriptions of many other recent novels that i've read i was pleased with the exposition and the way in which the author provided us with information about the narrator and her past via recollections throughout the book the author thereby avoided the information dump so common at the beginning of novels i'd have liked to know more however also i liked many of the characters especially mr hardie but felt that some of the secondary ones were underdeveloped i kept getting them confused grace was very passive but believable she wasn't necessarily likeable however the premise was excellent and the author seems to know a lot about boats and the sea but she included far too many mundane details that are only of interest to seafarers and not to the average reader overall the book was much slower paced than i had expected i had to force myself to keep reading because it didn't hold my attention there wasn't enough action the idea had such potential and the writing was technically very well done but the substance was a let down i'd have given it only one or two stars if i hadn't found the author's prose to be so lyrical after reading many suspenseful plot driven novels with cheesy dialogue and corny metaphors i wish i could find more books that have the well written prose and the page turning plot but they are rare","1687":" what a fascinating tale i really liked this book and the imagery i found when i closed my eyes to try and see through the eyes of those lost at sea i was completely captivated by the harrowing journey these poor souls were subjected to and wondered what would happen if i were in similar circumstances what would i do if i were adrift at sea in an over crowded boat with a massive storm coming right at me what would you do just gut wrenching to try and imagine the plight of these few souls trapped in a boat with little to no food or drinkable water how long could you last","1688":"well overall i enjoyed this book i was sceptical at first how interesting is a story only about people stranded on a lifeboat but because of the complex characters and the intricate relationship between them i was able to get through this book fairly quickly it was not a major page turner but it did keep me interested and wanting to continue reading well written for a first time book and that is something that is rare i recommend this book but i know it will not appeal to everyone the narrative style is not always appreciated by all job well done","1689":"a fascinating account of survival but not just based on what went on in the atlantic ocean this is a story about divisions based on class money and gender","1690":" on a transatlantic cruise to america in the summer of 1914 the empress alexandra sinks under somewhat vague circumstances grace winter an attractive young woman who has just escaped her fate as a governess by seducing an already betrothed very wealthy man takes to a lifeboat that is already crowded and even less capacious than it is meant to be due to cost cutting by the ship's owners with 38 others mostly women grace drifts as storms rage and water supplies dwindle the passengers would have perished early on if it weren't for the single seaman among them mr hardie who takes control of the supplies and makes god like decisions to keep them alive he steers the boat away from a young boy clinging to wreckage and knocks swimmers trying to climb aboard back into the water there is evidence that hardie is not exactly a saint but grace is grateful for his ability to keep them afloat and comes to admire him deeply eventually the passengers realize that some of them must die that others may live however an older woman named mrs grant resents hardie's callous manner and unpopular decisions and leads a mutiny against him - which grace also goes along with she presents herself alternately as hypnotized by the charisma of hardie and grant and then as someone quite determined to survive and willing to make hard decisions on her own after their rescue grace and mrs grant are charged with murder it's a fascinating book that works as a thrilling adventure at sea an examination of the staid edwardian mores of the era and how they crumble under the unyielding reality of nature and it also serves as a deeper rumination on the ethics of group survival this is rogan's first novel but she writes with a very assured tone and rich imagery on a storm \"the boat... climbed the foamy heights of the waves and then descended into hellish troughs so that we were surrounded on four sides by walls of black water \" on thirst \"my tongue sat in my mouth like a dead animal no longer supple and quick but parched and cracking like a dried and hairless mouse\" the rickety boat the bailing and tensions that run increasingly fraught all come to life i'm not sure that rogan adequately conveys what would have been the deplorable over crowded conditions on the boat although demure not altogether reliable grace winter with her edwardian proprieties may be the one doing the skipping over in this area in any case this is a terrific book especially for a first novel and its ambiguity allows the reader to make his own conclusions about grace's culpability or what might have been the \"moral\" thing to do in such a situation","1691":" definitely a page turner i read the entire book on a long flight from ohio to colorado so i enjoyed the book because it kept me engaged after further reflection i wasn't sure how much i really resonated with the characters the protagonist grace is certainly intriguing but as the book continued i grew to like her less and less she rarely seemed an assertive figure particularly due to her actions during the trial she often came across as weak and passive and it wasn't clear to me whether that was deliberate on her part in which case i would have liked her more hey playing the legal system or if she really was that weak which seemed more likely i also thought spoiler the relationship between her and her mother in law would go somewhere unfortunately the way she treated her mil never visiting her really made me resent her as a character she was incredibly self serving but again not quite sure if that was intentional or not still i gave it 3 stars because i was hooked but i thought the character development could have been more intriguing","1692":"this was compelling enough while it was going but i have to confess pretty forgettable now it's done don't you hate that i did enjoy the hinted discussions on gender equality suffrage but i get the feeling even they were only there if you sought them out historian fairly enjoyable though i doubt i'd read it again","1693":"this was a great read i only wish it had been a bit more gripping and suspenseful","1694":"this was a very interesting book and it was hard to put it down i was glad i wasn't in that situation why did she do it","1695":"hmmm this was a little interesting and strange i'm not sure what i thought about it i wish i could do 2 and 1 2 stars because i didn't love the ending yet i still couldn't put the book down","1696":"i thought this was a great book fast read having just finished unbroken her depictions of life in a lifeboat were right on","1697":"the narrator wasn't likable and the plot was slow i ended up skimming the last third of the book i don't recommend it unless you like slow paced historical fiction that focus on helpless women","1698":"grace winter the main protagonist is an interesting character as grace tells her story of what occurred on the lifeboat you get a better understanding of why her personality is so lifeless grace comes across as calculating and void of any real emotion as she reveals bits and pieces of her life you understand she is no stranger to survival she comes across as being desensitized but on the other hand given the circumstances leaves you wondering if this is merely a weapon to survive given her past and the present ordeal she has and will have to face her flat tone and demeanor make sense i felt for her and the situations she was dealt and admired her determination to survive any situation she came across as a shrinking violet but in reality she is an iron rose i enjoyed the story i like the fact it was presented in a swift manner and the sequence of events transitioned well i appreciate the range of emotions and moral dilemmas each survivor dealt with alliances were formed and the test of ones mettle was challenged ms rogan is a talented storyteller and i look forward to her future writings difficult to believe this was her first novel","1699":" after listening to an interview with the author on bbc radio 2 i thought that i would buy the book and give it a read the subject matter is not my usual genre but the behavior of people in unusual or difficult circumstances is always interesting the premise of the novel is fairly straightforward two years after the titanic sank the empress alexandra goes down in calm seas after catching fire 38 people are in a lifeboat that is too small though it should have fitted them comfortably lifeboat 14 sits in the water up to her gunnels there are few provisions and little water on board as the row clear of the wreckage what they do not know is that it will be three weeks before they are rescued charlotte rogan has a first novel to be envied she has a gentle flowing style which drifts along like the lifeboat itself always going somewhere but you never know what will be thrown up at you next so many emotions and feelings are suppressed then vented in sudden violent squalls that you are left breathless the story is told in recollection by the main character grace winter as she writes down all that she remember as she stands trial for her life i am not one to spoil a story in a review and that i will not change but as the story is told in first person you know from the start that our lady must survive - the question is how i thoroughly enjoyed this book it is eloquent but never flowery words are not wasted to meet a publisher's word count neither are they clever the story is told at the level of the main character's intellect no mean feet when the author is quite clearly smarter than most if not all of the people in the boat a class act in story telling a definite 4 star contender","1700":"began at 4 stars and dropped into 2 star range at the end will average to 3 stars but kind of indecisive about it like the main character","1701":"i love how the plot evolves and the author slowly reveals the details and circumstances related to our narrator afloat in a lifeboat","1702":"easy read it brought up some interesting points i'm looking forward to discussing it at book group","1703":"this was a quick read but didn't stand out for me","1704":" what is it about a shipwreck that is so fascinating especially when survivors on lifeboats are involved there's just a certain something that is so scary about it imagining being out there in the middle of the ocean nothing but water as far as the eye can see and no way to know if you're going to be rescued surrounded by scary sharks and fish and whatever other business is down there in the water just waiting to pull you under and eat you so sinister the synopsis of the book made me think of the hitchcock movie lifeboat which is really incredible and should be seen by everyone ahem the book was slow going early on as grace begins her story which is told in sort of a diary format written as evidence for her upcoming trial what she is on trial for we do not know but as the story unfolds we find out exactly what's going on and why she's having to defend her actions even though some of them may not be wholly defensible grace is a tough character to like she's both devious and weak which is a deadly combination for me - and not in the badass deadly way in the \"yuck i wish you were dead\" way she's also the type who needs a man so bleh oh oh and she's conniving and a snob so as you can see i didn't care for grace at all i didn't care what happened to her and it made me struggle with the book there are definitely some male vs female gender issues at play here while they're on the lifeboat and to me that was the most interesting part watching the dynamics as people split into groups and face off with one another over control was kinda fascinating i actually found myself skimming the last chapter which should have been the most interesting part but i found it a bit info dumpy and by that point i was ready to be over with it it wasn't a bad book by any means it just wasn't my cup of tea","1705":" this is a truly engrossing tale charlotte rogan succeeds in placing us in the lifeboat with the survivors witness to all the despair and paranoia that ensues i found myself bouncing from feelings of sympathy for grace in her plight to those of frustration and even contempt for her desire to ingratiate herself with others on the boat the author deftly illustrates through grace's first person p o v the attitude with which females during that time period viewed each other as well as themselves grace's moments of clarity on humanity and destiny are expressed simply and eloquently hinting that still waters can truly run deep please excuse the water reference beautiful imagery and a bittersweet ending launched this novel straight to my list of important reads","1706":"i'm not quite sure how i feel about this book just yet maybe my opinion of it will be shaped by the amount that i reflect on it while the prose was nice and the story intriguing i never felt myself completely captured by it i think my expression changed only once while reading it had a familiar rhythm of being rocked back and forth on calm waves which fits with the plot in general definitely not a thriller but still very interesting","1707":" my book club uncorked books selected this for our june read we were all very excited based on the synopsis all 6 members were disappointed for various reasons i couldn't get invested in the characters the main character as well as quite a few others had no redeeming qualities it was like reading a newspaper account no emotion no one to root for not to mention i didn't feel the crime several characters were accused of would have been something that any prosecutor would have actually brought to trial to sum up good premise horrible execution","1708":"promised much delivered little after 250 pages i thought well i just don't care about any of these people","1709":"an engaging and enjoayable read one of those tales that prompts you to think about how you would react in such circumstances and therefore offers up opportunity to discuss with others who have read it","1710":"grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes review charlotte rogan uses a deceptively simply narrative of shipwreck and survival to explore our all too human capacity for self deception j m coetzee the lifeboat traps the reader in a story that is exciting at the literal level and brutally moving at the existential i read it in one go emma donoghue author of room what a splendid book i can't imagine any reader who looks at the opening pages wanting to put the book down it's so refreshing to read a book that is ambitious and yet not tricksy where the author seems to be in command of her material and really on top of her game it's beautifully controlled and totally believable hilary mantel author of wolf hall the lifeboat is a spellbinding and beautifully written novel one that will keep readers turning pages late into the night this is storytelling at its best and i was completely absorbed from beginning to end tim o'brien author of the things they carried in the lake of the woods july july the lifeboat is a richly rewarding novel psychologically acute and morally complex it can and should be read on many levels but it is first and foremost a harrowing tale of survival and what an irresistible tale it is terrifying intense and like the ocean in which the shipwrecked characters are cast adrift profound valerie martin author of property and the confessions of edward day about the author charlotte rogan studied architecture at princeton university graduating in 1975 she lives in westport connecticut this is her first novel","1711":" this book about a group of people adrift on a lifeboat after an ocean liner disaster in 1914 has it all suspense interesting moral dilemmas good writing a likeable main character...okay scratch that last one the narrator of this compelling story is grace winter newly married to wealthy henry who presumably died in the accident we learn early in the book that she and others from the lifeboat have been saved but are being tried for the murder of one of the other shipwreck victims it's a fast read and hard to put down people will talk about the ethical dilemmas portrayed as food and water run out on the boat but the core of the book for me was grace and her essential weakness narcissism and lack of self knowledge she is male identified to the point that we cannot trust her portrayal of any other women in the story she is the ultimate survivor but at what cost i imagine a rousing book club debate between grace admirers and grace detractors i'm a detractor but i really liked the book","1712":"39 people on a life boat built for less after a shipwreck this got my attention immediately and was an interesting read but the ending was just meh i know she was exploring the darker side of survival instincts but i believe people would choose better than that i couldn't really figure grace out but maybe that was the point just ok for me","1713":"3 5 because you can't tell if the characters are good or bad especially when you can only take their word for it","1714":" charlotte rogan is clearly talented and the lifeboat is very well written but for me the book just never took off and became memorable i was intrigued and creeped out by the book within the first 20 pages or so and then it just seemed to drag after that i kept waiting for this big revelation that would blow my mind but it never came the ending was pretty lackluster i didn't find the main character grace likeable or relatable at all which my have hindered my enjoyment of the book as soon as i learned that she orchestrated meeting her husband after seeing his engagement article in the paper i was pretty turned off it seemed so manipulative and shallow also grace very rarely even mentioned her husband after the ship sank even though she must've known he had perished with so many others i just know that if it had been me and i had truly loved my husband the way grace claimed to i would've been inconsolable with grief in the lifeboat grace just seemed so callous and uncaring her explanation as to why she 'participated' in the 'murder' for which she's on trial was very inadequate it didn't explain anything just made me think even more how wishy washy and weird grace was unable to decide or firmly act on anything the author's characterization of everyone in the book was pretty deadpan and not memorable as well i was having trouble telling people in the lifeboat apart because i couldn't remember names ms rogan writes very well and i'd be interested in what she comes up with in the future but the lifeboat just misses the mark for me","1715":" well it's a bit flat but that's because the main protagonist grace is a cold calculator who might be a bit of a sociopath or not but i'd say that due to her environment of genteel respectability and finishing school education her personality is initially undeveloped however the experience of being shipwrecked and on a lifeboat with 40 people for 21 days either changes her personality or what i believe rubbed off the cultural accretions that she had accumulated in growing up she survives the ordeal of starvation and lack of water revealed early in the book so not a spoiler and is in difficulty when rescued because of what i think is a poor decision not excused by being near death and not thinking clearly she thinks it happened because she was unduly influenced or pressured i think it was her nature coming alive and in being released acting out her rage against men of power and authority some might call it vaguely a feminist story but i think it was more about the cultural condition of being a person who is made dependent by law prejudice and custom which can result in seething resentment of the power difference between men and women especially during world war i it's perfect for a book club read i don't think the book is written in an intense manner but the issues it brings up in the reading are definitely food for thought and at least none of the passengers are food for anything else above water so it doesn't quite become a horror genre close but i'd say not the characters are outlines except for grace however she is an unreliable narrator twice once because by nature she is a manipulative opportunist and second because she does not know herself not being an introspective person i think for the reader the biggest clue as to who or what grace is is that the two characters who force her into making a choice of sides mrs grant why does grace always call her mrs grant and not by her first name hmmmmm and hannah look at her speculatively several times and ultimately choose her as view spoiler executioner hide spoiler the other characters perhaps ten of the lifeboat inhabitants that are spotlighted are obviously foils for the readers' conversation on finishing the novel hardie the lower class hero of the moment is both bad guy and good guy grace looks to him for god like saving powers she is god's grace tee hee she loves him like a stockholm syndrome victim until mrs grant she grants grace to be her instrument of grace impresses her as someone who has more authority and power than the enigmatic hardie hardie was exposed as a person who may have ulterior and selfish motives while grant is ready and willing to take and assume the reponsibility of authority that single facility seduces grace so that she bestows her faith in grant without examining any evidence or logic behind people's behaviors or stop for perspective the other characters are simply stock footage the good innocent the deacon the steerage mother and child the scientist philosopher the gossip the accountant the hysterical woman a colonel working class men and an upper class older woman etc and i think they are there to prove that whatever their opinions moral judgements and skill set the only ones that matter are one's determination to live and luck while there are hard feelings accusations of favoritism struggles to maintain moral decorum and self respect these are not gone into with any depth so i think the purpose of these characters was to show how utterly what and who they believed themselves to be was completely without any relevance all that mattered here appeared to be determination and gamesmanship it's a good book with many quotable lines and observations and i could extend this review for many more paragraphs copying them and admiring however i thought it a bit unfinished for this type of literary novel it didn't reach the smart underlying symbolism which to readers is similar to the undertones you might be unaware of in a ringing bell but that make your chest vibrate it disappointed me but i'll be looking for the author's next book","1716":"i just couldn't get into it the story the main character nothing about it resonated it was interesting but not one of those stay up until 2 am to finish it books","1717":"it was good not great brings up the usual thoughts of what ordinary people do under extraordinary circumstances but i never truly cared much about the characters","1718":"great premise and tense and exciting moments on the lifeboat the ended fizzled","1719":" this story is not about some hiccup in a three hour tour this is closer to \"the lord of the flies \" the result is a delicious evil fun wrapped in think y moments you're going to have to dust off your most sinister chuckle while you blow through it it's the late 1910s and the empress alexandra is headed to america when there is a fire on board and the ship sinks some of the passengers escape onto lifeboats including the lovely grace winter whose back story becomes increasingly more complicated as the story goes on the gist she was on the ship with her new husband who is was ridiculously wealthy they still have to tell his mother and his former fiance that they've wed their time aboard the ship had been lovely but included some curious moments between her husband and business contacts and unexplained alliances as the ship sank she was tossed into a lifeboat at the last second also under unusual circumstances now here she is with 38 other survivors orbiting the area where the boat sank and waiting for rescue like any novel where most of it happens on the ocean there are big metaphors in play and lots of morality and mortality questions come into play rogan handles the unraveling of civilized behavior in a super subtle way","1720":"while having an intriguing premise this book fell flat for me the main character was deplorable and any supporting characters were basically throwaways the author does not even try to describe them in order for the reader to be able to keep them apart in their mind and too many people died by going overboard or just dying while sitting there it was just not developed as it should have been i wish the author had like a 3rd party perhaps another nameless person who had been on the boat describe what really happened it wasn't a tale of a likable heroine trying to prove their innocence or of a frame job it was just like a horrific situation with a shady main character who may or may not have been telling the truth","1721":"thought provoking and characterized very well","1722":"it was riveting and exciting i was listening to it on audiotape and the vivid descriptions made me feel like i was on the lifeboat the story was amazing and through the story it made me wonder what i would be like if i was trapped on a lifeboat and if i would have the strangth to survive by any means necessary","1723":"an impressive first novel i liked that it was not a typical shipwreck survival story lots of good discussion topics for book club","1724":"i guess a book called the lifeboat would take place in a lifeboat but it went on forever and i got bored with it i wasn't a fan of the storyteller grace either the author raises many moral and ethical questions that i will enjoy discussing with my book club","1725":"probably more like 2 5 stars it was an interesting book and mysterious enough that i wanted to keep reading to find out what happens although there are still plenty of unanswered questions at the end but mostly i just found the book a little overwhelming and disturbing obviously none of us knows how we would act in such a situation until faced with it but that makes it no less daunting to read about the choices these folks made to survive","1726":" i liked the premise behind this book and i thought it would lead to tension crackling off the pages but therein lies the problem with this novel the story takes the unreliable narrator route and is told only through a 22 year old woman named grace i'm not a fan of the lone perspective approach but it doesn't necessarily mean i won't like it although the writing itself is good it sounds more like a description of a tea party with ladyfingers than people struggling for survival aboard a life raft i found it easier to root for the crusty old sailor who uses his seafaring knowledge to lead the group than grace who comes across more like a bystander there's much more that could have been done with the story there's too little conflict and some of the decisions seem to arise out of nowhere on the plus side it did keep my interest but fell short of being an engaging read recommended for those who like tales of rescue but keep your expectations to a minimum","1727":"quick read and enjoyable on many levels good story on the surface but the personal and group psychology involved would make great course and book club material on many other levels","1728":"an interesting book about the psychological tension when people are confined at close quarters in a life or death situation impressive that the author managed to keep interest although the plot was comparatively simple written in the first person like so many contemporary novels which limited understanding of other charactors and their motives for their actions more descritpion of the trial would have added to the novel and added contrast to the introspective tendency of the first section","1729":"really good read however after the lifeboat is rescued the story fall apart","1730":"if i'd been on the lifeboat i'd have happily thrown myself over board","1731":"seriously some women are evil","1732":"i absolutely loved this 1st book by charlotte rogan combination whodunnit harrowing tale of survival on a lifeboat after a ship sinks titanic illusions was grace really innocent its a very fast read with many profound life observations about faith motives and survival instincts you are left with many questions but it was an amazing imaginative read sure hope she writes more","1733":"this story has an interesting premise as a group of people try to survive on a lifeboat after a shipwreck i would have liked some more time devoted to character development but it's a very good story","1734":"i enjoyed the book the key to the theme in this book is described in the penultimate chapter in mr sinclair's words where he describes the journey of a child to adult throwing off the authority of his parents and either having the courage to strike out on his her own or find another authority to replace them this analogy was drawn to describe the experience of a culture's relationship with god as well there was i thought a feminist sub text in the book which i appreciated hannah and mrs grant represent the feminine and mr hardie represents the masculine the world of law husbands authority and god by rising up against him the women are also symbolically over turning those things and it's for that as much as anything that they are prosecuted and convicted later grace of course is let off because she appears to properly scramble back into her previous subjugated role in society dressed in her lace and back in the fold where she belongs behaving in a predictable and comfortable manner to the male authorities on the other hand it would be wrong to dismiss grace as a passive victim because sometimes its the creatures with chameleon tendencies who have the greatest talent for survival and grace proves this all through the book she isn't quite the passive submissive person they need her to be to wit mr cole's frustration in the final chapter","1735":"this book was full of things i do not appreciate as an avid reader plot holes unreliable narrators a situation in which i would most certainly have been thrown overboard i read it quickly so it gets two stars instead of one but it was wildly forgettable and the ending was flat","1736":"this was a very quick read and i was engaged the whole way but then disappointed at the end i kept expecting a twist or a reveal it could have used one","1737":"wonderful story felt like i was in the boat with them beautifully written a must read","1738":"good read grab a raft and settle in","1739":"this book was a perfect end to 2015 for me it combined topics from books that i've read throughout the year survival from shipwrecks murder trials heroes in an unconventional sense the main character grace was sharp and strong her weeks on the lifeboat reminded me of the true story of the essex whaleship survivors in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex the only negative comment that i have is that the writing style could sometime be way too descriptive there were adjectives upon adjectives enough to make your head spin sometimes i was pleased to find out that the author had a passion for ships and architecture the lusitania and winter palace were mentioned in the book reminded me of my husband","1740":"for a debut novel it is written surprisingly well i think this author has potential as her plots become more developed it is an easy read and worth the few hours spent into it","1741":"it's the summer of 1914 and the ocean liner empress alexandra has sunk while traveling across the atlantic grace winter 22 who is traveling with her newly wedded husband suddenly finds herself a widower stranded on a dangerously overcrowded lifeboat with 38 other survivors food and water are short and the lifeboat is under constant threat from either overturning or taking on water it's clear to everyone that some must die in order for any to survive the story is told from grace's point of view it shifts from her struggles aboard the lifeboat to present day where she finds herself on trial for murder along with two other survivors from the lifeboat the book has a very striking cover and the synopsis had me wanting to read this instantly i love survival stories especially when told from a first person point of view where you can really connect with the character and the struggles they face i was also very curious to uncover what events had taken place to result in grace finding herself on trial for murder the survivors face ethical and moral issues when it comes to the overcrowding issue a power struggle takes place aboard the lifeboat between the seaman in command and one of the woman on board as she slowly sways others to her side this creates a lot of tension and represents the most interesting parts of the book unfortunately except for these few moments the lifeboat failed to deliver much excitement the main character grace was for the most part rather detached from the dramatic events happening around her she seemed quite calm for someone who might die at sea she was also an indecisive character at one moment siding with the seaman and then with the other woman for such a relatively short book i felt it actually dragged and by the end i didn't really care about the outcome of the passengers grace in particular to me it was just an okay survival story","1742":"i usually idolize the protagonist in an attempt to have strong empathy connection with the events they are going through except this book i have a love hate relationship with grace i am mesmerized by her and disgusted by her at the same time thought provoking book for sure","1743":"this was a selection of my book club and the person who suggested it raved about it i have to say it had so many loose ends throughout that i only gave it a three on the other hand it was a compelling read and the character much more complex than she initially appeared kudos for such a fine first novel","1744":"very fast read enjoyed it","1745":"reminded me of required reading in high school except it was enjoyable and quick there is imagery galore and many english papers could be written on unreliable narration women's rights god and faith the essence of humanity and morality one of those books you have to keep reading to find out what happens","1746":"i felt that the book moved quite slow the plot was easily predictable","1747":"a good story about survival and group dynamics though not as memorable as life of pi i found many interesting insights throughout the novel but i wish the main character had been more remarkable and i look forward to rogan's next novel","1748":"i never felt connected to the protagonist in this story i found her stunningly detached and not like able that being said i like the story idea and the plot unfolding was well done the use of foreshadowing was skillful i could relate to the exploration of ethics vs expediency humanity vs survival there was enough detail to put you there in that boat worth the read","1749":" exceeded expectations a possible 7 10 grace is an interesting protagonist certainly a product of her time who knew how to manipulate men to get what she wants needs very myopic character which leads to some grey areas over the other occupants of the boat at least half of whom are not even named in the narrative only those that she saw instinctively as stronger than her or of use in some way merit note in her narrative the ending didn't take me by surprise which is why this is probably a 6 5 rather than a 7 but all in all an enjoyable and creative read","1750":"thoughtfully written but i wanted more thirty nine people trapped on a lifeboat for 21 days is a plot ripe with possibilities however this novel lacked the character development and dialogue to understand the psyches and motives of the stranded passengers randomly thrown together and struggling to survive nevertheless it is a quick page turning read","1751":"i enjoyed reading this book and then i got to the end and was highly disappointed i am down for a cliffhanger in a book or for an author who leaves certain endings up to the reader but i feel you can only do that when you give the reader enough information to come up with their own conclusion this author failed to do that she put out a few different scenarios and or plots that i was looking forward to finding out the answers to and then just left me hanging with no clue what the final story was very upsetting a bunch of reading just to be let down at the end and left unfulfilled","1752":"i enjoyed it it was difficult to put down i thought rogan did a great job in the writing of it i thought the women were all guilty of the crime i wasn't satisfied with the ending but overall it was a worthwhile read","1753":"too many questions left unanswered what was the deal between hardie and blake the mysterious box and what did henry have to do with it all","1754":"an interesting take on the dynamics of surviving in a lifeboat after your cruise ship sinks because of an explosion on board i thought the ending was a bit weak and left some questions unanswered","1755":"probably the most thought provoking ethically and philosophically challenging debut novel i've read this year one could have tangential discussions about memory survival intentions and social structures for hours well written and readable to boot lovely book","1756":" the short of it strong start weak finish the rest of it after an explosion sinks the luxury liner she and her husband were on grace winter finds herself floating across the atlantic with thirty eight other passengers in a lifeboat meant for much less what follows is an account of what happens when food and water run scarce and when all hope of rescue is lost the story is told from grace's point of view as she recounts the events leading up to her rescue from the beginning the reader knows two things... that grace was not the only one to have survived and that she is on trial for something that she did...or didn't do that part remains a mystery for most of the book and is what kept me reading when the ship goes down they have little time to launch the lifeboats so half of them don't make it out and the ones that do are either terribly overcrowded as is the case with grace's or not manned by a knowledgeable crew member in this sense grace is lucky her lifeboat although overcrowded and taking on water is manned by a crew member so their plight seems less serious than say some of the other boats but as they float for three weeks and their chance of rescue decreases tempers flare and desperation sets in grace was a hard character to like on the surface she seemed very straightforward and possessed a great deal of common sense young and a newlywed at that she seemed to hold it together pretty well given that her husband's status was an unknown throughout much of the book however there was a coldness to her that i didn't care for calculating and detached those two words kept coming up for me when i was reading her story and it bothered me it made it hard for me to see things from her point of view and given that this is her story i struggled with parts of it my interest in the book started to wane at about the halfway mark they were still on the lifeboat but the day to day routine was becoming tiresome and not much else was shared about the other passengers at this point grace was interested in grace this retreat into herself didn't work for me i wanted to know more about the others so that i could understand the full effect of grace's actions this is one of those stories where one particular character finds herself pushed to her limits but i never got to see that desperation i expected to see her snap or to be overcome with grief or to experience some other extreme emotion but what the author delivered was just a shell of what i had expected to see because of this grace's outcome meant little to me besides my inability to feel much for grace i didn't think there was enough conflict on the lifeboat itself small boat too many people with little food and water between them that is a recipe for disaster and yet... what took place didn't seem all that bad to me the passengers seemed too civilized for me to take their situation seriously and i never felt the danger that they were obviously in perhaps me knowing that there were survivors lessened the sense of danger for me that is one possibility quite some time ago i read unbroken by laura hillenbrand i had trouble with that book too for different reasons but the lifeboat scenes in that book were riveting and so real that my stomach ached from hunger i think i expected a little bit more of that in this one for more reviews visit my blog book chatter","1757":"i found this book hard work not because it is a difficult read but because i found it quite boring i thought that a survival story would be exciting throughout unfortunately this was not the case with the lifeboat","1758":"this book was okay i kept waiting for something more dramatic to happen as the characters in the novel turn on each other i found myself being caught off guard and then thinking that's it the development of the turn of events wasn't clearly laid out in all though an easy read","1759":"interesting premise made me wonder how i would handle myself in this situation","1760":"the novel ponders the question what would you do to survive this was a good read not compelling but thought provoking","1761":"interesting but felt unfinished","1762":"nothing special","1763":"what started off as interesting quickly became tedious i slogged through the remainder of the book in hopes that the end would somehow salvage the middle of the book not so it came to an abrupt ending that was as dissatisfying as the rest of the story","1764":"the book implies several things but leaves you hanging with no resolution it was too much like life of pi which i hated","1765":"a quick read about what happens when a boat load of people are adrift for 21 days","1766":" over 40 years ago in a graduate course on group psych i participated in a lifeboat exercise in which our group of 8 people had to select one person to go overboard so the rest of us could survive this exercise similar to lessons taught in lots of classrooms back in the day was part of a values clarification unit what i remember best is the men in the group claiming their enhanced value because of their greater physical strength of course we all knew the situation was phony so their flexing was more humorous than threatening to the women after a couple of hours of discussion of too many variables and too much uncertainly about the unknown future we decided to draw lots here charlotte rogan attempts to give life to a similar fictional situation grace a survivor is on trial for the part she played in ridding the lifeboat of its hardhearted leader who rigged the drawing of lots what i like about the novel is the realistic portrayal of the narrator diary writer grace who in the journal written to help her lawyer reveals a manipulative approach to problem solving as she attempts not to offend anyone i didn't much like grace but she came alive for me she is a survivor and in telling her story forces the reader to evaluate her own reaction to unsettling group situations the thing that preoccupied me was the notion that a person's choices are only rarely between right and wrong or between good and evil i saw very clearly that people were mostly faced with much murkier options and that there were no clear signposts marking the better path to take our minds sought to make sense of things just the way people have always sought to make sense of their situations","1767":" from the opening pages the lifeboat reels you in and until the last line you're hooked a mesmerizing debut novel from charlotte rogan a constant guessing game as to who will make it and how the situation is an overloaded lifeboat a couple of years after the titanic and on the cuff of world war i there's even some thought that their ocean liner empress alexandra was sunk in a similar manner as the lusitania but this vein of thought is just an added ingredient to all the mystery surrounding the characters on board lifeboat plan on starting this one early in the day and not getting a lot of sleep that evening","1768":"it had great promise but missed the mark i enjoyed reading about the lifeboat but got lost outside of the immediate story","1769":"a true classic that i can recommend to many readers the protagonist a social debutante making her way across the atlantic in the early 20th century is caught on a sinking ship and forced to get onto a lifeboat with many others she drifts on the atlantic ocean for days as the group suffers from dehydration and hunger the theme is how far people are willing to go before letting go of etiquette and showing their true facades this theme has been explored many times in countless novels already but charlotte rogan's presentation and timeless characters make the novel unique","1770":"today and this month marks the 100th anniversary of the titanic the titanic went down historically on april 12th 1912 on that note the lifeboat is being published this month i was sent a copy by penguin i started to read it 2 days ago wow the lifeboat blew me away with its narrative the lifeboat is literary but it is also filled with mystery and suspense after the titanic went down did you ever wonder what it was like on the lifeboats for them did you re call if you saw the movie titanic it was said the capacity for the lifeboats was not enough for the capacity for the entire ship the question who will survive do you sacrifice others to save yourself what would you do if you were in this situation the lifeboat is thought provoking and think about mankind and human nature the lifeboat has a capacity of 40 passengers 39 passengers were on the lifeboat it was filled to capacity the regulations then for lifeboats was not accurate the lifeboat takes place on a ship called the empress alexandra the story is told by grace winter she has just been married to her wealthy banker husband henry while on the ship it explodes there is implications that her husband bought her a seat on a lifeboat that was filled to capacity there fits the story with plenty of twists and turn and mystery with plenty of accusations and paranoia and strong women characters to make you think what you would do any extreme disaster the story is written into henry and grace's romance and the problems they had before their marriage his and her family life this is one novel i will set up with little information this story i felt was that good it doesn't need any further explanation just a fast paced novel that you wish it would not end the lifeboat is a satisfying read a good summer read but not while on a cruise i give it 5 thumbs up i like to read books at a different time and place and something i have not experienced and make you think this fits the bill thank you anna for a copy to review","1771":"an interesting read definitely a page turner lots of questions left open which all kind of add to the murkiness of the events just like the endless ocean they were on worth reading i","1772":"the story line was good and it held my attention but there were way too many unanswered questions actions that needed to be explained it left me disappointed in the end","1773":"this was good but i admit i struggled with it a bit when they were on trial","1774":"really good book quick read and a page turner i love that it is written without a moral opinion position and lets the reader form their own opinions","1775":"i enjoyed the book but the ending was not as strong as i had hoped i may be in the minority here but i did not dislike grace i think she is the kind of person who does survive because she is able to change her mindset depending on what is happening and who is in control and she knows it her survival instinct is the strongest character trait that she has will be interested to see what this first time novelist does next","1776":"overall i found it a quick and interesting read that was very well timed with the anniversary of the titanic i was surprised by the increasingly feminist issues that came about but they made sense within the context of the story i liked the premise of the book and much of it flowed along very well but there were some disjointed loose ends that were never resolved i can make my peace with it but i prefer not to leave questions that thread throughout a book unanswered","1777":" grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her life in the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying grace and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat which the survivors quickly realize has exceeded capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes","1778":" this well written novel was easy to read in one sitting because of it's brevity less than 300 pages and its pacing it is the story of 39 people adrift on the ocean in a lifeboat for three weeks the story is told from the perspective of one of these people a survivor 22 year old grace grace's one heroic act or accident is that she survives the ordeal when many of her boat mates did not grace is a survivor but she is not a heroine her actions her morals her character even her thoughts are ambiguous and ambivalent and as ever changing as the sea upon which she was stranded the novel provided much food for thought what will each of us do to survive what is more noble to survive or to forfeit oneself for the possible survival of others how constant will our characters be when faced with the direst of circumstances","1779":"charlotte rogan's the lifeboat is a a chilling journey into the depths of human instinct will power and self preservation but the novel doesn't just explore aspects of choice and consequences it asks readers to reconsider their own moral compass in a situation where basic needs and survival instincts surpass morality rationality and human compassion and in between these sinister notions rogan also considers women's rights social status memory and the legal dilemmas of such a scenario the lifeboat is a fast paced engrossing and thought provoking debut but i wouldn't recommend it for beach reading read full review here http hookedbookworm blogspot com 20","1780":"i liked the plot of this book very thought provoking i also thought it was interesting that the author lived in dallas for a number of years and taught herself to write very good first novel","1781":"a strong account of survival of the fittest with a twist","1782":"biggest problem was switching time in her recollections without clearly announcing a time jump","1783":"easy to read this book until towards the end it gets a little confusing i did like it","1784":" the lifeboat is an account of the weeks on a lifeboat after a fire on a ship traveling from europe to new york in the early 1900's grace a newlywed who is separated from her husband is the narrator i had trouble identifying all the characters on the boat referred to mostly as mr or mrs so and so but i'm not sure that made a difference to the telling of the story in the end i was left with an unfinished feeling which may have been intentional by the author it seems to echo grace's experience an interesting post script in this edition of the book is an extensive list of charlotte rogan's bookshelf","1785":"highly recommend","1786":"i really enjoyed this book very much read it in a few days i wish the story would have included a little more about the story between grace u0026amp henry i wanted to know more about thier relationship but overall it was a really good story","1787":"i have always been fascinated by lifeboat situations ever since i saw the old movie lifeboat with tallulah bankhead on the late show when i was 15 that movie dealt with who should survive and they ended up throwing all the artistic people out of the boat this book did not have such riveting questions perhaps it was because there were more gray areas i read this for my adult education contemporary literature class and i am looking forward to the class discussion","1788":"this book left me with more questions than answers which i suppose is the mark of a good book the characters were well developed i really wanted more","1789":"i absolutely loved the language in this book this first time author placed me out on that ocean trying to survive the endless days endless nights i had read other reviews that criticized the lack of character development i would disagree i felt the characters were at their most raw when facing mortality there was no need in my opinion to build more upon who they were and how they changed yep i loved this book","1790":"i am a huge fan of alfred hitchcock's the lifeboat and had really high expectations of this it is set a few years after the titanic and is a study in humanity it's short so that was good and it wasn't bad but it wasn't great we are planning this for discussion at our bookgroup in july we'll see","1791":"1 did i like identify with and or care about the main character s not really grace was ok but i didn't like her all that much kind of annoying really didn't like hardie or the other ladies on the boat either 2 was i pleased with the plot especially the ending sure the plot was pretty good certainly provided a good what would i do in this scenario opportunity for discussion 3 was it a page turner nope","1792":"excellent book very well written suspenseful and very realistic character development is a plusalso highly recommended","1793":"it was an interesting study of human character and asks questions about what qualities we have and why we admire them as human beings i'm glad i read it but it' lacks something that is hard for me to pinpoint","1794":" rarely do i finish a book in 24 hours i finished this book in 24 hours rogan displays some talented storytelling in this novel but what was really amazing is how she tells this shocking and disturbing story in a way that dosen't rely on shock or gratuity to move the plot along the character development was so strong and the themes so well developed that this story could have taken place anywhere and been just as powerful rogan uses the lifeboat as a kind of microcosm of humanity which forces her characters to strip away all shallow inferences and pushes them to explore the deepest of themes this story a provoking classic study of human experience and ripe for discussion","1795":" a good enough read i loved the premise of the book fighting against the elements and the other castaways to survive in a lifeboat adrift on the atlantic ocean having to make decisions that may go against conscience in order to save your own life the problem i had with the book is that i could not like grace winter i didn't dislike her she just didn't seem to have an endearing personality and i was often frustrated with her grace is an unemotional woman who from the start is interested only in her own survival from her marriage to her trial that's not a bad thing taking care of yourself however her own lack of emotion doesn't leave room for much empathy for her she seemed a little too cold and matter of fact about events such as the fate of her husband hardie and other passengers as well as her hostile feelings toward mary ann i was also annoyed that the ending didn't satisfy some questions about her husband and his family and what really happened on the empress alexandra in the hours before the ship sank i liked the book i just didn't love it as i had hoped","1796":"3 1 2 stars it was interesting but i had a hard time feeling connected to the main character","1797":"if you take for granted that some or all shall die if no action is taken should an action be taken to save some","1798":"we read this book as part of our book club the back of the book sounded like it would be a great book to chew over together it is 1914 and europe is on the brink of war when a magnificent ocean lincer suffers a mysterious explosion en route to new york the survivors quickly realize the boat is over capacity and could sink at any moment for any to live some must die passengers plot scheme gossip and console one another while sitting incehs apart their deepest beliefs are tested to the limit as they begin to discover what they will do in order to survive the best part of the book was the blurb on the back i found it to be flat and didn't reach its full potential i didn't like the main character who was supposed to be a strong female character instead i found her wishy washy buckling easily to peer pressure and changeing sides at the last minute there were parts of the book where i thought it would get interesting ie court case relationships but they all just stopped and petered out the book clubs verdict and mine was disappointing sorry to charlotte rogan but while i finished the book i can't say i liked it","1799":"really fascinating look at people in life threatening situations","1800":" i'm giving this 3 stars because the author did a really great job describing many of the scenes in the lifeboat you truly felt like you could smell taste see and feel some of the scenes which was really amazing the downfall was that the stream of consciousness style away from the storyline in addition the ending could have been so much better but it really got boring i also feel like the author should have either made you love the narrator or hate her but i found myself feeling indifferent about her towards the end","1801":"took a long time to get interested in the book finally got hooked hated the ending","1802":"it's alright nothing overpowering or all that inspired i feel like i've been on this boat in other works and didn't really want to be on this one for very long i did enjoy rogan' s storytelling style and found interest in the significance of the character's names additionally i did like the subtlety of each character's personality and realistic attitudes","1803":"did not live up to my expectations an interesting read but disappointing","1804":"about halfway through it now and it is really a book to make one stop and think it is written to evoke all of the myriad of emotions one might feel if in the place of the storyteller it's a book that simply can't be swallowed in big gulps but has to be sipped and savored","1805":"boring","1806":"ms rogan's debut novel is a reason why i love debut authors so much this book had a fresh approach to a very tough story the question how do you survive at sea in an overfilled lifeboat after the ship you are on to start a new life in america with your new husband blows up the answers aren't pretty and could minimally land the newly widowed grace in jail for the rest of her life if she is lucky i thoroughly enjoyed this book although i must admit that parts of it were just downright disturbing it did take a bit longer for me to really get into the book than i would have liked but once i did the book took off her character development and why some were chosen was quite strong i loved the look at the human psyche and while under duress what it will do to survive and how decisions are made i did think it wrapped up a bit too nicely with a nice red bow for how the meat of the story was written to me it came across that the author didn't want to go too dark or that life is one big happy ending with how dark she had gone in the book i think the ending could have gone a bit darker and it would have been more real the ending as written came across as cheesy i am not sure if this was because she is a debut author or the book is a big house published book that is why it wasn't a 5 star read for me","1807":"if you were in a lifeboat that had too many people would you be in favor of throwing some of them into the sea to save the rest the author of the lifeboat takes this moral dilemma and turns it into a short novel where everyone of the passengers espouses a different philosophical bent i think you get the picture it's a quick read and not a bad read at that","1808":"i hated this book it was boring slow and seemed to have no point why i kept reading it is beyond my comprehension to top that off my puppy took a bite out of it and i have to buy it from the library ugh i don't want it and never pay full price for any book","1809":"interesting but not great","1810":"a slight twist on the usual titanic type what happens when the boat sinks type movie this was about what happens to the people in the lifeboat after the boat is sunk and gone it covered many moral dilemmas that surfaced in the long period that the survivors had to spend on the lifeboat before they were saved i also liked the twist of the legal case after they were saved which shows that no matter where you are or what circumstances you find yourself in you have to still obey the law or face the consequences i was torn between giving this book a 3 or 4 out of 5 as it was an entertaining read i eventually settled on a 3 because i just felt it could have been down a lot better there were some unnecessary parts to the story and slightly to many characters to keep a track of some parts were also slightly unbelievable but then again i have not been stranded on a lifeboat for an extended period of time so who knows if that is just because of my lack of that experience the character development of a few main characters could have been better as i did not really feel anything for any one of the characters i have just read a couple of novels that have had outstanding character development so perhaps my standards are now higher a good enough read and should make an ok book group discussion","1811":"after the sinking of a ship the author delves into the lives and personalities of the survivors in this particular lifeboat showing what people are capable of when they are trying to survive","1812":"this was not a book to read on a cruise but i enjoyed it nonetheless","1813":"this story really intrigued me when i read the cover and i had high hopes however i found very few redeeming qualities in the narrator main character grace winter perhaps that was the author's intention but i never found grace to be sympathetic or very interesting i wouldn't have been too sad if grace hadn't made it off the boat","1814":" i have so few feelings about this book that i'm not even sure i actively disliked it i just didn't like it there was nothing to enjoy nothing to be surprised at nothing to learn the general plot had potential but that's about all it had going for it the writing feels monotonous as though you're listening to someone with absolutely no inflection telling you a very lengthy story with far too many details worse the narrator has no personality and while i hoped that there'd be some twist to indicate that she was actually smart and calculating behind a general veil of dimness that twist never came skip it","1815":"an interesting question to sacrifice one to save others and is it really homicide if you kill someone who you think is endangering others but for me the characters were not memorable enough to follow their thinking and behavior","1816":"i enjoyed this book but i feel like i missed something in the character of grace i could not decide if she was a reliable narrator or not i plan to reread the book at some later time","1817":"i wanted to like it more than i did disappointing because of its good reviews","1818":"i think the author did an excellent job writing this novel and you felt like you were actually in the lifeboat i really liked the first 2 3 but it was a bit anticlimactic although probably realistic but just little excitement towards the end i read it for my neighborhood book club","1819":"loved this book","1820":"this is the perfect book to be made into a play this made it so enjoyable to read it would be easy to show everyone in a boat on the stage it had all the drama and humor you need packed right into the characters so you don't need an elaborate set gossipy women judgmental people no one trusted anyone privileged people bickered over the best seat on the boat these people started rumors about each other and it was only a couple of weeks and they were sitting right next to each other it was hard to take this book seriously because of these people of which i didn't like any grace had it right when she said none of were worth a spit they were all spoiled back stabbers that were only interested in proving their worth by how much money they had these were the same type of people in the titanic this story actually takes place two years after the titanic and they even talked about that event the author did a great job creating the atmosphere of the hardships these people endured being shipwrecked at sea from the empress alexandra for 21 days the fear of the darkness and unknown at night the cold water splashing onto the people wondering which direction they were headed rationing their water and food supply trying to discreetly to go to the bathroom or stop the bleeding from one's menstrual cycle drawing straws to see who would dive into the water to their death to lighten up the load on the leaking boat still i didn't feel bad when any of them died or suffered everyone was so mean and we didn't get to learn much about them besides the main character grace winter she was probably the most corrupt of all she was like a snake in disguise her newly wed husband henry had paid their way onto the boat nut they got separated so they weren't on the same boat it was implied that he had drowned she was only interested in him in his money since her father had lost his money in his business and shot himself and her mother went mad she needed some means of income in other words a rich husband he was a banker and was actually engaged to another woman when they met but she charmed her way into his heart and won him over this pretty much solidified my hatred of her right away but she is the narrator of the story because it is supposed to be her collection of the events she wrote into her diary so we get to hear her inner thoughts and what she really thinks of henry and the 38 people on the lifeboat that is how we know she is an evil conniving woman it seems like she is capable of anything if it means retaining her status among the privileged we do learn of the backstory of the ship and how they came to be shipwrecked we are told about the safety procedures they had and how many lifeboats the ship was required to have for this scenario people on the boat were dying left an right because of self sacrifice or malnourishment or from being mentally broken it was very interesting to see how it all played out who ended up being in charge calling the shots making the tough decisions how they tried to stay alive makes me think what i would be like in their position i know i wouldn't fare well at all probably not half as good as grace or any of the others but there were some things that grace and them did that i could never see myself capable of doing but that is what this story fun to read this was a very entertaining one sitting read that had you on the edge of your seat or railing the whole time","1821":"awesome story","1822":"this book for me was surprisingly unpredictable i kept expecting something unexpected to happen but that never happened the main character seemed to be viewing everything as in a dream and she was just part of this drama that took place and she was just a bit player when in fact she was a main factor in the outcome of the story a somewhat disappointing tale many unanswered questions such as why the ship sank was it sabotoged what was the deal between henry and mr hardee just her safety or something else were grace and henry really married just alot of frustrating open ends never tied up","1823":" the lifeboat is a small book that packs a big punch grace winter is on trial for her life accused of murder her attorney hands her a blank notebook and she records all her memories of the three weeks she spent on a lifeboat after the ship her and her husband henry were taking sank in the summer of 1914 so most of the events takes place in this lifeboat i can imagine people thinking how can this book be anything but boring i'll tell you it wasn't boring at all it was a completely captivating portrait of human nature it was fascinating to see the lifeboat become a little world to these people people were subconsciously given roles and cliques were formed as the days go by with no help in sight people started getting frustrated and desperate and this only leads to disaster especially since the boat is overcrowded and unfortunately some people have to go whether you agree with grace's actions or not you have to admire her she gave out this passive patient nature to the outside world but she was incredibly strong willed and intelligent very much so which you can see come out when she's in prison the lifeboat was a different kind of book i've never read anything like it before i was amazed that i wasn't bored or frustrated with how slowly events were coming the writing kept me entranced - it was amazingly done","1824":"a wonderful read i couldn't put it down l","1825":" this book had an interesting theme of 39 people adrift in a lifeboat designed for a lesser number of passengers after an explosion on board the liner on which they were travelling across the atlantic already there should have been suspense and emotion but the story never lived up to my expectations mainly because the author did not develop any of the many characters in the story except possibly that of hardie one of the crew the only survivor with any seafaring experience hardie was a man of mystery although we never find out the answers to any of the mysteries surrounding him even at the conclusion of the novel his strong leadership of the group is challenged by one of the woman survivors with predictably catastrophic results i could not engage with any of the other characters the heroine grace was in turn indecisive vapid manipulative and self serving even her marriage to henry a rich banker was instigated by herself to provide a solution to a pressing financial and emotional crisis in her life i was left wondering whether her entire story of her survival in the lifeboat was true recall hallucinatory or largely manipulated to ensure her continued freedom she was not a heroine to elicit much empathy i found the ending of the story entirely unsatisfactory a quick read but with little depth or passion","1826":"started out very promising due to the situation but it never went anywhere","1827":"excellent i could not put this down chilling tale of 39 passengers in a lifeboat waiting to be rescued lots of philosophical moral ethical dilemmas with no easy answers i loved it","1828":"an interesting premise 39 people stranded at sea on a lifeboat and the consequences of decisions that were made in the midst that life or death situation","1829":" this somehow reminded me of alias grace something about the matter of fact tone with which everything is recounted and obviously the whole woman accused of murder plot and i just realized the narrator's name how did i not catch that before now i also kind of liked the author's style grace would be meandering along in her tale and then nonchalantly drop an aha moment in there such as but she would die at sea then continue back along with a meandering retelling of life in the lifeboat i kind of enjoyed hunting for these little insights by no means however would i say that this is a real page turner while the situation is quite gripping in its premise it moves along rather slowly at times i didn't really mind though and found it an interesting read though if we're talking stranded at sea in a lifeboat stories i'd easily recommend life of pi over this","1830":"i wasn't sure how i felt about the main character at times but was enthralled in her story throughout and felt that it was an excellent book to talk about with my book club there were some powerful themes explored we had a good discussion over the captain of the boat's intentions and the subtle mystery involved in the story the ending was what it was it just kind of ended and i wanted something more satisfying and wrapped up the rest of the story though was gripping","1831":"i kept plugging through this because the book promised to be a riveting page turner so i was waiting for the story to pick up but it just never happened","1832":"it's the summer of 1914 and grace elopes with henry winter in london hoping to escape the disapproval of his wealthy family the empress alexandra the elegant ocean liner suffers a mysterious explosion on their voyage to america henry sacrifices his own safety and finds a lifeboat for grace even though it is over capacity adrift in the atlantic for several weeks the occupants of this lifeboat must learn to deal with dwindling supplies weather conditions and power struggles among themselves","1833":" i had just finished life of pi when i picked this one up so it was an interesting comparison of being stuck in a lifeboat extreme differences though of course i found myself having to make myself read this so that's never a good sign it was okay but not great i didn't like the main character she seemed like a shallow rich girl and i never really saw her do anything noteworthy to help their situation it's hard to say what i would do if i were in her shoes though so it was interesting to read how the occupants behaved honestly i'm not going to finish it because i have another i'm reading at the same time that's better and two others i requested from our library they always come in all at once","1834":"love how this book isn't just a history lesson like dead wake but gets into the head of the survivor and how others handle the stress of the sinking ship unknown future on a lifeboat and unlikelihood of being rescued","1835":"a well written tight little thriller you can polish off in a day kept me guessing with a frankly unreliable morally complicated narrator goes to show our justice system was sketchy in its aim as much now as in edwardian times good book hope she writes more","1836":"a fun read my concerns about this book were the same as my disappointment with most historical fiction populated by characters with modern sensibilities in this case a heroine with very modern sensibilities grace is a bit too calculating and self assured to be believable at least for me these characteristics make her an interesting character thankfully she isn't the self sacrificing mother who nurtures all the poor souls in the boat but not necessarily a believable one the plot is also very contrived the lifeboat isn't lord of the flies or even the hitchcock lifeboat both of which are far more complex but the lifeboat is a nice addition to survival fiction","1837":"yawn the premise of this book sounded so promising what a disappointment","1838":"i hardly ever leave a book unfinished but this one i had to by the time i had got half way through the book i didn't care if they lived died or got rescued this book is so boring i skipped to the end and even more thought what a waste of time","1839":" i think the book was very accurate in it's portrayal of memory and gaps in memory caused by extraordinary circumstances not remembering details of how she ended up on the boat totally believed the ship was sinking people pushing panic reigning fire despair fear everything happening so fast and all at once i challenge anyone to have clear memories under the circumstances this was grace's story not a documentary of events so there were bound to be gaps in what really happened as there are when any of us recount a story so that aspect posed no issues for me i found it an interesting study of human behaviour but did struggle with caring about any of them including grace very much still an interesting piece of writing","1840":"jury is out on this one the book is so deep and asks the reader to consider complex moral issues as well as human nature when i read novels like this i do not read anything else for a few days so i can process the story it's that kind of a book","1841":" i gave this a read on recommendation i was told to read this not necessarily for the story line although it itself is compelling but for the often times acrid pedantic pragmatic voice of narrator grace the whole book is an exercise in introspective reflection here we see an unreliable narrator done well with grace haphazardly recalling the days of survival spent aboard a lifeboat after the sinking of a shipliner at the early start of the century how the prose is initially set up you'd expect grace to be civil coquettish when instead we find a complicated narrator who is well aware of her misgivings while trying simultaneously to atone for them pair this with a life or death situation that would otherwise not care about grace's failings and you have a tiny vessel of emotion that grows in intensity far more than the luxurious ship liner could the book doesn't focus on the wreck nor the fallout but instead calls to question who we are when tested why we are what we've become and how we are able to maintain or disdain what we will become i'm surprised a movie hasn't been made of this already","1842":"very intesting story about human character and survival it tells the story of 39 people set adrift in a lifeboat pre wwi when their luxury liner sinks it examines what choices we need to make to survive very thought provoking","1843":" who could resist a book that had the following quote on the front cover the lifeboat traps the reader in a story that is exciting at the literal level and brutally moving at the existential i read it in one go emma donoghue author of room i'm surprised that donoghue gave the novel such a stellar review in fact many accomplished writers gave it rave reviews i found the book only so so perhaps it's because i had just finished reading jamrach's menagerie by carol birch if you're looking for sinking ships and survival on a lifeboat birch's book is the superior read the lifeboat failed to be really engrossing because it was so easy to tell from the outset who the troublesome passengers would be i also found it difficult to keep those passengers straight in my head there were a total of 39 but it didn't seem like all of them were named in the novel and looking at author charlotte rogan's website i see that there were 9 unnamed women in the lifeboat i got two women named mrs forester and mrs fleming mixed up all in all it was just too many people although i suppose rogan needed to stay true to what was 'usual' for lifeboats in 1914 also problematic for me was the narrator protagonist herself she was a shrewd calculating woman with whom i didn't identify i really didn't know what i was supposed to learn from her the moral of this story seems to be that the women who get ahead in life are those who can read people well and thus manipulate them for personal gain what kind of life lesson is that perhaps i'm naive but i think survival stories should expose us to both the worst and the best in humanity how strange it seems that my heart ached for the characters in jamrach's menagerie who resorted to cannibalism on their lifeboat when i felt completely devoid of emotion for the starchy british occupants of rogan's lifeboat #14","1844":"i seldom give up on a book but after 100 pages of simplistic plot boring characters slow pace i didn't have any desire to read more of this","1845":"i don't understand why the date 1914 was significant i found the book a somewhat interesting depiction of life in solitude and a study of human nature however having just read unbroken by karen hillenbrand this book fell short for me","1846":"i was completely riveted by this book i've always devoured books about the titanic and this is what called to me about this one but it requires the reader to look inward and wonder how she would respond under the same kind of circumstances in my case not very well i suspect","1847":"i only finished reading it because i thought it would get better waste","1848":"i finished this in a day and a half i thought it was a wonderful psychological study which doesn't require rollicking action every minute lots of thought provoking topics particularly women's place in the world and their power or lack thereof the author left many questions unanswered and that's ok by me four and a half stars","1849":" if you're looking for a love story full of self sacrifice like titanic you won't find it in the lifeboat by charlotte rogan what you will find though is a dark story of human survival mutiny and moral dilemmas beyond our normal perception in the beginning of the lifeboat we meet grace grace is on trial for something that happened during her 3 weeks in a lifeboat after the sinking of the ship she and her new husband henry were aboard grace has just secretly married henry to advance her status after some family drama grace is complicated and aloof void of any real emotion during the telling of her story at first we don't know why grace is on trial but this becomes evident as the story unfolds grace tells her story through a journal which her attorneys ask her to create in order to better understand her ordeal at sea and the events that led up to the incident that has landed grace in her current precarious situation there are 39 passengers aboard the lifeboat on day 1 and many will not survive the three week ordeal their humanity survival instincts and moral judgement are tested in the extreme conditions of sun exposure little water no food and growing panic most of the 39 people on the lifeboat do not know each other on a personal level they have one crew member who knows anything at all about surviving at sea they look to him to make decisions for them and as days go by they start to wonder if he has their best interests at heart most of the passengers in the lifeboat are women this creates a women versus men scenario on a few different levels keep in mind that the year is 1914 and women are oppressed and not yet able to vote this is also relevant in grace's trial where the jury is made up of all men i really enjoyed this book it was very well written and the way the author set up the scenario of grace's incarceration and trial to lead us into the story of the lifeboat was brilliant don't expect wishy washy love or sacrifice in this one it's about survival and the lengths a person is willing to go to in order to live it will have you asking yourself what you would do in grace's situation could you judge someone on actions they took at a time of duress and hopelessness the likes of which you can't even fathom one of my favorite interactions in the book takes place between some of the women in the boat and mr hardie the lone crew member the women are asking why god has let this happen to them and mr hardie responds ye're born ye suffer and ye die what made ye think ye deserved any different excellent story i highly recommend it","1850":"it's a book that the author spent many years secretly writing the joys and horrors of human nature it's all here no sympathetic characters but neither is that necessary to create a riveting read","1851":"yet another lifeboat story but each one is fascinating this short novel is has a compelling plot line as we learn about the past of the narrator the dynamics among the passengers and their dilemma as they deal with the consequences of their actions i thoroughly enjoyed it","1852":" this book was a switch from what i typically read not much action very much an internal 'examine the human condition' type of book so the fact that it really did keep me engaged throughout is definitely in its favor that said i felt as if there were quite a few things in this book that could have been defined that weren't and maybe that was the point that grace was operating solely out of what she knew and if we really knew everything would we make different choices even for grace however i felt as if there were big chunks of character explanation development missing and somehow at the end of the book i didn't know a whole lot more than i did at the beginning","1853":"i am glad that i tried it not what i expected actually kinda slow at times but as i have been reading some heavier stuff lately it was good to have something to read that did not require so much thinking","1854":"this was a well written book with an interesting story line it was my book group's selection for this month good choice as it raises many questions regarding how one would behave on a lifeboat some liked the bare bones style but i would have preferred more character development many questions were left unanswered several loose ends left hanging perhaps that is her style leaving it to the reader to fill in the blanks","1855":" the story takes place in 1914 and centres around grace winter a 22 year old woman who survived the sinking of empress alexandra a luxurious ocean liner and is now together with two other people on trial for murder through first person narrative grace recounts the events that took place during the 21 days she and 38 other survivors spent in the lifeboat 14 floating around the atlantic ocean waiting to be rescued as food and water run out and the overloaded lifeboat threatens to sink the lives of the remaining passengers are once again in great danger they quickly realize that for any to survive some of them are going to have to die when i first heard about this novel i was instantly intrigued i am a total sucker for gripping survival stories especially when they explore concepts such as morality ethics justice and sacrifice sadly my initial excitement quickly seeped out of me when i realized after about 30 pages that this book was not going to be as thrilling riveting and emotionally devastating as i expected while parts of it are quite interesting sometimes even captivating my overall impression was not very favorable the writing style is rather dry and tedious and the story flattens out towards the end its failure to deliver on both the emotional and intellectual level prevented me from being fully invested in the unravelling events and left me feeling indifferent to the outcome of the situation for one i felt unable to connect with the passive and strangely dazed heroine she seemed cold and detached and it was very hard for me to imagine her in an overloaded lifeboat fighting for survival whether she did a really amazing job remaining calm and composed or simply did not want or know how to react shock fear withdrawal i honestly couldn't tell whatever the reason if there ever was one to begin with the fact remains that her emotional response was almost entirely non existent as the story progresses we learn a bit more about her her life and the motivations behind her action her psychology however is never deeply explored and a lot is left for the reader to figure out on their own grace recounts the events in an emotionless matter of factly voice providing lots of vivid details but not much personal reflections and that's probably what bothered me the most about this book for someone who was on that sinking boat and lived through all those horrible events she remained surprisingly uninvolved and more often that not she seemed only mildly interested in her own survival while i don't consider myself to be a particularly discerning or demanding reader i do like my books to offer something more than just a lukewarm remotely thrilling story and a bunch of unresolved plot lines this book though enjoyable to a certain extent left me unsatisfied perhaps i went into reading it expecting too much and given the endlessly fascinating premise it's not entirely surprising that i did but the truth is the closer i got to the conclusion of the story the less i cared about it in the end what promised to be an utterly absorbing and thought provoking examination of human nature proved to be merely an ok read with a great but ultimately unexplored potential the ethical and moral aspects of this story were barely ever mentioned and even when they came up they weren't examined as thoroughly as they could have been and the main character seemed more concerned with the prospect of losing her newly acquired wealth than she was with the deaths of her fellow passengers or her husband for that matter it's perfectly fine to make a selfish manipulative person the lead character reading about flawed people is always interesting and more realistic but even such characters have emotions especially in extremely stressful life threatening situations grace seemed oddly disconnected from reality almost ghost like and that did not make me cheer for her nor especially care about her story for that matter that is not to say that this book is a total fiasco not at all though it lacks the narrative dread and it fails to tap into greater truths and deeper feelings it's still quite an enjoyable read if you can get past the unanswered questions unresolved plot lines and the lack of character growth in grace you might even like it it is a quick and pleasant read just not a deep one not a bad story by any means just one that if approached differently could have been much better but if you want a story that will really move you you should probably look somewhere else","1856":"full review on my blog guiltless reading","1857":"i kept reading this book to the end because i wanted to find out why the main character was on trial for her life i found myself skimming lots of long descriptive portions that did not succeed in holding my attention i was intrigued by the action that took place on the lifeboat among the survivors but anything other than that flashing back to the ship the current day's trial were not as interesting to me","1858":"it has been along time since i have read a book that i have had to force myself through it took me weeks to read this short book with each turned page i felt this has to be it i did rate it two stars only because the last few pages finally summed up the story overall i was very disappointed and wanted to stop reading it early on","1859":"i wanted to read this book as i was quite intrigued as to how someone could write a novel about people sitting in a lifeboat for three weeks obviously there was a lot more to it than that and it was a really enjoyable read set in 1914 a magnificent ocean liner suffers a mysterious explosion and sinks but not before several of it's lifeboats have been launched in one such boat is grace whose place was secured at the last minute by her husband henry whom she had to leave behind in the hope that he would make his way onto another one also on the boat is a crew member from the liner who immediately takes charge his first instruction being to put some distance between themselves and the sinking ship and more importantly the victims floundering in the ocean when he refuses to even stop to help a young child stating that the lifeboat is already over capacity we get our first glimpse of the lengths that people will go to for their own survival the story is narrated by grace in the form of her writing a journal of the events so we know that she survived however it's revealed right at the start that she is on her way to court to stand trial for her life along with two other women so it is then a matter of waiting for her journal to reveal just what exactly happened during those three weeks on the lifeboat this was a really enjoyable page turner of a book one of those that really makes you think what would i do in that situation","1860":"lots of interesting things to discuss well drawn characters a suspenseful plot and a good twist ending the group really enjoyed this and it made for a very good discussion","1861":"i would probably like this better after discussing it in a book group i wasn't happy that the tension in the boat and the need for survival weren't better expressed the dressmaker was a better historical fiction read and the nonfiction book unbroken was a better survival on open water read the lifeboat","1862":"totally got into this book a great story","1863":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really really e'noyed it couldn't put it down sort of thing insight into life religion love etc was quite thoughtful the characters are well drawn the circumstances of the boat a lifeboat at sea is so original and remarkable until the very end of the book when it wraps up so abruptly no numance no thought it seemed the writer suddenly decided she had written enough she had other things to take care of and just like that the story closed so much more should have been written i really really e'noyed it couldn't put it down sort of thing insight into life religion love etc was quite thoughtful the characters are well drawn the circumstances of the boat a lifeboat at sea is so original and remarkable until the very end of the book when it wraps up so abruptly no numance no thought it seemed the writer suddenly decided she had written enough she had other things to take care of and just like that the story closed so much more should have been written leading to the resolution which was simply too convenient teh love affair bewtween her and the lawyer should have been explored more perhaps from his perspective i would have given it 5 stars until the last 8 pages more","1864":" i loved everything about this book with exception of the epilogue the story was great deep and thought provoking it was a just dark enough to keep me interested i love that the other posed all these moral questions i did not need to know that last blurb so what it was like the other added for the hopeless romantic and i think it actually brought the novel down a notch it just was not necessary and i feel cheated when a read a book like this and i give into to completely and to appease a certain audience we tie the ending up in pink bow however over all it was keeper","1865":"this book started off so exciting i wanted a shock or a twist at the end especially given the character's personality how she ended up with henry still good book read it in a day","1866":"i liked the use of the unreliable narrator that makes you question and go back to the story over and over to try to determine what you would do for yourself and how the characters should have reacted","1867":"set during the beginning of wwi a ship goes down and survivors are in a lifeboat who survives who sacrifices and did murder occur that pretty much describes the whole book a short read only 219 pgs told by one survivor the reader is left to decide is she lying or telling the truth since she's on trial with fellow survivors it's hard to tell the ending is a bit disappointing but the overriding question of the book is would people be noble in this situation or would they do whatever it took to survive and in the end who do you believe this was a book club selection so discussion will be interesting","1868":" grace is twenty two years old and newly married the year is 1914 she and her wealthy husband are on a luxury liner going from london to the united states when an accident happens and the ship sinks she is left adrift in a lifeboat with thirty nine other people and her husband is not with them after spending three weeks on the sea they are finally rescued grace soon finds herself along with two other women on trail for a crime that was committed while in the lifeboat i found this book to be a bit tedious and some of the characters and situations were simply not believable 07 16 15 my bookclub discussed this last night and all twelve agreed the story was too boring and left too many unanswered questions also there was not enough character development","1869":"i had a really hard time connecting with this story the main character seemed interesting enough but just not deep enough for me i couldn't connect with her a lot of the book takes place in the lifeboat and i had trouble picturing it and becoming involved in the story i guess it just wasn't for me","1870":"i didn't even finish this book i tried for four months to read it and every time i picked it up i felt so frustrated i made it about a quarter way through the book and there was nothing about the story to grab me and make me feel remotely interested in the story","1871":"great read that kept me interested throughout interesting and unique premise the narrator grace seemed to me at first perhaps even for the majority of the book very logical smart and fair by the end my impression of her was completely changed she was shown to be diabolical and calculating very interesting development of character by the author","1872":"wow this book makes you think what it is to be human and what you would do in this situation","1873":"this was a really interesting story i liked how it dealt with the human instinct to survive and how it changes people in different ways it was also very detailed so rogan must have really done her research","1874":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i didn't really like this apparently i'm the only one it could have been better going into the details of the boat and everything that happened would have been good instead we only got a glimpse into their survival and focused on the murder a little detail on the other people rescued would have been nice we only got names here and there there was zero character development for anyone as for grace the main character i hated her i don't know if we were supposed to hate her or not maybe l i didn't really like this apparently i'm the only one it could have been better going into the details of the boat and everything that happened would have been good instead we only got a glimpse into their survival and focused on the murder a little detail on the other people rescued would have been nice we only got names here and there there was zero character development for anyone as for grace the main character i hated her i don't know if we were supposed to hate her or not maybe like the jury we were supposed to make up our own minds grace was a mean manipulative cruel person she murdered a man without question because someone else wanted her to she manipulated her husband the other survivors her doctors her lawyers and the court to make them believe that she was a good decent person she deserved to be found guilty more","1875":" to me very reminiscent of alias grace by margaret atwood and also very very good both graces are ambiguous characters and seem to float through life without commiting to it starting with discussion of grace's trial and then slowly unfolding events until her fate is decided by a jury i read this in 4 hours got caught up and couldn't put it down waiting for the reveal of her decision about what is important to her the breaking down of those in the lifeboat those who are strong those easily led and those in denial is partcularly interesting and made me think about my own behavior under those conditions this lack of self knowledge follows into the the courtroom","1876":"damn this was some good shit","1877":"well written couldn't put it down","1878":"brigette frase's review which led me to read this one said a subtle and persuasive analysis of the circumstances in which decent people can devolve into primal creatures perhaps a more accurate synopsis would be a subtle and persuasive analysis of the circumstances in which people realize the good or evil of their inner souls","1879":"this was one of those books you love and hate at the same time the drama of being stuck in the overcowded lifeboat was very well done some of the choices amde by the character made me want to scream at her if she hadn't been in the midst of a trauma very good book","1880":"this book didn't keep my interest i was considering putting it down but then visited goodreads and read some reviews someone somewhere said that the narrator had manipulated us that was enough to keep me reading but in the end i was either so bored that i missed the aha moment or there wasn't one either way i guess i should have stopped reading it halfway through to me it was mundane and had no real point the ending was odd too","1881":"erin and shelly a 2016 book club suggestion","1882":" he was very good at what he did but he was still a man and men rarely knew what decisions a woman had or hadn't made i was oddly disappointed with this one i was hoping for some answers that either the prosecutor or the defense or even someone who survived could tell us the whys and answer any number of the sordid stories and questions that popped up on the boat instead you are left wondering i was left jumping to conclusions based on grace's understanding of the situation not necessarily one i wanted to rely on","1883":"do you know the apocalypse now quote never get out of the boat well that's how i felt after i finished this novel the first two thirds is very engaging since the lifeboat scenes are quite gripping but it definitely lost its momentum in the last 75 pages after the setting shifts","1884":"this book never quite picked up for me grace is such an interesting mysterious character but since the story is told through her point of view and she is so guarded and controlled we never really got to see what really made her tick there are moments where tantalizing elements are revealed but i felt like i needed more","1885":"this book had some intriguing parts but left too much unanswered at the end i was expecting a twist that made it all come together but nothing it just ended so many things the author touched upon were never resolved i'm kind of annoyed","1886":"this was so creepy i haven't slept the night i was on the ferry going on vacation","1887":" i was fascinated to find out what this book was actually about i have yet to do some research on the author being her debut novel i always like to know what inspired their writing but i certainly wasn't disappointed in spending time in its pages i guess we've all been confronted with that partytime activity if you were on a desert island in a lifeboat and there was only food left for some not all of you who would you throw out give up on and then the values and morals dictate our answers this book does the same as i read i kept asking myself the question what would i do in this situation would i survive a lifeboat experience i was intrigued to know what details the author would create how 'true to life' could the story be as the story progresses charlotte doesn't put us in agony and stall the important information but rather moves us along at a good pace it's not a slow harrowing journey at all instead before we know it there is one overboard then two then three and it leaves you shocked sad and trying to side with the good and the bad in each of them i can't say that it's a happy read be prepared to be faced with some tough notions of life and survival but rest assured charlotte has crafted it well and left no stone unturned the story still haunts me a few days later i can still hear an undercurrent of questions inside about humanity and what we are called to do or not do at our most despairing moments","1888":"i had such high hopes for this book and was really disappointed","1889":"the lifeboat is a story about hard choices ambition and endurance but unlike other books that depict the circumstances surrounding difficult often criminal actions and the repercussions following those actions it didn't leave me with any insights into human nature a good story but not especially thought provoking it didn't stay with me once i put the book down and that is its biggest flaw","1890":"i have mixed feelings about this book maybe because i've already read a novel about an extended unwanted stay in a lifeboat jamrach's menagerie and seen the life of pi i felt like i could almost predict some of the events which occurred in this story down to the unreliable narrator the book was beautifully written and the main character herself was intriguing her name grace almost an antonym to her determination to better her situation in life but in the end wasn't really won over just an okay read","1891":"survivors of a shipwreck turn on each other after days in an overcrowded lifeboat i read it in one day","1892":"i loved this book grace the narrator is a wonderful character who is by contrasts naive at times yet calculating and ruthless in obtaining what she wants at the end you will still be wondering if what version of events to believe","1893":"i flew through this book hoping things would get wrapped up at the end sadly i felt there were too many loose ends also grace was not a strong main character i found her conniving yet indecisive i've never been in a lifeboat situation but i found some of the actions of the people questionable and unbelievable it was an ok read and plenty of people are giving it glowing reviews but it just didn't do that much for me","1894":"really good read","1895":"interesting situation that most of us may never encounter however it causes you to think deeply about survival skills i feel that an experience like this would change anyone while on the lifeboat and for those who survived f","1896":" i seem to read a lot of books where people get stranded in the water life of pi unbroken left for dead kon tiki with no sos heard left for dead this debut novel was not as good as i had hoped but it has a great main character that shows us the resilience that we need to survive in our lives there is a toughness of character and intense introspection in grace that i admire although she does things that i would not approve of in normal life a nice period piece although i think the writer is a modern woman who tends to make the wwi era a little to tech heavy keep writing charlotte","1897":" what would you do if your ship sank and you were left on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with other passengers and limited supplies how would you handle to frustrations of your fellow lifeboat passengers how would you keep your spirit strong and sane it was interesting to see in the end how the characters behaved in the lifeboat that became their small world in this world there were leaders and followers those who paired off in balances of strengths and weaknesses there was a spiritual leader and when he disappeared one who took his place showing the need of such a leader there were those in authority who had power over the group and led and those who tried to take over control there were discontented who murmured and those who just floated along in the end the woman through whom we saw all that happened and who had lost her husband was asked about her experiences and in thinking about herself with or without henry the husband she lost she said i don't think that the only way to show courage is to face the world alone also there is room for love and companionship in my life overall this was a great read and made me think about myself and what i might do if the challenges were so life altering i was listening to a conference talk this morning and this quote struck me you must be the rock that the river cannot wash away grace was truly a rock and despite the challenges she faced she survived and was able to move forward after it was all over","1898":"this is a quick read as very little happens it could even be described as tedious a great premise but sadly this novel fails to deliver","1899":"there were far too many characters in the lifeboat therefore it was difficult to keep track of their backstories the main character grace served as the narrator so the reader just saw one view of the ship's sinking i don't strongly recommend this book","1900":"this was just an ok read for me the premise was great but for me the book didn't grab me","1901":"started off loving it ended up liking it good read scary premise i would be interested to see if others who read it all agree on what actually happened in the end","1902":"the best thing about this book was its length short i've never read a book of less than 300 pages that was so difficult to get through it just never picked up any momentum for me this falls under the category of should have loved it but didn't","1903":"quick and suspenseful but it took me a while to distinguish between the characters in the boat i did like the ambiguity of the main character some major details e g how and why the boat crashed would have increased my enjoyment of the story still the psychology and pack mentality on the lifeboat held some interesting xonsequences","1904":"i feel rogan did a good job of constructing the world on the lifeboat i only gave this 3 stars because she established so many mysteries in the beginning of the book that were never resolved i wanted more character development as well","1905":"great book really made me want to keep reading and not put it down","1906":"the main character makes me want to dress like rosie the riveter and burn my bra and this book along with it a little harsh i'm sure there were parts that were interesting and i can't wait to discuss at the next meeting but overall i was so angry at the ending that i'm back to burning things","1907":"loved this book though the last 50ish pages were a bit of a let down the book started out strong then seemed to rush through the ending grace's voice seemed to get lost in the end","1908":" many say that the narrator protagonist grace of this novel is a person for whom one can only summon intense dislike by the middle of the book i concur then the book gets three stars because nobody liked grace i detested her she's one of those people with no ironclad center who she is what she thinks what she will do all changes according to who is around her at that moment not only that she chooses to be u0026amp think like whichever person she deems most valuable i have known people like this chameleons changing who they are irrevocably and tragically to suit the new person deemed important so yes the main character is kind of awful but the book is wonderful we don't have to like her to fall into the rhythms of the story bumping against our minds like oars against a boat it's a good story there are some holes for me like why not use a bit of bone from a corset and make a fish hook and use the offal from the two caught fish or the dead in desperation as bait or make a needle from a bit of bone u0026amp sew dresses together to make a big billowing sail wondering that out loud brings up the question would a different group of people in another lifeboat do completely different things maybe the beauty of this story in part lies in its ability to make us think","1909":"couldn't finish this so painfully dull","1910":" on the eve of world war i the fictional empress alexandra sinks en route to america and newlywed grace finds herself widowed and stranded aboard a floundering over capacity lifeboat in the middle of the north atlantic when the novel opens she has survived weeks at sea only to find herself on trial for murder the circumstances of which are unknown to the reader told in a series of journal entries written by grace to aide in her defense charlotte rogan's engrossing debut novel is a fascinating study in human nature and what happens when people are pushed to their absolute limits as readers wonder who will survive who will be murdered who and what will be sacrifieced next how they will be rescued and perhaps more intriguing who is telling the truth the pages will turn themselves","1911":"i have read so many books involving ships sailing and the sea lately that i should start a new maritime category this is a gripping read with the perfect blend of unreliable narrator and extreme circumstances","1912":" i had high hopes for this novel after seeing it listed on a couple of best of 2012 lists the writing was eloquent and the story line had so much potential but by the 3 4 mark of this book i found myself feeling a bit like i myself was stranded on a lifeboat with no hope of rescue i had to slog through the final pages and when it was over i didn't really feel a sense of resolution as much as relief that i'd made it through the entire book there were aspects of the story line and main character that i felt needed to be more detailed and or fleshed out i was left with far too many questions about the how who why's of the story and it was hard to feel any real emotional connection to the narrator as the very nature of her narration was to keep herself her motivations and her true intentions somewhat veiled from the reader i found it the most frustrating aspect of the book and ultimately what kept me from feeling fulfilled by or connected to the story i give it a solid eh","1913":"this book is a bit hard to rate as it's not one that you actually enjoy reading nor can you really identify with the characters and situation however i will say that i think rogan did a good job imagining how gruesome the days of being stranded on a lifeboat would be though the ending was a bit odd","1914":"i struggled between giving this two or three stars i went up because the writing is good but i felt let down by the ending also i might have enjoyed the story more without the trial aspect why bring the outside world into the tragedy instead of having the dilemmas which arise be waged solely by grace and the other people in the lifeboat adding the trial felt like outsiders intruding into a story where they did not belong perhaps that's the point people intruding into something they can't understand but i would have enjoyed a subtler approach maybe through interaction after the rescue with her sister or mother in law there is no mention about the trial on the back of the book and i don't know if i would have read it if there had been","1915":"good psychological novel with an interesting twist at the end","1916":"it was ok a good debut but hard to follow all the characters","1917":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here creepy suspenseful disturbing hopeful clever leaves you wondering not all the ends are wrapped up but how could they be definitely a page turner with the most unreliable narrator ever one of the best books i have read this year is grace a mr s ripley or is she simply a strong survivor the reader can decide eta trying to get fb link to work","1918":"this is an unsettling book somewhat reminiscent of lord of the flies what happens when otherwise civilized people are put in an isolated and stressful situation it is a psychological study wrapped up in an interesting story it was a page turner a good mix of mystery and foreshadowing to keep the reader wondering what was going to happen almost anything i could say would be a spoiler so i won't say much about the story this would be a good choice for a book club","1919":" when the empress alexandra sinks forty people are in a lifeboat 14 john hardie a member of the liner's crew and the only person with seamanship abilities states the lifeboat is unable to hold this many and in a storm they would be capsized told from the point of view of one of the women in the lifeboat who has survived and is now charged with murder we slowly learn of the groups twenty one days at sea before they are rescued over time some die and at one point four of the men sacrifice themselves when a short straw draw chooses them when two of the women decided mr hardie is no longer a benefit they vote to throw him overboard and the main character although she abstains from the vote when the vote is for throwing him overboard she helps in doing it some days later they are rescued and soon the three women are jailed and on trial grace the story's protagonist is separated from the two and it is from her remembrances that the story is told","1920":"this is a what if book what if another ocean liner mysteriously sank a few years after the titanic what if several lifeboats full of people escaped and remained unrescued for weeks what if three of the women threw another survivor overboard and were tried for murder upon their return to civilization grace winters is one of those women newly married and subsequently widowed she's a tricky one an unreliable narrator relaying the events of her time in the lifeboat and her trial she admits to earlier manipulations or at least omissions of truth and claims to not remember some of the events on the boat which is understandable considering the conditions she looks out for herself in a time when women had few legal rights while grace does raise some interesting questions about faith justice and memory this isn't a life changing read it's not particularly deep or exceptionally suspenseful but it was an enjoyable read i shelved this book as historical in the sense that it takes place during a specific period of history not that the events portrayed actually happened","1921":"a rather strange but interesting story of a woman who spends two weeks in a lifeboat after the luxury liner she is on sinks and how she makes her way by taking every advantage possible","1922":"i mostly liked the book but i did find it got a little boring reading day after day on the lifeboat but i guess the author had to build up to the end and the trial very descriptive of the narrative by grace and the ups and downs of the people on the boat","1923":"well written and interesting character study of someone struggling to survive adrift at sea also an intimate look at group dynamics and how they change as life and death decisions become reality nothing that will change my outlook on life or stay with me for a long time but a satisfying read","1924":"interesting different fun read good story and characters","1925":"hmmm i found this oddly slow and unemotional despite being a story about a life and death struggle","1926":"could not get into this one at all i know some folks who i usually agree with loved it but this was not my cup of tea","1927":"interesting tale of survival","1928":"i really liked the premise 39 people on an overloaded lifeboat for 21 days and all the moral dilemmas that go with it told after the fact by a 22 year old newlywed widow who is a seriously unreliable narrator if you're wanting the ends to tie up neatly at the end though or even to be sure of grace's intentions this book isn't for you i can't decide if the childish desire to know at the end is part of the author's point or just more proof of grace's simplicity or coldness or evil","1929":"this was so calmly terrifying i love it rogan really jumps right into it with this book there's no boring beginning simply morbid foreshadowing then we're in the lifeboat i love the arc of excitement in this book other books like this tend to start slowly and then slowly work up to murders this is nice enough but it gets old rogan was careful not to do that the foreshadowing prevented you from really feeling safe at the beginning she also did a good job of portraying the shock a lot of books like this tend to show characters recovering unrealistically quickly no they're going to sit around crying for a few days and that's unsettling when you're used to super survivor characters of course there was a super survivor view spoiler i like how his sociopathy is obvious from the beginning but not in a stereotypical psycho way just in a clinical sense he didn't feel shocked that's pretty messed up but no one questions it because he's actually really smart and capable no pure light or dark characters he didn't resort to cannibalism his logic makes chilling sense still we can tell he's the villain because of foreshadowing there's never a time when you like this guy then the action escalates people die there are storms the book feels calmer this is so perfect for showing the messed up mental state of our narrator you notice when she detaches herself and starts remembering things more logically and less emotionally it's a perfect use of the unreliable narrator the confusion adds a whole other level of creepy then the ending comes around and you can't think of any central points that aren't tied up but you aren't satisfied the character feels real and you're worried about her going out into the world she's been hurt and that can't be fixed in three hundred pages it's chilling hide spoiler i highly recommend the lifeboat it's engaging and terrifying","1930":"great story when i could give it time and my full attention it was engrossing","1931":"well written","1932":"good book on how people coped living on a lifeboat for some time after their boat sank and how some were put on trial because of what happened","1933":"god i really wanted to be able to review this book like this a lot like the life of pi but with fewer tigers because the life of pi is about a kid that gets stuck in a lifeboat with a tiger right it sounds so awesome but when i tried to read it it's just unreadable it might not even be about a kid trapped in a lifeboat with a tiger possibly the tiger is a metaphor for humanity's unique capacity to comprehend death or something i don't even know the point is that the lifeboat isn't really anything like the life of pi it's about a woman circa 1918 or something who survives a shipwreck her new husband secures her a seat on a lifeboat but tragedy strikes when no one comes to rescue the poor bastards in the boat they linger at sea for weeks succumbing to the darkest side of the will to survive u0026amp once the boat is plucked out of the water the narrator u0026amp two other women are put on trial for murder it's definitely un put downable or maybe that's just my weird horror of the ocean speaking i zipped through this bad boy in maybe three hours u0026amp i was surprised u0026amp gratified to find that aside from being about as much of a thriller as you can cobble together from a cast of characters trapped on a lifeboat together it also has some interesting feminist y elements could have used a tiger though so points off for that","1934":"it was very similar to an old movie i had seen and i mentally kept thinking about the movie however it was an interesting read","1935":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the strength of this story lies in the middle ground very human character flaws of the main character this debut author does a fine job of fleshing out this first person voice one character but the other characters are so skeletal that i had trouble sympathizing with their plight missing also were the back stories on the ship and its passengers henry's family how she ends up engaged to her lawyer and the relationship of others on the lifeboat this was a slim 250 pages book that the strength of this story lies in the middle ground very human character flaws of the main character this debut author

the ship and its passengers henry's family how she ends up engaged to her lawyer and the relationship of others on the lifeboat this was a slim 250 pages book that needed more greatly fleshed out details to be well crafted i read this because every magazine including a lengthy article in oprah promoted this as a must read in their may issue last month it was the vanishers which i quit after the first 50 pages i am beginning to think there's a publishing conspiracy when i go to the library and find dozens of other newly published is this really the best of the best more","1936":"intense scary makes me wonder what i'd do being stuck in a lifeboat in the middle of nowhere","1937":"not my favorite novel but some good observations about human nature and empathy","1938":"i didn't find any characters in this book to actually like i wanted to know how everything played out but i was also disappointed to see that nothing about the characters really seemed to change as a result of the experience","1939":" as soon as i read the synopsis for this book i was intrigued it's 1914 and the ship 'empress alexandra' sets sail for new york a few days in to the voyage the ship suffers a mysterious explosion on board and the passengers are put on to a lifeboat which it soon becomes apparent is overloaded here we follow the passengers and our main character grace only 22yrs old as they wait to be rescued this book is mainly about our most basic instinct 'survival' and how we all can react differently in extreme conditions told by grace it is often hard to work out if she in fact a reliable narrator but she does seem vulnerable amongst the power struggles and authority of the other strong characters in the lifeboat the book makes you analyse everyone and think all the time as we see examples of extreme human behaviour as morals and all else go out of the window as people fend for themselves the story runs between the past and present as grace is looking back at what happened in the lifeboat due to her court hearing for murder along with two other passengers that were aboard but how and why did such an act take place i really enjoyed this book and the style of writing and if i could i would have given 4 5 but i dropped a half star due to the ending that felt a bit rushed and parts given away i thought a bit too early overall a very enjoyable read and this author really is one to watch for the future","1940":"historical fiction is one f my favorite genres and this book seemed to have such an excited premiss yet it was hard to trudge though and very boring","1941":"ambition morality and self deception all the while within a story of survival","1942":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the lifeboat is a life and death struggle for one girl named grace she starts in a struggle for life when her father fails at his business then takes his life which in those days causes the whole family to go down then she marries secretly and was coming home but the boat bringing her home wrecks and she is put on a real lifeboat where she survives again just to be saved and brought home to be arrested and have to

more","1943":"i really wanted to love this book but unfortunately it was a big disappointment i didn't care about any of the characters and the writing was flat and one dimensional i made it half way before i just gave up it could have been a wonderful story","1944":"an interesting intense look at what lies at the heart of man in this book everything is stripped away from a diverse group of people when they have to survive on a small boat for three weeks the narrator is person i did not necessarily like but i understood her i even related to her in some occasions it was a captivating story","1945":"an interesting book about a group of people who all ended up in a lifeboat after their ship sank since it was overcrowded they had to decide who would go overboard in order to save the others a grim subject but the writing style was very good","1946":" in this novel newlywed grace winter is stranded upon a lifeboat after the sinking of her luxury ocean liner no one has come to rescue the survivors and she must along with the other inhabitants of the boat decide who must lead and more darkly who must die so that the others may have a chance to survive this was a fascinating psychological study the novel is framed by grace's trial for murder of one of the citizens in the boat and i know for one that i was not wholly sure of grace's innocence still i was unsure if she or the other boat inhabitants really could or would have done differently given their desperate circumstances if you are into psychology or just like books that pose questions that can't be answered easily this is one for you","1947":"an interesting look at human nature in a life and death circumstance it was pretty insightful for a first novel i thought","1948":"so not sure how this happened consciously or unconsciously but i've read a lot of sea survival books recently that fact might have lessened my enjoyment of this one as it is inferior to the other ones it definitely interesting and a different take on how rich passengers might have tried to survive at sea in the 1910's although i don't think the basic principles of sea survival has changed all that much since people started traveling in boats on the sea water food shelter from the sun and not killing each other that's pretty much all it takes simple right now add an unreliable narrator who seems like a bit of a sociopath to me and you have an enjoyable quick read there were a lot of holes in the narrative due to the writer not really accounting for all the characters on the boat 39 are a lot to keep track of but once a writer mentions numbers i start doing the math this habit of mine can be distracting and annoying but most people have their own odd habits when reading the lifeboat is the story of grace winter who is aboard a luxury cruise liner when there is an explosion of some kind and the ship starts to sink her newlywed husband somehow gets her on board an overly full lifeboat and the harrowing survival story begins there are villains on the boat along with some heroes mixed in with some ordinary and faceless people narrator winter is very unreliable but she is a survivor and her loyalty towards different people on board changes with who has power or who will soon have power i read this for a book discussion and the room was never quiet it was one of the best book discussions i've been to as there is a lot of material to discuss both in the narrative and the morality of some of the characters","1949":" the story follows the story of a young woman on trial after the empress alexandria sinks in the atlantic ocean this is not a retelling of the titanic sinking as that occurred at a different time but it is a story of what happened in a lifeboat after the sinking of the boat the details in the characters of the other occupants is wonderfully told you begin to see some jump to assist and others sit back and wait the stress of the situation shows some of the real personalities come to the surface how would you act under that situation there is how you think you would act and then what actually happens when the conflict presents itself loved it","1950":" well this is no life of pi which will be the last big story in everyone's mind concerning a lifeboat seemingly it is a page turner you would not want to put down and readable in one sitting i did read it in four days but only as i was late starting it for my pending book club meet any was it good well yes alfred hitchcock directed his own lifeboat back in 1944 from a john steinbeck story which whilst reading rogan's book i was reminded of the back story with rogan's book was gender power and politics of the time which was also around the mid 1940's as opposed to hitchcock's adversaries being evil nazi's or stiff upper lip brits on this lifeboat the main man is mr hardie at first heroic a leader safe attractive but soon enough the huddled unhappy women get so upset with the untidiness of the boat what with scraps of dead fish and birds lying around the main man is held responsible with dire consequences the heroine 22 year old grace winter remains detached throughout from the lethal rages of unfulfilled domesticity needs and at the same time is manipulative self preserving and all the while scheming in effect being a life survivor casting all and sundry adrift in her journey without any one being thrown a lifebelt ensuring desire for her all the more","1951":" i enjoyed this book for many reasons the narrative voice was compelling the story was immediately interesting and little revelations throughout kept up the tension and interest this book is definitely a survival tale but at the same time it's much more complex than that at its core it's really about how grace is a consummate survivor and has spent most of her short life surviving i kept forgetting how young she was supposed to be but it also touches on important themes like feminism class issues religious faith the power of memory and the nature of survival the ending lost me just a little bit though and i'm disappointed that i still don't know what the truth of the story is i always feel like an unreliable narrator is a mean trick to play on the reader because if that's all the reader is told how am i supposed to know what really happened and i'm the kind of person who always wants to know what really happened as if these are all true stories on some plane of existence by the end of the book though i had to question almost everything grace told us and i have no means of comparison so i was left frustrated and a bit annoyed nonetheless this problem is probably not the book's fault the author executed the unreliable narrator part very skillfully and it's really just my own character flaw that led me to give this book 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 it was beautifully written in any case which makes it worth a read in itself so don't let me talk you out of reading it","1952":"well worth reading one or two anachronisms i thought","1953":"sorry not my cup of tea way to long way to much introspection repetitive","1954":"this was a very odd book even after reading it i am not sure i understand the events in the lifeboat please note it is purely fiction and not based on any real shipwreck","1955":"the first part of the book was intriguing especially since it is the 50 year anniversay of the titanic sinking however i don't feel like the author pulled off the moral delimena that was suppose to be the climax of the book i sort of read right through it without much emotion","1956":"i concurr with emma the lifeboat traps the reader in a story that is exciting on the literal level and brutally moving at the existential although i read it in two goes","1957":"i enjoyed this hard to believe it was the author's first book by having the narrator refer to the future events as she tells you the story as she looks back on it it kept you turning the pages wanting to know the whole story","1958":"this one got a good review in the la times which is the reason i sought it out however the lifeboat idea in its various incarnations is such an overworked idea that the book had better be pretty damn good in order to overcome the setup this wasn't it was a pretty good read but i never felt fully invested in the characters and never truly believed the story","1959":"i read this sometime last year and remember wanting to like it more but i couldn't the characters weren't likeable don't usually have a problem with that or believable that i have a problem with","1960":"too bad no half stars i did have high hopes for this book the plot was appealing the concept intriguing after a mysterious explosion on their ocean liner happened after the sinking of the titanic 39 people are adrift in the ocean all in a lifeboat not really made for 40 as the plaque states grace winter newly wedded and now a widow is one of those on a tiny lifeboat she tell the story of survival betrayal and its outcome how do 39 people survive together with different points of view little water and even less food one could draw parallels to the character roxie from chicago how innocent at some points grace sounded like a song was coming a great effort from first time author charlotte rogan","1961":"it was brave of the author to take on such a difficult project how do you keep people entertained with a story about people in a lifeboat ultimately an interesting series of moral dilemmas and a broad reflection on the human condition how our thoughts let us wander toward suspicion unless buoyed by others confidence in us and the little bits of things that are picked up in conversation that turn into very large pieces of evidence later on watch what you say","1962":"a bit hard to get into but then i couldn't put it down","1963":"huh really like it except the ending","1964":"good narrator and seemed really believable","1965":"grace is a survivor she doesn't realize that she is but her story proves that she is she was on a lifeboat for 23 days after just being married after being rescued she was on trial for her life and she was also a newlywed u0026amp a widow this is a very captivating book i was hooked from the very beginning","1966":"bu0026amp b january 2013 fiction book grp april 2013","1967":"a quick and entertaining read it would make for a good movie","1968":"i had high hopes for this book but actually found if quite boring","1969":"classic life choices situation of too many people being in a lifeboat what would you do if you forced others out to save the rest would you be guilty of murder a good book for a reading group","1970":"by halfway through this book i was feeling waterlogged","1971":" i was really intrigued by the premise of this story it seemed like it would be interesting to see how people would deal with being stuck in a lifeboat together however much of the story falls flat the story of her time in the lifeboat is interwoven with her present time in prison while on trial for murder this alone made me stop because it doesn't seem plausible that survivors from a tragedy would be charged with a crime it just seems obvious to argue emotional mental distress under unforeseen circumstances so this initial point annoyed me right off the bat additionally grace is a horrible narrator she is indecisive passive and lacks compassion and empathy she also comes across as a manipulative bitch who purposely steals her husband away from his fiancee just so she doesn't have to get a job and fend for herself then there's the whole business with how she got on the lifeboat no spoilers but this seemed like a wasted opportunity this storyline is never developed or concluded it's just used as fodder for speculation which annoys me again because i hate loose endings overall it just seemed like a pointless story grace continues to manipulate the jury her lawyers and overall the reader it really could have been developed much better if it had been grittier and tenser instead of shying away from the harsh realities of human nature","1972":"a well written first novel an ocean liner sinks mid atlantic forcing 40 people into an inadequate lifeboat the boat is adrift for 21 days not all survive and during the time a crime is committed but is it really a crime given the circumstances the experience aboard the lifeboat turns a life comfortable with simple blacks and whites into one filled with grays a very thoughtful page turner","1973":"i might give closer to 5 stars but i disliked how the story was broken up it was very compelling and i finished it in 2 days losing sleep to keep reading which is of course a high compliment","1974":"i found this book fairly boring and found myself skimming just to see how it ends","1975":"intriguing question of unreliable narrator would be fun to discuss","1976":"couldn't wait to finish this book don't even know why i kept reading","1977":"this book was chosen by our book group i was not excited to read it due to the lifeboat scenario it was better than i expected it to be just not a book i would choose on my own","1978":"disappointing is the first word that come to mind as i reflect upon the lifeboat i should not be surprised at this disappointment there is only so much one can discuss about being trapped on a small vessel in the middle of the atlantic ocean nor is this the first attempt by a writer to weave a tale of being trapped on small dingy charlotte rogan's story is about grace winter a recently married woman who finds herself without her husband on a lifeboat full of strangers in 1914 the passenger boat sinks at the start of the first world war and how it sunk is unknown to all instead the tale weaves the classics conflicts - man vs nature man vs man and man vs self - as grace winter and her \"companions\" hope for rescue also one senses that the period's social norms towards women and their role in society also are equally critical in this book's story regretfully i was not a fan of the lifeboat maybe i wanted to focus more on the struggle within the boat or perhaps the lives of the characters regretfully we only have the main protagonist's point of view possibly it would have been more interesting if the author wrote from the perspective a few key characters instead of a single person i give this book a rating of 2 50 stars out of 5 stars thus barely a 3 star read of goodreads","1979":"well between 3 and 4 stars four because i kept reading and was curious about the truth three because i never related to grace throughout and almost wished that oops can't tell ya","1980":"new year's resolution if nothing is happening halfway through a book i give myself permission to move on this book just can't get going even squeezed into a shaky soggy lifeboat the characters by the time i hit the halfway mark remain flat one dimensional and self serving charlotte the main focus of the group of survivors of a 1914 titanic like accident has little depth and complexity despite the hints that there will be deception and mystery ahead a riveting trial the spoilers on the book jacket tease i'll never get there this book had potential but the pacing leaves me shrugging","1981":"ok plot was ok character development ok fastu0026amp easy read","1982":" fascinating read that i finished rather quickly this book follows the viewpoint of a survivor of a ship wreak that was stranded at sea with 30 some other people and what they had to do or at least thought they had to do to make it though the ordeal after several days and some questionable choices three of the survivors are on trial for murder so the book is the retelling of the events through flashback and intermittent glimpses of the trial wonderful book worth the read makes you question what you think you could be capable of in a time of desperation there is a fantastic quote from the book that i just love because it is so accurate \"you must admit that it is only in lonely and challenging circumstances that our true natures show through \" now aren't you just dying to know what really happened out there on that boat","1983":"the idea of what you would do if you survived a sinking ship and what drives people to survive is intriguing to me i started this book with the hope of a survival at all costs tale but was disappointed none of the characters were well drawn and the protagonist is confusing i ultimately wished that the main character had not survived as i didn't find any redeeming qualities in her a book club choice","1984":" wow was this book descriptive at times i really felt like i was on the lifeboat with the 39 passengers of the sinking empress alexandra as these 39 people got further away from their sinking ship and struggled in their over crowded lifeboat for 20 days rogan really allowed you to feel their emotion i can't even imagine the mental state of those that survived those later days on the boat although i did enjoy this book there are many other books i would recommend over this one however if you're ever curious what it might be like to be stranded out at sea for days on end this is the book for you","1985":" this is a very enjoyable book full of atmosphere and tension which i found very hard to put down once i started reading it it had a really authentic feel to the story with the reader feeling almost as chilled as the occupants of lifeboat 14 as one follows the story i loved the character of grace as the narrator she had a powerful voice and her narration of the story was compelling and yet there was just a tiny undercurrent of doubt as to how much we as the reader should trust her consider for instance how easily she convinces her fellow prisoner florence that she is mistaken in the fact that she has just watched grace conceal something she shouldn't have beneath her pillow there is something a little too easy and natural about the manner in which the lies come to grace other reviewers have commented on the fact that there is little background to events leading up to the sinking of the empress alexandra with only half stories provided as to the mystery behind the explosion in some ways i found that this added to the authenticity of the tale grace herself admits that she was very wrapped up in her own personal affairs and not watching too closely the events aboard the ship but in others and like other readers i did find this frustrating and would have liked to know more on the whole however i found this a very entertaining read and would certainly recommend it","1986":"what should have been an interesting read was tedious and boring the characters were unlikeable at best and the narrative was a schlog i ended up hoping they'd all drown","1987":"slow going","1988":"grace finds herself in a lifeboat after the ship she and her husband are sailing from england to america explodes and sinks once the survivors reach land grace is among the women arrested and charged with a horrible crime is grace a villain or a victim or both can others really understand not to mention judge what people do in a life or death situation grace who has without compunction poached another woman's fiance to avoid going to work as a governess narrates this story does her remorselessness on that situation tell us the truth about her character this story was skillfully told and it gave me a lot to think about after i finished it","1989":"heavy handed","1990":" i really enjoyed this book 39 people mostly women are afloat in a lifeboat after the sinking of their luxury liner going between england and the u s in 1914 wwi is just beginning in europe the interaction between the people under incredibly difficult circumstances was very interesting and it made me think how i would behave and or be able to cope with the uncertainty and hardships these people were faced with the amazon reviews are all over the boards on this one but i really liked it the ending wasn't what i expected although i don't know what i did expect so i can't really say that i was disappointed good book quick read highly recommend","1991":" after reading this book i googled images of lifeboats grace the narrator describes the lifeboat that she is stuck on as a vast space i imagine it to be much larger than a real lifeboat could be which in perspective is rather bizarre because the premise of the book is that the lifeboat is a tight and overcrowded space i found the characters to be deep and multifaceted grace is a manipulative and compelling character while it becomes obvious that she is an unreliable narrator she is a good storyteller and i felt drawn to her she explains her wedding trap and is very self involved confusing her manipulations with strength","1992":" boats and sailingboats and sailingboats and

insured her survival pre lifeboat in the lifeboat and after while reading this book i wondered what choices or sacrifices i would have made","1994":"this was five stars until near the end i found it sort of petered out and i lost interest and respect for the characters","1995":"this is an incredible tale of endurance and human nature in it's most desperate hour almost the entire story is confined to a twenty two foot lifeboat and in turn charlotte rogan creates a cast of deep characters whose desires morals and histories are revealed as their situation deteriorates what a wonderful debut novel","1996":"i did not want to put this book down once i started reading it but i was left with a somewhat ambivalent feeling once i was done kudos for the writing character development and storytelling enjoyed the way the narrator goes back and forth between remembering what it was like according to her memory on the boat her present situation and her life before henry did not appreciate the subplot or was there about hardie and blake's speculative relationship pre and post sinking","1997":"it was just ok some of the plot was way out there the dialogue seemed contrived and it really had no ending i didn't hate it but really didn't love it either","1998":"hated this book","1999":" ironically for me i gave this book 3 stars more because it will be memorable than because i actually enjoyed the story i'm pretty sure that what i felt was monotonous writing and pacing was actually intentional to make you feel what the characters must have felt being stuck on that lifeboat for so many days and nights and while there were some exciting parts i feel like something more could have been done to convey there terror they surely would have felt not because i am a fan of terror frightening stories necessarily but more as a balance break from the monotony i was very keen to find out how the trial would turn out though so it's not a 2 star book in that i had to force myself to finish but maybe if we had met grace and knew more of her story from the beginning instead of through disjointed flashbacks i could have connected with her and had a rooting interest as it was i was merely curious to see how the writer would end the story didn't really care whether they were convicted or not my rating system 5 stars great book will run around telling everyone to read it will probably read again one day 4 stars really enjoyed the book would probably recommend if asked about it 3 stars read the book enjoyed it at the time but not necessarily memorable 2 stars finished the book but did not necessarily enjoy it i don't give 1 stars because i don't feel comfortable rating reviewing books i haven't finished any book i've finished falls into one of the categories above","2000":"i'm still thinking about this after having finished it i'm not sure i completely know what really happened and what was a result of the narrator's trauma and false memory i thought it was pretty compelling","2001":"i really liked this book a lot it takes place in the summer of 1914 henry and grace have just gotten married and are sailing aboard the empress alexandra from london to america an mysterious explosion takes place on board and all of the passengers scramble to get into lifeboats grace and henry are separated so grace is forced to make decisions based on her own thinking it's all quite exciting this book is thick with juxtapositions strong vs weak spiritualism vs realism rich vs poor it is a story of hard choices and endurance what began as a team of survivors working together in the lifeboat for a common cause ended with disdain and the playing out of behaviors that no one would be proud of the story is told by grace and the reader is privileged to gain an in depth look at her thinking process and to see how it landed her into a very precarious situation i highly recommend this book and don't quite understand why it only received 3 1 2 stars in it's rating on goodreads","2002":" an interesting premise can we be held accountable legally for actions that occurred in a survival situation i liked the structure of the story starting out at the beginning of the trial and then moving to the ship's sinking and the time on the lifeboat at times i found myself wanting even more details about what it was like in the lifeboat and i wondered how grace could keep all the details straight for each day i would think they would all sort of blend together there was not much mention of some of grace's feeling wouldn't she have been full of fear i know i would have i liked the characterizations and i did feel like i could smell the sea salt whilst reading","2003":"i am constantly fascinated in everyday life by people and their actions i always wonder how people think and what goes through their minds when they do or say certain things was i fascinated by grace in this story no i thought she was an unlikable character who was calculating and conniving and not by her actions on the lifeboat but by her back story how she met henry and how she planned to change her course in life the lifeboat descriptions were fascinating you almost felt the anguish but also the hope of course nobody knows how they might react in such a horrific situation and i don't think any of them should have been condemned for the choices they made under the circumstances i would have liked the book better if it highlighted more characters rather than just grace and what was going on in their heads during the ordeal why was mrs grant the way she was why was hannah always so focused on grace who was hardie really or maybe these questions come up just because the only point of view we have are the manisfestations of grace's thinking","2004":"ugh the detached telling of the story makes this so hard to connect with i can't remember names personalities a fail","2005":"i was a bit disappointed in this book the premise was interesting but the way it played out didn't resonate with me grace the narrator was not a sympathetic character without spoiling the story the end was not satisfying to me i would have preferred more detail","2006":"terrifying experience of being shipwrecked nothing but vast ocean in small boat made to hold no more than forty people once you start reading it is hard to put down","2007":"this was kind of a combination of life of pi and lord of the flies what made it interesting was not so much the survival on a lifeboat story but wondering whether the narrator was reliable she left out an awful lot about herself very open ended and many interpretations could be made i wouldn't have read this one if my book group wasn't going to discuss it and now darn it i'll miss the discussion it is definitely one that you need to bounce off someone else","2008":"not as exciting as i thought it would be there are real moments of tension on the lifeboat but she isn't able to sustain it for long much of the book just seems to plod along i read the whole thing but i never felt really captivated","2009":" if you went to law school you may have read the tale of the speluncean explorers a group of cave explorers caught in a cave in u0026amp unable to be rescued before all would die the solution kill u0026amp eat one of their number subsequently the survivors go on trial for murder the justices of the fictional high court can't agree on how it should come out the typical law school exercise is to write an essay deciding that question in this novel rogan posits an overloaded lifeboat after the sinking of an ocean liner not a cave similar dilemma the author tells the story through a female narrator one of those on the lifeboat who survives the ordeal but then with two other women survivors is put on trial for murder this was quite a page turner and not everyone is who they seem to be","2010":"enjoyed it book club pick so we should have good discussion on this one disappointed with the ending a bit but the ethical discussions alone will make up for that","2011":" this is a well written book that makes you think at the start of the book we know that grace is on trial for murder but are given no detail of why this is so her lawyers ask her to write a diary of exactly what happened and this makes up most of the rest of the book we learn of an explosion on the liner empress alexandra and of what happens to the passengers and crew grace finds herself in an overloaded lifeboat for 3 weeks before they are rescued the people in the boat face some moral dilemmas if the weather worsens the overloaded boat will be likely to sink but how to lighten the boat would you be able to sacrifice yourself for the good of the others in the boat or would we all end up like those here who are soon plotting spreading doubts and rumours the boat has a crew member on board mr hardie who takes charge but then some on the boat begin to doubt his decisions and to wonder if he really has their best interests at heart maybe someone else should take over the decision making with everyone weak from hunger and thirst beginning to despair of being rescued they all find their strength of character tested there are many questions about why the boat exploded and whether grace is as innocent as she appears and at the end of the book these are not all answered leaving you wondering about the outcome of the trial i'm sure we all hope we would behave better if we were in the same situation but this book leaves you thinking about what you would do if you felt it was necessary to survive","2012":"it's like a social experiment put people on a boat and who survives how does that instinct play into the journey under dire circumstances who is responsible i really enjoyed reading this and there were moments of intensity that i couldn't manage and i had to flip forward to find out what happened in order to deal with the getting there a good book for group discussion","2013":"it was just ok ~ i didn't really get the point of it ~ maybe it was over my head ~ ha","2014":"meh it was ok i liked the main character grace and it did make you think of how would i react in such a life threatening situation would i make moral decisions or life sustaining decisions interesting but i thought the story could use a little more punch","2015":" the year was 1914 and 39 passengers on the empress alexandra ended up stranded on a lifeboat they were lucky that they even made it on a lifeboat grace winter newlywed lost her husband and made her way onto lifeboat number 14 she is a character that has flaws and lack of decisiveness makes her a frustating one to follow i finished this in only a couple of days i was drawn in to the horror of what these people had to survive on the lifeboat and how their lives ended up because of their decisions i didn't care for the 2nd half of the book as much as the first i was expecting more and thinking that it would keep me wrapped in til the very end but that wasn't the case i thought that the ending dragged on a bit too long for me but overall very interesting perspective of a titanic esque story","2016":"a very good book though i found the ending less than totally satisfying it follows the old story i faced in sociology class in college what do you when you're in an overcrowded lifeboat somebody's gotta go or you'll all sink the story is from the perspective of a young newlywed woman in 1914 a power struggle emerges and sides must be taken leading to actions that will have life long consequences the narrative flows smoothly and jumps back and forth from post rescue to time at sea to keep the reader engaged and wondering how it will turn out none of us can really know what we would do unless we were in the situation this one probably would make for good discussion in the book club","2017":"brilliantly done shows how amoral a person can be u0026amp how they justify that to themselves u0026amp others","2018":" i liked the questions this book raised the story was interesting and the book was well written but i really liked the dilemma faced in the book and what it made me consider obviously we like to think we'd sacrifice ourselves for others but complete strangers perhaps people we really don't like and what if they have no family and you do people who need you it was kind of fascinating to think about and i still hope i'd be a good person but i'm also not sure what that would mean in this situation you should all read it","2019":"i initially was drawn into the book and the writing and prose were good but then i got to the end and it seems like such a letdown just seemed as if there could have been more to the ending","2020":" yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil i shivered and for the first time since the day of the shipwreck i felt profoundly afraid we were doomed this i knew for a certainty or close to certainty but still i looked to hardie outlined there in the back of the boat glaring unwaveringly at us all after a titanic lusitania era shipwreck thirty nine survivors are stranded together on a crowded lifeboat with little hope of rescue as the days drag on lines are drawn alliances are made and the young newly widowed grace winter is caught in the middle of a power struggle that could either doom or save them all the author puts together a picture of the microcosmic world in the lifeboat that's both realistic and frightening the characters within the boat were realistic though i had to keep a list in order to keep straight who was who and their descent into desperation and madness was terrifying because you could see it actually happening in such a situation the author's descriptions made you really feel there as if you could actually feel the rain or the dry heat or the water splashing up over your boots the narrator sometimes focused in on the small details and these little additions made it all the more vivid i did not however care at all for the main character which made it hard for me to sympathize with her plight her background revealed her to be a self important gold digger and throughout the novel she continues to take an apathetic approach in which all that really motivates her is her own will to survive she acted bitterly towards some of the other characters for no apparent reason and as i was reading i was never quite sure how she was going to act first person narrations generally serve to give the reader insight into a character's mind but i didn't really find that the case here there were also far too many loose ends as i approached the ending i kept hoping that things would fall into place that we'd finally find out view spoiler if there really was gold in the other lifeboat if hardie really did have sinister motives for how he acted if henry's mother had actually received the telegram grace did talk to her afterward wouldn't she have asked hide spoiler or kept waiting for some crazy twist that would explain grace's attitude about the whole thing view spoiler had she secretly killed mary ann was the ship sabotaged did hardie know some secret about henry hide spoiler but it all ended in a rather straightforward fashion that leaves the reader hanging a bit forced to accept the fact that there are some things we'll just never know overall a tragic tale filled with philosophy and moral dilemmas for the deep thinker who isn't afraid of getting a little seasick","2021":"rogan has an interesting angle to write about the people in the lifeboat well written and well designed caracters","2022":"there was too many unanswered questions at the end of the book for me i didn't really care for the ending either it was an interesting book lots of things to think about with this one","2023":"completely captivating tale of a woman lost at sea in a lifeboat with a handful of other passengers from a sunken ship well drawn characters cleverly written dialogue both internal and external and an engrossing depiction of people's desperation in dire circumstances could not put this book down highly recommended","2024":"thirty nine people find themselves adrift in a lifeboat after the sinking of an ocean liner they were adrift for approximately three weeks i had a difficult time getting into this book it wasn't until approximately the middle that i finally got into it my rating is three and a half stars","2025":" i am so glad this book is over it was bad bad bad it would have never found its way to my shelf but it was a present from a friend who liked it and i am already thinking of ways to get even the biggest problem was grace dear god what an unfitting name and charlotte rogan i have an advice for you if you can't make your character likeable at least make them interesting grace is none she is spoiled shallow self absorbed ruthless immoral completely obnoxious unable to rely on herself and incapable of compassion i don't think rogan was sure of who she wanted grace to be because the inconsistent mambling of her thoughts is not mirrored in her actions and how could it we are talking about a woman who is about to enjoy her newly found freedom and mayby embark on a new adventure as she claims because we all saw what a success her last one was and by the next sentence she has decided to marry somebody in lack of more options the next sentence not that the writing was better but i don't want to waste any more time on this book so i'll say no more and we shall never speak of it again","2026":"grace is a young woman who finds herself stranded on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean after the ship she was on sank it's 1914 two years after the sinking of the titanic and the lifeboats are too small for the number of passengers they claim to hold thirty nine people are in her lifeboat and it's obvious this is too many people for it to hold without sinking and they also have little food and water as the days go on a sense of madness seems to settle over those in the ship and each tries to figure out a way in which to survive knowing that their survival requires someone else to die the book opens with grace on trial for her life alongside two other survivors from the lifeboat it then drops back in time with grace narrating the time that they'd spent on the boat going crazier and hungrier by the day and how things unfolded it took a few chapters for me to really get into the story since it just sort of drops into the days aboard the lifeboat without pretense but i quickly felt as if i were on the lifeboat alongside the others the majority of the book takes place aboard this small lifeboat with a few short flashbacks grace describes from her life before the sinking and a few narrations about the trial after the rescue and so there's not a lot of action instead the book's focus is more on the emotional toll that floating in the ocean takes on the survivors and the ways in which everyone tries to cope and be assured of their rescue if only x number of people would jump overboard to save the others if only a certain person would allow them to do x they could surely survive there were many discussions about ethnics morals and responsibilities and it was fascinating to see how things progressed on board based on their dire situation and frustration at not being able to control the situation this was very quick to get through and the pages flew by for me i was a little disappointed in the ending as i felt like things were wrapped up without fully addressing further problems grace ran into upon her rescue from sea but perhaps this was unnecessary since the book focused more on internal struggles than external ones even though it was the external problems driving the internal strife i don't think everyone would enjoy this book because of its quiet narration but i found it thoughtful and interesting","2027":"the book was very scattered and didn't flow for me","2028":"i thoroughly enjoyed rogan's first novel the primary ethical dilemma is absorbing 40 people in a lifeboat built for 35 who is thrown overboard","2029":"captivating definately recommend","2030":"a book more about human nature than it is survival is very entertaining to someone who enjoys reading about psychology as a past time i enjoyed it","2031":"it was an ok read i didn't think the story or the characters had much depth and intrigue","2032":"this book i do not recommend it i don't see the point of it","2033":"a fascinating look at humanity and the struggle to stay alive under extenuating circumstances the main character of the story is far more calculating and shrewd than she lets on and it's interesting to see how she plays her parts through the situations that life hands her","2034":"you never know what will happen with desperate people in a lifeboat","2035":"the lifeboat is filled with ambiguity yet never manages to leave the ready unsatisfied survivors of a shipwreck drift on the ocean for weeks some die some survive narrator grace winter recounts the events with a slightly aloof voice she appears to be neutral and is never deceptive but why does she commit a violent act and is she a murderer or merely trying to survive","2036":"this would be a great book for book club discussion the moral dilemmas included in this captivating novel are astounding","2037":"intriguing simply because of the mystery of why grace is on trial and what the outcome will be but i felt like i was plodding through sluggish waters the worldview was not mine hers either god is absent or malevolent and at times it felt self important while it did keep me reading to discover the answer to the mystery i was simply relieved to be finished with the book when i reached the unsatisfying end","2038":"wow hmmm wow didn't see that coming 3 4 way thru i was thinking i was finished now i'm glad i stuck it out hmmmm","2039":" reread 11 10 13 for library bookgroup first read 6 24 12 3 5 stars the lifeboat is a story of survival for grace winter in more than one way first she arranges to meet henry winter a wealthy man after her family's income is gone there were not very many options available to women in the early 20th century then traveling back from london to new york after their elopement their boat explodes and henry arranges for a place for grace in a lifeboat grace and the other passengers on the overcrowded lifeboat struggle to survive food and water are soon gone and a power struggle erupts between some of the passengers conditions are horrific especially when enormous waves flood the boat that is sitting low in the water should some of the people sacrifice themselves by jumping overboard to lighten the boat so that others can live eventually grace will face another test of survival when she is tried in court for the murder of one of the people in the lifeboat although i empathized with the unfortunate people in the lifeboat i found that i did not feel very emotionally attached to any of them which decreased the impact of the story there were some tough ethical issues that they faced it was an interesting book that brought up some good points about surviving in 1914 both in and out of the lifeboat","2040":" picked this book up at a library book sale and it had been on my list for some time so decided to read it after my current read i liked it even though at times it got a little slow but it was a good book and would make an excellent book club selection i knew grace the central character would eventually be rescued i just didn't know how or when a lot of days on an open ocean and a lot of decisions to be made and would they be the right ones it was a book you had to finish just to see how it would turn out","2041":"i found this book ok as in maybe if this was first book i have read about being lost at sea i may have loved it but since it is the third maybe i'm over that theme","2042":"this was an adventure psychological thriller about the sinking of the empress alexandra a ship that sank just a couple years after the titanic and the survivors of one of the few lifeboats the character of grace winter is complex as are most of the characters in the novel my only gripe is that i would have liked more detail about the ship and to have seen it sinking this would be a good book club choice lots to discuss","2043":"i can picture this being a book assigned in a class there are so many discussion topics that can arise from the many layers developed i don't think i really gave it the time or deeper thought it deserves but it did prove to be an exceptionally quick and enthralling beach read finished in a day and a half of lounging","2044":"not my favorite not a fan of the story line or the characters could have been way more interesting","2045":"this would be a great book club book it has so many social and political issues around women and power it is so much more than a survival story","2046":"i really enjoyed this book not only is the book complex and well written its exploration of the morals decisions and actions of people who are thrown into harrowing and life threatening circumstances is disturbingly accurate","2047":"a large boat sinks mid ocean in a titanic esque catastrophe there are lifeboats that weren't built to scale so they are over filled the people in the boats are faced with the horrible choice to help save the swimmers to their own detriment or try to save their own lives the boats are so overloaded water pours in and it cannot be moved towards a rescue point after days of little to no food or water the group of people who base most of life on society and class are starting to debate why and how people got into the boat and who should jump out to give the others a chance their memories and all based on half truth stories laden in prejudice that nobody knows what is true anymore this book had an interesting premise but i had a hard time getting through it the plot moved very slowly and i had a hard time relating to the main character i think i will try to re read this one when i can enjoy the minute details of the description","2048":"i really wanted to love this book the premise was excellent and the writing good i can definitely say better than much of what is currently out there it started out good and did seem to have great potential it was a very maneagable size i read it in a few hours i think that there were many excellent conflicts and great characters that deserved more attention use it for your bookclub if you want a simple quick read that does not offend the more literary readers in your group","2049":"according to the reviews i should have loved this book i did not i would have loved to have more into the people themselves and less detail into the mundane things happening also a new character was thrown in on every other page i found it very hard to follow","2050":"i was underwhelmed by this book i realize in hindsight that i didn't care much for grace winter","2051":"this would be a good discussion book although watch out for the end it just kind of well stops period","2052":" i thought this book was incredibly well written for a debut novel the phrases are so elegantly turned and so subtle and nuanced and some of the images will stay with me for a long time for example the starving passengers on the lifeboat falling on the dead seabirds and eating them raw the author's bio said she taught herself to write well all i can say is she's done a good job i found the story very thought provoking with so many layers and i'm still not certain what i think about some of the characters if i were to find fault i'd say that for me the story lacked a real emotional centre somehow it starts off with an incredibly fraught situation and that just continues rather than rising and falling not sure if that makes sense for example after the 'crime' is committed for which grace and the other two women are being tried there's no great change aboard the lifeboat whereas i was looking for a more dramatic consequence the trial itself is not particularly tense either i suppose i feel the story fizzles out towards the end maybe that's partly a result of grace's character and the ambiguity of the narrative but still i loved this book from the first sentence 'today i shocked the lawyers and it surprised me the effect i could have on them ' how brilliant is that i can't wait to see what this author writes next","2053":" this is a beautifully written book the suspense keeps the pages turning but underneath the story line are bigger issues to ponder what exactly is justice what is permissible in the name of survival what would we each do in order to simply stay alive and what do we do in the normal course of events that keeps us alive and operating within our own belief of who we are how do we assess a balance of power and how is that balance established or over turned how do we explain our own actions later in the retelling are we honest or just trying to appear so charlotte rogan isn't bound by traditional conventions in her writing she isn't afraid to make the reader question what is being revealed even as the revelations happen an undercurrent of manic laughter lingers within the narrative line as the narrator grace describes the increasingly raw circumstances of the survivors i had occasion to read a few passages aloud in doing so the artfulness of the language was clear this is an unusual book nothing formulaic about it i finished it and started over again","2054":"this book made me think about what i would do if i ever found myself in a survival situation would i remain calm and act in a moral and ethical manner or would i become someone i do not know someone ruthless and only concerned for my survival how can i truly know the answer until i am confronted with the dilemma like the people on the lifeboat i can only hope that i know myself to my core but do we ever really know what would you do to live","2055":" this was a gripping tale of survival on a lifeboat after the ocean liner empress alexandra sinks in the atlantic in 1914 the narrator is 22 year old grace winter whose husband made a deal to get her on the lifeboat before he himself perished in this framed narrative grace recounts the events on the boat while on trial for murder of the liner's crewman who was aboard she reports on the power struggle among the diverse personalities on board and gender inequities in which grace finds herself somewhat aloof upon reflection described as part 2 angry men and part lord of the flies this novel raises some questions about the extent one might go to in order to physically and psychologically survive a harrowing ordeal","2056":"i was hoping for a modern day _old man and the sea_ and instead got feminist social commentary on the last century using the lifeboat as the vehicle","2057":"beyond boring poor character development wouldn't recommend","2058":"it wasn't as riveting as life of pi but a good study in character and somewhat suspenseful","2059":"3 5 would be more accurate this was an interesting book i listened to it for expediency i chose it because the author is coming to a local festival tomorrow but actually found it was already on my to read list the author did a great job with imagery there were times it was so clear i could have been there the main character was a bit of an enigma for me so i remained interested towards the end the whole thing just fell sort of flat for me","2060":" there was so much hype around this book that my expectations of it were probably way too high the quality of the writing was good excellent but for whatever reason the story didn't grab me grace has been married for a matter of weeks when during a transatlantic crossing her ship sinks and she finds herself in an overcrowded life boat it's a fascinating premise but i never really got a feeling of suspense perhaps because i knew from the beginning the prologue what much of the outcome would be grace is indecisive and introspective which for me didn't always work when she was relating such a harrowing journey it was as if she'd created a distance between herself and what happened in the lifeboat and unfortunately that distanced me as a reader to the point where the tension of the story was lost","2061":" kept me engaged spinning the tale of 39 survivors in one lifeboat after an explosion on their ocean liner told from the voice of 22 year old newly married grace the story grows with each page telling grace's history that brought her onboard the ill fated empress building the stories of the other lifeboat passengers and chronicling their present day challenges my biggest complaint was it seemed to conclude rather abruptly i was prepared for more of the same detail there but it was not to be","2062":"well written and engrossing","2063":"ugh time waster to the 'abandoned books' section of this library","2064":"i found this a struggle to read so it took me a while it is a good story though","2065":"enjoyed the beginning and ending of this book some days in the over crowed lifeboat got tiresome for me i did not connect with grace winters i found her character to be cold and uncaring perhaps that is what the author wanted","2066":"good short read historical fiction diary style story of 21 days on a lifeboat decent for her first novel","2067":"as 22 year old grace winter begins a trial for her life she recounts her experiences on a lifeboat which she shared with 30 odd people after the capsizing of a ship this is a debut novel for the author and quite a good read","2068":"thought this was just ok to me there wasn't any real build up and the end was just wrapped up","2069":"i really enjoyed this book hard to put dow","2070":" i believe this book appealed to me as a fan of both the factual accounts and the fictional accounts regarding the titanic it didn't disappoint the book was certainly as intense as promised if not more showing how people change and perhaps forget parts of themselves in the fight of survival this aspect of the book was deeply explored by the author and this surprised me a little and allowed me to devour the book even more keenly from a student psychologists point of view would certainly recommend this book to a variety of people those who like a tense fast paced story those interested in psychology and on a slightly strange level those with the fear of water or boats as it certainly engrossed me further and ingratiated me with the plight of the characters","2071":"not my favorite it was well written and i like shipwrecks but i just can't say i was crazy about the story and characters","2072":"this book started off so strong but in the end it just fell apart","2073":"terrific but also a little tedious","2074":"the book was slow to get my attention and i felt the ending lacking","2075":"i thought this started off well but by the end was counting the pages until it was over the main character drones on but says almost nothing of interest","2076":" this was a really good read i was pulled into the story and really enjoyed the writing style the very end wasn't as engaging as the rest of the book and it did seem to kind of just end but i liked the characters there was a line towards the beginning that was intriguing to me which goes to show that admirable traits are often exactly the same as negative ones only expressed in a different way and another towards the end if the world needed changing before it would suit her i could only wish her luck","2077":"i thought this a well written misfire it's tough to make a unsympathic narrator work especially in a first book i'll be curious about what rogan tries next","2078":"interesting plot but the old fashioned voice threw me a bit and i kept waiting for a twist that didn't happen good read but not my fave","2079":" this is a story about an impossible situation and the difference between what we think we would do in a life threatening situation and reality it ends with consideration of how we the public react to those who have faced these types of situations the setting and plot of this story are right up there in my list of worst fears so this book had my attention from beginning to end the main character is complex enough that i can't say i truly understood her she is highly reflective however and she takes you through her decision making or lack thereof sometimes eloquently i will be recommending this book to my daughters and friends this summer","2080":"i had a hard time to put this book down it was a true page turner it's a cruel and dark story of survival at any costs and what people are forced to do to live a suspenseful story of survival at sea and about how we react when life gets hard and one has to make difficult choices i really enjoyed reading this book","2081":"interesting and yet disappointing","2082":" this is a careful told tale that proves to become an interesting well written read and although i did enjoy it i feel that i didn't connect to any of the characters and that grace's character was unfinished this was a tale not about connecting emotionally to the characters but by sowing the seed of morals ethical issues and thoughts of that time gone by the book has some compelling moments of lies mistrust and shrouded motives that keeps you reading wanting more overall a good debut from the author charlotte rogan and one to put on the to read list if you enjoy a thought provoking tale","2083":"but not in a deeply detailed way that might be a thing unto itself the setting two years after the sinking of the ti in the venn diagram of things i'm fascinated by edwardian stuff ocean liners and morbid ish survival tales involving cold places overlap nicely so i thought this would be a good book for me sadly it was a bit disappointing though i've never actually read a john grisham novel i felt like this was something more along the lines superficial mystery lite it was procedural -- but not in a deeply detailed way that might be a thing unto itself the setting two years after the sinking of the titanic and on the brink of ww1 was oddly underplayed it was as if the novel was set in 1914 simply to allow there to be no radios on the lifeboat also small anachronisms were rife and a bit jarring there were themes about suffrage and women's role in power dynamics woven throughout and this was i think the best part of the book feeling the most smart or deep the main character was painted with some interesting dualties dichotomies and was not necessarily a reliable or to be sympathized with narrator making her story sometimes less compelling and more frustrating most of the other characters were flat characatures who felt like types and thematic stand ins rather than people down to the salty dog sailor constantly saying aye i didn't hate this book and in fact appreciated its novelty and what it was trying to do just didn't find it terribly successful","2084":"i reviewed this book here http turnthepagelisa wordpress com","2085":"this is better than a book about people trapped on a lifeboat for almost an entire book should be","2086":"is grace good or bad hard to tell","2087":"don't quite understand why they did what they did although i think the author gave us a lot of details about what being in a lifeboat would be like who knows what any of us would do in that situation","2088":"this impressive debut novel explores the way people behave in extreme situations in this case being cast adrift in a leaky and overloaded lifeboat it has a well developed plot full of tension and with some surprising twists i especially admired the author's handling of the ambiguous central character grace my only criticism would be in the sketchy characterisation and motivation of some of the minor characters","2089":"well written for the most part but i was left unsatisfied the entire story is told from the point of view of one passenger on the lifeboat and she is not reliable i would have preferred to have multiple narrations from others on the boat to allow me to decipher the events and motivations also this is not a mystery novel despite some reviews which call it that a mystery aficionado would be sorely disappointed there are intimations of secrets and hidden motivations but nothing much comes of it and since we are limited to one viewpoint we don't know more than she does which isn't much she doesn't even understand herself very well which is what makes the book interesting but not enough to sustain my interest the narrator is also not a very likable person and becomes a bit annoying but maybe that was the point if i had been on the lifeboat i might have ended up on trial rather than her i was certainly ready for the book to be done so i could quit spending time with this character this could have been a great book but it ended up feeling slight","2090":"one word boring waste of time","2091":"billed as a literary thriller i didn't find it literary or thrilling in fact i struggled to finish the premise sounded exciting enough but the prose was very stilted and i didn't relate to or care about anyone in that boat","2092":"total bore i can't believe i actually finished it the book had some promising aspects bu they were never elaborated on or made to be a more central story line so the entire summary goes like this i'm not giving anything away a boat sank 39 people end up on a lifeboat together some of them die the end boring","2093":"a thouroughly enjoyable read i've always loved the lifeboat senario as a plot debate and this novel captures it well will keep an eye out for the authors next one now","2094":" you don't realise how much you've probably been misled until the final third or so of the book grace winters 22 year old survivor of a ship sinking and three weeks on an overcrowded lifeboat is in jail for murder the book takes the form of her diary of recollections which is is submitting to her lawyer and a few choice flashbacks to her life before her trip with her brand new husband if you put a bunch of people in a cramped space in a life threatening situation you start to see what people are made of or rather not see since grace's version of events may be entirely fabricated you'll never know and i'm not sure you want to","2095":"a compelling read and swallowed it in 2 sittings reflections on human nature under severe strain personality and gender and much more","2096":"this book placed me adrift in an overcrowded life boat right alongside grace i felt what it was like to survive under harsh circumstances and i was devistated to be tried in a court of law for being strong","2097":"i thought i would love the lifeboat a friend highly recommended it and i have in the past enjoyed the other books i've read about survival on the open ocean i was immediately intrigued by the opening chapters three women are on trial after surviving on a lifeboat with 39 other people after the sinking of their ocean liner in the early days of world war i the suspense and mystery are immediately introduced and the desire to find out what happens at the end compelled me to devour the book in a day survival books are interesting studies of human nature watching people reduced from polite and civilized to instinctual beings intent only on their survival or mere shells of themselves as they give in to the harshness of nature and die are people good or bad do they become their true selves now that they are released from the rules of society are their real personalities magnified or are they changed by their horrible surroundings what the lifeboat does well is highlight these questions and others about those who survive or don't survive in perilous situations the book will leave you pondering about human nature for days afterward however what the book fails to do is keep up with itself in the story the plotting is slow at times regularly going back to the narrator's past with her husband now lost at sea and presumed dead other than the main character narrator the other 39 people on the lifeboat do not become fully fleshed characters it is hard even to grasp the motivations of the co conspirators on trial possibly this is because of the narcissistic nature of the narrator who cannot fully be trusted nuggets of information are given regarding the mystery surrounding the main character and the sinking of the luxurious ocean liner to entice the reader to keep going but just like the philosophical questions that aren't really answered neither is the mystery solved or the truth discovered","2098":"it was ok for me interseting study on how people react when under life and death situations it just got tiresome and i was glad to finish it and move on","2099":"good book it was sort of like life of pi it did drag on in the middle of the book but still a good read i enjoyed it","2100":"i loved this book i would have liked a little more courtroom drama but for a short quick read i really enjoyed it","2101":" not just an ordinary read about being in a lifeboat and hoping for a rescue this story delved deep into the psychological aspects of the main character grace her strengths and weaknesses were seen through the eyes of others and after finishing the story the aftermath was haunting in that it produced more questions i went back and re read the last chapters and the epilogue again and gleaned yet a different translation this was a book that exposed the character of those in distress in the boat but also made you see yourself too rather beguiling and unsettling but nevertheless a great read","2102":"this is a story about the occupants of a lifeboat after the ship carrying them to america sinks in 1914 grace and henry are newlyweds on their way to meet his family henry has secured grace into one of the last lifeboats off the ship he doesn't survive but she does and must endure many days of fear thirst hunger and even some jealousy and mistrust the thing i found most incredible about the mostly female occupants of the lifeboat was the pettiness and shallowness of their conversations perhaps the author was trying to show that these wealthy socialites actually were that shallow were the women of 1914 so much without their own ideas and principles were they that easily moved to do things they didn't want to do perhaps or was it just their circumstance that made them change to be that way well it all made for a good story that kept me interested","2103":"really enjoyed the beginning then it kind of slogged along not much excitement there","2104":"a great read for the titanic buff or survivalist","2105":"i was a bit disappointed with this book the premise was really intriguing a female narrates the harrowing tale of surviving the explosion and sinking of the steamer boat she was traveling on with her new husband and of then experiencing several weeks with 30 strangers on a too small lifeboat however the diary format takes away a lot of the suspense and i could never really get engaged with grace the protagonist the book raises some intriguing questions of morality and the extent to which people will go for survival but overall it was not as good as i had hoped","2106":"what happens when a group of people are forced to live together in a miserably small space the choices they make are fascinating","2107":"i'm not really sure how i feel about this book it was well written and intriguing but not intriguing enough for me to read it quicker a lifeboat adrift in the sea after their ship sinks is over capacity questionable behaviour in the name of survival ensues alliances are formed people are murdered and a trial regarding the innocence or guilt of grace winter mrs grant and hannah of killing a man happens i felt the plot was a bit slow and i would have preferred if the flashbacks of being on the boat were interspersed a lot more with the trial instead of closer to the end and i don't really feel like some of the mysteries were resolved but the characters were well written and there was a bit of character development happening as you get to know grace a lot better the reader was also able to see the breakdown of the survivors as the story progressed which was rather well done overall it's a good 'people in isolation having to deal with each other and survive' book but not great the ending left a lot to be desired","2108":"i got into the book easily and quickly good pace and descriptions but as it went on i struggled with grace's contradictory thoughts and testimony which ultimately led me to dis engage from the story some way before it ended loved the look of the outer and inner covers book group","2109":"i enjoyed this book surviving those circumstances is amazing","2110":" as the title suggests this book probes deep questions about life about good vs evil about survival and instincts about whether situations can ever simply be black and white the characters are interesting and the issues raised are provocative rogan does a nice job making the reader wonder what she would do if faced with lifeboat choices not much happens in the way of plot but the character study more than makes up for the lack of action the book leaves many questions unanswered a quality that does not bother me in the least as i am left wanting to return to the book over and over in the days following its reading","2111":"easy to read i found it interesting to gradually get to know the main character through her thoughts and interactions with the other passengers on the lifeboat","2112":"while i loved the premise of this book and had no issues with the authors ability to tell a story i found i did not care for the main character the story itself was gripping but there was something indefinable that left me feeling meh i would read the author again","2113":"i really liked this one too it was nothing at all like i expected but that's probably for the best it was an interesting story and well written with a strong and sympathetic though not mushy heroine i particularly liked the feminist aspects of the story such as the women being judged by a jury entirely made up of men and the fact that testimony from men seemed to carry more weight than that of women thank goodness those days are behind us or are they anyway a great read","2114":"not worth reading","2115":"enjoyed this story a very quick entertaining read covering deep issues in a superficial way but still would recommend for holiday reading","2116":"a first novel can you believe it this book blew me away with its top notch writing and tight pacing what a story and so well told i still haven't decided if i liked the main character i'll leave that to my book group to decide this will be a great choice for my well read ladies","2117":" i read this in one day it is a very quick read i didn't think the characters were fleshed out really well enough to get a good read on their various motivations for remaining alive grace winter is 22 and newly married aboard a ship bound for home to announce her quick marriage when the ship is struck and sinks she is a last minute passenger on one of the lifeboats as her husband seemingly secured her a place on the boat it is a point that was brought up later in that long period of introspection gossip and boredom in that tiny cramped boat i would have liked better character development as grace seemed but a cypher only near the end does the reader get a sense of her self preservation at all costs still i'd recommend this because i'm always a fan of a well written sentence","2118":"great premise however i was disappointed with the ending","2119":"disclaimer i may have wanted to like this more than i actually did that said i think this would be a great book club read interesting premise and left me with more questions than answers a good book to discuss","2120":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book is literary gold charlotte rogan writes exquisitely i will admit the negative reviews worried me but they seemed to come from people who just wanted more physical action i loved the psychological aspect of this book the calculating that the main character had to do and the decisions she had to grapple with another thing that i was pleasantly surprised with was how progressive grace was without it seeming too odd for the time period overall this book kept me captivated the entire this book is literary gold charlotte rogan writes exquisitely i will admit the negative reviews worried me but they seemed to come from people who just wanted more physical action i loved the psychological aspect of this book the calculating that the main character had to do and the decisions she had to grapple with another thing that i was pleasantly surprised with was how progressive grace was without it seeming too odd for the time period overall this book kept me captivated the entire time that being said there were a few things i was confused about the first thing is i still don't understand exactly what the author was trying to convey but the lingering stares between grace and hannah was it to add to the mysterious thing hannah had going on was she trying to show a girl crush the emphasis on their relationship didn't seem to add anything to the storyline and left me with more questions than answers i really didn't like that the rescue chapter came so late after the prison and trial parts the question of how they came to trial is never really explicitly answered the reader is left to infer from the small amount of informations who turned them in and how the events transpired this is a debut novel so it can't be expected to be perfect but i will certainly be on the lookout for more from this author more","2121":"a quick read that begs the reader to consider what pieces of their personality will rise in the face of a disaster i wasn't overly impressed by this book had much higher hopes for character development the booked wrapped up poorly would have liked to explore themes of gender class and power more than was offered","2122":"it was compelling enough to want to finish the book","2123":"a page turner but maybe not as charlotte rogan intended who wouldn't begin this with high hopes a ship has just sunk in mid ocean a desperate and disparate group have made it to a now overloaded lifeboat and one of the women who survived our first person narrator has been charged with... something it has potential my problem was that i wasn't gripped couldn't get gripped it soon felt like this narrator was keeping something back then a lot back... grace winter giving a partial account for the lawyers and her own ultimate benefit ok but that something kept back amounted to convincing detail feelings emotions sensations smells and general realistic seeming sense impressions... it never felt like a convincing account by someone who had really spent these three weeks in a boat deprived of food water and seeing others die around them was this from our grace being a deliberate careful and purposefully unreliable narrator or was it a failure by the author to fully imagine the scenes she was writing that the images were not really... not really... formed in her head and so could never be in our first person narrator's head and so certainly never reach ours i increasing felt the latter eventually i left a paragraph unread not minding that much if i missed the next snippet of pre sinking information or current in the boat events then i skipped a page then i flicked a bit then i went to the pure courtroom scenes my interest did not revive i was unconvinced but as well as being unconvinced there was the problem of the endless telling so little showing so much telling if i turn the page feeling i've seen something then the question of conviction does not even arise but time after time the 'showing' that basic element of storytelling was absent page after page of just 'telling' were in their place unlike kate saunders i did not find it 'almost unbearable exciting ' i didn't 'gulp it down at one sitting ' instead i let this little boat of narrative drift off across the ocean of so so ok but nothing special books and didn't care","2124":"utterly gruesome and depressing but ms rogan's storytelling abilities are solid realistic to a fault","2125":"this could have been so good but the big reveal of what they're on trial for is really that's it plus grace notices or mentions a number of things in passing that are meant to add intrigue but are never elaborated on i guess that makes sense since she doesn't know more about them but still i feel like how everything is laid out could have been done better","2126":"didn't finish this book it was very slow","2127":"a very good book the action moves right along as grace winter faces the trial of losing her husband on a ocean liner she works her way through though not easily working with the others on the liveboat and the subsequent trial she faces for murder grace does a lot of soul searching from the time her father commits suicide and her mother goes off the deep end i think i learned a little bit about human nature in thea reading of this book","2128":"i thought in the beginning that it would be slow and a bit tiresome to get through the life on the lifeboat but rogan's built up a tension so you realt want to know what happening next i also founder the ethical discussionsgrace has with herself and the lawyers are very interesting all in all a very good book i live close to the ocean far north bythe north sea and know hundrede of stories of people lost at sea and other who survived and sametingets one wonders who was better off","2129":"this was an outstanding book a story reminiscent of the titanic story what happens when a group of strangers is forced to survive in a life boat the narrator tells her story of life before the cruise during and then what happens on the lifeboat","2130":"at first the prose was engaging but as the narrative progressed i became less and less connected to the characters the end result is that i no longer cared about any of them but particularly the main character disappointed","2131":"wow wow wow loved this novel which gets more and more interesting as it goes along good writing and interesting commentary from start to finish","2132":"this is where a half star comes in handy this is really a three 1 2 star book i wanted to read it before the movie comes out starring anne hathaway i think she would be a perfect grace i kind of wish she started off with them on the boat leading up to the sinking and what happened on the lifeboat itself but otherwise i definitely enjoyed the book i think it will make a very good visual movie ala life of pi or titanic i would definitely read another book by ms rogan","2133":" such a captivating read the book begins with a prologue about grace winter 22 years old on trial for an initially unclear crime that took place during her ordeal on a lifeboat the story is well told going between the daily unimaginable challenges of surviving on the lifeboat as well as how grace came to be there interesting way of telling the ending as well she is an extremely intriguing character the story takes place two years after the titanic so the time period and women's roles during that time adds a lot to the telling of grace's experiences","2134":"read this for our book group i wasn't overly enthusiastic at the start but was gripped almost as soon as read the first page the ending was perhaps slightly disappointing probably the weakest part of the book but all in all a good read","2135":"intriguing unique view of a 1914 catostrophe a novel about hard choices ambition and endurance","2136":"this was a very readable book i devoured it dying to know who would survive and how the premise is that an ocean liner has sunk at the beginning of wwi and 39 people on an overloaded life boat must try to survive until they are rescued the story goes back and forth between the days on the life boat and the related murder trial of grace hannah and mrs grant grace is the protagonist a young woman whose family fell on hard times a year or so before the ship sinking her father had killed himself her mother had given in to depression and her sister found work as a governess grace wanted more and managed to find herself a rich husband who could provide the kind of lifestyle she'd always been used to and whom she genuinely loved she and her new husband had been traveling home to the us after eloping in england when the the boat sank because she rose above her family's circumstances grace sees herself as a spunky survivor and she is a survivor but i see her as someone who survives because she just always manages to attach herself to whoever is powerful and can protect her this is what life boat situations do of course show us who we really are and that certainly happened in this life boat my only complaint about this book is that there were hints that mr hardie u0026amp mr blake and perhaps grace's husband were involved in smuggling or something and that that may even have had something to do with the boat's sinking but that mystery was never solved and i think it should have been","2137":"i think this one would bring some good conversation to a book group","2138":"although i trudged through this book i do believe it would make for an excellent book club read lots to discuss about survival of the fittest and human nature","2139":"this book argues the point that you really don't know what you will do until you're in a given circumstance","2140":"i could not put this book down the action opens with a young widow on trial for murder who is asked by her lawyers to write a journal of the events that occurred during the weeks she and almost 40 others were stranded in a lifeboat after the wreck of a transatlantic ship her descriptions of their time on the lifeboat and of her past life raise tantalizing questions about what actually happened","2141":"captivating read but the ending fell flat","2142":" i'm finding myself on the fence about this one the writing is good and the issues are interesting to think about though the issues and moral questions came one upon another which occasionally made me feel like i was reading a discussion guide rather than a novel the issues were the best part of the book for me but by the time we got to day 6 of 21 in the lifeboat i was losing my will to go on with the book what i really liked about the book is that it isn't a traditional survival tale the narrator spends quite a bit of time examining the behaviors and motives of the other people in the lifeboat including her own this almost made it a 4 star book for me but while many of her comments were extremely insightful i had a bit of a hard time ascribing those thoughts to a young narrator with limited life experience i haven't actually been in this kind of situation so maybe facing death and the harshest of natural elements brings out all kinds of truths that make you wiser and smarter than your years what i didn't like was the description of actually being in the lifeboat a little of that goes a very long way with me overall i'm glad i read it and it gave me a lot to think about this is the type of book that would lend itself very naturally to a book club discussion","2143":"quick read but ending a bit dissatisfying","2144":"i'd actually go to 3 5 stars but it wasn't good enough to merit a 4 star rating some of the characters were well developed but others left me wanting for a better explanation and more back story","2145":"i'm a little skeptical any time i pick up a book and the description seems strikingly similar to something i've read before a shipwreck... lost at sea fighting for survival... dwindling food and fresh water... gradual loss of hope struggling to understand what's real and what's not... i'm clearly referring to life of pi right wrong that's actually a brief description of the lifeboat by charlotte rogan when i first read the summary i automatically filed the story under been there done that but i decided i'd give it a chance just the same despite clear parallels of setting and situation the two works really have very little in common when a cruise ship suddenly catches fire and sinks in the summer of 1914 twenty one year old grace winter becomes both newlywed and widow her wealthy husband secures her a spot in an already overloaded lifeboat and that's the last she ever sees of him grace is the narrator of the story so there's no question she will survive her ordeal she faces an entirely different struggle when after finally being rescued she finds herself on trial for her life john hardie is the only crewmember aboard the lifeboat he's vastly more experienced than any of the others and immediately takes charge of their situation he delegates duties rations the food and water supplies and determines their course of action however some of his decisions make the other castaways question his motives he's reluctant to approach other lifeboats seems to have them going in circles and one of the heavy water barrels he brought aboard doesn't contain water at all the majority of the passengers are women and many of them grow suspicious they finally decide mr hardie must be dealt with but is he the only one with a hidden agenda as days and weeks go by and the situation grows more desperate passengers begin to turn on each other the lifeboat is charlotte rogan's debut novel and it's much more than a story of survival the author does a masterful job weaving from past to present from lifeboat to cruise ship to courtroom to jail cell at various times grace has questions about her husband her companions and even herself the longer the group is at sea the heavier the mental and physical toll it takes on all of them rogan does a beautiful job capturing the changing spectrum of emotions as things continue to deteriorate","2146":" hmmm i just don't know what to think about this novel i really like the idea behind this as 39 people are stranded in a lifeboat after their ship sinks on the eve of wwi but i got annoyed during the parts on the boat the narrative was disjointed which was probably on purpose since it was supposedly based on grace's memories but i felt like we really only got to the surface of anyone on the boat the most interesting part of the character of grace to me was how she ended up married because that hints to her character but so little of that is actually revealed i think it could been so much better if we'd gotten more back story to everyone instead of surface descriptions and talk about what the sea means plus there was no conclusion to the other lifeboats or blake or the jewels or the gold or grace's relationship with her sister or the telegraph machine was it broken did he send a cable i feel like i missed an entire section of the book but i didn't","2147":" while an intriguing and interesting read i had much higher hopes for a much more thrilling ride the plot itself had such promise and was different than what i normally read but while they were fighting for survival i was fighting the battle between wanting to know what happens and not really caring i was certainly expecting more nastiness amongst the lifeboat passengers and while there was blatant disagreements and unnecessary death it wasn't as cataclysmic as i was wanting charlotte rogan developed an interesting character in grace but not one who i really cared about add to that several unanswered questions that i was curious about and it just left me feeling unsatisfied","2148":"i love stories of survival and author did an excellent job of plumbing the psychology of the characters and describing the group dynamics that took place in the lifeboat some interesting twists and turns in the plot","2149":"such a riveting story rogan's writing is so vivid that i really did imagine myself on the lifeboat with grace go read this","2150":"i was super excited to read this book of fiction about a group of shipwrecked individuals whose ship sank in 1914 as i started reading i realized that i was expecting this high powered taut unputdownable type of book and it is not that at all it is a telling of a survivor's story by one of the survivors named grace and it is her version of events if i were to read it again i would try to complete it quickly because i believe it would have had more impact if i had read it in 2 or 3 days versus a week grace is telling the story and i almost felt like i had to pause in the middle of this life and death situation and each time i stopped i would lose the flavour of their plight i'm a sucker for survival and adventure stories but this didn't deliver the way i thought it would i was just expecting more punch more nail biting more wide eyed gasps when i arrived at the climax of the story i hardly raised an eyebrow it is well written with a fine cast of characters and grace is quite the narrator this is charlotte rogan's first book and i would definitely read her next novel","2151":"catastrophic life u0026amp death told in slow motion literary prose","2152":"interesting but needed a bit more drama","2153":"there was a lot of talk going on around the lifeboat it was one of the waterstone's 11 last year and there were a hell of a lot of reviews around it was on my wishlist for a long time but once i actually got it it took me three months to actually get around to reading it partly because of my requested reviews backlog i had actually been excited about reading it i had expected to like the part of the story focused in the lifeboat itself to be the most interesting it was split between a tale of what happened on the lifeboat and grace's impending trial but actually i found that rather slow moving and you didn't get the moral debate i had expected in fact the idea of people being sent from the lifeboat or jumping was barely discussed at all it was more a story of what extreme situations can bring out in people there was also a vague mystery aspect which was interesting except we never really got any answers it was almost as if rogan had started another storyline but forgotten or been unable to finish it the sea scenes were rather well done and you could imagine very easily what it might be like to be on a little lifeboat in the middle of the ocean","2154":"interesting characters but somewhat stale plot good debut novel","2155":"a sly book of ideas disguised as a first person survivor's tale i liked it very much but i can't give it 4 stars because i wanted a little more from it","2156":"in 1914 thirty nine survivors cling to a lifeboat and the politics of class and gender effect their chances of survival i thoroughly enjoyed this book","2157":"this wasn't a favorite for me but still i was compelled to keep reading it was one of those books that you just can't stop reading only this time i am not really sure why give it a try certainly has some very gripping moments and inspires soul searching","2158":"great premise that starts with grace after she has been rescued from a 1914 explosion on a cross country trip on a steam liner most of the book focuses on her time in a lifeboat that is overloaded with people and their struggles there were struggles to stay alive as well as power struggles at some point after the rescue it is clear grace has been charged with a murder that occurred on the life boat despite the premise the book was too inwardly focused for me and i got the other lifeboat members mixed up at some point i just skimmed til the end it was not horrible by any means but after awhile it didn't hold my attention","2159":"v interesting stranded on the lifeboat people start getting killed eeee","2160":"i was very excited when i came across the lifeboat by charlotte rogan it sounded harrowing exciting and wonderfully dark however i found this book only mildly entertaining and for the most part dull how could this have happened this book sounded like it was made for me well it was due to a number of factors most of the story is told on the lifeboat it is 1914 and the ship has gone down grace our narrator is separated from her new husband and finds herself in the company of a diverse number of individuals as the days slowly move by and their supplies dwindle the darker side of human nature starts to emerge in a number of ways i found some of the sequences somewhat unbelievable but then again i have never been in that situation and cannot imagine what kind of madness would descend over one's mind i would not relate to grace in any way and found her rather unlikeable she could be strange and uncaring and i must say i disaproved of the way she 'caught' her husband the book was very slow for the most part and dry i found myself skimming bits and praying for them to be rescued just so it would be over overall this book was okay read it if you must but its not the kind of book you would move heaven and earth to get rating 2 5","2161":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i didn't like this book because i could never really figure out what was going on and that was more annoying than intriguing there were mysteries about certain characters that were never explained and that bothered me as well the main character was unlikable and she didn't seem to change or grow over the course of the book i couldn't figure out her motivations and she didn't seem changed by the whole experience i also didn't like the pacing of the book each chapter was a day on the lifeboat i didn't like this book because i could never really figure out what was going on and that was more annoying than intriguing there were mysteries about certain characters that were never explained and that

experience i also didn't like the pacing of the book each chapter was a day on the lifeboat and then boom the setting switched to the courtroom where she was on trial and i kept thinking what about the rescue how did you get rescued i was also annoyed because i could never really picture the lifeboat which supposedly had 39 people on it and was overcrowded but people kept getting up and walking around i guess there were greater philosophical questions of who deserved to be saved but i didn't feel connected to any of the characters so i didn't really care who lived or died as i was reading this i kept thinking about how much more i liked on the island which was about a plane wreck not a shipwreck but was a much better lost at sea type of book more","2162":"pretty depressing and had a weak ending but it captivated me enough to want to continue","2163":" p 263 when we are babies he said we need an authoritative figure to guide and take care of us we ask no questions about that authority and imagine that the small circumstances of our family life is the limit of the universe and that what we see before us is what exists everywhere and also that is all it should be as we mature our horizon expands and we begin to question p 262 i do not think that the only way to show courage is to face the world alone just hearing him suggest it made me feel stronger than i was which is a testament to the power of words","2164":" our narrator grace is on trial after surviving 21 days in a lifeboat originally containing 39 ocean liner passengers from her increasingly unreliable narrative point of view how much do we trust grace we learn of the ship's sinking and what happened each successive day rogan's writing is good and i liked the narrative conceit start with the trial and a sense of what could have happened and then slowly reveal the horrific conditions in the lifeboat it definitely kept my interest until i learned the crime for which grace is standing trial from then on i trusted her less and less never having had a great deal of sympathy for her anyway and grew weary of the introspective nature of the last third yes all along we hear grace's musings on life faith and so on but the more she tries to justify her actions the less i cared","2165":"this is a great book beautifully written and plotted","2166":"this was just a fun book to read you can't help but root for the narrator even if she did help throw someone overboard","2167":"decent the parts on the boat were more interesting to me than the trial afterwards also after reading the epilogue i get the feeling that i'm overlooking an important plot point like perhaps it is trying to tell me something that i am too dense to pick up on but a decent book overall i will check out whatever she writes next","2168":"i was close to voting 4 stars but have had so many goodreads lately it is hard in some parts but is an interesting story of survival would be a good discussion in terms of 'moral dilemma","2169":"i was really excited to read this book after reading a lot of positive blurbs however i feel like not much happened it was tre anticlimactic","2170":"fairly lightweight book ok to read quick read interesting subject matter","2171":"a page turner and well paced you really feel the isolation of a good survival story","2172":"great story interesting characters makes you wonder about the decisions you would make if you were in their situation","2173":"savage story of survival of the fittest with women at the lead","2174":"i could hardly make myself finish this book i couldn't connect with the protagonist at all grace's narrative of the trials and tribulations of those on the lifeboat seemed superficially described at best i didn't have a sense of what really was happening other than what i thought what might happen to people stranded in a life boat for that long very disappointing","2175":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it

premise in short the novel follows a young woman named grace who is trapped in an overcrowded lifeboat grace and nearly 40 others must struggle for survival as thirst hunger injury and illness threatens their lives and reveals the baser side of humanity i didn't rate the novel higher as author charlotte rogan left so many unanswered questions in many ways the lifeboat seems like an incomplete mystery novel for example what was the real story behind blake and hardie what was in the box hardie hid in his pocket what was the deal with the large chests of gold was grace's husband involved somehow what caused the explosions what happened to the other lifeboats and so on and so on as other reviewers have noted the main character grace is also a bit passive and dull the entire story is told from her point of view which is unfortunate i think the book would have been much more interesting if told from different characters' viewpoints particularly hannah and mrs grant despite its flaws i enjoyed the book and would recommend it for someone intrigued by survival fiction more","2176":"jumped around a lot either i missed it or it was never said why the boat sunk","2177":"read this book in one sitting minus a nap the story of grace's survival in a lifeboat with 38 other people keeps the pages turning at times it's hard to believe how they survived i put myself in her shoes and can't imagine the physical and psychological toll the elements would take to make matters worse after she was rescued she was accused of murder the story plays out with nice tension a will definitely read more from this author","2178":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here based on the plot i had quite high expectations on this book a group of people have to survive in the restricted space of a lifeboat that could have turned into something very interesting but in my opinion for a number of reasons it didn't my first disappointment was the setting i don't know why but i thought the story would be set in the present instead it takes place at the beginning of the first world war and i felt the attempt to recreate language and atmosphere just did not succeed based on the plot i had quite high expectations on this book a group of people have to survive in the restricted space of a lifeboat that could have turned into something very interesting but in my opinion for a number of reasons it didn't my first disappointment was the setting i don't know why but i thought the story would be set in the present instead it takes place at the beginning of the first world war and i felt the attempt to recreate language and atmosphere just did not succeed rather the language felt altogether artificial second disappointment the first person narrator grace choic of name also a bit too obvious is completely indifferent as a character she's not very likeable which is not necessarily negative for a protagonist but also passively scheming throughout the story she never takes a clear stand but is always trying to be loyal to the winning team we are brought to understand she would do anything ie marry wealthy men to get a position in society as long as it doesn't involve any strong effort but i didn't feel she was very convincing the other characters are too vague to be even slightly interesting hardie again the name is too obvious the seaman could have been an interesting character but fails to get a life of his own and so do hannah mrs grant and all the other occupants of the lifeboat out of 39 people we get to know only a handful and yet none of them makes a lasting impression while i thought the choice of the diary to narrate the story was a good idea i didn't understand the change of perspective in part iv the meetings with dr cole add nothing to the story and neither do grace's dialogues with the lawyers it feels like the author wants to show off her knowledge of law and psychology rather than take the story forward so what does the author want to say with this book that we are all capable of horrible actions if our survival is at stake but those actions were decided and carried out by a minority of the survivors is it a critique of the male dominated society of the time hardly although eventually those condemned are the strong women who want to take charge but fail the morale seems to be that if you want to survive both in the lifeboat and during trial you should be as passive and vague as possible make no decisions and manipulate the facts to your advantage in conclusion i wasn't convinced by the story nor by the characters but i managed to finish it so it gets two stars more like 1 and a half more","2179":"rogan's talented debut is a fascinating study of people pushed to the brink and the shallowness of human civility told in a series of flashbacks between grace winter's three weeks stranded on a lifeboat after a shipwreck and her present day circumstances on trial for the murder of her shipmates grace is a complex character alternately calculating and genuine coldly sensible and warm and romantic and i enjoyed reading her thoughts an excellent book that cemented my decision to never go on a cruise","2180":"i'd give this more of a 2 5 stars if i could i don't think there is anything wrong with the book so to speak i just couldn't get into it i felt like it was the same story i've heard a hundred times with a lifeboat at sea i think if it were a little shorter it would have been more exciting","2181":"published by virago in the uk on 29 march the lifeboat is charlotte rogan's first novel and has been picked as one of waterstone's 11 of 2012 i was to stand trial for my life i was twenty two years old i had been married for ten weeks and a widow for six the words of grace winter taken from the prologue of the story of the lifeboat grace and her wealthy banker husband henry were travelling to new york on the empress alexandra in the summer of 1914 when a mysterious explosion ripped through the liner henry managed to secure a place in a lifeboat for grace but he was not so lucky and perished it soon becomes clear to grace and her fellow passengers that there are too many people in the lifeboat and this is where the story really begins under the leadership of ship's crewman hardie the assorted travellers will spend the next three weeks at sea some will live some will die but all of them will discover things about themselves and their companions their beliefs their principles their morals will be tested to the limit each and every one of them will be made to face up to the fragility of life beginning to read a debut novel is an adventure in itself often it can take a while to get used to a style of writing the structure of a story or the mix of dialogue and description not so with the lifeboat i was totally engrossed in this novel within the first two pages charlotte rogan's writing is splendid grace is brought to life all her innermost thoughts and faults are exposed and beautifully drawn grace is at times quite selfish childish unreliable and very complicated she is also likeable realistic and passionate the other passengers in the lifeboat also jump from the page from the overbearing mrs grant to the mysterious and often cruel hardie each one of them are expertly portrayed the lifeboat is a tale of survival first and foremost but underneath this it is a complex and many layered story dealing with friendship deception frustration and despair an outstanding debut novel that had me gripped throughout charlotte rogan really is 'one to watch'","2182":"i failed to experience the tension of the time in the life boat writing a novel in which the majority of the saga is dialogue that takes place in a lifeboat is a huge challenge and i thought the author handled it well but i just couldn't stay interested and enthused","2183":"grace is a captivating paradoxical character","2184":" in the dark of a north atlantic night passengers abandon a stricken ocean liner the empress alexandra it is 1914 with the memory of titanic fresh in the minds of the characters and the wartime torpedoing of the lusitania still to occur adrift in an overloaded lifeboat with scant provisions and the uncertain hope of rescue diminishing by the day the survivors form alliances and grievances with the dawning realisation that for some to live others must die the story of the survivors is recounted by grace as she faces trial for murder alongside two of her fellow passengers but is grace confused and traumatised by the exertion and exposure in the lifeboat was she just a passive witness manipulated into complicity is she deluding herself about her role in events or is she just as cold and scheming as the others rogan leaves it for the reader to conclude","2185":"very confusing and the plot sucked","2186":"disapointing it seemed that the author couldn't figure out a proper ending and wanted to be done","2187":"loved rogan's writing and like the narrator main character but did not love this book as others have js","2188":"great book best ive read in a long time makes you think about how we survive every day and all the little judgements we make along the way i did have one or two questions that never tied out for me otherwise would have been a 5","2189":"i read this book quickly and really enjoyed it while i did find some flaws with the how it played out i think it would be a great bookclub book because everything was not tied up neatly kind of like real life","2190":"why am i naive enough to believe if i have to wait for a book for months from the public library it must be good i struggled through this book and wasted much of my precious reading time on it frustrated","2191":"1914 two years after the sinking of the titanic and the empress alexandra five days out from liverpool and set for new york suffers a mysterious explosion on board ship which necessitates the ship's evacuation grace winter newly married and on her way to america with her banker husband henry is placed in a lifeboat alongside some of her fellow passengers set adrift in the atlantic ocean and under the dubious guidance of crew member hardie the occupants of the lifeboat must learn to adjust and compromise but the situation is far from easy and it soon becomes apparent that the lifeboat is overloaded when then follows is grace's documented narrative of the time spent languishing in the lifeboat her observations and petty indignations are played out superbly well grace is neither likeable nor hateful and yet her volatile vulnerability and awareness of the greater implications are what keep the story alive running throughout the narrative is an underlying menace which seeks to emphasise the power struggle between the major players and yet the story encapsulates perfectly the ennui of the unending expanse of ocean which combined with grace's social observations make this a compelling read ultimately this book tells the story of survival at its most basic level and yet its multi layered and systemic dialogue encourages the reader to think beyond the obvious as it burrows deep into the very essence of human behaviour charlotte rogan took over ten years to complete the story of the lifeboat this book is a testament to her tenacity and is an amazing debut from a very talented author","2192":" setting early 1900's at the beginning of wwi a ship sinks in the atlantic radio not working not enough lifeboats this is the story of one of the lifeboats and the people on it their ordeal ends up being 3 weeks long and the tale takes you into the psyche of desperate people in extreme circumstances and what they will do to live the book begins with grace the protagonist in court for a murder during her time in the lifeboat and then her journal for the attorneys of what she remembers from her struggles while waiting to be saved her memories left me wondering what is right and wrong when you can't think straight because of extreme physical hardships the majority of this story was captivating but left me a little unsatisfied at the end with the wishy washy thinking of the main character but i don't know that three weeks on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean might not do the same to me so i'll cut the character some slack","2193":"i had such high hopes for this book after reading the premise i didn't like they way the story was presented as far as trial lifeboat trial i don't understand why it wasn't in chronological order i hated how the author never resolved anything what was mr hardie hiding what was his relationship with blake did they steal the chest of jewels and so much more it could have been so good i wish she would have added in more of the repationship with henry as well the other thing i disliked was the main character she was wishy washy spoiled self centered and annoying also i felt like they pounced on hardie at such a random time i hated that part overall i was disappointed","2194":"i'm just not sure i just felt like blah after this a nice enough tale but nothing really grabbed me quite honestly i'm surprised i didn't abandon this one halfway through it seems people either loved this one or they just felt like it was no real gem i'm in the latter category","2195":"thirty nine people lost at sea in a small lifeboat how will they survive for weeks with limited food u0026amp water what will each of them do as they come face to face with their mortality and must finally ask the ultimate question how far will i go to survive an inquisitive reader may be so bold as to ask the very same question as they read this fast pace novel what would i do in this very same situation as i remain lost at sea for weeks on this small lifeboat","2196":"decent book it was the right length and i was looking forward to reading it but somehow it pooped out in the middle when it switched to the trial it lost its zip","2197":"rather depressing but brillantly written account of a group of survivors of a ship that sunk in 1914 how each person reacts to their situation was very intriguing as well as making me wonder how i would behave during 3 weeks on a lifeboat that 3 persons were on trial for murder afterwards made this even more readable lots to ponder","2198":" ship blows up and sinks passengers scramble to a limited number of lifeboats game on sound familiar i am a titanic fanatic and have watched alfred hitchcock's lifeboat numerous times reading lifeboat by charlotte rogan seemed to be rehashing what's already been done numerous times reading this book in one day i expected to be amazed i regret to say that while i enjoyed the book i really don't think there was a lot of originality to the story line i gave the book four stars because the author vividly expressed the daily drudgery in the lifeboat in addition i could not stop thinking about how angry i was once i was finished with the book on the other hand to get me this upset over a book deserves four stars my main complaint is that there were just too many unanswered questions for me to me if reflects a lazy author not pulling together the loose ends for the reader makes a great book club read because of all the unanswered questions but not what i was looking for if a few unique things would have been completely clarified i wouldn't be so unhappy with the book questions that i have 1 twhat did actually happen on the empress alexandra was there an attempt made to steal the gold that was brought on board by mr cumberland who may have been involved in the desperate attempt to become rich quick 2 tdid grace's husband really make some kind of deal to secure her a seat on lifeboat 14 3 twhat was in the package that hardie was keeping hidden from everybody on the lifeboat 4 twas hardie guilty of something or just on the receiving end of a lot of nasty lifeboat gossip 5 twhat were all the \"odd\" looks directed at grace all about was she just so beautiful that the men couldn't look at her and when they did they became mesmerized the women jealous or a secret communication system grace was not informed of 6 twas hardie charting the lifeboat appropriately if not why what would his reasons be for not attempting rescue 7 t what amount of odd behavior should be attributed to ptsd or a slow death 8 twhat was henry thinking about when out of the blue he drops all plans to marry felicity close and gets engaged to grace instead 9 twhat was going on between mrs grant and hannah were they attracted to each other in some way i really didn't particularly care for any of the characters in the book and that is fine by my standards i was very indecisive about grace until the very end of the book was she a shy observer a scheming social climber or a young twenty two year old trying to cope with the death of her husband i have resolved to myself that grace purposely gave the impression that she was passive and patient in nature but in real life she knew she was a \"looker\" and a gold digger to the core she was very aware of her \"status\" being downgraded once her father lost all of his money very aware of her status being upgraded by marrying henry very aware of her status being downgraded again by losing henry very aware of her status being upgraded again by roping in her lawyer mr william reichmann grace stated she did not get butterflies of happiness in her finance's presence but he did and that was good enough for her in addition she was not willing to have her new husband be involved in assisting mrs grant or hannah with their appeals i know that during this historical time period many women did exactly as grace did in the book i guess it just bothered me that grace admitted life was a challenging game to her a big joke on the men or anyone else who happened to not fit into her current plan grace admitted that she would have to accept mr reichmann's proposal of marriage for want of a better plan after all she was happy in her new silk dress that rustled magnificently when she stood up and walked ah yes status money","2199":"could not finish it was initially very excited to read it but it was just blah very boring not really any conflict and you'd think that people stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean would have conflict didn't keep reading to see if it had any good stuff","2200":" i was glad to have picked this up at the library definitely not worth buying the general story sounded interesting a story about a lifeboat of about 39 survivors of a boat explosion and sinking problem for me was that i did not like the narrator of the story at all grace a 22 year old woman newly married makes it onto the lifeboat as the boat is sinking this could have been a much better novel but i couldn't get beyond grace the descriptions of how the people survive for 21 days was interesting especially as the men and women slowly starved went mad and manipulated each other to gain power of the boat not nearly as good as i expected based on book reviews","2201":"it's disappointing to like a book only in retrospect i struggled in reading it but at the end i appreciated the conflict and the characters would enjoy discussing it so i can recommend it for book groups","2202":"well written but caught up a few times with the old english can't help but put yourself in the boat and what decisions would you make","2203":" after an explosion sinks the luxury liner she and her husband were on grace winter finds herself floating across the atlantic with 38 other passengers in a lifeboat meant for much less the lifeboat is an account of what happens when food and water run scarce and when all hope of rescue is lost the story is told from grace's point of view as she recounts the events leading up to her rescue from the beginning we know that grace was not the only survivor and that she is on trial for something that she did or didn't do that part remains a mystery for most of the book and is what kept me reading however the book faded at about the halfway point grace was a hard person to like cold and calculating and the day to day routine became tiresome","2204":" i just finished this book today and am still mulling it over in my head i do love this quote from the deacon on the lifeboat when we are babies we need an authoritative figure to guide and take care of us we ask no questions about that authority and imagine that the small circumference of our family life is the limit of the universe and that what we see before us is what exists everywhere and also that it is all as it should be as we mature our horizon expands and we begin to question this questioning continues until we either throw over our creator our parents for good and take their places as the creative force in our own lives or we find replacements for them because the terror and responsibility are too great people go one way or the other and this accounts for all of the great personal and political divides throughout history","2205":"i had my own perceptions of how this story would unfold so i spent the entire time reading this book waiting for what i thought would be the inevitable climax it never happened not only that i felt like there were lots of gaps and missing details that if included would have enhanced the story tenfold i was interested enough to finish but all in all was disappointed","2206":"this was a brutal read meant to be an examination of human nature under extreme circumstances but i couldn't help but get caught up in the story which is why i was irritated by the plethora of loose ends left hanging at the end of the book and mocked by the last sentence if i had not felt so sorry for him i would have laughed out loud at his desire to pin everything down at his naivete at his childish desire to know not an uplifting story by any means but it definitely makes you look inward and wonder the lengths to which you would go to survive","2207":"i think i've read too many life and death situational books to have been surprised by any of what happened in this novel http bookaliciousbabe blogspot com","2208":"this would be a good book club book","2209":" i can't really explain why this book is a 5 because it isn't a happy book the title kind of lets you know that the story is about a woman named grace who is in a lifeboat with 38 other people it starts off with grace with her lawyers enjoying a rainstorm and remembering when they first had rain on the lifeboat and their feelings then grace writes a journal for the lawyers so that they can get a feeling about what and how decisions on the boat were made she takes an introspective look at if how her decisions were made if things would have been different the book looks at human nature and how different personalities and weaknesses in people can affect them in survivalistic situations the pack mentality i guess is closest to describe it i will be looking for future books by charlotte rogan she not only told a story she put you in that lifeboat beside them and had you wondering what you would do","2210":" oh boy this author has a new book coming out i can't help but wonder if i'll be less cynical if i read it i was dying laughing rolling on the floor laughing sharing about all my thoughts about this book with my husband later my kids something about it hit a giggle nerve i was re writing this novel as fast as i was reading it in my head mine was comic tragedy of course mostly heavy on the comedy i never understood why this little book was so popular for awhile maybe for a great laugh on day 4 in the lifeboat grace our narrator says mr hoffman spoke without a trace of emotion i could not stop laughing after that sentence i found it hard to take this book serious as i also did not 'feel' a trace of authentic emotion for this story i wanted to these are 'my' personal thoughts we know at the start of the book that a woman is on trial for her life did she or did she 'not' kill a man she was on the lifeboat with we know she survives before we start reading the back of the book tells us grace goes from 21 days living on a raft boat to 'prison' note the book was more interesting to me once she got to prison towards the very end i'm still laughing as i type i am sooooooooooooooo sorry i do not mean this in any righteous way its just how i am 'reacting' i do not blame the author or anything i just keep wanting to laugh a lot reading this small novel i couldn't seem to filter my mind maybe i needed to do meditation but for starters i kept asking myself if i were only married less than a year and i was on a ship that was going down with my new husband you can bet your ass we would have ended up on the same lifeboat 'together' period no ifs ands or butts about it married same lifeboat another thing for a small book which was less than 300 pages long the author mentions sooooo many characters 'names' sure we had our 'main' characters but it seemed pointless to me to 'drop' lifeboat names as fast as she did never having time to develop their character i would have almost preferred the author say the guy with the long nose or man with bushy eyebrows than keep dropping names that were not lasting in this story anyway and most my emotions were not 'invested' it felt like i was reading 'notes' things to remember to write in the book but the 'feelings' were flat for me and without the feelings i could have read a newspaper article to read details about a tragedy in all fairness i wasn't a huge fan of the boat movie that came out this year either with almost no words with robert redford it 'too' lacked authenic emotion for me whereas i 'did' see the other boat movie captain philips and the type of acting tom hanks did in the last few minutes of that movie was gut wrenching believable to the point of self reflecting the entire depths of the story so i'm not a fan of this book straight on yet i'm thrilled i had soooooooooooooooooooo much fun rolling on the floor laughing trying to talk to my husband about this book and i am deeply sorry if i am hurting anybody's feelings again its not my intention","2211":"a story about people in a lifeboat after being shipwrecked the dynamics of the relationships and politics what happened when they didn't get rescued straightaway etc the novel focuses on one female passenger and the part she played or didn't this was an interesting story with a highly unreliable narrator which always adds some tension and a lot of grey areas in terms of morality which i also like well done i think","2212":"ok read well written and interesting but did not live up to all the reviews for me","2213":"even though this was sometimes a bit depressing due to the location of the main character for most of the story i still found it very enlightening overall the book really makes one think about what we humans are underneath all the civilized behaviors we show to the outside world take away our food water and creature comforts and watch out very good for a first effort for this author","2214":"a great new writer i'm hopeful she has more in the works the beginning of this story didn't draw me in right away and that's the only reason i didn't rate it 5 stars main character is so complex i'm still trying to decide if i like her the writing never got in the way of the story the author lead me back and forth in time with ease i loved some of the what if's suggested towards the end spoiler alert did she get away with something i may still like her even if she did","2215":" the lifeboat is a nice fast read it is the first person if somewhat untrustworthy account of a shipwreck u0026amp experience of some survivors in a lifeboat because it is written as grace's memories of the experience some mysteries go unsolved and some information is incomplete but that certainly adds to the authentic voice of the story grace makes some interesting observations about life and about people but at the end of the story it's unclear whether she has really evolved as a person or if she is still in the same place as she was before the story began i would definitely recommend the lifeboat as a good summer read it's not terribly deep but it was worth the read","2216":"meh i wanted to like this more than i did just never cared very much who survived u0026amp who didn't don't understand the accolades this is getting given that if you've seen any of the following you don't need to read this 1944 alfred hitchcock's lifeboat 1957 seven waves away 1975 the last survivors","2217":"i enjoyed this hard to believe it was the author's first book by having the narrator refer to the future events as she tells you the story as she looks back on it it kept you turning the pages wanting to know the whole story recommended by lisa r check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore rogan","2218":"so slow kept thinking something would happen notsomuch","2219":"i really liked the story idea really enjoyed the first days that the story takes place but i got super impatient by day 7 and started to skim i feel like a lot of those days could have been condensed and the after part could have provided more","2220":"i loved this book great story well written","2221":"the book starts out with grace going to trial and her lawyer giving her a journal to recount what she remembers we then find out she was at sea for 21 days in a lifeboat when the ship she and her husband were on sank she is accused of murder i did not feel there was good buildup to the murder it just all of the sudden happens i did not care for grace that much either i would not recommend this book","2222":" loved this book was riveted throughout and really enjoyed the sophistication of the story and the ambiguity of the main character's moral compass the setting is in the title - two years after the wreck of the titanic another cruiser sinks and the unsettling story is told from the first person perspective of a woman on one of the lifeboats it's revealed at the beginning that she is on trial for something and there are tantalizing hints dropped throughout the narrative about what awful things she might have done interwoven with her story of survival on the open ocean are her memories of the rich man she had just married and the reader is given glimpses of her machinations and manipulations to make him fall in love with her these facets of her character then inform the series of events that unfold on the lifeboat interesting perspective on power dynamics women vs men in roles of power and the bare teeth of the human impulse to survive","2223":"i was in that lifeboat dazed numb salty philosophical watching in denial in suspense in a leaky boat amazed scared young that's an accomplishment to get me in that boat and keep me there for so many pages","2224":"this was a great book good characters and a gripping story line","2225":" i'm so glad this book found it's way to my summer reading list after reading the light between oceans i was in the mood for something harrowing and dramatic and this completely fit the bill i was fairly engrossed from the beginning and the pacing of the story works well you pan back and forth between grace's the protagonist's life and the current situation of the survivors in the lifeboat you find out early on that grace is also on trial for murder after she is rescued and receive bits of information about that throughout the book for me it kind of petered out at the end after such a dramatic story i expected a fitting or maybe even shocking ending and i was a little disappointed however this book mostly kept my interest and i would recommend it as an excellent summer read","2226":"boring writing can't even believe i read it curious about the outcome i suppose the dressmaker was so so much better","2227":" mesmerizing read and a thriller as 39 people are in lifeboat in atlantic ocean after the empress alexandra passenger ship has explosion this is the first book written by this author and her character development is amazing grace is narrator of story and lives through the ordeal at sea mr hardie an officer of the ship who commands lifeboat is pushed overboard by grace as ordered by another strong take charge woman named mrs grant book ends with a trial where grace mrs grant and her accomplice hannah are charged with the murder of hardie good read great writing strong characters horrific time at sea","2228":" the prologue introduces us to grace winter a 22 year old newlywed who also happens to be a widow as she is escorted by lawyers who are representing her as grace stands trial for her life why as a survivor of a shipwreck is she on trial the story starts with grace remembering the first hours on a lifeboat watching the destruction of both property and life it is 1914 and a war is brewing on the horizon grace and her new husband henry had decided to head home from london to america and they chose a small transatlantic ocean liner henry is a well off banker and so grace is wined and dined with no worries except if henry's family will accept her but shades of the lusitania there is a mysterious explosion and the ship quickly sinks grace finds herself on a lifeboat supposedly able to carry 40 persons but in truth the ship owners skimped on size and the lifeboat should only have 30 persons to stay afloat for anyone to live ... someone must die hours move into days and days into weeks as the survivors battle the elements and each other to stay alive as the chances for rescue grow slimmer and slimmer we get grace's backstory of her own struggle to make a life for herself after her father lost the family money and committed suicide leaving a wife and two daughters homeless hard choices were made then and hard choices had to be made now the rescue finally comes for the few who are left but grace must now face the fact that while she lived many had died with two other women grace is charged with murder specifically assisting in throwing overboard the ship's crewman mr hardie as the trial progresses we begin to question whether grace is remembering the lifeboat incidents as they truly happened or as she while in a weakened state remembers only what she wants to remember this tale is a psychological story of sacrifice and duty but also of men and women battling each other to survive another day and another wave the book started slowly but as the situation became desperate the book became a page turner this is a wonderful first novel from charlotte rogan","2229":"i was hoping to like this book but i was just happy to finish it i have read other stories of lifeboat experiences some true and spellbinding this story fell short of my expectations","2230":"entertaining i'm not sure that i would have been this articulate this philosophical or this able to attempt to save myself but i'm sure it is going to make for an interesting discussion at book club","2231":"the empress alexandra the ocean liner you were traveling on has sunk you find yourself on an overcrowded lifeboat yourself and your fellow passengers unable to bail water fast enough rescue ships are nowhere in sight the only option is to lighten the load to keep the lifeboat afloat what do you do this is the situation grace and her fellow passengers find themselves in in the lifeboat hostilities arise and thirst and starvation are barely being kept at bay luckily an experienced seaman is aboard to help the passengers survive...or is it so lucky rogan certainly provokes thought with her debut novel forcing readers to ponder their own would be inner struggles between morality sacrifice and self preservation i had just read the nonfiction book a night to remember about the sinking of the titanic before coming to the lifeboat and found the details about the alexandra's sinking and emergency procedures to be accurate and plausible according to similar real life events nevertheless the unchanging setting on the lifeboat grows tiresome switching only occasionally to grace's descriptions of events leading up to her recent marriage and mid atlantic honeymoon and eventually her trial furthermore the narrative is inconsistent switching from a casual tone to one more conservative and consistent with dialogue of the early 1900s the true nature of each character is slowly revealed either through action or inaction and clues as to what exactly went on during the chaotic moments before the alexandra sunk are pondered but never revealed the psychological stress of being aboard a lifeboat for over two weeks is hinted at but certainly not developed in a satisfactorily complete and anticipatory climax only to be reflected upon later with 20 20 hindsight the motive for and events leading up to grace's actions that eventually result in her trial are provided so abruptly that it doesn't seem rogan could've given it much thought thus taking away from the credibility of not only our narrator but the resolution of the novel as these motives and actions are drawn out unendingly during the trial likewise the actual rescue is glanced over with barebones details and a rushed alacrity at first as if rogan simply wanted the book to end already only to then drag out the remaining chapters on the post trauma events once back on land grace claims to not remember the last days aboard the lifeboat only to describe later in perfect detail her voyage upon the rescuing fishing boat definitely an interesting idea but delivered with a ho hum and somewhat haphazard ordinariness that makes the lifeboat a mediocre read","2232":" the lifeboat is a novel set in 1914 just after the crown prince has been shot in sarajevo and europe is about to go to war an ocean liner sinks in the north atlantic en route from england to america there is chaos but some lifeboats are launched we follow the lives of those in a lifeboat cutter with 39 people although the boat is made to hold fewer the survivors in the boat come from different social classes and backgrounds there is some but obviously not enough food and water i have read a lot of survival literature first person accounts diaries histories and even research my interest in how we respond to survival situations what is the role of leadership in survival and what makes one person a survivor and another not rogan does a wonderful job of showing the problems and issues surrounding survival she has also obviously read a lot of survival literature the story is told from the point of view of grace a newly married young woman who before her marriage was barely clinging to upper society - we don't really know if she is a creditable narrator i particularly liked the interaction between the survivors and the issues of leadership the 1914 setting provides a way to show more distinct roles between men and women and explore how these become blurred in survival situations","2233":"it was okay not as good as i had expected to be","2234":"good plot submerged in murky language and reaffirmation of my belief that i don't want to take a cruise ever","2235":" nice to read a page turner for a change i was originally drawn to this novel because it was a first novel by a woman in her 50s gives one hope the story about a group of people stranded in a lifeboat bobbing along in the ocean after fleeing a burning luxury liner a few years after the titanic wasn't initially something i thought i'd enjoy too claustrophobic too small and tight a world but the writer who is an architect by training knows how to build a plot and characters and themes which made this deceptively simple book more complex raising all kinds of questions about what it takes to survive on a lifeboat and in the courtroom when you're on trial and the parallels between the two what makes a person powerful and how men vs women gain power especially back in the bad old days whether murder is ever justified and on and on the main character is a young bride who turns out to be much more interesting than she initially appears","2236":"this book did not live up to my expectations based on early reviews i had read about its premise and its author in 1914 a young bride grace finds herself in an overcrowded lifeboat for three weeks with 38 other passengers the story then turns to her recollections of how she manipulated her now lost rich husband henry into marrying her possible mysterious financial intrigues onboard the ship never illuminated and her part in the desperate decisions the survivors make which lead to grace and two others being tried for murder after their rescue too much psychoanalyzing of feelings and intentions in past moments versus rationalizations in the present for my liking","2237":"good debut novel reminiscent of titanic well worth reading","2238":"unfortunately the story fell really flat for me i felt it had so much promise but the continual 1914 and the ship empress alexandria has just sunk our narrator grace winters finds herself aboard a lifeboat with 38 other people and the reality that it was built to hold only 20 at the beginning of the book grace is on trial for murder with two other women from the lifeboat and that initially is very intriguing because what could have been done on that lifeboat to put these women up for murder tunfortunately the story fell really flat for me i felt it had so much promise but the continual switching from present day back to the 21 or so days they were aboard the lifeboat took me away from the drama of trying to survive on the boat i did not enjoy any of the book that was set during grace's trial and at about halfway through i felt disconnected from the entire story but since it was a shorter book decided i would go ahead and finish it great idea for a story just left something to be desired in the telling","2239":"lots of potential zero follow through","2240":"interesting but too much psychoanalysis throughout took a bite out of the action adventure for me","2241":"although the subject was about survival this was a good story","2242":" i learned about this book from one of russian booktubers and i liked annotation and idea of this novel and i bought it and read it i've never been so wrong from the very beginning i understood that this novel would be awful as i've never gave up reading books to the end i decided to finish this one too stylistics of the lifeboat is so poor and inexpressive all the caracters are silly and selfish the author doesn't even describe them only in the endind i learned that the main character has dark hair and that's all the idea was sooo good but mrs rogan decided to create a plot and publish it just as it was such a waste of my time","2243":"an unimaginable ordeal soul destroying choices and terrifying consequences so realistically written it transforms time and place","2244":"the story of a young social climbing woman who is on a steamer that sinks in 1914 married for 10 weeks widowed for 6 the book begins with her trial for murder and then flashes back interesting premise but ultimately i did not care for the main character and did not think that the author had any good insights into why some people behave well in bad situations while others give in to their worst impulses besides wasn't this a hitchcock film while i didn't wee it it was probably done better disappointing","2245":" this is a great idea for a book 39 people on a lifeboat built for far fewer and the only way that anyone can survive is if some of them die sounds like of one those team building exercises where you have to decide whom you would take into the bomb shelter except here you have to decide who does not get to stay on the life boat the book is well paced written like a hitchcock thriller more than a picoult ethical dilemma search or a christie whodunnit but for me the highlights were the ethical questions raised and the questions of who knew what they were doing when they were doing it the primary question raised in this novel isn't really who deserves to live or die but whether saving yourself by allowing someone else to die can be called self defense the question asked by a lawyer in the book is if you were holding on to a plank in the water and that floating plank was only big enough for one and another survivor swam up to you would it be ok for you to push them away","2246":"great book for book clubs very interesting discussion on morality and human nature","2247":"an unreliable narrator and not in a good way very compelling read that left me unsatisfied so much potential and yet","2248":"this one is a well written page turner it reminded me at various times of alias grace rules of civility the american heiress and in the heart of the sea more about moral dilemmas and ambiguity than a traditional work of historical fiction","2249":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here very disappointing no real action even stormy scenes and fights seem slow motion and dull no real passion to any of the characters or story main character was not well developed it only give the illusion of a good back story but it was very vague and cliche poor girl dupes rich man because she has daddy issues it was draggy and anticlimactic","2250":"i give this book 3 5 stars i really liked it it was very well written and had a very interesting premise but there were so many characters in the lifeboat it was often hard for me to keep them straight i also agree with other reviewers that the ending seemed rushed and by the end i was left questioning what was the point of this what did grace the main character learn it was also left unclear what sort of deal henry made with hardie to obtain a seat for grace in the lifeboat also the deal with the gold in the locked box these sort of answers were never found i would have liked to have known more about henry as well","2251":"this novel is about a woman who is traveling from london to nyc in 1914 when her ship crashes and she put into a lifeboat with 30 other people she recounts the events of what happened during the several weeks it took for them to become rescued as you would expect some of the actions by the individuals in the boat were geared to ensuring their survival but to me that was not so shocking because it seems like what people would have to do overall the book is well witten and keeps your focus it is a fast read but i felt like i got hints of things that suggested the main character had some secrets but it was never really expounded on i enjoyed the book though it definitely makes me wary of such a situation","2252":"great book but the ending lacked excitement and left me feeling a little disappointed but i would recommend this book as a quick and enjoyable read","2253":"good writing but for me this book failed to live up to the hype","2254":"this is a relatively good book it wasn't as compelling as i expected it to be the book did not pull at me when i was not reading it and i would easily forget about it but i must say that for a first time writer she did well i give it 3 5 stars and wouldn't really recommend it","2255":"huh well that's done it was ok but not a page turner","2256":"i liked the book but i thought that ms rogan could have done much more with the main character grace after finishing the book i found myself still wanting to know more about her and her experience in the lifeboat","2257":"slightly entertaining but not a really good book the plot is flat and it just is slightly boring","2258":"interesting premise but left too many questions i had no foundation to guess at answers","2259":"not well written and did not feel attached to characters scanned it and then put it down for good","2260":"perhaps not the book to read when you are about to get on a ferry","2261":"interesting but nothing earth shattering","2262":"1 5 stars from the beginning grace winter is not a character with high moral fiber as she sets her sight on someone else's fiance after the ocean liner she and her new husband are traveling on explodes she finds herself in a lifeboat fighting for her survival she must step up and help make some hard ethical and moral choices in order to survive her ordeal","2263":"four stars for the first half two for the second average would be three but with the content rating of two if sufficient a book where the characters have few if any redeeming qualities the narrator and main character coincidentally named grace is manipulative and looks out only for herself see other passengers in the lifeboat as well the tale begins as she is spinning an account of what happened to in the past that affects her in the present no spoilers two stars are generous for a book the attempts to neatly wrap up grace's life in a bow as she is about to live happily ever after or so thinks her soon to be husband grace will always want good better best this came i think as a $2 99 kindle recommendation fitting i kept reading the second half hoping it would revert to the interesting first half","2264":" this was one of the better audio books i've listened too picked up entirely on a whim i ended up really enjoying the narrative and narration both equally the story of a young woman shipwrecked and surviving in a lifeboat was exceptionally compelling as well as the part of her surviving the real world aftermath and shocking legal consequences charlotte rogan created in grace a strong compelling and utterly sympathetic character and rogan's writing style is so confident and capable it's very impressive for a debut novel well done recommended","2265":"book was slow to start and involved flashbacks between the ship sinking survival on the life boat and after events give it time it is a winner debut novel hope for more to come","2266":" after purchasing the lifeboat just 20 seconds after reading a review of it i can say the novel did not disappoint this gal loves a good old disaster story and the harrowing story of grace trapped at sea with 30 odd others over three weeks is amazing and not just for the story charlotte rogan keeps the details to a minimum which matches the spareness of the survivors and the tantalizing holes in her story part narrative part diary allow you just enough room to put in your own horrifying ideas of what happened the ambiguity is what makes the novel it's short and if you enjoy reading novel with a clear cut hero or fully fleshed out details the lifeboat may frustrate you i totally recommend this to anyone","2267":"an intriguing page turner quite the feat for a first time author","2268":" i was sent a free advance copy of this book to review for lovereading co ukset in 1914 this is the story of lifeboat 14 told by 22 year old grace who we learn from the outset is on trial for her life along with two other women but can only guess at the reason grace takes us through the 21 days spent in the lifeboat awaiting rescue her narrative is 'matter of fact' leaving the reader to decide the motivation for the decisions each of the characters make the boat is over capacity and it becomes clear that not everyone will survive the story cleverly twists through practical details and the impact on the individuals whilst revealing the back stories of the main characters we are reminded of the different values of the time and in particular differences between men and women it is intriguing that some of the individuals only become interesting because of how they die by choice or otherwise the story is gripping as we are drip fed information about the people life on the cruise ship personal circumstances and prejudices we are treated to a range of emotions being shocked touched terrified and confused reflecting what people in the lifeboat have to go through throughout the book we question when certain actions are justifiable - is leaving someone to die the same as murder when the act which brought grace to trial is revealed it leaves us wondering what the outcome will be and questioning why this action is taken to trial and other similar ones are not this is a thought provoking book about circumstances in which we hope never to find ourselves and can only imagine what we would do","2269":"i actually like this book i like the drama this story had","2270":"the plot was predictable the lifeboat situation straight out of an old movie by the same name i believe the author seemed to be going for something more a subtle message behind the major action but she didn't quite get it across i disliked everybody i wanted the lifeboat to sink i began to believe that the world would be a much better place if the whole boat just turned over and dumped everyone into the sea however i did keep reading right up to the end you can't just leave a bunch of people sitting in a lifeboat no matter how unpleasant they are without finding out their fate","2271":" full review here http everydayiwritethebookblog com have you ever forced yourself through a book that you didn't enjoy but you still wanted to finish maybe you were curious about the ending or maybe you thought it was good for you or the reviews were really promising and you thought you might be missing something that's how i felt about the lifeboat by charlotte rogan the lifeboat takes place in the 20s about two years after the sinking of the titanic grace winter and her husband henry elope to london after he decides to marry her instead of his wealthy fiancee grace a young woman from a disgraced family knows that henry's family will not approve of her and she urges him to tell them about their marriage while they are en route back to boston on an ocean liner soon after the ship sinks and grace finds herself crammed into an over capacity lifeboat while henry remains on the ship to meet an uncertain fate the lifeboat is about the period of time when grace was at sea and then a subsequent trial after she was rescued for crimes allegedly committed onboard the lifeboat there were power struggles among the 38 people on the boat who faced difficult ethical questions about the price of survival and when it is acceptable to sacrifice lives for the sake of others the situation brought out the worst basest impulses of the people on the boat as they tried to align themselves with the people they thought held the power only to shift cruelly when the tides changed so... i didn't love the lifeboat it was very stressful to read i kept putting myself in the shoes of the people on the boat which made me very anxious and depressed the writing is good and the book is intriguing and engrossing but i just didn't like the process of reading it i also found it difficult to really understand grace her relationship with henry remained shadowy to the end and i didn't get a good enough sense of what she really felt about him or why grace was worth the sacrifices henry made for her i also had trouble keeping the minor characters separate in my mind i wanted to care more about them and feel something when they lived or died but instead i mostly felt detached and disconnected from them the lifeboat had an intriguing premise but i think it was ultimately not successful and it was stressful to read","2272":"i enjoyed the book it was very captivating but the ending left me hanging i felt like the author never really answered any of the questions she had been presenting to the reader i'm all for stories that are left open to interpretation but this left too much unanswered","2273":"i read this in one week reminded me of stephen king's work when he was richard bauchman excellent psychologically suspenseful","2274":"30 people in a lifeboat after a ship sinks in 1914","2275":"it was interesting until the end it's sad to start loosing interest at the end of a novel","2276":"i admire writers who take on unimaginable topics and this is one of those","2277":" humm many tangled feelings did i like grace yes with some reservations did i trust her recount of events sigh not sure did she show in her narrative some contrary effects to mr hardie's and mrs grant's actions why did hardie have to die other than mrs grant saying so i wasn't sure did mrs grant hold that much sway over the others i've just finished the book and am trying to work through all the moral lessons it holds i loved the language the imagery the characters and their development i think that grace really loved henry but i have my doubts which is what good writing is all about she was looking for a way to escape becoming a governess henry provided that marrying mr reichmann her attorney provides another escape does she really want freedom or does she want to be protected a compelling read with vivid detail of being on a lifeboat adrift at sea i loved the book and never hope to be in that boat","2278":"as a lover of shipwreck survival nonfiction this was irresistible to me compelling from the get go i found the second half stronger than the first things really got rolling when things got bad during the first half i had difficulty suspending disbelief because all the lifeboat passengers talked so much yak yak yak despite stiff water rationing and the narrator saying they were all thirsty not so thirsty they couldn't all share life stories and such i guess i agree with those who found the ending vague as well as what really was going on with henry blake and hardie before the ship went down if you like this sort of thing may i recommend more enthusiastically the usual suspects","2279":"this book was just ok the writing was pretty good and the characters were interesting however the main character was not she was indecisive boring and not very likable the story line itself could have been so much more than it was and the ending was a let down it kept me reading through the whole story but i wouldn't read it again","2280":"in 1914 a ship sinks and a group of people are in a lifeboat i couldn't relate to the narrator nor to their predicament everything is told in a flat unemotional voice maybe that's the point but there really wasn't any sense of dread or suspense","2281":"because this is a 4mfgu0026amp ls choice i read the whole book i never got to the point where i cared about the welfare of any of the characters i didn't have any feelings elicited except disgust and boredom the final straw was 'charlotte rogan's bookshelf' who cares i just need to remember her name in case she writes another book","2282":"i think that the concept of the lifeboat was much better than its execution the story follows grace winter a newly married woman traveling with her husband across the atlantic when we first meet grace she is in prison awaiting her trial for her involvement in something that happened on the boat in journal form she recounts the events of the boat sinking her time on the lifeboat and then the trial like i said earlier the idea was good but i did not like the huge gaps in the story maybe it was supposed to be similar to the gaps in grace's memory but it just left me feeling disconnected from the events also much of the book is just grace's diary of her time on the lifeboat in this section the book dragged on similar i'm sure to how it must have felt to be on the lifeboat itself the story picks up a bit during the trial which pretty much saved the book for me i would recommend this book if you are looking for something thought provoking to talk about but not really a page turner","2283":"it's hard to like a book if you don't like protagonist and she was very unlikeable","2284":"the story is a bit slow which i would say is mostly because there is very little dialogue in it overall a very good story that i would recommend to my friends","2285":"interesting premise poorly executed i agree with the reviewer who said huh sums up the book ending perfectly","2286":"a well written book on tragic story of a lifeboat in the 1914s and the murder trial that followed it captures the female struggle of the era very well although from a male perspective i did find it overwhelming in regard to the narrotive but then women have to put up the opposite from male authors so perhaps i should just suck it up and go with the flow","2287":"39 strangers on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean after a shipwreck and there's really nothing to this book that's just crazy two women orchestrate the overthrow of the only seaman on the lifeboat and i have no idea why there's just threads that go nowhere the only thing i was left with was the possibility that grace was a sociopath that would have been something there's certainly not enough reason to read another book by this author","2288":"disappointing there are so many other great books on surviving i finished thinking is that all there is the main character was weak and boring","2289":"gripping look at the moral decisions that people will make to survive i literally read this in one sitting because i needed to see what happened it grabs you from the first sentence and doesn't let go of you for several hours after you finish it","2290":"interesting story line but lots of things were left open ended i would have liked to have more of my questions answered","2291":"this is one of those books that once i picked it up i couldn't put it down i'd give it 4 1 2 stars but since they don't do that i am giving it 5","2292":" the lifeboat was a novel about a woman's escape from an exploded ship onto a lifeboat of about forty different people the novel follows the travels of the lifeboat seeking safety aboard is a woman grace who estranged from her family after the ship wreck is forced to live amongst strangers each with different and varying eccentric personalities they struggle to cope with possible loss of their families and the depleting of available food while leaders evidently rise and alliances form quickly the novel turns from a story of shock to one of death when they must decide who will be able to stay on the boat of an overflown capacity and who will die after grace does everything she can to survive she is left in safety sacrificing another's life which means a trial on her life when the boat is rescued and they return home i thought this book was gripping and exciting and also including grim topics displayed in a very formal way by charlotte rogan it was one of those novels with cliffhangers and twists and it was hard to put down","2293":"this isn't an easy book but it is surely an interesting and thought provoking one the writing style reminds me a lot of margaret atwood and in particular the work alias grace the protagonist of the lifeboat is also name grace and her motives and culpability are likewise ambiguous if you prefer your stories nice and neat this isn't the tale for you","2294":"compelling page turner definitely a great book","2295":"this was an enjoyable read it was interesting to see how far people go for survival i thought the ending was a little rushed which is why it didn't get four stars","2296":"audiobook just a simple story nothing exciting","2297":"another case where i wish goodreads would up their game and go with half stars like librarything i would have given this debut 3 5 stars","2298":" i had been wanting to read this for ages but have to say it's been a big disappointment the style of writing is easy going first person narrative and this makes it a quick read it starts with a woman grace about to go to court accused of murder but the main thrust of the novel is a 'flashback' to her experiences aboard a lifeboat following a ship disaster which she is recording in a diary the book is not a thriller but an introspective look at people their character and behaviour unfortunately this means there is a lot of thinking guessing and second guessing and we don't view anyone else's story in some places grace just can't recall events the end is rather abrupt as we learn the outcome of the trial but then it fizzles out a pleasant read but forgettable","2299":" tlike john steinbeck's story of the same title filmed by alfred hitchcock in 1944 cornell woolrich's short story \"it had to be murder\" also made into the film \"rear window\" by hitchcock agatha christie's \"ten little indians \" and reginald rose's play \"12 angry men \" \"the lifeboat\" by charlotte rogan is what is known as a limited setting piece claustrophobic unnerving and somewhat surreal this debut novel places 40 passengers in a wooden lifeboat built for 32 but mislabeled accidentally or otherwise after an unexplained explosion on an ocean liner on route from england to new york it is 1914 the beginning of wwi and the end of the belle epoque a year since the titanic sank and mere months before the lusitania did there is what readers cannot expect from \"the lifeboat\" a drama of manners and romance a la \"downton abbey \" or a heart wrenching war story such as hemmingway's \"a farewell to arms \" here's what readers can surprisingly expect a coming of age drama akin to forster's \"the longest journey\" or woolf's \"the voyage out \" mashed up with a harrowing survival story jamestown 1972 andes flight disaster the donner tragedy-- take your pick twell written and well paced \"the lifeboat\" is narrated by grace winter a straight forward girl newly wed to a man she feely admits to having stolen from another in order to rescue herself from her family's downfall the phrase \"fall from grace\" will occur to the reader more than once eminently practical grace embodies a type of woman that could perhaps have only existed in 1914 one caught between the modern world and a stereotypical historical one she is a woman of action who tries to understand those around her through their eyes and experiences yet she views her world as being only complete and safe as long if she has a husband too bad for her as her husband is probably not a survivor let alone in her lifeboat tas in the above mentioned works in which a group of very different people are thrown together in a life and death situation involving a shared space the story is rife with suspicion insinuation threat manipulation and humankind's ability or inability to rally comfort and show heroism in the most dire of circumstances ti thoroughly enjoyed \"the lifeboat \" though i can't say it went where i expected or hoped it would go this may not be a bad thing however early on it's assumed that some horrible turn of events befalls the survivors in the boat--some twist of fate some unseen corner around which they suddenly curve--and i still wanted that kind of twist after i was through that said though there is a climax and conclusion it's not the event itself that forms the crux of the conclusion rather it is the myriad of social psychological layers among the female characters and the almost creepy mythology that begins to form but never quite forms about them that creates a tension that extends to the last page","2300":"i'd give 3 5 stars i enjoyed the book but i wasn't completely glued to it","2301":"2 1 2 stars i feel like it had potential to be a fascinating story but definitely fell short i thought it was kind of boring","2302":"this was a surprisingly good book if you've read ahab's wife the plot will sound familiar it's the early 1900s and a ship goes down in the atlantic ocean those passengers who survive find themselves in a lifeboat with little food and insufficient water they have no way to call for help and help doesn't come but this is where the similarities end charlotte rogan's grace is a survivor she has been in tough spots before but her self interest and lack of sophistication mean that she watches carefully but relates what she sees without the lens the 21st century reader wears as you would imagine among the passengers in the lifeboat there are a variety of ways in which people cope there is selfishness and cowardice as well as kindness and courage the choices of individuals and groups of individuals have implications which aren't immediately apparent but lead inexorably towards devastating consequences grace ultimately has to chose who she will become in order to survive","2303":" there are two terrifying aspects to this book first the reader inevitably ends up in the lifeboat asking oneself what would i do in these circumstances how long would it take my civility to unravel what part would i take in the execution of tribal justice would i survive the entire 21 days or would i be one of the people thrown into the sea dead or alive the second horror is the trial of the survivals at the end of their ordeal when the jaws of justice chew over their decisions made in extremis and decide if they'll get to live that life to which fate returned them very good use of the first person pov","2304":"really interesting such an interesting story line","2305":"intriguing heavy u0026amp dark read","2306":" i was intrigued by much of this book but also found much of it rather boring i have found that after i finished reading and did some thimking and evaluation the whole premise and point of view of the book began to have deeper meaning two years after the sinking of the titanic another cruise liner sinks the exact cause is never revealed the entire story is told from the point of view primarily the memories of one passenger grace it is clear that grace is a survivor and has learned to hide her own true feelings for the sake of getting what she needs it is a technique she has used before during and after the sinking most of the story is a journal she writes after the fact when she is on trial for murder involving the death of one of the other passengers was it murder was she under the power of another individual there is a lot going on and lots of questions it is an interesting perspective to have only the one point of view and if grace did not learn the truth then we will not learn it either as a reader that is frustrating because i always want all the loose ends tied up neat and tidy but from a literary standpoint it does make the novel interesting and a platform for discussion about character morality struggle and a number of other things it would be interesting to see the story from several points of view and to know about the rest of the characters i don't think that was the point it was to see things from the narrow perspective that for the most part we view life","2307":" part morality piece part survival story and all encompassing it may be short read but it is meant to be stretched out over a couple of days to digest it all our narrator grace is not very reliable but when starvation sets in how many people can remember truth from fantasized truths part of what makes the book so interesting is that the plot is not very clear even by the end but that is part of the charm along with the breakdown of seemingly civilized folks by the end people have been thrown overboard tempers get flared and a power struggle ensues between the patriarch leadership and the woman vying for a more matriarch lead if you like stories of survival and attempts at power grabs then you should give this book a read","2308":" i read this novel in just over a day in fact i would have finished it a lot faster if i did not have to go to work this novel starts out by the reader being presented to a women that is currently on trial for murder this is followed by a serious of diary entries explaining what happened in the lifeboat that lead eventually to murder the setting of this novel was very well though out and had been well researched i felt like i was sitting in the lifeboat beside that characters watching the story unfold in front of my eyes whenever this happens i know that the book i am reading is going to be one of my favourite books of all time the lifeboat is a very thought provoking read and will bring you as reader to the edge of humanity how would you survive in the situation would you be willing to sacrifice others so that you would have a better chance of surviving i was left thinking these questions and more when i got to the end of the lifeboat overall this will probably be one of my favourite books of 2012 and i highly recommend it","2309":"just not as gripping as you would think","2310":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here grace is a captivating protagonist and the way rogan combines present and past moments is well done and creates a terrific dramatic tension i did have a slight problem with the book's premise would three women who were suffering from starvation and dehydration really be tried with murder that seems a bit far fetched for me if they were crewmembers i could see it because they have a duty to protect their passengers but these women were not in any sort of normal mental state at the ti grace is a captivating protagonist and the way

and dehydration really be tried with murder that seems a bit far fetched for me if they were crewmembers i could see it because they have a duty to protect their passengers but these women were not in any sort of normal mental state at the time still a riveting read more","2311":"disappointing i gave up a third of the way through","2312":"an ok book asks some interesting philosophical questions but never really grabbed me it felt more like the problems presented in high school philosophy","2313":"after the ship grace and her husband are on sinks grace makes it into a lifeboat with others and they are left to their own devices for 21 days very interesting how people cope in different ways and how grace's view of others changes day by day or even hour by hour depending on her circumstances at the time thought provoking","2314":"i really wanted to like this book the set up was interesting i like survival tales but this was more character analysis than action story then ending was anti climatic and disappointing","2315":"this book was hard to put down it was mysterious there was a definite plot and it was a story of survival and the women who helped each other survive death at sea","2316":"cool premise started out well but she lost my interest at the end just finished it to see what happened didn't really care","2317":"this was a hard book to get through but i was determined to finish it i kept thinking it would get better or the ending would bring answers i found it hard to sympathize with grace ending was disappointing","2318":"a nicely written intriguing book that unfolds sort of like a big road map that doesn't always have the right section next grace the narrator is retelling the experiences in a diary which she writes in jail while she in on trial for something she relates the various personalities the circumstances of 39 people in a lifeboat that is actually much small than its advertised 40 person capacity during the first two weeks of their drifting about the north atlantic the final week is not detailed it was a rather dispassionate non complaining relating of the story except for complaining about one very whiny other passenger just the facts and the one thing missing i thought was any serious reference to the hunger she must have felt as they gradually starved the constant discomfort of being crowded on hard seats the stickiness of the salt air on her hair and body and that sort of thing but altogether a compelling story that keeps your interest high","2319":"i found the book compelling and the idea of 39 people on a lifeboat in 1914 waiting to be rescued an interesting premise i often thought while reading what i would be like in a similar situation would i be a survivor would i be noble and give myself up to save others would i become like others wanting to survive and be willing to kill for it there were a couple of things brought up that were never answered which i would have liked to know about what was in hardie's box what did hardie and mr winter discuss before grace was put on the lifeboat i would have liked to know more about hardie i wasn't sure whether he was noble or not it raised a few good questions about life and death responsibility to self and others the breakdown of humanity and self when all is taken away and survival is the greatest need it made me think of lord of the flies for some reason it definitely is a good first effort for the author she was able to take a disastrous situation and treat it quite matter of factly through the voice of our young protagonist grace i didn't think much of grace and in fact she reminded me a bit of the timid and weak title character of the book rebecca how would the book been written had it been the voice of mrs grant it would have read much differently the author also could have written it with more horrific description but kept it to our imagination to explore the various scenarios it also made a difference in when the story took place would there be different outcomes had it happened twenty years later before wwii i felt more emotion at the beginning of the book along with grace when she first in the boat by the end of their 21 day journey she was nonfeeling and described the situation very much in the same way it was a quick read i finished it in just a couple of sittings i will most likely search out the second book of charlotte rogan's","2320":"a very quick read considering the subject matter how horrifying to survive that ordeal and then find yourself on trial for your life i couldn't put it down","2321":" such an intriguing premise 39 people stuck on an overcrowded lifeboat in the middle of the ocean for 21 days with the struggle for survival turning more and more ruthless the more time passes yet it left me a bit disappointed i love a good survival story as much as anyone but the problem i had with this one was that i just didn't care about a single one of the characters so who lived and who died and how and when and why was pretty much all the same to me nevertheless it was entertaining enough","2322":"good beginning fell apart at the end","2323":" first i did enjoy the book but it was not a great book my favorite part of the book was while the passengers were on the lifeboat and how they survive the emotions they experienced and how they interacted with each other the author did a lot of alluding with her writing sometimes it was confusing the ending was quick and abrupt and i almost felt that the ending the author wrote did not even correlate with 3 4 of what the book was written about this book did give me some insight as to how it was to survive the demise of the titantic by going on a lifeboat and waiting for rescue although those who survived the titanic were not on lifeboats for 21 days the emotions the survivors must have felt are projected in this book i also felt that the author needed to have more character development for not only main characters but for all of people on the lifeboat as well","2324":"i had an odd sense that i had read this book before probably because i read unbroken and saw life of pi recently another floating in the ocean in a lifeboat story felt like a repeat how different can the story be eating birds drying out fish catching rainwater in your mouth well add the 38 different characters although we never really hear about many of them interesting but not riveting","2325":"i'm not quite sure where the unbearably exciting comment came from on the cover it wasn't at all exciting but a carefully constructed study in the morals of survival and how people react and respond in a crisis how apt that i should read it this week very well written expertly constructed a masterclass in novel writing and an interesting plot","2326":"i had heard such good things about this book but i really didn't enjoy it kind of a disappointment and i expected it to b a quick read but i kept putting it down out of boredom","2327":"no plot just droned on u0026amp on very short only about 300 pages but was so tiresome to read u0026amp finish","2328":"didn't initially expect to like that much based on plot description but found it very compelling and enjoyable superbly unreliable narrator vivid and realistic detail of boats and oceans and people an intellectually complex existentialism all pulled into a tightly constructed plot just really nicely done","2329":" this was just a little too dragged out for my liking i'm a fan of novels depicting the actions carried out by human beings in dire circumstances the degree of extremity is both fascinating and intriguing not to mention thought provoking i had wanted to read this book even before it was published because i was real curious about the story 39 survivors of a shipwreck all in a lifeboat that was clearly overloaded the book started off portraying grace winter 22 a survivor whom was put on trial for murder alongside another 2 women mrs grant and hannah the writer went on to show us the recollections of grace during the twenty one days they were in the lifeboat before getting rescued followed by the courtroom proceedings determining the fate of those 3 women what i liked about the lifeboat 1 i liked that it was set in 1914 and it reminded me a lot of titanic just that the focus was on the survivors in the lifeboat and that they weren't rescued as fast as those of the survivors from the titanic i thought the writer grasped the era quite well with regard to language and the like overall that 'vintage' feel was there 2 that there were different cliques some who yearned for power others who conspired among themselves and those who were weak and powerless i thought the writer differentiated these people very distinctly from one another which was a good thing lots of drama here and there who would have thought so much could happen in a lifeboat 3 the physical and especially mental state of the survivors in the lifeboat were captured very well by the writer starvation thirst sickness hallucinations internal struggles some had it worse but some triumphed above them 4 the courtroom proceedings were interesting to read because i wanted to find out how the three women could escape from prosecution the arguments and everything made it exciting despite me not usually being a fan of law fiction what i didn't 1 loads of unnecessary information were fed to me which i thought were kind of irrelevant i'd rather more lifeboat drama 2 the story was far too dragged out for my liking as i have mentioned in the beginning 3 so there were 39 people on board the lifeboat but somehow i felt that there were only roughly 15 present who were the rest what happened to them perhaps the number of people was far too big to start with 4 the deaths were a little too convenient verdict while i enjoyed some aspects of the book i felt others were dull and boring to plough through nevertheless it was an interesting read on the topic of human nature","2330":"every now and again i like to read something completely different and this book was it's a tale of a lady called grace winter stranded in a lifeboat with an eclectic mix of characters after a transatlantic liner sinks mysteriously on route from england to america in 1914 over the course of several weeks grace and the other occupants of the lifeboat realise they are not going to be rescued quickly and try to eek out a perilous existence as one after another they die i tried to like this book i enjoyed it in places but it began to bore me a little especially with the chapters concerning grace being arrested after being rescued and returning to boston it wasn't a bad book just not as exciting and interesting as i had hoped","2331":"interesting but left out realistic aspects like how the young boy survived w o much food or how he kept such a low profile in the raft when he should have been active or whining about hunger being uncomfortable fear lack of things to do etc","2332":"read it fast but gave me a bad feeling the whole time narrator was just awful i want to read life of pi again just to cleanse myself","2333":"this was a good book although at one point i wondered who wanted to get out of the boat more me or the passengers it was well written and a quick read","2334":" this book was a solid read but i did not feel compelled to keep reading which is the feeling i use to base a 4 or 5 star review off of the story is one i have seen before mainly in alfred hitchcock's film lifeboat the characters and happenings in this book were different but it was similar in how being stuck in this situation played out in the lifeboat survivor dynamics all the plotting and murdering for survival when the people were not picked up by a boat right away after the disaster sunk the ship i started to have to force myself to keep reading when the court scenes started i just didn't care much about them and they were a huge change from the rest of the book by that time i was disconnected from the main character grace because she was proving to be manipulative and calculating in her story telling so i wasn't sure she could be trusted in what she said the last line in the book i so wanted to slap her i could see her delivering it with a i won smirk on her face so the book wasn't a bad one it just didn't thrill me like others i have read i am sure that other people may feel differently about it","2335":"i loved this book for the first 2 3 and then couldn't finish it it floundered sea pun","2336":"i went with 4 stars instead of three only because it was definitely a page turner","2337":"an engrossing story that leaves you with several unresolved questions about the protagonist and isn't that what a good read should do","2338":" it was a very good good book at the opening but towards the end it really didn't give me too much interest during the trial of grace and the other women that were in the lifeboat and i would have loved to have seen more details about grace and henry's beginning i had read this book because of it being one of the library's readers choice books and i always try to read a few of them but i was not regretful of my decision to read this book since it was a very gentle read and those are the kind of books that i like to read","2339":"really excellent read","2340":"i would give this a 3 1 2 because it kept my interest i read it in three days but the things people did on the lifeboat didn't seem too realistic to me it was a good read anyway and not too gory there also wasn't a lot of action or emotion but maybe she tried to make us feel how it would be to be stuck on a boat with nothing but endless water to look at for days and days","2341":"i finished it because i had to know what happened did not end the way i would have liked it but i guess i will be ok with it it was a fast read so that is a plus for me","2342":"strictly hasen","2343":"after all the hoopla about this woman's first novel and the fact that i'm a sailor i thought i would enjoy this more than i did for some reason the psychological drama never grabbed me and i didn't particularly like the protagonist and you do start out knowing she survives so that's not a spoiler eh it was ok","2344":"didn't even finish it didn't feel the need the story is very predictable and not much depth","2345":"very well written good blend of mystery and atmosphere it was true when it said you had to read it in one sitting","2346":"this book was easy to read and enjoyable i would have liked additional information in the epilogue like why did the ship sink were other lifeboats found where was the lifeboat ultimately scooped up did their paddling and sailing make a difference","2347":" i dont know it had possibilities and kept me interested but honestly lifeboats are small and you can only have so much happen in them well life of pi excluded as that was pretty good it was an interesting look at ones moral code lets say and how different people react in situations i say this though i would of thrown the old bitties overboard i mean come on i was very disappointing in one thing what ever happened to the boat with the bad officer and possibly the gold it wasn't good enough to read again so i will have to wait and asks others","2348":"another titanic inspired book it is not about the titanic but another fictitious ship of that time period in this story the sinking is not immediately apparent those in the lifeboat are not discovered for days and in order for some to live others had to die this one did produce some thought provoking questions about what would you do if","2349":"this one is a well written page turner it reminded me at various times of alias grace rules of civility the american heiress and in the heart of the sea more about moral dilemmas and ambiguity than a traditional work of historical fiction reviewed by kate h","2350":"it was an interesting account of their time stranded in a lifeboat i would have liked to seen the chapter on rescue before the results of the trial","2351":"great psychological profile what happens when 40 or so people are launched into the sea from a burning ocean liner excellent power play great period piece as well","2352":" the story is intriguing but the use of a first person narrative undermines the suspense we know grace survives along with other passengers so the suspense revolves around their guilt or innocence of a crime most of the action takes place in the lifeboat where the passengers face their ordeal in different ways and form allegiances that change daily once their crime is committed the story centers on the trial their rescue from the lifeboat is an anticlimax is grace a manipulative gold digger was henry involved in a shady deal what was mr hardie hiding in the end much is left to the reader's imagination i would have liked more suspense and definitive answers on the plus side the tension between mrs grant and mr hardie as well as grace's manipulation of henry would be great topics of discussion for a book club","2353":" i wasn't too impressed with this novel i thought it sounded really good but i didn't like the main character so that put a damper on things it definitely brought up some good existential questions about survival and how far you would go against your fellow man to survive however i didn't feel like the author put any hopefulness in the story because they were lost at sea it made me think of unbroken i realize that was nonfiction but there was such good humanity in that story even amongst war and evil but in this one i didn't see much of that","2354":"took a while for me to get into slow start but became better as i continued reading interesting story of survival and power","2355":"this book is ok always waiting for something to happen or to resolve and not much of either disappointing","2356":"i liked this book yet i didn't care for the protagonist are you supposed to give up all of your morals to survive well written","2357":"i thought it was going to be a lot better than it was i kept reading because i kept hoping but it never happened glad it wasn't any longer than it was","2358":"i really just couldn't bring myself to care if she got off the damn boat there was poor character development and therefore i felt no empathy for them","2359":"i wished i liked this book more i just didn't care about any of the characters","2360":"the beginning was captivating i did enjoy the book","2361":"a quick and very good read","2362":"i couldn't wait to finish this book i appreciated in theory of the single point of view but also found it frustrating how much of what grace is remembering is accurate it really gives thought to the definition of innocence and guilt definitely kept me guessing until the end","2363":"kind of boring took me forever to read but my dad read it in a day and loved it so there you go","2364":"in a nutshell i didn't like the book for two main reasons 1 the heroine without feelings and emotions2 the whole point of the story is on the surface any hints are being immediately explained for everyone to understand that it was a hint actually everyone got it without that the reader does not like it when the author considers him an idiot my complete review in russian http book side blogspot ru 2012 12","2365":"i made it to page 89 and i am quitting i am sorry to the person i cannot remember who recommended this book to me i just cannot stand the main character and the writing is not what i am excited about either i have too many books staring me in the face to invest any more time","2366":"i highly recommend","2367":"a book club book this was not an enjoyable read but it certainly was interesting and thought provoking","2368":"startling and fascinating","2369":" i have a feeling i missed something i think there was meant to be some higher plane in this book or a profound discovery well the book in its entirety went through it's story as if the reader wasn't even there i felt the story was somewhere far away in the ocean and there was no lifeboat to come to its rescue in other words couldn't relate some parts tried to lure me in but failed i kept anticipating the mystery thriller part of the book but i have a feeling it was thrown overboard midway nevertheless the ending got my attention i was left with questions as i think the author wanted it so the ending really saved the whole thing if you do pick this up and get going i urge you to get to the end it might open yoour mind to the whole story in new ways","2370":"unputdownable","2371":"narrated beautifully from the period","2372":"the reality of being lost at sea","2373":"i loved this book it has a great plot and character development it is definitely one of my top books of the year you won't be disappointed","2374":" author charlotte rogan wisely starts her story in the middle of the action readers meet grace winter twenty two a bride of ten weeks and a widow for almost 6 weeks grace is being escorted from the courtroom where she is on trial for murder as her attorneys lead her to a nearby restaurant for lunch a rain storm opens up and grace greedily stands in the downpour allowing her mouth to open and swallow up the drenching rain much to the embarrassment of her lawyers this prologue tells us so much and yet so little what rogan as brilliantly done is make us want to know more whew let me start by saying that i read this in two sittings over two days i was so hooked on grace winter that my real world was put on pause so i could read this brilliant first novel i won't give anything away that the publisher doesn't reveal in the synopsis or prologue we know that grace and others do survive the explosion and subsequent sinking of the luxury liner the empress alexandra taking place two years after the loss of the titanic we know some in her lifeboat do not survive what we will find out is who and why some do not survive as we meet the passengers in the over crowded lifeboat we see the struggle for life over death and of death to bring life break out author charlotte rogan has crafted a story so simple but with so many layers that you are hypnotized by its telling not a miss step that i could find in this story and i will add that i think it's interesting that we know a lot more about the women passengers than we do about the men rogan gives us what we need as far as character development not too much just enough to care and to keep us turning the pages a huge 5 out of 5 stars this e galley was provided to me by the publisher through netgalley and that in no way affected my honest review","2375":"an interesting fictional account of what actions people may take in times of crisis enjoyable narrator and well written tale","2376":"a little strange but still one of those stories i just had to find out how it ended","2377":"a true page turner i felt i was in the boat in 1914","2378":" i read a review of this book in a magazine and i thought it sounded pretty interesting a shipwreck the survivors stuck on a lifeboat together and all the physical and psychological trials they endure the narrative is told from the perspective of one main character grace winter a newlywed and now also a widow who ultimately finds herself charged with murdering a fellow lifeboat passenger overall it was a fascinating look at human nature in a survival situation especially since the narrator herself is unreliable","2379":"the psychology of this was very interesting lots of layers","2380":"i loved the style of writing and really enjoyed her descriptions of her characters feelings and setting","2381":"follows the days that a group of shipwrecked survivors endure being in a lifeboat before being rescued strangely good","2382":"grace is a survivor she did what she felt she had to do in order to survive her family's fall from grace her survival on the life boat and eventually her survival of life after her trial by marrying her attorney a little drawn out at times but well worth reading","2383":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2012 04","2384":"interesting story that takes place almost entirely on a lifeboat it moved quickly and depicted some interesting human intricacies that come about in the face of crisis","2385":"i was looking forward to this book and it starts out interestingly enough but that's about as interesting as it gets its a slow long slog of a read i will say that you feel like you're in the lifeboat at times like it will never end","2386":"the drama of survival on a lifeboat was the most intriguing aspect of the book that is what made it a page turner for me the court trials of the first person protagonist and two others on the boat was less entertaining but offered an interesting insight to how women were perceived and prosecuted in the man's world of the 1910s","2387":" the lifeboat was too vague and fuzzy for it to mean anything to me the main character is purposefully elusive which i liked but its through her unreliable perspective which means all of the other characters are kept at an impossible distance from us the end result was that i didn't feel like any characters stuck out the writing itself didn't do much for me either it neither popped or clicked with me it also didn't feel particularly revelatory within the story it was telling nor the character who was telling it it was a really quick read and i wasn't bored but it did not live up to the hype that the synopsis instilled within me","2388":"i'm not sure what i think of it yet i think i would like the book discussion group to read it","2389":"read this book because of a book club i am in and i wasn't that impressed it took me to about three quarters through the book to actually want to read to the end it dragged for me but wanted to read it so i could discuss it at the book club","2390":"very slow and anticlimatic","2391":"read in one day real food for thought","2392":"i feel like i read a book version of the titanic without any of the romance drama or heartbreak maybe to say it was a combination of titanic and castaway is a little more accurate the author has a great voice but it was the most steadily boring book i think i've read in a long time i so badly wanted to be grabbed by this story and have the story mirror the waves unfortunately that just never happened people died and there was a trial in the end but it was the most anticlimactic story of death and extreme situation that i've ever read i read this because it had blurbs by emma donoghue hilary mantel and tim o'brien hilary mantel describes it as beautifully controlled but i'm pretty sure that's just the nicest way to say steadily boring she could think of","2393":"this was interesting didn't love the ending the shipwrecked portion was interesting","2394":"4 5 stars complex characters suspenseful things unanswered","2395":"quick and thought provoking read","2396":"this was an absorbing read a page turner the writing is skillful and puts you right in the lifeboat with the survivors rogan's handling of the protagonist gives us a keen sense of human nature under pressure the power struggles both between the men but more interestingly between the women if you need a book to get you reading again or you know someone in a reading slump i recommend the lifeboat","2397":"a scatterbrained read i never could get behind any of the characters","2398":"i picked the perfect day to begin reading the lifeboat with a thunderstorm rolling in i tucked myself up in bed and transported myself to the tiny lifeboat where grace and her companions faced the treacherous ocean for days on end whether or not it was the atmosphere of the storm outside or charlotte rogan's detailed writing i couldn't help but feel like i was tipping back and forth in the boat along with the rest of the characters needless to say i was sucked into the story from page one and managed to finish reading the entire novel in two days straight the lifeboat presents a gripping tale of a young woman facing the pressures of life and death in the open sea one of the things i loved most about this book was politics and struggle for power between the main characters stuck in the lifeboat together in a way the examination of survival and human endurance reminded me slightly of life of pi by yann martel minus the animals of course the framing narrative of the novel was also extremely interesting and i couldn't help but revel in the suspense of discovering whether or not the jury would find grace guilty or innocent of murder without giving away any spoilers all i can say is that the ending was absolutely perfect and i was able to put down the book with a great feeling of satisfaction that isn't to say however that the lifeboat wasn't without its faults i became so engrossed by the story that i couldn't help but want it to expand some of aspects of the narrative for example i would have loved to have learned more about grace and her relationship with her husband henry i feel like the readers are only given the sparks notes about grace's past before the boat sank revealing more about grace's life leading up to the lifeboat would have certainly helped to develop her character a little bit more also readers are left with a lot of unanswered questions regarding some aspects of hardie's character and whether or not he was actually looking out for his own interests i suppose the reader is supposed to come to their own conclusions about this unresolved storyline and base their judgements off of the rumours and gossip of the other characters on the boat despite these unanswered questions i really did enjoy my time spent reading the lifeboat and would recommend it to readers who enjoy stories about survival and the struggle faced by the human spirit during challenging circumstances the lifeboat by charlotte rogan will be available april 3rd 2012","2399":"very good book well written and a great insight into social classes in the early 20th century","2400":"seemed to have a lot of promise a boat filled with the survivors of ashipwreck goes astray and they start to turn on each other but the book is neither thrilling enough nor the characters interesting enough to sustain the journey","2401":"i couldn't put this book down it was so well written the words just seemed to flow although a quick read it was very thought provoking about the ramifications of choices made by everyone what one would or wouldn't do to stay alive and survive safety regulations class distinctions and whether the rule of women and children first should and still applies would be an excellent read for any book club","2402":"an ocean liner explodes and 39 people are adrift for 21 days in a lifeboat much too small and without enough food and water a slow and unresolved psychological thriller of sorts not at all satisfying for me","2403":" this is an ok book not quite as good as i was hoping but not to bad is the story of a sociopathic manipulative woman and unreliable narrator who always seems to save herself from danger at someone else's expense view spoiler whether it be destitution finding a rich husband x 2 and a rich mother in law who she distances herself from once she gets what she needs gaining a place on the lifeboat avoiding drowning at sea and one murder possibly even two murders at least a second seem suggested to me hide spoiler anyway one i won't be reading again and i'll be giving away my copy to someone else","2404":"boring","2405":" description it is the summer of 1914 and newly wedded grace is on a luxury ocean liner with her husband henry celebrating their nuptials but when the ship suffers a fatal explosion grace is placed on a lifeboat as henry and other crewmen passengers sink into the ocean with the doomed vessel now widowed grace must fight for survival on an overcrowded lifeboat where rations and hope are dwindling who will stay afloat when there is no choice but sacrifice who will answer for the decisions made review i was really excited when i first received this book but it wasn't what i expected especially the lead character grace i disliked her personality it was ingenuine and irritating and i did not see where her character improved visibly changed throughout the novel her narration was unreliable and monotonous often leading to predictable plot lines and a general lack of interest on the readers part i usually love survival stories especially those that take place in open water or in unfamiliar and dangerous territory but the lifeboat failed to peak my interest ship explodes some live and some die crowded lifeboat floats on passengers bicker meager supplies death repercussions and atonement typical i was ready for shocks plot twists and admittedly cannibalism who doesn't love a plot readers can chew on unfortunately my continued reading was only rewarded with more disappointing narration and dialogue as for the aspects i did enjoy the character development was pretty good and there were definitely distinct personalities present the details were welcome additions as well often transporting me to the very lifeboat where the characters were stranded or to the isolating walls of the courtroom i really appreciated charlotte rogan's poetic writing style using some beautifully crafted depictions to describe the moods of the lost but the story as a whole fell flat good for a first time author but still not up to par with other books in the survival genre my favorite part was taking in the cover art rating bounty's out 3 5 i received this book from the author in exchange for an honest and unbiased review","2406":" in the summer of 1914 newlyweds grace and henry winter are traveling on an ocean liner across the atlantic when a mysterious explosion rocks the ship henry was able to secure a place for grace in a lifeboat but it was now at full capacity and he was unable to join her as the novel begins grace now a widow has finally been rescued and is facing trial for murder this is her story of what happened during the time at sea in the lifeboat as grace tells the story of the days adrift in the ocean she also thinks back on her life and how she met henry the entire novel was told from grace's perspective we never heard from any of the other people in the lifeboat all we know is what grace tells us i was never certain whether or not her version was the truth as it really was or the truth as she wanted it to be my biggest problem was i didn't like grace the other characters in the lifeboat people i would have liked to know more about weren't very well developed and we never had a chance to hear their story multiple narrators would have created another level of complexity something i would have liked to see continue","2407":"well written book about the struggles of surviving a ship wreck worry guilt the week to live and the hopelessness of the situation if rescued what you face back in society","2408":"i had high expectations for this one it wasn't bad but i wanted more","2409":"very interesting ideas presented some of the circumstances were lifted directly from an actual event of the same situation so reading some of the content seemed redundant overall a good read","2410":"i really enjoyed this book a first novel by charlotte rogan it is a very interesting character study and quite suspenseful at that highly recommended","2411":"i'm ashamed to admit i loved a book that was written in first person but i did it was a bit like the movie panic room mostly taking place in one setting which is why i think it's amazing that this person's internal monologue of her time on the boat was so interesting","2412":"engaging easy to read and thought provoking i especially enjoyed the protagonist grace and her take on life lovely sentence construction and thought flow perfect for book clubs so glad to start 2014 with a fun fiction book like this author's debut quite promising","2413":"sort of a predictable plot line but it was entertaining enough thought ahab's wife had a much better story of shipwreck victims set adrift at sea","2414":"a compelling story once i started i stayed up all night reading so many topics such detail i loved it the lifeboat is horrifying harrowing and beautiful leaving you with so many points to ponder what would you have done are you a surviver and what defines a survivor read this","2415":"this was a very good book the author describes the survivors very well and even their family members back home or those who did not survive it is not a life of pi but still a very good book","2416":" there are 39 people in a lifeboat in 1914 it's sinking because the weight of 39 is too great what happens next this simple brilliant idea is the main premise for the lifeboat our narrator grace who was a completely unreliable narrator which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't tells us the story of their journey from shipwreck to salvation with more than a dozen deaths along the way it's a harrowing story and i had a hard time putting the book down the author did a fantastic job of describing the misery of drifting alone in the middle of the ocean everything down to how their hair smelled and felt was told with such raw precision that i could absolutely feel myself drifting along with my fellow shipwrecked friends and enemies it was an absolute what would i do sort of situation what do you do when hunger desperation and the need to survive overrides your basic human decency could you murder throw someone overboard guilt someone into giving up their life kill a child this book was headed into the one of the best reads ever categories when i hit the final quarter of the novel then i'm not sure what happened the first three quarters of the book were told mostly from grace's perspective in the lifeboat which was excellent and addictive read the last part of the book which would have been the climax of the novel was all told in the courtroom in past tense it was as if all the energy had been sucked out of this story which was whirling towards a fantastic conclusion i've never been a fan of reading courtroom dramas and for me this just took the wind out of my sails it was still a wonderful read but i couldn't help think of the towering achievement that it could have been if the ending had been in the same style as the rest of the book and let me just tell you lifeboats are way less fun without a tiger in them","2417":"well it takes 200 pages to get out of the freaking lifeboat","2418":"both my husband and i both enjoyed this book 39 people on a lifeboat for extended period of time begins with main character in prison accused of murder was it murder","2419":"this book is about either a survival on a lifeboat in the early 1900s b a philisophical discussion on good and evil and the tendencies of people to live or die c the ramblings of an egotistical sociopathic or crazy woman trying to figure out which is the fun part","2420":"the prose was crisp and the narrator unreliable and those two things always make for an interesting story","2421":"i love survival at sea stories but this one just didn't work the author was trying to delve too deeply into the psychological aspects of the characters the suspense was lost and i held very little interest in any of the characters would not recommend","2422":" i'm afraid this book did very little for me i found grace a wholly unsympathetic character and the unreliable narrator just didn't hit the right note for me the power struggles in the lifeboat left me cold - i didn't really \"get\" some of the looks and hints and comments and wasn't enjoying the book enough to make the emotional or intellectual effort by the time i got to the trial i really didn't care it's not so much that it's claustrophobic a book substantially set in a 40 seater lifeboat is bound to be - but i just couldn't summon up any emotional engagement with the characters and i found that unforgivable","2423":"it started out really strong i really loved the plot however there were a lot of characters and i felt that it jumped around a lot and left out details","2424":"interesting first novel about survivors in an overcrowded lifeboat i was really interested to read this book and see how she dealt with all of the different personalities and politics in such a small arena i wasn't disappointed it was a very interesting look at survival and humanity makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation and if you would be able to survive love that it makes you ask questions and pursue ideas while you're reading the story","2425":"i need to talk about the ending with someone","2426":"deliciously written fantastic conversation starter and creative thinking generator well done","2427":"don't know if it was the writer's style or just my lack of empathy for the protagonist but this story wasn't as compelling as i had hoped i was probably about half way through when i stopped caring whether the folks died in the lifeboat or were rescued i slogged through it to the last page and was glad to be done","2428":"vostorzhennye retsenzenty the times i new york times

interesting book but it moved slowly and i felt it left a lot to figure out it would be a good book club book as it lends itself well to discussions and interpretations i can appreciate the author's ability to describe the characters and their personalities but didn't not like the missing events and the jumping around","2430":"a decent read but the characters were not fully developed for my taste a better shipwreck tale of survival is ahab's wife by sena jeter naslund","2431":"i will wait to rate this book until after our book club meeting","2432":"close your eyes for a bit and think nice thoughts","2433":"this is a beautifully written book and a really well crafted story that grabbed me from the very beginning and didn't let go until the end","2434":"good story couldn't imagine all that time in a boat","2435":"i really liked this book but found the ending really frustrating i felt like a lot of major plot lines were left unanswered disappointing","2436":" found this on the new shelf at the library the premise sounds exciting and full of suspence unfortunately i didn't get any sort of a thrill reading this this story felt flat to me with little to draw you in and keep you reading to find out how it all ends it wasn't until i was 2 3 of the way through that i even found a scene that really grabbed me i hoped that feeling would continue ultimately i was disappointed no real tension no characters i loved and wanted to be invested in no amazing ending to make it all worthwhile while this author has command of sensible language it just didn't hold my attention and i only finished it because it's such a short book that it didn't take me long to finish","2437":"i was looking forward to reading the lifeboat as a friend had told me she thought it was really gripping unfortunately i was really disappointed i wasn't gripped at all and had no empathy with grace the main character she is quite cold and not really very likeable it is an interesting premise for a book being stuck in a lifeboat hoping to be rescued but sadly i felt like i didn't really care if they lived or died","2438":"this book is a fascinating fictional account of the dynamics in a lifeboat for 21 days after a shipwreck there is very little action it is mostly what is going on in grace's head and some dialogue i liked the first half much better than the second because eventually action is needed to hold one's interest she is on trial along with 2 other women for the murder of a ship officer who took charge of their lifeboat and probably stole something from the ship i finished the book to see the trial outcome but wished for more action","2439":"it's ok that's about all there wasn't enough depth to any of the characters for me to really care whether they got thrown overboard or not great idea for a story great idea to frame it within a trial but just a bit disappointingly bland","2440":"listened on audiobook really liked it","2441":"2 5 stars it was interesting but i didn't resonate with any of the characters it made me think about what i would do in a situation where there's the possibility of death i was disappointed in the lack of nobility in all of the characters","2442":"interesting account of 39 people stranded on a lifeboat for days how did they get there who is in charge will they every be rescued the dynamics among the survivors is contentious at best especially with 30 women and 9 men leads you to look into yourself and consider what you would do","2443":"easy read made you think how one would act if you were stranded in a lifeboat for 21 days wondering if i would have what it takes to survive","2444":"i like to think that the human spirit would portray itself in a better light in a survival situation than was presented in this book hopefully i'll never know","2445":"loved the premise of the story however i did feel that a lot of discussion was wasted on the personalities of the people in the boat i couldn't understand mrs grant or hannah's appeal to everyone and didn't quite follow the lack of participation of the men i also felt that grace was very very manipulative choosing what was best for her at all times not my favourite but the story was interesting","2446":"this book was very well written and full of suspense i really felt like i was in that lifeboat with all the survivors i felt the dread and the uncertainty i felt the thirst and the hunger so why only 3 stars the ending the ending was so nothing it just ends there's no real conclusion at all and i found it to be disappointing","2447":"all that water wore me out","2448":"i wanted to love this book based on the premise and all of the glowing reviews and while i liked it i just didn't love it probably since i couldn't ever warm to the narrator for me it was a good read just not a great one","2449":"not so great but okay she is accused of murder when found","2450":"eh i didn't hate it but it just felt so pointless","2451":"a decent book but quite long and drawn out lacking in a complete conclusion interesting story with thought provoking ideas","2452":"this story was a disappointment the plot was flat and surprisingly dull given the situation of 39 people in a lifeboat i kept reading hoping and expecting something more to happen that would truly be interesting the best part was reaching the end so i could move on to another book","2453":" favorite quotes p 215 still it is never a good idea to form any hard and fast opinions at nighttime and by the next morning much of my old equanimity had returned p 222 ' we must content ourselves with trying to decide whether it was permissible in this particular case for the strange and anomalous facts of the situation are unlikely ever to be repeated each case must be decided upon its unique facts and merits and not by the application of some universal rule ' thus the judge pronounced his jurisdiction over us the majesty of the law was proclaimed and we were cast upon its waters p 264 and whether i did or not just hearing him suggest it made me feel stronger than i was which is a testament to the power of words","2454":" this book caught my attention right away and i had a hard time putting it down it starts with a young woman being tried for murder we soon find out that she is the survivor of a shipwreck and has spent a couple of weeks on a lifeboat before being rescued it is what happened on the lifeboat that is the subject of the trial and the book the woman's story is told in the form of a diary that she creates for her attorney this reminded me in some ways of lord of the flies in that when a group of people is stripped of the trappings of society true human nature emerges it's a very interesting book that will leave you thinking about it and the main character for a long time","2455":"excellent novel one of best reads so far this year","2456":"what a stupid book very disappointed after the reviews and comments i had read i feel like i wasted my time the only good thing about it is it was a short book so i didn't waste as much time as i would have if it was a longer novel","2457":"grace survives a shipwreck only to be put on trial for murder finally an audiobook i enjoyed despite knowing that she survives the tense situation and strong personalities in the lifeboat provide plenty of suspense and grace is an intriguingly unreliable narrator","2458":"good and interesting but ultimately i satisfying and not a well drawn enough picture particularly of the lead character it almost felt like someone chopped out a chapter or two","2459":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here on the eve of the first world war a liner sailing from europe to new york suffers an explosion and sinks

of the first world war a liner sailing from europe to new york suffers an explosion and sinks 39 men women and children are adrift in a lifeboat waiting for rescue our narrator grace winter who has become a wife and a widow within a short space of time observes the battle for survival and must later defend herself in court over something that happened on the lifeboat in reading a novel mainly set in a confined space over a period of three weeks you'd be forgiven for thinking that things might get a little dull from time to time but in the case of the lifeboat things couldn't be further from the truth the book is more exciting that most thrillers i've read and made me keep feverishly turning the pages to find out what happened who would survive and the impact of all this on the characters though the action is drawn within a limited boundary all human life is there and the boat is a microcosm of the wider world at the brink of a global conflagration that will change things forever the survivors struggle sometimes explicitly with issues of class the role of the sexes at a time when the fight for women's rights was coming to the fore whether religion is still relevant darwin's theory of natural selection and freud's view of man as an animal driven by unconscious drives to survive and reproduce just as the world will never be the same after world war i those who survive their ordeal on the lifeboat will be changed forever - the implication being that they will be altered for the worse the novel is interested in how far individuals must go to survive how they can square the terrible things they do in order to be able to live with themselves and the two faces that all of us have - the real person inside which we feel would be unacceptable to show to others and the face presented to the world in preference grace ably demonstrates this dichotomy but we can only guess what is really going on behind the face she presents for though she is the novel's narrator she is far from being a reliable one much of her narration takes the form of a diary she must write for her defence attorney in order to answer charges laid when she gets back to dry land we know therefore that she is presenting her best face and wants to come out of things well but we never really know how much she believes what she recounts she says she doesn't remember some key points so the reader has to decide whether to believe her or not there is doubtless evasion omission and obfuscation in grace's tale but we can't know for sure how much of it is deliberate or whether we are being told outright lies and though we only see things through grace's eyes it must be remembered that all the others on the lifeboat are probably acting in the same way as is the way of humans rather than remaining united two \"tribes\" form on the boat which leads to much drama and more fatalities no one comes out of the novel well - the message seems to be that as humans we will do or say anything to ensure our own survival and that those who sacrifice themselves for others are fools as you'd expect the novel is very claustrophobic and you can feel the characters' longing for any kind of escape it leaves the reader with a sick feeling while reading - whether this is more due to the scenes at sea or predominantly due to our reaction to the elements of humanity portrayed in the book is a matter for debate there's also a thriller type element to it not so much a whodunit as a \"will they be punished for it\" the lifeboat is surprisingly funny in places and how i felt about grace ebbed and flowed like the waves under the boat she is a wonderful creation whether you feel she is predominantly good or bad - a real multi faceted individual who you feel could have been walking around somewhere outside the novel this was a book that i read in a couple of big gulps as i was desperate to know how it would come out it was also a book i found myself thinking about after it was over and going back to in order to confirm particular details so that i could be sure i fully understood and had got the most out of it definitely a must read more","2460":" as the story opens the first world war has recently begun newly married grace winter and her husband henry are sailing home to america when the ship the empress alexandra sinks in the ensuing panic grace gets a place in one of the last lifeboats to be launched although henry is not so fortunate and she becomes one of 39 desperate passengers in a craft which is so obviously not designed for that many people right from the outset their situation forces them to face a major moral dilemma should they help those in the sea who could not get into a lifeboat thus threatening their own survival in an already overloaded boat with extremely limited supplies of food and water or do they beat away with the oars those who try to climb in so far so philosophical and so the novel progresses in the same vein as their time without rescue lengthens just how far will people go to survive and what coping strategies are needed to do whatever is necessary what should have been a tense and gripping novel somehow for me fails to engage to be in such a situation would be unimaginably awful and frightening and the actions of individual characters are part of that context but what is harder for the reader to accept is the weak characterisation they are just not rounded or developed enough and it is hard for the reader to develop empathy and sympathy as a result this lack of confidence with characterisation is also evidenced in the earlier chapters of the novel - as there are 39 people in the lifeboat this array at times appears to many for the author and as a reader it is confused by the lack of differentiation so that it becomes hard to work out who everyone is and which character is being referred to there are points in the novel when it becomes quite a tedious read and throughout there are a number of unanswered questions the final conclusion of the book is also weak the premise of the novel offered much potential but sadly the execution was lacking","2461":"eh it was ok","2462":"this book had so much potential remember the ethical exercise that most of us did in high school there's a boat that holds x number of people here's a list and description of more people than the boat will hold who will you eliminate and why well this book takes that exercise and turns it into a less than satisfying exploration of human behavior and motivations i found it very disappointing","2463":" this book initially sounded interesting to me and i was disappointed it was kind of slow to get into and it never really picked up for me i never connected with grace and i almost disliked her at times although i felt that way with most of the people on the boat i had to keep reading because i felt something would happen that might make me change the way i thought about the book that never happened i was fascinated and a little horrified that the lifeboat had been made smaller but the placard for the maximum persons load was never adjusted down this let to way too many aboard the life boat","2464":"very interesting loose ends not tied up as neatly as i would like did keep me wondering and guessing until the end memorable","2465":"this book did its best to make me question myself there were many times i wondered what i would have done in the same situation i cannot say that i actually got vested in any of the characters but i did related to the story itself this novel repeatedly had me questioning and evaluating my morals and ethics we think we know what we would do under any circumstance but do we really i question what type of person i would be and what decisions i would make if my life really depended on it","2466":"this showed such promise but it never really moved along repetitive and boring","2467":"an incredible book charlotte rogan gets the gears in your mind working overtime very suspenseful very thought provoking a must read wow i will be rereading this one","2468":"i won this book as a giveaway on goodreads i enjoyed this book it was an interesting topic for a book i think it was a very good effort for a first novel","2469":"harsh look at survival","2470":" so really 3 5 stars and here's why my wife and i often buy each other bargain books usually sight unseen no research often motivated by whimsy as much as anything and this is likely the most successful of such purchases in recent memory the story revolves around the survivors of a titanic era shipwreck not the titanic and the subsequent murder trial of several of those survivors the motivation for which stems from the events on the lifeboat after the shipwreck the first person narration takes the reader through these events but as the story progresses it becomes apparent that the narrator's self serving bias may be withholding key details or shaping perspective in her favour without spoiling the end of the novel and therefore the outcome of the trial the narration runs slightly in the face of how the narrator is perceived by fellow characters this is not a shortcoming of the book just an interesting quirk that follows the narrator throughout the story it wasn't a book i absolutely couldn't put down but it was interesting enough to keep me reading later than i wanted to on several occasions to say i recommend it if you have nothing else to read sounds like i'm selling the lifeboat a bit short it's a quick and easy read the most entertaining part of which was the what if it were me considerations as i read the book also spans genres also not exactly a mystery or a thriller or a romance or a period novel but containing elements of each i recommend it but really don't have much more to say in terms of how enthusiastically","2471":"really made me wonder what would i do","2472":"i'd read rave reviews of this book and i enjoy unreliable narrator novels so when i saw it half price in a sale i snapped it up what a disappointment it fell very flat and was certainly not gripping or unputdownable i never felt any concern for any of the characters because most of them are just shadowy background figures whose names meant nothing i couldn't remember who was who beyond grace hannah mr hardie and mrs grant grace is not likeable that's fine i don't need to like the heroine of a novel to enjoy it she's manipulative and self centred i didn't care whether she was acquitted or not so there was no suspense really good unreliable narrator novels give the reader enough information to judge just how unreliable the narrator's version of events is for example in elizabeth is missing the other characters are cleverly used to shed more light on situations maud herself doesn't understand i don't want everything spelt out there need to be grey areas but we never really get a chance to see grace through others' eyes in any meaningful way i'd have liked to read the story through hannah's eyes she seemed a more intriguing character many loose ends were introduced for no apparent reason the box in hardie's pocket the chest full of gold the other lifeboats for that matter were all of them lost if not why were none of their occupants present at the trial finally it's derivative hitchcock's lifeboat springs to mind but the basic premise of the choices to be made in this situation sacrificing individuals to save others is fairly obvious and then i think it's no accident that the heroine is called grace it irritates me to even write this but margaret atwood's alias grace is about an unreliable narrator called grace facing trial for murder telling her story in flashback to an outside male observer at the end of the novel you still aren't sure what to believe whereas in the lifeboat you very quickly get the idea that in every difficult situation she's encountered grace has ensured her own survival at the expense of others if charlotte rogan thinks her book can stand comparison to what is arguably atwood's best novel well she is sadly mistaken hmm must re read the atwood","2473":"very interesting and intense novel a group of people thrown from the decks of a burning ship into a lifeboat will they be rescued will they all die a young bride is not who she seems to be and participates in a murder or does she all told from the bride's perspective as she awaits trial gripping right up until the end","2474":" first of all throw out all your intentions of reading this if you're a titanic buff this isn't a romantic tale of self sacrifice this tale is more about what happens at the edge of reality survival about the personalities and the decisions that clash when the only thing standing between you and death is another person i won't say i 'enjoyed' this one at several points i was alternately horrified and inspired the writing was excellent and i thought the decision to make grace a little wishy washy was a good choice since that brought the reader into her mind and experience even better as opposed to having the story told through mrs grant's eyes someone whose forceful personality would have made it more difficult to identify with the way rogan pieces out the story never quite fleshing everything out at once also makes it a fascinating read and while i wouldn't call it fast paced it grabbed and held my attention as i read","2475":"i am of two minds on this one i found the scenario very compelling the characters are all trapped in a drifting lifeboat after a shipwreck but i thought the book had a lot of little mysteries and loose ends that were left utterly unresolved and there was a lot of inner life of characters what they were thinking what that might mean for example the main character keeps overhearing snippets and fragments of conversation or observing glances between other characters and then wondering what if anything it means there is a lot of that which i guess there would be if you were trapped in a lifeboat what else can you do but sit and plot and wonder but i felt most of those little mysteries were left unresolved i guess it all ties into bigger themes about the meaning of life and ethics when trapped in a life or death situation and so forth but to me it took away from the excitement of the drama and action of the story my husband had said he might like to read this and i warned him he will hate it all that existentialism will drive him up the wall it might make a great book club book though lots to pick apart and discuss","2476":"loved it great story and characters","2477":"i was a little disappointed in this and i'm not sure why maybe it wasn't what i expected and i felt like the plot arc went nowhere","2478":"i wanted to love this i love all things titanic and this did not live up to my expectations i was ready to put it down after just two chapters but i don't like to do that i plugged through it and the book never got better i wanted to become invested in the characters i loved the idea of the book but it never happened i recommend skipping this one and going onto the next one on your list","2479":"do not read this book it was a chore that i had to finish instead of the page turner i expected it was the monotonous day in day out horrors of living on a lifeboat not knowing if you'd ever be rescued too many questions remained unanswered those were the things that kept me reading hoping for a revelation which never happened","2480":"this was my second attempt to read this book i found the book challenging to my perceptions on survival but recognised that no one can judge unless faced with the same dilemmas","2481":"wasn't thrilling although it did make me think about the decisions one has to make in a life or death situation like that a few plot points seemed to go nowhere and i found little to like in the narrator who came across as grasping and manipulative in her own way not a bad read but let's put it this way i'm glad i only borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it","2482":"the only thing that kept me reading this book was that it is our book club selection for october the first person narrator is an opportunistic flibertigibit there were too many characters to keep track of this could have been improved had they been more finely drawn there was a mystery about a transaction between grace's husband and the crewman on the lifeboat that was never resolved as well as the matter of what was in the box too many loose ends","2483":"quotes shouldn't i be sorry for god's sake alone p 70 but the sleep of the saved is the same as the sleep of the damned p 153 i enter that blue vaulted chamber of memory rather the way one would enter a church reverently with awe in my soul the church is filled with light too_not the usual gaudy sort filtered through lurid images of christ on the cross but sea light murky and green and as cold as satan's heart p 157","2484":"i would give this book 3 5 stars it is the story of grace winter who is on trial with two other women for murder while trapped in a lifeboat she and her husband henry are on a ship across the atlantic that sinks two years after the titanic she is placed in an overcrowded lifeboat with one of the crew who seems to behave suspiciously to some of the minds of the others in the boat there is a power struggle between him and a very strong willed woman in the boat it is very well written the kind of book where you want to read every word but she started to lose my interest about 2 3 of the way through i really just wanted to find out about the murder and the author got a bit bogged down in the details of being in the lifeboat and about the lives of some of the others in the boat that just weren't that relevant to the story a quick read","2485":"roughly 1916 the passenger ship empress alexandra sinks between england and the us the story follows one particular lifeboat told in first person of a young woman just married and enduring the open sea questioning any rescue a good story of endurance and the struggle of someone used to having strength provided to her and who must now endure with her own strength","2486":"wow i am really impressed with this book what starts off as a corker of a survival story slowly becomes a much subtle examination of truth and morality it's handled so well i have a hard time believing this is rogan's first novel i highly recommend it","2487":"this tale is so like those disaster situation team building exercises definitely a page turner so much innuendo foreshadowing so many loose ends","2488":"not a page turner bought it a year ago and so bored i've decided to never finish it","2489":" i really enjoyed this book i didn't expect such a thought provoking character study and thoroughly enjoyed trying to figure out the book's who is stranded in the lifeboat with 39 other people every time i thought i had her pegged another incident comment or thought on her part would throw be back into speculation the characters were diverse and developed enough to different degrees based on their contribution to the story's purpose which is also something the reader must decide for themselves this would be a wonderful book for a book club to pick apart just don't expect this to be a total action adventure with sharks whales or what have you the storm is all the excitement this book needed","2490":"i felt disappointed with this book perhaps i 'bigged it up' too much having read the reviews etc but i expected more however it was interesting seeing how the confines of a boat lack of food and water and hope to some extent play tricks on people and affect their minds and thinking i can see why some give it 5 stars but for me it's not my cup of tea","2491":"not action packed and no cannibalism but still a very good survival morality story a fair touch of women's rights are addressed as well as the balance of power in the lifeboat starts with the men but rapidly shifts which is more important physical or mental strength many moral issues are explored here as the survivors drift in the atlantic awaiting rescue good for fans of jamrach's menagerie or room","2492":"this read more like the outline of a story rather than a good tale seemed as though the characters all needed to be fleshed out a bit more none were compelling quick read disappointing close","2493":" very very good but lacked the mystique the presence to push it further up charlotte rogan has done well to paint a picture of those lost at sea complete with the moral conflicts inherent the background stories and subplots and the tragedy you would expect there are rich descriptions of the color and texture of sky and sea that show a clear sensitivity and elegance to the writing a vivid portrayal of the ravages of exposure to the elements starvation and thirst however the moments of grace were scarcely enough to outweigh the lack of intrigue in the plot and the last part with the trial not memorable or recommended","2494":"highly recommended","2495":"this book surprised me in a really good way i expected a somewhat standard survival story but the way the author chose to reveal the plot was interesting and unexpected it's a fast read but a fast read with substance and plausible characters","2496":"hell is other people on a lifeboat","2497":"on the eve of the first world war newly wed grace winter is cast adrift in a lifeboat with thirty nine others when the transatlantic liner on which she is a passenger founders and sinks this is the story of how and why she survives while many of her fellow passengers perish it's told in grace's words but she's an unreliable narrator she doesn't necessarily lie it's more a question of emphasis the reader has to sort out where and with whom his or her sympathies ought to lie it's a strongly imagined narrative but surprisingly for such a situation i found it a little lacking in drama the same ground is covered and recovered as it is re examined in the light of small changes in our understanding it's clever and interesting but it didn't thrill me too many of the characters were sketchily drawn and i felt she could have done more with such a powerful premise","2498":"good drags a bit in the middle and again at the end but very well written","2499":"3 5 stars i have always liked survival at sea stories whether they be fiction or true one of the best was included in last year's non fiction book unbroken i wonder if the overload of titanic documentaries and print articles at the time of this book's publication will help or hinder sales of lifeboat due to titanic fatigue this fictional account is about a mysterious explosion aboard a ship named the empress alexandra it is bound for the usa from england 2 years after the sinking of the titanic and just before the formal outbreak of ww1 it is an account of a survivor grace winter we learn at the beginning she is on trial for murder her lawyers have urged her to write a book of her lifeboat memories while imprisoned hoping to use it in an insanity defense i failed to find grace particularly likable but her character was vividly portrayed the actions and behaviour of other lifeboat passengers did not make them seem as real to me as grace which diminished the suspense grace was on her honeymoon with husband henry they were on their way back to america to meet his parents and to settle down henry is a wealthy banker and they had gone to england mainly it seems to take grace shopping we see a very aggressive side to grace's character she first became aware of henry when she saw pictures of fiance's engagement in the paper and became determined to marry him she began stalking him to determine his whereabouts run into him accidentally and seduce him grace was brought up in comfortable circumstances but her father lost everything and committed suicide and her mother went mad it seemed the only path open for grace and her sister was to become governesses or marry a wealthy man grace appears to look down on her sister's governess position the lifeboat where grace finds herself is overcrowded and holds few emergency provisions a sign on the lifeboat says it holds 40 people but the size of the lifeboats was reduced to save money and the sign never changed there are 39 people on board which is far too many for its size grace is looked on by suspicion from other passengers she was the last getting on the lifeboat along with a ship's officer mr hardie hardie was seen in conversation with grace's husband just before the ship exploded the rumour is that money was exchanged to get his wife a place on the lifeboat hardie is ruthless in battering people in the water to keep them off the lifeboat and refusing to take aboard a child struggling in the water this begins a division some people grateful to hardie as they have barely room for themselves and also thankful for his sea knowledge which they believe will help them survive others feel him to be too ruthless and events aboard add to rumours and suspicions about him grace admires hardie but becomes passive sometimes shifting her allegiance silently to others led by two strong women on the lifeboat we learn of horrifying events and see jealously rumours and lies moral dilemmas self sacrifice illness and death paranoia and murder some truths never come out as the survivors recall events differently i was bored with the legal maneuvers leading up to the trial but the trial itself was interesting and dramatic","2500":" i'm going to say that i didn't enjoy this book as much as i would have liked simply because i was busy with other things and would read maybe a couple of pages a day which meant that it took a long time to read this book as a result i became uninterested in the story and it sort of fell flat to me the idea was intriguing and i enjoyed it at times while i wouldn't say it's a total allegory i can see some prominent metaphors in this book that relates to religion etc i might give it another shot another day","2501":"this book held my interest and was hard to put down until the end the ending leaves you feeling incomplete questions are left unaddressed and the story is culminated with events that hardly connect to the rest of the plot","2502":"this is a compelling and deeply disturbing book about the choices we make and why we make them what made it readable is that you never really know the motivations of the protagonist who also serves as the antangonist","2503":" i did not really enjoy that book i expected something different it seems to me that the author did not stress enough the difficulties experienced while trying to survive on a lifeboat during the first two weeks by that i mean simply experiencing the cold hunger thirst fear etc she does mention it especially at the end but describing these feelings and emotions seems less important to the author when i would think they should come first the struggles between men and women people on the boat of different backgrounds the decisions they have to make and live with are all very interesting though i just expected more somehow i did not feel while reading the book how hard it must have been to survive for 3 weeks and especially the first two that are mostly written about and as a reader that's what i wanted to feel it seems to me that things should have gone downhill very quickly whether or not there was a mr hardy on board under such extreme conditions i don't think it would take that long for people to totally fall apart but i have never experienced such conditions and i hope i never will so i could be totally wrong overall i think it's an interesting book interesting characters and behaviors it just fell short of my expectations left me a little too cold for such a topic","2504":" while the first few chapters of this were captivating something that may or may not have had something to do with the fact that i was stuck on a delayed train i found this book seriously lagging by the end i lost interest in the characters and found little in the plot manipulative characters whose motivations reader never entirely understand and whom we are given little information about fairly repetitive by the conclusion at which point the narrator alludes to a new husband unmentioned before or after i was frustrated i'm all for withheld information and for narratorial ambiguity but it needs to be governed by some overriding narrative structure design","2505":"still wondering about this did she or didn't she","2506":"i wondered if all a person hope for was illusion and luck for i was forced to conclude that the world was fundamentally and appallingly dangerous 71 i do not think that the only way to show courage is to face the world alone 264","2507":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here when i first started this book i didn't think it would be this interesting i was fearing some dull nature based story though i knew it had had great revues i ended up reading most of it a chapter or two a night which actually reflects how it's written the majority of the story is divided up and told as each day and subsequent night unfold with the past few snow days i've had some time to read more in one sitting this is not just a story about survivors of a shipwreck and it's not just when i first started this book i didn't think it would be this interesting i was fearing some dull nature based story though i knew it had had great revues i ended up reading most of it a chapter or two a night which actually reflects how it's written the majority of the story is divided up and told as each day and subsequent night unfold with the past few snow days i've had some time to read more in one sitting this is not just a story about survivors of a shipwreck and it's not just a story about the sea this is a story about human nature and more specifically women the women are the main characters they come alive as we watch them evolve over 16 days at sea including the three that stand trial at the end there is depth and nuance in their descriptions interestingly the entire story is told through grace's voice but she is not quite believable as her maturity and wisdom don't seem to mesh with her age she is about 22 however mrs grant and hannah are real they could be the mean girls in your high school or the leaders of a sorority mary ann has definite modern day counterparts as well the male characters are much more limited only hardie is of interest and even he is fairly two dimensional while we watch his progression from leader to hunted animal we don't really know much about him or why he makes the decisions he does yes this is a feminist book discussing women's lack of rights in the early 20th century their limitations in the court system and lack of options in life hannah is probably a lesbian character of all the story elements in this book the feminist angle is the one i take away the book owes some of its nature to the titanic story and not a little bit to lord of the flies survivor stories are not new but they certainly touch a chord with us i found the ending satisfying both the outcome of the trial and how grace is thinking about moving forward without actually planning it this seemed realistic give it a chance even if the early chapters seem a bit slow it's worth the effort more","2508":"couldn't get into this one she didn't write to the time period correctly and i didn't care about the characters by page 50","2509":" i finished this survival story in about 24 hours although i admit skimming the courtroom scenes at the end these were far less interesting and morbid than the tense and terrifying scenes that took place in the lifeboat where ethics morality and gender roles became the basis of life and death battles between the cool and calculating unreliable narrator and her unfortunate companions 2 3rds of the book is terrific but those last chapters full of blustering sexist lawyers the novel takes place in 1914 and long ethical arguments just bored me i know they were there to illustrate the bias and prejudice of the time period but i would have preferred staying in the heart pounding lifeboat than the bloodless courtroom","2510":"i had really high hopes for this one but i feel very short of the mark for me i couldn't get into it after trying several times","2511":"this was interesting and adventurous but needed to be fleshed out a bit more","2512":"quick read for my book club interesting read about what happens to 39 people's sanity when they are adrift at sea for 14 days with little water little food and dealing with the weather although this book takes place in 1914 most of it could take place at any point in history it was interesting to see the sanity decrease as the circumstances became more dire i would love to know more about whether grace's husband henry had some underhanded dealings could he be the cause the ship caught fire and sunk that situation was never resolved to my satisfaction also what about the situation between mr hardie and mr drake some answers would have been nice this book should make for an interesting discussion with my book club this month","2513":" this review was originally posted on my blog http turnherintoliterature tumblr com this book won 'most interesting cover' during the book design portion of my diploma of book editing and publishing right after i'd read it when i bought it on book depository initially that was what drew me to it the sense of extreme isolation in an unfriendly world the novel opens with a young woman standing for trial with a few other women accused of murder while being stranded on a lifeboat in the middle of the atlantic ocean set in 1914 days after the shooting at sarajevo grace winter is a newlywed with a very rich husband who is lucky enough to have passage back to america from the continent unfortunately the ship sinks and while she makes it onto a lifeboat her husband does not the lifeboats are overcrowded and one by one the passengers turn on each other cold starving and thirsty and start calculating who belongs on the lifeboat and who should be thrown overboard so that the others may survive throughout this grace reflects on her relationship with her husband and we are able to become acquainted with the motley crew aboard the lifeboat as well as the calculating power plays and the dynamics between the women aboard some parts of this novel were truly chilling but while i found this a story i couldn't put down i was rather disappointed with the final denouement and with the way the women standing trial were portrayed in their exchanges with each other still i found it a worthwhile read and quite an interesting take on a titanic style scenario","2514":"it was okay i admit to some skimming","2515":"enjoyed the way the characters were portrayed at human with flaws instead of two dimensional either good or bad had issues with the way the ending was handled overall and good read","2516":"i am reluctant to review this book it was not at all what i thought it was going to be a victim of marketing i thought it was going to be a vivid true to life survival story emphasis on survival it just wasn't","2517":"an intriguing and quick read unfortunately the author didn't add much to the often debated question of what acts one is capable of in dire circumstances","2518":" i had a hard time getting into this book and it went pretty slow for me i got a little more interested by the end but it just didn't do much for me i never got very invested in the characters and none of them even the main character were very likable i also felt the storyline about how she got onto the lifeboat and the chest of gold box of jewels was confusing and not really explained i was disappointed because this book came highly recommended and was looking forward to an interesting survival story and dramatic trial","2519":"thoroughly enjoyed this read it is amazing what humans feel forced to do when put in a survival situation","2520":"the tension might have been better served had the other characters been more distinctly drawn but maybe that would not have served grace's character well and nature is at the heart of the novel","2521":"not a thrilling read but well done for a first novel kept me reading just to find out how they would survive","2522":"i thought this book to be very compelling the events that occur during their time in the lifeboat are very traumatic however one can only imagine if they would do the same if they were there too","2523":"one of the worst books i have ever read","2524":"what would you do how would you survive what choices would you make","2525":"a book about the quest for survival in an over crowded lifeboat which poses ethical questions about human behaviour in desperate situations the book is cleverly narrated and the central character grace is likeable but it is open to interpretation whether she is a good heart or cleverly manipulative in a malevolent way even after her trial the reader may feel that the jury is still out on this point","2526":"felt like an under achiever of a book thought it was going to be more of a shocker but it was surprisingly bland","2527":" set in 1914 at the beginning of the first world war after the sinking of the empress alexandra a group of 39 people are left adrift in a lifeboat built to hold far less in the middle of the atlantic ocean for 21 days this tale is told retrospectively from the point of view of grace winter a 22 year old newlywed who manages to find a place on a lifeboat but the lifeboat she's found herself on is overloaded and in danger of sinking there isn't enough food and water for everyone on board soon some of the passengers are discussing volunteers to go overboard some may need to die if the rest are to survive very fast reading","2528":"i had to force myself to persevere through to the end of this book during the time in the lifeboat there are so many named characters that it becomes very hard to follow none of the characters are developed enough to make a reader care about them or their plight totally should've stopped reading not worth the time to get through it","2529":"the story is set before world war ii during a sailing from england to america the survivors of a shipboard explosion are now in a lifeboat this small group becomes a microcosm of society who will lead and who will follow if only some survive which ones will it be are women and children given preference over the men is it survival of the fittest what about god helps those who help themselves what happens during a severe storm at sea this book is a study in sociology","2530":"i really enjoyed this book the heroine grace was a well thought out character and her thoughts and emotions were believable it was easy to read and follow","2531":"didn't love it i felt no connection to the main character at all kinda boring though the premise was good eh","2532":"ok reminiscent of life of pi i like to care more about relate to main characters","2533":" i love the way the author handled this story survival on the lifeboat was a little bit chance but mostly about people how they behaved the alliances they formed what they were willing to do to survive and behind it all is a mystery one that is never really solved about why the ocean liner carrying passengers from london to new york sank was there foul play was it because the liner was carrying materials of great value or did it have something to do with the war brewing in europe these possibilities are introduced as peripheral ideas floating around and through other speculations about the wreck and the survivors and there is much speculation throughout the novel whether it is among the survivors on the lifeboat or those observing three female survivors who are put on trial for murder a quote from grace the survivor who tells her story and the story of 21 days in the lifeboat with 39 other souls is telling it was not the sea that was cruel but the people why should any of us be surprised by that","2534":"a must read about survival","2535":"i really enjoyed this i thought you could read it from many different layers and the lead character is a great character so complex","2536":"meh read for my bookclub i think its potential was great but its excecution unfortunately average","2537":"enjoyed this book but found it difficult to empathise with the main character grace also there were too many other characters to get to know their back stories but on the whole worth reading","2538":"grace winter is one of the most interesting narrators i've ever stumbled across the depth of her character develops with each chapter as she describes the events that occurred in a single lifeboat after the sinking of an ocean liner in 1914 the undercurrent of gender expectations and women's roles in early 20th century society added to the complexities of the lifeboat it's a great read and fantastic narrative","2539":" oh poo i had a quote marked in my book that i wanted to base my review off of but my book is at home and i am at work not working too late to turn back now i had high expectations for this book here's the general idea of the story i had in mind when i decided to read it three woman are on trial for murder after being stuck on a lifeboat for days when their ship sank on a journey across the atlantic here's what i expected psychological intrigue 39 strangers picked to survive in a boat to find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real i thought surely there would be some cannibalism alas no cannibalism what i liked most about this book the image of a woman in petticoats sinking into the sea what i liked least the entirely monotone unlikeable narrator rogan writes well for this being her first book it just didn't capture me as i'd expected upon a rereading of my review i noticed i subconsciously quoted from karen's review of the same book and now i feel silly so i recommend reading her review since they are always much more entertaining than mine and she has more positive things to say about this one","2540":"the first 2 3 of the book was a five star read and i couldn't put it down it was so dull and unsatisfying in the last 1 3 that it drags my rating down to a three","2541":"loved this book even though there were many unanswered questions at the end which usually drives me crazy i couldn't put this book down i find myself thinking about it long after i have read it","2542":"i gave the book 3 stars but can't say i'm firm on that i enjoyed the story not sure how i felt about the writing i was hoping for more character development i was left questioning some of the moral dilemmas the story posed i felt i got a little of each of these but not enough of one or the other","2543":"4 stars for parts i thru iii 2 stars for part iv","2544":"i never imagined a story about people stuck in a lifeboat could keep me so riveted on every detail this was an exceptionally well written book","2545":"no surprises here you know most of the plot just by the title","2546":"i wasn't as impressed with this book as i wanted to be i thought there were some unanswered questions about the narrator left that needed to be reconciled","2547":"complex narrative voice very well done first novel","2548":"i would actually give this book 3 1 2 stars if that were possible i feel it started out slow but then got interesting with the twists and turns of events and the development of characters several of whom were hard to figure out although i can understand some of the happenings that had to take place i cannot imagine having to make some of the decisions that were made","2549":"interesting but very slow it's all about character because there are no scene changes all the 'action' takes place in the middle of the ocean on that lifeboat our main character is a very complex woman and we find out more and more interesting things about her as the book progresses she's very well written","2550":"it was a quick read but never really captured me i didn't get the feelings of what it was like in the lifeboat the characters motivations weren't clear to me and there were plot points that went nowhere it was ok but not great","2551":"grace winter newly married and newly widowed survived the shipwreck of the empress alexandra only to find herself on trial for her life she and two other women are facing murder charges for events that transpired while they were adrift in a lifeboat on the open sea i think this novel could have been more engaging if we had learned more about the protagonist's life both after and before her experiences in the lifeboat i wanted to know more about her relationship with henry and how it evolved i wanted to know more about her relationship with her mother in law how did she receive her how did she treat her did she know her son was married how did she find out when did she find out i wanted to know more about what happened to her after the end of the trial how did she bring about the events that occurred i thought this was a fairly interesting story but toward the middle it dragged a bit i never really identified with grace and i wasn't quite sure what motivated her actions on the lifeboat it's apparent the narrator isn't being completely honest with us but is she honest with herself i think this would make a good book for a book group and would generate some good discussion about what would be justifiable in such extreme circumstances i think this had the potential to be a really great novel but it never pulled me in if you like an unreliable and manipulative narrator i recommend 'gillespie and i' by jane harris","2552":"started off with a promising plot but towards the end fell flat could have filled in some gaps but the character development was good overall","2553":"the lifeboat is enthralling i read it all in one sitting check this one out","2554":"i did not like this book at all i had read many rave reviews and heard only good things but i didn't agree i thought the book was boring and tedious the best part was how short it was so i didn't waste too much time","2555":"i did not finish this one it was a while back but i recall the pace was slow the details were strangely specific about certain aspects of life but sparse about others","2556":"liked it a lot i think of it as the 3rd in my recent lifeboat trilogy unbroken life of pi lifeboat it kind of fits between the other 2 unbroken is deadly real nonfict life of pi is fanciful fiction lifeboat is fict but more real than life of pi good for those interested in class struggle and the roles of men u0026amp women just as wwi was breaking","2557":"much of the lifeboat takes place in a lifeboat that much is obvious from the title and i was curious to see where the author would take this premise like the room in hell with no exit or the tropical island in lord of the flies this provides a perfect setting for thought experiments on human nature add to that adventure on the high seas mutiny on the bounty treasure island so many possibilities there and what else i was waiting to be happily surprised unfortunately i was disappointed the author did touch on philosophy briefly but then with a heavy hand as though applying spackle to drywall instead of using metaphor to convey meaning the main character and narrator simply told the reader her deep insights old recycled insights without much grounding in the few real events that were taking place in the story there were interspersed bits of adventure i could probably count them on the fingers of one had as i read each chapter i felt as though a checklist were being ticked off nothing brought up by the author was fully explored stylistically the book reads at a young adult level the structure is essentially linear with flashbacks thrown in to break up the monotony of a group of people sitting in a boat for two weeks passing the time by bickering i wanted to give this book two stars for trying but that would be unfair to other books that had actually earned their two stars i don't actively dislike this book i don't feel like it left me with anything to like or dislike about it i never felt engaged with any of the characters i never felt as though the story had direction i'm really not even sure how the author managed to fill 274 pages without really saying anything that stands out","2558":"generally a reoccurring theme of shipwrecked but some true insight as to the depth of character and resilience","2559":"an interesting premise for a story but a disappointing read for me i found none of the primary characters likeable as seen through grace's eyes and too many secondary characters got in the way of the story rather than adding to it also the hint of a mystery regarding activities on the ship before it sank was never really developed or resolved i was glad when i finally got to the end and could move on to something else","2560":"this is a very intriguing book i give great credit to charlotte rogan for her wonderful writing style and her ability to keep us captivated with a story that unfolds almost entirely on a small lifeboat in an area so confined that people must take turns sleeping her descriptions of the sea the characters and the boat create such empathy we are forced to ponder what we would do in a similar situation and to evaluate our own moral code in the last few chapters the story shifts from the boat to the court room and that is where the story weakens the conclusion leaves the reader with too many unanswered questions creating a feeling of frustration in spite of the weak ending however the book is definitely worthwhile and one that will create great discussion with friends","2561":"wow did this read fast all told i think it took me less than 3 hours start to finish it's definitely a page turner and a very interesting commentary on the effects of extreme duress on the human psyche a lot more action than i expected though it left a few loose ends that were more frustrating than thought provoking","2562":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here who or what are the survivors' true adversary the sea their maker each other or themselves the lifeboat is a thrilling yet desperate tale of survival after the sinking of a large ship set not long after the titanic's doomed voyage the reader is informed at the start of grace's survival and then the story travels back in time through the device of a journal to explain her survival the chapters' titles were particularly effective in marking time passing after mother nature strips away who or what are the survivors' true adversary the sea their maker each other or themselves the lifeboat is a thrilling yet desperate tale of survival after the sinking of a large ship set not long after the titanic's doomed voyage the reader is informed at the start of grace's survival and then the story travels back in time through the device of a journal to explain her survival the chapters' titles were particularly effective in marking time passing after mother nature strips away the veneers of social etiquette and beliefs how much of a person can actually be labelled 'a survivor' there is a superb quote relating to this that i will have to scour the book for i felt that the ending lacked the power of the rest of the novel but in a way it is fitting that grace's response to her psychiatrist's curiosity is mirrored by the reader if you are ready to be provoked into asking yourself some uncomfortable questions about your own ideas of humanity and identity i hope you will find this book as fascinating a read as i did more","2563":" an interesting book which i found reminiscent in terms of ideas anyway of no exit by jean paul sartre similar in ideas to who would you throw out of a hot air balloon to stop it from sinking i did not find it well written i read it quite fast though and perhaps it bears a second look i found the method of skipping between sections of time difficult grace would often remember things out of time and though that is in itself very real i found it confusing the character of grace was strongly drawn and indeed she is a strong character the women in general are very strong characters and i wonder if that was twenty first century feistiness or feminism coming to play i found the coincidence of grace's having been newly married above her station along with that of another female character an odd construct too much for me grace was an interesting voice and i found that i did not always believe her narrative and yet at other times she was brutally honest i could not understand some of the ways that the men failed in their challenge to stay alive i found it unbelievable although chivalrous i think the novel could have been longer with more descriptions of the cruise and more descriptions of the relationship between grace and her husband her husband was described by grace as being a very strong character and yet he could not stand up to his family and tell his mother the truth about this new bride he was an anathema many other characters were rushed over including grace's new mother in law and the lawyer reichmann who represented grace in court i think this novel needed more not less writing and if it had been longer it may have been a good read pleased to have read this but not a great fan","2564":"good book intriguing storyline but sort of lost it's steam towards the end had tons of potential but didn't live up to it","2565":"1914 two years after titanic 39 people in a lifeboat surprisingly engrossing","2566":"the lifeboat by charlotte rogan is a novel about a young woman named grace and her new husband henry who go on a boat that has an accident and have to abandon ship henry makes sure that grace is on a lifeboat which is where the story begins i really loved this book i kept picturing how i would react being out of food water and pretty soon hope while seeing other people die this is a page turner for sure but i was a bit disappointed with the ending that being said this is pretty much a must read in my opinion enjoy if you read this i'd love to know what you thought of the ending gerard's review","2567":"i really wanted to like this book and i did really like the story and the premise but somehow i found the character to stilted to tell it the language was just hard for me to read and kept me from getting into the story and identifying with the characters' predicament it seemed like a newspaper account that being said though it is a good story","2568":" the lifeboat takes place in 1914 just after the war has broken out and 2 years after the titanic disaster grace winter 22 and her husband henry board the empress alexandra which soon suffers a mysterious explosion when the story opens grace is now a widower and on trial for her life in an effort to help her lawyer properly defend her grace takes us through the 21 days she and the other members of the lifeboat struggled to survive and also offers us glimpses into her life with her husband this book had me hooked from the beginning honestly i didn't like the cold and calculating grace but in this case i don't really believe that we were ever meant to charlotte rogan presents us with a character who needs to be questioned as reliable we are only served other people's viewpoint of grace as grace herself repeats them the book is really a study of personalities and what motivates people into desperate actions in order to survive i have read tons of reviews that have stated that they didn't see the big twist at the end well it wasn't in bold capital letters but it is there it is subtle but when i closed the book it was a holy crap moment i look forward to seeing where charlotte rogan takes us next","2569":"downton abbey meets life of pi enjoyable read i was hoping for more detail about the psychological dilemmas on the boat","2570":"wonderful novel i loved reading this book as well as its depth and mystery i would like to read this author again","2571":"this story of people trapped together in the confines of a lifeboat as they await rescue raises interesting moral questions for the reader to consider what would you do to survive","2572":" this is a debut novel by author charlotte rogan it's the summer of 1914 twenty two year old grace winter is the narrator of the story she's a newlywed widow and on trial for murder the ocean liner carrying her and her husband sinks and she ends up on a lifeboat filled beyond capacity some must be eliminated in order for any to survive sounded good till i read the book the concept was great but i felt that there was no follow through i was very disappointed with it i couldn't empathise with any of the characters none of whom were well developed while it kept my interest i was waiting for something more to happen there was obviously some underlying stuff going on that was never made clear i wouldn't recommend this book","2573":"my favorite part of this read is the way the main protagonist grace hints at her true nature over the course of the story and reveals her truth most powerfully at the end the ending is a surprise and the story of survivors lost as sea as an examination of human nature is a page turner","2574":"not a bad tale recounted through the eyes of the narrator bit repetitive in parts","2575":"enjoyable book grace winter is portrayed as believably and imperfectly human i definitely recommend to someone looking for a quick read with some depth to it","2576":"i trudged through this book hoping for a moment of enjoyment i wanted to like this book it had such an interesting theme however the events were confusing there weren't any like able characters and there never seemed to be a point i was very happy to reach the end","2577":" what an incredible book by newcomer charlotte rogan the lifeboat works as a kind of sequel to the story of titanic even two the events take place in 1914 two years after the famous shipwreck at the brink of the first world war a ship the empress alexandra sets sale from london to new york for unknown reasons a malfunction caused by an unexpected explosion maybe an attack from a german ship floods the empress alexandre leaving its passengers in need to fight for their lives however only a few actually get to the undersized lifeboats the novel is cleverly narrated by one of the ship's passengers grace winter who is standing trail for the murder of one of the passengers of the lifeboat it is in this forensic background that the terrible ordeal of the passengers of the lifeboat is told in deep detail this serves a great essay on the intrinsic nature of humanity in life threatening situations hobbe's leviathan is honorably mentioned and the true place of morality in the context of self preservation in addition to be really interesting and though provoking the book is really well written i just could not put this down and read it in one gulp pardon the obvious metaphor all and all a book to remember","2578":"microcosm bring out true human nature","2579":"with a surprising theme for a debut novel and intelligently written the book is not only a suspenseful tale but also a study in human nature thoroughly enjoyed being in the author's capable hands","2580":"i don't think rogan wanted to write about a lifeboat per se i think she had a message she wanted to get out she wanted to make a comparison between behavior in a lifeboat in a life and death situation and ordinary life she wanted to talk about what humans do on the extremes of life and how that relates to normal life but starting to write she had to get through actually talking about time in the life boat before she could do what she wanted the discussion of life on that boat begins dry boring we know next to nothing about the characters including the narrator and even less that made me care about them any more than i want anyone in such a situation to make it out alive i eventually cared closer to the trial i thought she actual shone there when she could talk about how the first two thirds of the book impacted the main character i think she might have written a decent short story focusing only on part of the book with more limited references to the time on the life boat or a cut down narrative interspersed but as it was it took 200 pages before i cared and before a book can be regarded on the strength of the message of the more literary merits it has to have an enjoyable story engaging characters the basics i also think there were problems with the 'literary' aspects rogan tries to bring in literary techniques in the organization interspersing large sections or chapters of other detail into the main narrative this threw me for a loop because i really can't see the main character narrator employing anything but a straight forward narrative and that infidelity to the character is odd because it seemed to me that rogan's over fidelity to the framing device the narrator's account of her time on the life boat as an account for her lawyers and potentially for the trial was a reason why the account was boring why i didn't care about the characters","2581":"this wasn't what i was expecting at all but i did quite enjoy it and it was a quick read can't say i liked the main character of grace and still don't understand why she found not guilty but you can't begin to imagine what you yourself would do in that situation","2582":"i'd call it a good read left a few questions left unanswered but a page turner for me","2583":"such a simple story yet so complex everyone's book club should read this right now","2584":"put 39 people together in a very small area figure in past lives ambitions secrets combine with over the top conditions little food water space take away privacy future hopes loved ones what do you get interesting commentary on gender charisma power","2585":"short dry predictable","2586":" this book takes place in the summer of 1914 aboard an elegant ocean liner bound for america from england there is an explosion and this book is a harrowing story of survival for those lucky enough to have made it to a life raft lifeboat is beautifully written full of hard choices ambition death and endurance anyone who has spent time boating on the ocean out of site of land will recognize how small and helpless one is alone at sea the author paints a beautiful and horrifying picture in words of life adrift and what follows","2587":"best book of the year","2588":"this book is another gem i found on the staff patron recommended shelf at the library the story is about a group of people trying to survive a ship sinking as the title suggests but set in 1914 the tale is quite different than anything i had ever heard before and well worth the read","2589":"charlotte rogan takes your basic social studies moral dilemma group discussion and fleshes it out into a captivating story of a group of people lost at sea in an overcrowded lifeboat","2590":"an amazing account of the survival of the passengers on a small lifeboat set adrift for days in the early part of the 20th century and the aftermath that included a trial for the charge of murder in an interesting account the author shows the creation of alliances and the shifting of those same alliances as the passengers realize that not all can and will survive the event i find it simply amazing that a murder charge would even be considered after the rescue but amazingly it was","2591":"i was disappointed i was hoping this book had a more exciting survival type story however it was very basic no food no water to many people basic survival even the one instance of an up raising had the basic kill to survive story line it was an easy read just wanted more","2592":"this book was a very shallow view but quick read on an experience of people in a lifeboat that survived a sinking ship it was interesting to see the characters develop and i just couldn't stop reading because the story kept having flash backs and flash forwards that i wanted to understand what happened i wish the author had given us more detail shared more about the overall story i was left with many questions that will go unanswered but i enjoyed the adventure nonetheless","2593":" in 1014 when the ocean liner crossing the atlantic catches on fire the boat sinks and too many people are set adrift in a lifeboat the lifeboat is rescued after 22 days but during that time the one ship's crew member who had taken control was murdered the end of the book is the trial did grace the main character assist in the murder or not while the set up had great suspense and grace had a shady past i was not convinced that the lifeboat members were angry enough or capable of the murder while this was a good first effort by this author the murder mystery was too vague making the details of the trial murky","2594":"compelling easy read","2595":"creepy but strangely dull really unlikable irritating main character though i think that's the point","2596":"titanic u0026lt the lifeboat u0026lt life of pi this is a twist on the sinking ship survival story and it brings up an interesting moral dilemma how to decide if a few should die to save many and the topic of legal accountability for one's actions in a life or death situation while this was a page turning read and i enjoyed it in terms of overall impact life of pi left a much bigger impression on me","2597":"a very good book about the actions people take in life threatening situations a very interesting first book and look forward to her next book","2598":"i'm editing my review this novel gets better with thought one may expect this to simply be a tale of survival at sea which on one level it is but it stabs at much deeper issues throughout this is not a perfect book but it is entertaining and is worth some discussion good choice if you're looking for something to read","2599":"not a favorite book by any means interesting plot to follow the dynamics of life in a lifeboat after a ship wreak","2600":" a true page turner i enjoyed the style of writing the subject and setting i did feel on occasion there were rather far too many characters to keep tabs on but that said a very good read the narrative of the lifeboat survivors was well drawn and the interplay of characters fascinating the last section of the book was very different but equally as absorbing as the reader i felt i had been totally manipulated into believing grace however read it and i think you might be left with a similar feeling","2601":" it is 1914 and the empress alexandra is sinking grace the narrator of the story is put into a lifeboat with 38 other people unfortunately the boat is over capacity causing serious problems little water dwindling food major storms heat are making the occupants of the boat realize that something has to give like maybe a few survivors need to go overboard alliances are made a major power struggle develops and grace does everything she can do to live to see another day as grace writes in her journal and ultimately goes on trial it is up to the reader to determine her innocence this is a complex story of difficult choices survival and deceit not sure what i would have done if i were in the same situation even though the story was a little slow at times i thought it was beautifully written and very believable leaning towards 3 5 stars","2602":"i am very torn about my feelings on this book i think that it was a good first novel however i also felt that it was rushed to publication due to the titanic anniversary it had the makings of an excellent story but in my opinion needed tweaking firstly the blurb says it is about 'survival in an overcrowded lifeboat' to me the lifeboat never came across as overcrowded the survival aspect of it was lacking also secondly i didn't dislike the character of grace winters but and in my opinion this is worse i didn't care about her i also didn't mind her style of narrative but i never got the impression that she was in an enclosed space or that she was afraid finally the reader is never told the answers to certain questions such as why did they stay away from the other lifeboats the author needed more time to develop the characters and plot","2603":"this should have been a good book it's the story of a woman and her companions stranded on a lifeboat for several weeks after their ocean liner capsizes the book is set in the early 1900's but post titanic unfortunately i found the story to be somewhat tedious i couldn't keep the characters straight and didn't really even care to","2604":"couldn't find the time to finish but really wasn't inspired to pick it up to do so kinda dull","2605":"mixed feelings on this one many others have covered the plot so i won't go there the main character is an unlikable sort so i had a hard time getting into the plot there are many characters not to like though the book is to predated survivor it reminded me of later seasons of the television show where the players refuse to take on the leadership role because they know as time passes and life gets difficult we turn on our leaders even if they are not worthy of the animosity the book will have me pondering like many of these books do what i would do in the beginning save those in the water even though it will overtax the already overfilled cutter in the middle what do you do when you see the storm coming and know all won't survive and in the end when someone says the leader must be overthrown i remember discussions in religious school as a kid and after much discussing the right answer was to draw straw and let g d the fates or chance decide but this book hints at the question who prepares the straws overall not a wonderful book but one that would lead to some wonderful discussions on chance and predestination","2606":"i feel like maybe i'm not smart enough to get this book it was mainly boring and i kept waiting to figure it out but it didn't really happen good thing it's from the library","2607":" page turner and a good way to pass time potential for interesting character studies of grace sociopathic or self preservationist hannah feminist or merely a realist men and power mr hardie henry reichman grace's father few good men attempts at a philosophical reading mr sinclair a psychological reading dr cole lots of themes class gender position of women i just am not sure the writer managed to explore them all due to how much she was trying to cover but interesting to ponder over","2608":" what would you do if you found yourself in a lifeboat struggling to survive not just from the elements of nature but from the other passengers as well what of humanity the story begins with grace winter who is on trial for her life she recollects and narrates her ordeal the story does start off slow and cryptic but i found her story an interesting one i found it quietly addicting she doesn't so much as tell a story and play for an audience than simply recollecting her ordeal the pieces and details sort of fall into place and take shape along the way what was interesting was meeting the different passengers and seeing how they handled each situation there's a deacon an accountant a mother and her child among the characters one of the most interesting is hardie who is secretive shrewd and has knowledge of the sea hours go by days drift by and it becomes more obvious that immediate help is not forthcoming if ever inevitably desperation climbs hunger cries and resentment simmers to the passengers' humanity breaking point the story is broken into days and nights and other important events in which grace recalls in a plain and almost detached way oh henry grace's husband doesn't have an active presence in the story but he did have presence and i really wished there was more of him he would have added more dimension i thought it showed a lot about his character to go against his station and marry grace he chose love over his societal obligations grace who orchestrated their meet to help her own circumstances does end up caring for him genuinely as well i'm not convinced grace learned a lesson if she was meant to learn one she is who she is and part of surviving in life not just on a lifeboat is seeking opportunities in life this is especially true if she is to live a privileged one love and happiness may not be in the cards but there is contentment i can't help but feel many things were left unresolved what was henry's role in securing grace a place on the lifeboat was it luck or did he make the luck what of henry's telegraph what was in the box how is hardie and blake connected what is grace's future there is an air of mystery about grace that was present throughout the whole story she seemingly appears as a somber figure to tell her story and just as quietly leave it with the reader she doesn't try to win us over justify and reason her and the others' actions it's hard to get in her mind beyond what she chooses to share and that is what makes grace complex and interesting","2609":"very thought provoking but dark i didn't love the heroine but she had several traits i admired i found myself wishing for this story to be based on history like movie titanic the fiction was wound through history and fact i for some reason wanted that for this story as well i was surprised where the story took us not at all what i expected some things were wrapped up nicely and others never answered","2610":" the lifeboat was not a successful read i'm afraid it promised much but didn't seem to deliver i think the best way to sum it up is that it had a couple of chapters missing off the end i started with high expectation but struggled to carry on past the halfway mark what was in the chests brought on board at the start of the voyage what caused the explosion did henry survive did henry give hardie grace's jewels in payment for her place in the lifeboat if so why is that so shocking on a sinking ship with the memory of titanic fresh in everyone's mind grace actually strangled hardie and helped to throw him overboard it seems unrealistic that she should be acquitted the intimidation from ursula grant didn't seem to justify murder numerous men drawing straws and simply jumping overboard and drowning without struggling or holding on to the boat for a while doesn't seem likely there was a lack of description for both the characters and the situation they were in and this made it hard for the reader to imagine the situation or empathise with the characters there were probably many details of both character and plot which were in the author's mind but which were not transferred to the paper it was potentially a great idea and i look forward to charlotte's next book idea","2611":"very thought provoking and well written i look forward to seeing more books from this author and impressed that this is a debut novel going to a book group discussion on it this evening at my local public library","2612":"blah not a bad read but you can tell the writer struggled to wrap this story up into a memorable ending i for one will forget the lackluster ending and the rest of the experience before the week is through","2613":"fascinating and hard to put down","2614":"i am going to blog about this for booklist i think because it is a good book for somebody just not for me","2615":" with as many depths as the sea the lifeboat is a multifaceted jewel of a debut novel this is no flimsy story following the opportunistic marketing trend that seems to currently crowd the library book shelves the lifeboat stands alone and shatters the mold to create a worthy novel for those readers who crave a psychological realistic examination of the dark side of human nature with a fictional disaster as the perfect catalyst the reader will be drawn immediately to ms rogan's ability to capture the late edwardian era with her attention to research dialogue and description with only a few words the reader will be transported and captivated by the narrator grace winter who reminded this reviewer of the cunning and tragic lily bart from edith wharton's beautifully crafted house of mirth the characters were multidimensional and represented a cornucopia of human personalities and emotions from the passive weak heartened to the paranoid and detached and finally to the cunning and manipulative historical details were evenly dispensed throughout and added to the well constructed imagery a dose of ancient theories are sprinkled in that may surprise the potential reader and finally add a minute touch of religion but not overly preachy or intrusive everything falls into its own niche and equals to a perfect consistency in the end i was extremely surprised with my response when i reached the final page i honestly loved it and highly recommend the lifeboat even with the greatest literary works there were a few wanting or bothersome particulars that normally would cause me to deduct a star but the lifeboat supplied me with the major morsels i crave when i invest my time and attention in a historical fiction novel the book ultimately caused reflection stayed with me days after and illustrated sublime research pertaining to major and minute historical details that are usually frustratingly overlooked by new authors and that is what warrants 5 stars i look forward to reading more from ms rogan and hope she stays in the edwardian era or researches the victorian period for her next work her voice and talents can certainly carry either","2616":" the lifeboat charlotte rogan's debut literary fiction novel - is a very thought provoking story about a young woman who finds herself stranded in a lifeboat with several others set in 1914 the sinking of the titantic is still recent enough in everyone's minds for the survivors to realise that escaping the sinking ship is only the beginning but here instead of icy temperatures they have to contend with days lost at sea with seemingly little hope of being rescued with little food or water and the weight of the passengers proving to be too much for the leaking vessel what decisions must the survivors make and what alliances must they form in order to stay alive the lifeboat focuses on grace winter a 22 year old who becomes both a newly wed and a widow within the space of a few days grace is not painted as a flowery sweet character by any means - in fact as the novel progresses it becomes clear that she can be frighteningly manipulative her main aim in life seems to be to achieve her own desires regardless of the cost to others yet it is this very behaviour that will offer her the best chance of survival aboard the lifeboat and you can't help but find yourself wondering 'would i do the same ' this is a novel that focuses heavily on morality and in particular the suspension of accepted morality in order to survive the fact that grace seems particularly spoiled and self centred adds an extra dimension when you are forced to accept that a selfless caring attitude of others proves to be their undoing in some cases to say this is charlotte rogan's debut novel it is absolutely stunning the quality of the writing is simply excellent and the story is beautifully narrated originally i had planned to rate this with four stars but the book has stayed with me for days and i can't stop thinking about it therefore given the quality of the writing the fact that the story has a real simplicity but the range of emotions invoked is extremely complex and the effect the book has had on me both during my reading and since i finished it i must give this five stars this review was originally published on book bags and cat naps i received a copy of the book in exchange for my fair and honest review i did not receive any additional compensation all opinions are my own","2617":"i really enjoyed this book the layers and subtle social commentary were great but the pacing was amazing seriously the best laid out book i've read in a long time i was never bored or rushed i didn't realize how rare and important that was until i read this book","2618":"i took my time to read this one in a desperate situation when do we stop being polite let our basic instinct take over","2619":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i had some issues with this book i love the set up but i felt like i could never get a clear picture of any of the characters maybe this was meant to show their deceptive natures but it just felt like poor storytelling i mean i literally could not discern one voice from another and i couldn't form a mental picture of any of the people on the boat also the idea of throwing overboard the one guy who knows anything about sailing and navigation just seems absurd it felt like the woman who i had some issues with this book i love the set up but i felt like i could never get a clear picture of any of the characters maybe this was meant to show their deceptive natures but it just felt like poor storytelling i mean i literally could not discern one voice from another and i couldn't form a mental picture of any of the people on the boat also the idea of throwing overboard the one guy who knows anything about sailing and navigation just seems absurd it felt like the woman who orchestrated the murder had no real plan at all also there were at least 20 other people on this tiny boat who are never mentioned how is that possible they were just all silent as these decisions were being made about their fate overall i really can't imagine recommending this to anyone more","2620":"it's not that it's bad it just wasn't for me i think i have a hard time reading books that are so realistically sad because i am unable to suspend my own reactions however much in the vein of the road and lord of the flies it's a book about the darkness of mans heart and forces you to examine your own","2621":" actually 2 1 2 stars one reviewer wrote that she wanted to throw herself overboard after chapter 3 well i didn't feel quite that strongly about it but it was a bit of a slog for me i almost abandoned it which is rare for me but i hung in there and finished it was simply too uninteresting i didn't care one bit about any character because i found them all so shallow it could have been so much more as the premise is an interesting one but i found myself just wanting them to get the heck off the dang boat already maybe after reading unbroken i had the bar set too high","2622":"i read this book as a part of a reading group i have joined i'm sorry to say that i didn't enjoy it if i hadn't been reading it for the group i would have read about 1 3 of it and returned it to the library why number one the plot never grabbed me i'm not sure why but building suspense is an art and this book just didn't work for me i knew the main character would survive that is clear from the beginning but that isn't the problem that is a situation that is often a part of fiction writing somehow i just didn't care about what happened in the book number two the characters weren't memorable i didn't like the main character she was a miserably self focused survivor who had nothing to recommend her survival she could have been the first one into the ocean as far as i was concerned anything good about the book ms rogan raises some very interesting points about human nature survival personality types what is truth different perspectives etc but when i was done with the book i said huh just like another reviewer here said huh so what","2623":"i don't have energy in me to fully review this book it was all over the place and was narrated by one of the most unlikeable person i could imagine blah","2624":"this was an easy read but it didn't hold my attention i found my mind drifting off during reading it it wasn't terrible but it didn't have much memorable in it","2625":"the first half of this book is strong the writing is well done and the imagery evoked during those first chapters after the ship sank really set my heart pumping being in a shipwreck and more so deep water and hanging out with sea life rank fairly high on my list of fears let's just say that i can't watch my favorite movie from high school titanic i swear jack i'll never let go anymore without having a panic attack the second half sort of lost me i'm a fan of the unreliable narrator but i think this book really lost a star rating from me because i read it fairly soon after gillespie and i which really sets the bar for that type of book in my opinion when the trial began i couldn't stop comparing grace to harriet baxter and the ending just sort of fizzled from that point for me i do think this is an admirable debut though anybody who can write a decent book while raising triplets i don't care how old they are is amazing in my mind","2626":"well i didn't think the entire 274 pages would be about sitting on a plank in a lifeboat not my cup of tea and on to the next book","2627":"very fast u0026amp compelling read if a bit emotionally manipulative read in 1 5 days without really trying very similar to \"room\" by emma donoghue in its writing style so similar in fact i felt as if it had been ghost written by the same author like \"room\" we get one person's perspective in a stressful dangerous situation it felt a bit manipulative because facts are revealed late in the story after the reader has invested themselves hate that also similar to \"room\" the ending felt a bit disappointing it was like the author rushed over the climax u0026amp instead gave us a long prologue i don't want to get into it too much though have to save something for bookclub","2628":"this book didn't take me where i thought it could have simplistic writing and character development lacked continuity not much of a story unfortunately","2629":" interesting novel that takes place on a lifeboat in the north atlantic two years after the titanic disaster and as europe is bracing for wwi the empress alexandra is sinking in the north atlantic because of the problems with the titanic ocean liners no longer taker the northern route between europe u0026amp the us so the empress alexandra didn't hit an iceberg grace winters was able to get on a lifeboat but only after it was raised back to the deck to get her and mr hardie one of the crew members why your guess is as good as mine the lifeboat is full to the maximum they were expecting to be rescued in a short time period but were lost in the atlantic for 20 days a lot can happen in that period they run out of food and water people die others volunteer to jump overboard to help save the others they battle a storm once rescued grace and two other women are on trial for an act that happened on the lifeboat can one take the life of another if it saves the rest of the survivors is this self defense well written story about surviving and what our minds go through especially when malnourished while on the lifeboat we learn grace's history and how she married her husband in england without his well to do family's knowledge the last she saw him he was still on the ship she was hoping that somehow he was able to find another lifeboat how would she explain to his family that she is now mrs winters good story","2630":" mrs forester who had been so silent and watchful went mad overnight the lifeboat read was like being in the choppy sea without the means to navigate well at times i thought i understood and even empathized with the 39 passengers adrift and then there were the moments when i realized i didn't know where the narrator was taking me at times i had no empathy for anyone in that wretched boat even so i read at a breakneck pace wanting to be with the survivors all the way to the novel's conclusion","2631":" i really thought i was going to enjoy this book in the end i don't think i did there were parts that got my attention but stretches that were a bit off the main character is someone i started off liking and ended up just seeing her as weak and passive i thought this would get juicy it has to right with 39 people on a little boat there has to be anger drama crazy and the unthinkable nada it just fizzled right as they were asserting themselves and about to start really starting to starve they all of a sudden were rescued then the trial was an even bigger disappointment i don't know what she deserved i don't know what i expected to happen to make the ending interesting or memorable whatever it was it didn't happen","2632":"this ended up being a great big meh from me i kept thinking there was going to be some big twist or turn or life lesson etc the premise i thought was interesting a bunch of people in a lifeboat social experiment and all that and it sort of was but it just took so long and ultimately was pretty boring","2633":"lordy enough already that was way too long and predictable by the end i distinctly disliked the heroine and frankly everyone else on board excruciating choices of suicide murder or death by elements ugh sorry i read it i gave it 2 stars for no apparent reason just impressed anyone can write a book really","2634":"this book started out strong enough it had a true confessions of charlotte doyle vibe to it at the beginning which i liked while i was a little disappointed in the courtroom ending the parts that were on the boat offered some pretty disturbing psychological suspense that kept me turning the pages","2635":"really enjoyed the book but the ending not so much","2636":"well written and interesting first person perspective makes you think about human nature and psyche what is real or imagined what would you be willing to do if you were stuck in a lifeboat for 21 days","2637":" the novel is a diary written by grace winter about her three weeks on a lifeboat after the ocean vessel she was crossing on sank she is currently on trial for murder with two other passengers and those circumstances are explained throughout the writing is good and if you want to spend some time in introspection about what people do in times of crisis and madness this might be for you my big problem is that grace is unlikable and seems unreliable but nothing comes of it there's no big what the unreliable narrator was covering up moment in the end only a tiny anticlimactic revelation so her detailed yet confused recollections actually lead up to nothing more than you're currently reading except for hints that only the naive search for the whole story all in all i didn't care what happened to any of the characters and there were no amazing plot twists to make up for that","2638":"if you would like to read a book where you finish feeling creepy about the protagonist this is a good choice there is a lot to think about","2639":"started off well and a good premise for a story but so many strands left hanging vague characters disappointing","2640":"okay book a little slow hard to keep track of the characters","2641":"on trial for murder after spending 21 days adrift in a life boat grace tells her story how do you think would have done in the same situation","2642":"the premise is too many people in a life boat and what it brings out in human nature it reminded me of life of pi without the twist of creativity","2643":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i wasn't a big fan of this book i think the author missed the mark it seemed like a lot of interesting issues were brought up in the book but never resolved like what really caused the ship to go down was mr hardie involved in some sort of illegal operation pertaining to the gold on board the part in the book where the men picked straws to see who would jump overboard was not believable the 3 men that lost just hopped out of the boat to die no biggie i think the will to live and survive i wasn't a big fan of this book i think the author missed the mark it seemed like a lot of interesting issues were brought up in the book but never resolved like what really caused the ship to go down was mr hardie involved in some sort of illegal operation pertaining to the gold on board the part in the book where the men picked straws to see who would jump overboard was not believable the 3 men that lost just hopped out of the boat to die no biggie i think the will to live and survive would be much stronger and they would at least put up a little fight also i don't think that anyone would really be put on trial for murder after surviving in a lifeboat for 21 days i feel like it would be more anything goes to survive in those conditions i also wasn't a big fan of the main character grace she just wasn't that interesting anyway not a fan of the book it didn't help that i just finished reading unbroken by laura hillenbrand right before this that true story of survival in a life raft was much more entertaining more","2644":"with a boat load pardon the pun of excellent characters and their independent agendas this book could have been a best seller however i found myself skimming over paragraphs of superfluous dialogue the implausible narrator was one minute naive and next able to ascertain subtle dissention amongst the survivors the editor of this book should be put on a large fish hook and dragged out to sea how about these ideas what if henry actually had something to do with the theft of jewelry gold what if grace actually killed mary anne to keep her from voicing her theory on henry bribing hardie what if hardie u0026amp grace were part of a con scheme and somehow the shipwreck ruined that plan","2645":"great book always enjoy a book told in first person in this year of the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the titanic this book is set two years later in 1914 on the brink of war in europe it will make us all wonder what how we would face such a situation and what one does to save one's own life","2646":"best new fiction i've read in a very long time worthy in the tradition of virginia woolf whose sea voyage and seaside books are for me the best ever written","2647":"the only reason this was a page turner was because i was in a hurry to finish it and start another book very nice cover and the first paragraph was well crafted and got me interested but after the first couple of pages the story did not live up to it although 39 people on a lifeboat could have been a great story the characters were so sketchy i found myself wondering momentarily who the current person being tossed overboard was and then not caring even the main character was a not very compelling sociopath we're supposed to believe that that some fishy transaction had occurred shipboard but the narrator is a lying piece of work with the unlikely name of grace so who knows what really happened don't expect to find out oh and the wailing italian women really got on my nerves the writer seems to have taken a page from that horrid movie the titanic in regards to italian stereotypes i definitely would volunteer to go overboard on this one","2648":"an intriguing set up and well written but it left me curiously unmoved i am not sure i am clear on the events as they are reported by the narrator but what's worse is i don't really care that much i agree with a friend's review may be best utilized as the starting point for an excellent book club discussion","2649":"this is a quick read by a first time novelist she examines the thoughts and actions of a group of survivors of a ship sinking who are overloaded in a lifeboat we wonder what we might do if pushed to the brink","2650":"the beginning was quite suspenseful you find yourself wondering what secrets the narrator has besides the one she shared with us early on but unfortunately that was the only one i kept expecting things to take a dark twist but they didn't the book was definitely enjoyable but i think it could have been a bit more exciting","2651":"i found grace to be fascinating character by the end of the story the reader is left to decide if she is a murderer an opportunist a gold digger a shrewd manipulator or a victim the only thing you know for sure is that grace is a survivor","2652":"the theme of the lifeboat endlessly floating became a bit tiresome about mid way through the book i suppose that is the point though as we identify with the monotony of another day adrift for the survivors the group process and the psychology of the situation were insightfully written while not the page turner i was hoping for still worth a read","2653":"definitely nearly four stars i raced through this staying up late and wishing i didn't have to go to work so i could carry on reading it's a survival tale told by grace one of the 39 passengers on a lifeboat after the sinking of the 'empress alexandra' at the beginning of ww1 as time passes and the situation becomes more and more desperate the lines between 'right' and 'wrong' become blurred and life or death decisions are made grace is rescued but then finds herself on trial for murder it's taut and suspenseful and atmospheric and really made me think what i would do in the same dire situation i wasn't too keen on the ending hence the 3 instead of 4 stars which was rather anti climactic i felt that the action switched from the lifeboat to the prison courtroom too early i would have preferred to stay in the more gripping lifeboat storyline right up until the rescue","2654":" i am a titanic fan and terribly afraid of water i feel as though this book was written for me i really was engrossed in the story but at the end of the book i still had a lot of unanswered questions i'm ok if there are one or two unanswered questions but i have a lot of questions that had to be left open ended i'm not usually a fan of authors who write in this manner i tend to think of them as unpolished or just lazy regardless this was almost a 5 star book in my mind would like to read more by charlotte rogan","2655":"loved this story intriguing from the first few pages a fast bare story of survival and human nature","2656":"i thought the concept was very clever but the book was not i was just glad when i finished as i had to read it for a book club","2657":"this kept my interest but i expected it to be a little more exciting","2658":"a great premise and some interesting ethical dilemmas explored however i never was able to make a real emotional connection with any of the characters especially the main character grace in fact i really didn't like her i was expecting her to be the heroine the protagonist that we would be rooting for in the end however i didn't feel that way about any of the characters disappointing","2659":"i was sucked into this book and was amazed that so much detail could be written from a lifeboat it read a lot like room in that the author had to concentrate on details that would be overlooked if the setting was different interested read though i'm still at a loss as to why she ends up on trial in the first place the ending was a little hasty too","2660":" my expectations for is book were exceedingly surpassed thanks to rogan's sharp narrative and in depth analysis of man facing his most primitive fears in the face of almost certain death as grace was asked by her therapist to identify those on the lifeboat who most closely resemble significant players on her life i found myself recognizing those from my life in the unfortunate boat mates struggling with the sea themselves and each other rogan uses this piece of fiction to explore social issues women faced at the turn of the century as well as the psychological grapplings of the central protagonist","2661":"started out promising but got bogged down in legal language","2662":"the lifeboat was engagingly written and i could hardly put it down however it seemed to focus on the worst in people and ended in an unsatisfying way","2663":"i would give it a solid 2 5 to me this book was a titanic meets life of pi and stagecoach an elegant ocean liner suffers an explosion and yep just like the titanic there are not enough life boats henry winter secures a place for his new wife 22 year old grace winter on the life boat with 38 other passengers the life boat is over capacity and yep just like life of pi there is little food and water and the passengers become creative to survive for 21 days adrift on the ocean three weeks in a boat with a multitude of personalities yep just like stagecoach there is an awful lot of tension for the majority to live some must die i think parts of the story seemed to drag on and on i am not a fan of stories that start in the future and retell the past especially when they seem to go back and forth as much as this book did i did like rogan's writing and would be willing to try her next book","2664":"enjoyable gripping great descriptions of the despair fear struggle to survive and hopelessness and the powerlessness of women what would i have done to survive","2665":" i listened to the audio book version of this book it was okay it was a realistic portrait of some shipwreck survivors and their unpleasant time spent on a lifeboat awaiting rescue the voice actor was okay the desire to keep listening to this narrative consistently won out over the desire to stop listening it was a fine balance it was almost a tie the story moved along at its own pace and my mind didn't wander that much it was all pretty okay and now it's over and i will move on to something else charlotte rogan it was a time","2666":"this novel would be a good book club selection it is about shipwrecked individuals on a lifeboat and their need for survival catches you into the story immediately told by grace a complex and unforgettable character caught up in the struggle of who should live and who should die","2667":"this writing was so promising i only wish it had a more satisfying ending the storyline was exciting and the characters were intriguing but the ambiguous ending outweighed the novels strengths","2668":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i felt this novel moved really slowly trapped in an over capacity lifeboat for

who was the person that brought about the charges since they were at sea and so many other people died how would they know that the women killed mr hardie that section wasn't clearly written the epilogue was also a bit confusing since it didn't tell where grace was living or what she was doing with her life after the trial all of a sudden she was engaged to her lawyer and her deceased husband's mother wanted her to visit like the rest of the story it jumped around too much and didn't clearly lay out the story line meh i would skip it if i were you more","2669":"this is a hard book to forget it is a hard book to read it makes you think and feel there aren't any characters to like as they are all flawed in obvious ways this book would make a good book club selection as there would be many levels to debate","2670":"my book club read this one the narrator was an interesting point of discussion lots of questions are left unanswered we all enjoyed it though","2671":"i couldn't relate to the main character and there were just too many characters in general that were undeveloped there were some elements of intrigue but overall this was a snoozer not the worst thing i've read by far but nothing i'd recommend to others","2672":"i'm slowly dying trying to finish this book started strong and occasionally ramps up then let's me down all over again i'm basically too stubborn to quit reading save yourself","2673":" this debut novel by the talented charlotte rogan arrives at an opportune time given the solemn 100th anniversary of the sinking of the fabled titanic rogan invites us to imagine the sinking of a similar ocean liner two years later and her story begs the question of whether there are worse fates than sinking with the ship what if you instead ended up on a lifeboat with no rescue ship in sight and your nightmare had only just begun this is the fate of the enigmatic grace a 22 year old newlywed who finds herself adrift in the ocean with fellow survivors who gradually realize that their vessel is dangerously overcrowded the pacing of this novel is near perfect but be prepared for this is not the type of story in which all the loose ends are perfectly tied up at the conclusion rather the reader is left with the type of perplexing and controversial questions that book clubs thrive upon what is the meaning of justice and who is equipped to judge what actions are permissible in order to save yourself or others can morality exist in extreme circumstances in which survival trumps all other interests is grace an intelligent and trustworthy survivor and narrator or is she someone much darker and manipulative at heart 4 5 stars","2674":"cover|isbn 978 0 316 18590 5 grace winter 22 is both a newlywed and a widow she is also on trial for her lifein the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband henry across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion setting aside his own safety henry secures grace a place in a lifeboat in which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity for any to live some must die as the castaways battle the elements and each other grace recollects the unorthodox way she and henry met and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found will she pay any price to keep it the lifeboat is a page turning novel of hard choices and survival narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes my review the lifeboat is a page turning account of 21 days adrift in the atlantic ocean narrated by 22 year old grace winter the lifeboat is overloaded and some people are going to have to die jumping overboard to their deaths to drown in the sea asking for volunteers there is utter silence so straws are drawn and those 3 who choose the shortest must go overboard who could feel right about playing god in this way the personalities of the men and women in the lifeboat are as different as night and day there are those who are trouble makers those who are afraid of their own shadow those that feel 'they' must be in charge and those that vacillate between the combination of learning to go with the flow so as not to be centered out by anyone the emotions that these poor people go through are horrendous to say the least and the lack of food and water doesn't help but when your lips are swollen to twice their normal size split open and bleeding and your tongue so dried out and swollen that it's cracking and drinking the salty sea water is not an option for it would only worsen their condition in the end three of the woman including the quiet narrator grace winter are on trial for murder having been forced to make a decision at sea brought them to the point of out and out murder however what transpires in the courtroom will surprise you as a debut novel this was well written well thought out and left you feeling hopeful that you yourself are never put in the same position as these people found themselves charlotte rogan has written a compelling page turner that should not be missed","2675":" i really enjoyed this book a quick read that i completed in a weekend i liked that a lot questions were left unresolved in the narrative since the perspective of the main character was limited some of the questions that i was left with were what were the motives of mrs grant and hannah why did they feel that such a drastic measure was necessary against hardie was grace a survivor or con artist tracked down and tricked henry tried to support hardie until the tides turned then would not choose sides caused her defense lawyer to propose what was in the box was it payment in exchange for grace's passage was the main character moral or just motivated by the selfish will to live did not really fight for the life fo the little boy tried to convince marianne to sacrifice herself and how would i or anyone react in a similar siutation i tend to think that i am not hardy enough to survive in such a harsh environment and how much does the mental state effect the survival of the passengers why was it women characters that the author chose to lead a revolt why were the men so passive in their responses to the events even though they clearly disagreed with the decision this was my pick for my book club this month and i am throughly pleased that there are so many great questions for discussion and speculation","2676":"who picks a book about an explosion on a ship to read during an alaskan cruise oh yeah me i like being prepared i thought this was a good story about survival on the lifeboat some must die for others to live after they are rescued grace goes on trial for the death of one of the men on the lifeboat interesting aspect","2677":"the interaction of the characters was very interesting however it was one of those story's that could have been told in less pages","2678":"during the summer of 1914 the elegant ocean liner carrying grace and her husband across the atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion grace's husband secures her a spot on an overfilled lifeboat for any to live some must die a thought provoking novel about the choices one makes and how to live with oneself in the aftermath","2679":"pretty good perfect movie material","2680":" the premise of this book had so much potential a few years after the sinking of the tiantic the empress alexandra ship sinks although the reason for the sinking is never revealed but there are similarities too few lifeboats filled with too many people panic to get people on the boat but the similarities end there this a story about 39 people in a lifeboat over a few weeks and their story of survival or what they had to do to survive the book left me feeling like i didn't get the full story the book is written from grace winter's perspective a newly married woman who is on the empress alexandra returning to the us before the war there were so many additional plot lines regarding her husband and his family that i was hoping would be developed and weren't if you are interested in the dynamics of a group that is forced to be with each other then you might like this but for me not so much","2681":" the title sets the stage for this book it's 1914 and we're in the atlantic on the elegant ocean liner empress alexandra and it goes down a la titanic style we have 39 people in the lifeboat whose story we will follow the story is told by grace 22 a survivor who is on trial for events that happen on the lifeboat she recounts the struggle of the boat the trial and how she came to be on the ship in the first place the lifeboat turns into harrowing pretty quickly pile on the social conventions of that time the staunch separation between men and women and ingrained class structure and you have an intriguing tale on multiple levels grace our narrator is young smart and deceptive i didn't like her too much i have to say but i admired her ability to survive and report the events in an intuitive way she's just cunning and manipulative enough to be quite the slippery sue there's a lot going on here all of it exciting as we follow the struggle within the lifeboat as the days and nights start to buildup it's amazing the different ways people start to disintegrate both physically and mentally we're front stage for all of it that life is a relentless sliding down that eventually everyone finds himself in water up to his neck and that the ability to have such realizations is what distinguishes men from beasts","2682":" being honest i found this book hard going in places and wasn't really enthused to pick it up and continue reading which was a shame because i was so looking forward to reading it it was very well written but i just found the book a bit disappointing particularly the ending with several questions left unanswered satisfactorily i didn't warm to grace at all i thought she was manipulative and possibly deceitful some of her recollections were ambiguous and i don't believe she was such an innocent as we were led to think she clearly sought out to ensnare henry the wealthy banker whom she married after a brief courtship and who broke off his engagement to another to marry grace as to many of the other characters on the lifeboat there were 39 in the lifeboat initially i didn't know enough about most of them to form an opinion but i didn't really engage with any of them even the stronger characters like hardie mrs grant and hannah and found it hard to care whether any of them survived the tensions and divisions in the lifeboat were well described as were the suffering they endured for 21 days whilst waiting to be rescued it really was a case of survival of the strongest and those too weak or useless were deemed to be dispensable i've given the book 4 stars because overall the quality of the writing deserves it it just wasn't a book that i can say i particularly wholly enjoyed","2683":"a very interesting story set just after the titanic sank","2684":"similar to titanic but worse it shows the lengths people will go to survive you feel like you are in the boat with them to the point that you are asking yourself what would i have done in that situation","2685":"this is an incredible book it is hard to believe it is the author's first book i read it all in one day it is a book that will leave thinking about the moral implications long after you finish it","2686":"i found the historical fiction narrative interesting titanic but i am not quite sure i got this book with the lifeboat rescue turned courtroom drama i kept waiting for shocking legal turnabout as there seemed build up in that direction and then in the end no spoilers meh i would give it 3 1 2 stars","2687":"i really loved this book and am surprised that it does not have more five star ratings","2688":"this debut is a riveting thought provoking survival story the narrator grace is a complex and well written character the themes of power weakness sacrifice morality and dishonesty explored in this remarkable tale make the lifeboat the perfect book club novel","2689":"what a great story a look at human nature at its best and worst in horrendous circumstances i never comment on writing style because i know nothing about it but i really liked how this book was written","2690":"the lifeboat is an interesting look into humanity not necessarily the darker side but certainly not the light side","2691":"not horrible just not really what i was hoping for","2692":"books about lifeboats seem to appeal to me i loved life of pi and unbroken and this novel is no exception the story takes place two years after the sinking of the titanic when another ocean liner has wrecked in the atlantic grace finds herself in a crowded lifeboat with 37 other passengers plus a seaman named mr hardie hardie displays an obvious distaste for the likes of the over privileged survivors in the boat and takes some snide pleasure in rationing their supplies and directing them in various chores he's a distasteful and shady character but i had some difficulty in classifying him as an outright villain even as he forbids the others from hauling other survivors out of the water into their already over crowded lifeboat herein lies the crux of the story how far should we go to protect ourselves in a life and death situation like this do the usual laws of a civilized society apply or do the laws of nature such as survival of the fittest seem more appropriate or more accurately should a few be sacrificed in order to save the majority this question becomes more and more pressing as the days stretch into weeks and the characters become more contentious aligning themselves with competing factions one woman mrs grant begins to form alliances with some of the other women who outnumber the men and threatens mr hardie's authority the whole situation reminded me of william golding's lord of the flies--the mounting desperation as the hope of being rescued diminishes the uprising the savagery and the matter of fact manner in which the author describes a climactic unthinkable action by a group of human beings we know from the beginning that grace faces a court trial after being rescued but i can't possibly judge these characters for what it's worth the book is not particularly gruesome it's an adventure that will raise questions in your mind as to what you would have done in grace's position","2693":"very quick read the book deals with many issues life and death right and wrong good and evil it was an interesting story that kept me turning pages into the night","2694":"i registered a book at bookcrossing com http www bookcrossing com journal 11845939not as exciting as i thought it would be","2695":"a quick read thought i would love the book great idea and plot but didn't have much interest in the characters as i didn't find any of them all that interesting not enough depth to them it was thought provoking at times but not one to get your teeth into","2696":"a dazzling novel engaging plot elegant prose possibly the best first novel of the year","2697":" i didn't love this book i found the main character quite difficult to penetrate and so couldn't really empathise with her in fact i didn't much like her at all at first i thought she was a strong woman but her behaviour on the boat proved otherwise i found it frustrating that much of what happened on the boat was unexplained and felt as if the whole story had a bit of a veil over it that i couldn't quite see through i appreciate that this may have been intentional as perhaps this is how the main character survived but it didn't endear me to her or the book","2698":"wow such an amazing read well written really interesting concept and has you unable to put it down cannot recommend it enough","2699":" at first i was going to give this 3 stars but the more i thought about it the more i realized it was just okay the concept for this book was just so great and the execution was rather a let down for one thing i just didn't like any of the characters that much including grace one should at least feel something for the narrator right i also thought that considering they spend 21 days in a lifeboat there should be a bit more hardship going on she mentions their hunger and gaunt faces almost as if she's remarking on the weather the only time i was convinced that they were starving was when they tore apart birds and ate them raw blood dripping down their chins otherwise i didn't feel their hunger their fear their exhaustion their hopelessness and i certainly didn't see the motivation for the big bad thing that leads to their trial back in boston even though i understood what rogan was going for i just don't think she did a great job of explaining the circumstances and motivations enough for it to make sense i was especially disappointed because i'd heard such great things about this one oh well","2700":" i liked this book while i was reading it but felt somewhat neutral by the end the unreliable narrator protagonist grace winter is stranded on a lifeboat for 21 days with 38 other passengers from a ship that sinks during a trans atlantic voyage in 1914 at first she falls under the spell of the decisive controlling crew member who seizes command of the lifeboat but when others turn on him she does what she must to survive this summary does not give away any important plot elements because the prologue tells us that she and two others are about to stand trial for events that happened on the lifeboat i couldn't decide whether grace was a pragmatic survivor a whiny and self absorbed social climber or a bit of both and by the end i didn't really care although the first half of the book built up a good level of suspense too many descriptions of rough seas and too many enigmatic characters caused me to lose interest as i slogged on through to the end of the book","2701":"i can't seem to finish it","2702":"had i edited this book i would not have started book with chapter one giving away they were on trial in addition having read lots of nonfiction sailing tales from this era of the sea it is hard to believe cannibalism never came up","2703":"this is a fantastic novel that follows a group of people on a lifeboat after the sinking of an ocean liner in life threatening events people's true natures come out and it is interesting to follow the power struggles alliances and paranoia that naturally sets in","2704":"when the first chapter actually begins in the lifeboat you know you are starting a very fast entertaining read somewhere along the way i got tired of some of the simpering turn of the century behavior you know all the hysterical women fainting stuff mixed feelings on the ending one of those unreliable narrators that would be interesting to discuss good read","2705":"this book took me a while to finish much longer than it should have considering it was less than 300 pages i'm not sure if i attribute this to my busy summer schedule or the fact that the story didn't hold my interest as much as i thought it would the premise is intriguing enough in the prologue we learn that grace winter is on trial for murder along with two other women she then flashes back to the events that led up to her arrest it's summer 1914 and grace winter is adrift on a lifeboat in the atlantic after the ocean liner she was on sinks from an explosion grace was heading from england to america with her new husband to be introduced to his wealthy family when the ship sinks grace finds herself on a lifeboat with 38 other people who soon find out that even if the capacity placard reads 40 people the lifeboat is clearly much smaller and for any to live some must die so it sounds really intriguing especially as it takes place two years after the titanic sank and clearly ship builders were still cutting corners here's what i was expecting i was expecting better character development rogan states that there were initially 39 people on the lifeboat but i feel like we only get full descriptions of a handful of them and even those ones don't seem completely fleshed out at times i was alose expecting a more thrilling plot the story definitely dragged at times mostly in the middle and the ending felt very rushed i couldn't believe grace's characterization at times rogan seemed conflicted about what she wanted to stand for she marries a man to escape her circumstances and then on the lifeboat and during her subsequent trial she seems to alternate between being a strong character and one waiting for others to rescue her two other women on the boat ones who are tried for murder with her are made to be the villains to some degree but i sympathized more with them because they were actually trying to take charge grace really wasn't all that likeable rogan also left many of the little mystery plot points dangling and never fully resolved them which was frustrating 3 stars fro being a relatively entertaining look into the psychology of survival but so much more could have been done with the plot to make it a tighter story","2706":" it really was just ok i didn't dislike it but i did dislike the main character and her narration the story line itself had a lot of potential cruise line crash two years after titanic and the plight of the survivors in one of the lifeboats and how people react and change in different circumstances but the author never brought a feel of real life to it there were no descriptions of the numerous characters and i felt it hard to relate to it it's worth a read especially if you're on holiday and need something easy to spin through but i wouldn't go out of my way to do it","2707":"i thought it was going to be a mystery but just got long and tedious on the lifeboat thought it was not a great first novel","2708":" i read this book quickly and was fascinated by it i almost rated it 3 stars instead of 4 stars but then i realized that was because i was annoyed with the character of grace not because i didn't like the book itself i think grace was a sociopath i'm not sure what i think of mrs grant and hannah i would love to hear this same story from their perspectives or really from anyone else's perspective other than grace who in my opinion was completely untrustworthy riveting story of shipwreck survival all the same","2709":"wow i read this book in one day of course i was sitting on the beach most of that time really kept my attention i think the title explains right away what this book is about ethical issues surrounding those in a lifeboat for three weeks following the sinking of their ship towards the beginning of world war i","2710":" an interesting story in a titanic sort of way grace survives a shipwreck of an ocean liner which went down mid atlantic a few years after the titanic she is in a lifeboat with about 40 other people mostly women and a few men the lifeboat says it was made for 40 but it turns out that they skimped on the building materials and it can't quite hold 40 people if any are to survive some have to go i love stories like this which present epic moral and ethical questions and i always wonder which role would i be playing in this story the strong survivor who clings to life at all costs the weak link who falls prey to quick decline and early death the noble soul who volunteers to go overboard so that others can live a leader or a loser and then of course one wonders is it better to survive when others have to sacrifice themselves for you to continue or to die with a clean conscience i am always prone to consider the practical aspects too if someone is clearly dying is it wisdom or cruelty to throw them overboard so that other healthier people are given a greater chance to live this is a quick read and holds your attention but it seems like we've been here before","2711":"interesting made me think about how i would handle 3 weeks in a lifeboat","2712":" what would you do if you found yourself drifting in the middle of the atlantic in an overloaded lifeboat do you sit tight and let the lifeboat sink so everyone drowns do you sacrifice one or two to save the majority do you sacrifice your own life for the good of the others this is the dilemma faced by 39 survivors from the empress alexandra grace winter is one of those 39 and it is through her diary accounts that we learn how they come to resolve this terrible dilemma grace's diary is particularly unreliable resource not only because it is from her perspective but also because it is not always clear what her motives are and the more i read the more suspicious of her i became sadly there are a few dodgy bits condoning sex before marriage bizarre perspective of god but they are only passing references so i think it would come out at about l b1 cf http www goodreadingguide com lifeb for a fabulous and contrasting review that at a guess would push this book further into the l c1 category","2713":"promising start but never really developed any tension or suspense the court room trial at the end of the book was dissapointing and read like a different book","2714":"i am still thinking about the ending of this novel overall it was a very thoughtful look at human behavior while stuck on a lifeboat at sea for three weeks and the consequences of what it takes to survive","2715":"i was a little disappointed in the ending i would have liked a little more about the rescue","2716":"really not much to say didn't like the ending didn't like many things along the way","2717":" based on all the hyped rave reviews that i saw when this book first came out last year i expected intrigue a gripping compelling mystery a nail biting survival at sea etc well the prologue was intriguing and i was prepared to like the novel but it went nowhere if you are interested in a psychological study of human nature maybe this book is for you if you want to read an entertaining mystery story this isn't it there just isn't much of a story the characters are never fleshed out enough to know them i never felt concern for any of them which is strange due to the predicament the author has put them in and i didn't feel bad for them in bad times or happiness for them in good times when it was over it was just over the author never finishes up or fleshes out any of the questions that were raised throughout the novel i will say that there was one passage that i marked aristotle distinguished between 'memory' which he said even slow people are good at and 'recollection' at which clever people excel and she goes on from there with a little more explanation which i thought was interesting enough for further investigation reread and listened to audio for a library book club changed to 3","2718":"fast lpaced adventure on high seas some stilted language but believable confusing endings","2719":"interesting read sort of reminded me of cast away","2720":"on the eve of world war i the fictional empress alexandra sinks en route to america and newlywed grace winter finds herself widowed and stranded aboard a floundering over capacity lifeboat in the middle of the north atlantic when the novel opens she has survived weeks at sea only to find herself on trial for murder the circumstances of which are unknown to the reader told in a series of journal entries written by grace to aide in her defense charlotte rogan's engrossing debut novel is a fascinating study in human nature and what happens when people are pushed to their absolute limits as readers wonder who will survive who will be murdered who and what will be sacrifieced next how they will be rescued and perhaps more intriguing who is telling the truth the pages will turn themselves","2721":"highly recommended","2722":"spoiler alert started out strong as a tale of surviving and human nature then fizzled out great character development of the heroine then just ended the story abruptly with the conclusion of the court case would have liked to have followed her through her second marriage","2723":"this book has a nice quick pace and an interesting mostly broken up story structure there are a million story holes though the reader also doesn't really get to know any of the characters even the main character grace feels really vague the interest of the book is in the minutia of people surviving on a lifeboat post shipwreck anything else in the story about character feels tacked on","2724":"i approached this book with some trepidation assuming that it would address the queasy moral choices confronting a group of survivors afloat in a lifeboat but the universal praise for this freshman novelist caused me to put aside my initial bias rogan has written a confident first novel which opens with a surprise three women are awaiting trial for their alleged role in a murder at sea one of these women grace winter a 22 year old newlywed who last saw her husband as he hustled her onto the lifeboat after their luxury liner bound for new york sunk after a mysterious explosion narrates the tale of the 39 survivors on the overcrowded lifeboat in journals she prepared at the behest of her lawyer the lifeboat is filled with a variety of disaparate characters including mrs mccain a brusque spinster whose sister had survived the sinking of the titanic two year before a solemn deacon mr sinclair a scholar and natural born storyteller and three italian women who spoke no english the lifeboat is guided by john hardie an able seaman who as the days adrift at sea mount and provisions are depleted finds his authority questioned by ursula grant a solid enduring and forceful character rogan has written a provocative tale made more compelling by allowing the tale to unfold through the eyes of an unrealiable narrator","2725":" it is the summer of 1914 and you are grace winter you have recently married henry winter your families do not know about the marriage since you traveled to london and married secretly because there is danger from the impending war you and henry make a hasty retreat from london back to the united states on a ship called the empress alexandra while you are on the ocean liner there is an explosion that destroys the ship you escape without henry but with 38 others in lifeboat 14 this is the start of a perilous twenty one days adrift on the ocean your supplies dwindle and become scarce personalities clash and a power struggle ensues while all of you become weaker and you begin to lose faith in being rescued the story of the days in the lifeboat is not only about survival but about how people interact in life threatening situations grace is the narrator and through her retelling of the experience the reader can almost experience the fear the hunger and the thirst while feeling the boat rock back and forth on the waves kudos to charlotte rogan for a well done debut novel","2726":"i read 23% and just couldn't get into it","2727":"as the title suggests this is about people in a lifeboat after the ship they were in catches fire and sinks i am not sure what i really think about it much like the sea itself it sort of washed over me there are some moral dilemma within should you pick up others when you haven't enough food water is it ok to chuck people overboard to make the boat more stable i gave it three as i thought it was trying to be something it wasn't and it was all a bit beige to me","2728":" this is the fictional account of a survivor of a ship that sinks during a trans atlantic crossing much like the titanic there are not enough lifeboats and grace a young newleywed is put into an overcrowded lifeboat with 38 other people the book read quickly in the beginning but then it seemed to plod along a little to slowly for my liking i didn't like that there were several jabs taken at people with a belief in god it was interesting to think about how the mind must deteriorate as the body suffers from a lack of food and water and how 39 people with different backgrounds and opinions can be expected to get along in a small lifeboat","2729":" what a weird wild world to find yourself immersed in i liked the way the prose was created there was intricacy and nuance but i found myself quickly traveling through the pages strange combination of individuals who wouldn't be together if it weren't for such horrifying circumstances wouldn't we all want a hardie or a mrs grant i found myself thinking about the story line during the day and being so glad i wasn't trapped at sea i kept waiting to feel protective or angry or annoyed at grace really she was a grounded neutral for me quite a vessel for perspective i didn't get the sense that she was resigned to her fate but more dispassionately curious about what was going to be coming next so was that her true nature or perhaps it was all the lens for survival guess i'd have to re read it to ascertain that and no offense to the story or author but i don't anticipate that i'll just savor the story as i met it","2730":"awesome first novel i love the lifeboat moral quandaries she writes the nuances of non verbals extremely well i like the historical setting between the titanic and lusitania sinking you ask yourself the question of what would i do in similar circumstances and what would i be able to do as a woman without equal rights","2731":"i loved loved loved this book and didn't want it to end","2732":"very good tale of a group of ship passengers adrift in a lifeboat after the sinking of their ship shortly before ww i and hiw the occupants work together and against each other and decide who lives and dies","2733":"the lifeboat starts during the early days of wwi runaway newlyweds harry and grace are sailing back from england to new york when their ship the empress alexander sinks harry gets grace maybe by way of a bribe on one of the overcrowded lifeboats and for the next two weeks she and her fellow survivors are adrift on the atlantic in the dangerous little world of the lifeboat loyalties are made and broken small victories are negated by life threatening setbacks and self preservation takes an unbreakable hold at the start of the novel author charlotte rogan tells us that grace and two other women passengers from the lifeboat are in new york on trial for their lives the charge is murder the two women have pleaded self defense grace has pleaded not guilty the novel is the journal of events that graces' defense attorney has her write down in doing so she also tells the story of her young life thus far at 22 grace has gone from pampered daughter to jailbird in short order her dispassionate narrative is compelling but flawed the document is from her perspective and therefore slanted it is being written after the fact and she is recalling a time when the effects of malnutrition and dehydration bring her memory into question by the same token the testimonies of the other survivors and defendants carry the same caveats rogan has crafted a remarkable character in grace that's an especially good thing since the novel spends most of its time inside her head if grace didn't let an engagement to another woman impede her marrying harry to ensure a financially secure future how far will she go to survive when the water and food run out on the lifeboat is grace just young or is she calculating she worries as much about how her new in laws will receive her as she does about surviving the sinking thanks to rogan during the two weeks adrift the veneer of society cracks in fascinating ways the first ordered steps on the boat soon give way to power struggles illness thirst and paranoia graces' telling of the harrowing day to day of the passengers is also filled with interesting thoughts and questions about religion and morality despite the fact that from the start of the novel you know that grace has survived the shipwreck the lifeboat is extremely suspenseful how did charlotte rogan accomplish that the lifeboat is no potboiler cataloging shortages storms and deaths so what combination of impressive skills and magic has made it so complex so gripping i do not have a clue but whatever it was...thanks the lifeboat is one of my favorite reads so far this year","2734":"i really struggled through this found it boring and long winded and i really didn't care about any of the characters if you want a good story set on a lifeboat read life of pi this was a snooze","2735":" i am seesawing over 3 or 4 stars the writing is excellent and worthy of 4 full stars but the overall feeling was not so kind to our fellow man this reveals the dark side of humanity 39 people stranded in a very overcrowded lifeboat in 1914 after explosions never explained sank their ship to america from london instead of pulling together and working as a team rivalries form and no one knows whom to trust the reader is put into the mind and body of grace a young newlywed who seems to be innocent and quiet but turns out to be strong sly and able to play the game she would have done well in our modern day survivor as the days go by without rescue it becomes clear that some people will have to die so that others may live this is a good story and as i said at first superbly written but it just didn't leave me with a nice feeling it certainly does make one think however which for me is a characteristic of a great novel what would you do in grace's situation i like to think survivors would pull together more and buoy each other up but maybe being in the boat does make the instinct to survive only self serving","2736":"a wonderful book if you don't want a protagonist a satisfying story or a sensible ending this story told from one character's viewpoint showed no growth in that character and in fact proved that she had no defining character at all i'm sorry i wasted my vacation days on this one","2737":"lord of the flies meets the titanic","2738":"a very thoughtful and interesting first novel i'll be looking for more from her as time goes on","2739":"i loved the idea of this book and enjoyed it but for some reason i felt detached from all of the characters still it was a good read just not great","2740":"this is a must read the character development is excellent","2741":"i was surprised how much i liked this and a pretty amazing twist near the end","2742":" ugh this story had so much potential in a lord of the flies sort of way but it falls short it is slow and slightly numbing but you continue to read on because there are the ever so slightest indications that something big will happen and then it doesn't it definitely portrays an interesting perspective on the politics of survival and the natural tendency of human beings to become oppositional of one another but it's just not a mind blowing piece of literature i'd rather tell someone about this book than ask them to read it for themselves","2743":" if you read this book remember to breathe several times my eye zipped all the way down to the end of a chapter or jumped back over several details in the previous paragraph before i took in oxygen again book apnoea i've decided to call it the premise is simple 39 people are in a lifeboat that's practically everything you need to know except even the most casual reviewer should supply a bit more it's set in the year 1914 somewhere in the atlantic it's told retrospectively from the point of view of grace who survives the ordeal and is now standing trial for a terrible crime and from the start fatalities are not possible but inevitable the genius of this novel is the way it turns the lifeboat into a community a gossipy parish complete with factions and paranoia morality and pragmatism rub up against each other creating friction at first then overlapping then merging comparisons jump out at you it's like 'lord of the flies' with edwardian ladies it's like 'touching the void' - like 'the worst journey in the world' - like '127 hours' and it's true 'the lifeboat' occupies a genre space with these other works real and imagined it also reminded me of agatha christie's 'and then there were none' which i read at the age of 13 and which has given me the creeps ever since but charlotte rogan has something else to offer too the rare gift of articulate literary prose combined with thumping good storytelling after i finished this novel i felt like standing up and applauding more charlotte more","2744":"i enjoyed this story it was a quick read but was detailed and caught my attention it is interesting to try to imagine what it would be like in a situation like that what would i do in order to survive would i want to or would i sacrifice myself would i see it as a sacrifice or as a faster ending which was inevitable you never know what you would do until you are in that situation","2745":"kind of an odd book drama that turned out to be sort of a mystery","2746":"good writing but flat and not interesting characters women are caricatures and men either mean or deceitful","2747":"fantastic book the character development was what kept me turning the pages i hope someone in my bookclub picks this if only to have discussions i'm longing to have what a great first novel by this author","2748":"started promising then became bland","2749":" there was a little girlwho had a little curlright in the middle of her for'edand when she was goodshe was very very goodbut when she was badshe was horridand that my friends is the refrain that sums up the feelings i am having upon finishing the lifeboat to be honest the final part of the book was so disappointing that i am actually feeling angry too angry in fact to expend much energy in writing an eloquent review my thoughts the horrid unfinished themesunderdeveloped characters especially lacking in motivationsno resolution lots of unanswered questionslost momentum dry land dried up storythe good it is hard to remember the good after the disappointing ending engaging from the get gointeresting premisebeautifully and skillfully writtenenthralling at times prompted lots of interesting book club discussions3 stars 4 stars for parts i ii u0026amp iii 1 star for part iv","2750":"a good read got slow in areas","2751":"abandon lifeboat this book stinks why suffer through a book when there are so many others","2752":"i know i must just be missing something because everyone else loved this book it has rave reviews from respected authors all over it but after 100 pages i'm giving up this was not a page turner for me in fact it felt slow if you are telling the story of people hanging on for life after a shipwreck it seems hard to make it slow at 80 pages i really wanted to give up but i gave it one more try still 20 pages later it did not improve","2753":"titanic meets lord of the flies a page turner with a lot of potential but it didn't quite come together the way i hoped it would","2754":"excellent first novel as an aside one of my favorite things is discovering exceptional first novels they're among the best of the books i've reviewed compelling story of the human struggle beautifully written the characters are intriguing and the story is developed in such a subtle manner with hints of the drama to come that this reader's attention was entirely focused throughout the book the central character narrator grace shows depth and strength and a level of complexity that might be obscured by the constraints on a woman's potential during this era 1914 highly recommend great for a book group enough ethical ambiguities and mysteries surrounding the characters for interesting discussion","2755":"somewhere between 3 and 4 stars sometimes i really liked it but then i'd lose interest too many passive thoughts by the main character","2756":"yeah this book is my jam absolutely terrifying and psychologically complex historical fiction that i read in one evening because it was so gripping","2757":"i need a half star here grace the unreliable narrator tells the entire story of her weeks adrift in a overloaded under supplied life boat she also describes the marriage trap she sets for the affianced and unknowing henry the life boat strains under the weight of a few men and many women the violent ocean the scorching sun the eternal wind and the jockeying for control all contribute to the descent of the survivors the days on board were chronicled with great diligence the novel begins as she sits in her jail cell having been accused of god knows what grace is not the simple passive hapless survivor she tries to convince the reader she is she's sharp manipulative self deprecating and maybe self delusional maybe not i do not judge her being on a luxury cruiser with my husband searching a few greek islands and ending up in venice is not much of a comparison but my husband felt claustrophobic as we looked at the bountiful food and wondered how fresh it could be the instructions for an emergency drill were given in 6 or 7 languages english was the last the boat was too large to be docked in many of the harbors we took turns getting on small cutters late passengers had to hire private boats and get on while both were moving i wouldn't be surprised if the term cut throat derives from shipping rogan through grace introduces some interesting questions but somehow i felt that i was being taken advantage of by grace and therefore by rogan","2758":"just finished reading the advanced reading copy wow confronting and leaves you wondering what you would do if you were in the lifeboat over capacity ready to sink at any moment suggest you read in one or two sittings for the full impact journey the author takes you on so realistic you have to stop and remind yourself that it is fiction will be one of the great reads of 2012","2759":"read this for book club it tired to cover some interesting topics survival leadership the role of women but never seemed to come to a point on any of them it was all told through the point of view of the narrator whose perspective you couldn't entirely trust the other characters were all really one dimensional the sudden plot shift from the boat to the court room just left me even more ready to be done with the book","2760":"painfully painfully slow excruciatingly dull couldn't bring myself to finish it","2761":"too many themes feminism god moral decisions poverty marriage greed race i could go on choose a few decent threads and discard the others the book would have been better for it also too many characters i could not invest in them","2762":"interesting story of 40 survivals of a shipwreck in the 1920s told by a young bride there were layers to the protagonist but other characters lacked development and the ending left me uninspired","2763":"i loved this book the luxury liner the empress alexandra sinks and thirty nine people are in a lifeboat floating on the open ocean waiting for rescue this book is the story of one of the passengers of the lifeboat grace winter and her court trial after rescue what happened on the lifeboat that has grace and two of her fellow lifeboat passengers on trial for their lives this is where life gets real is it solely survival of the fittest could you do the greatest good for the greatest number if you were called upon the philosophical questions inherent in this book are enough to keep you thinking for days afterwards i picked the book up and didn't put it down until i finished it it was exceptional highly recommended","2764":"i thought the idea for the book was a good one i feel that the author could have wrapped things up better i'm glad grace the main character had a happy ending but you are still not entirely sure how many people from that lifeboat actually survived maybe if the epilogue had touched a little bit more on what happened to the other survivors i would have found the book to have a more complete ending","2765":"this is almost a short story based on its speed and format the language is simple and direct with the story moving forward at a great pace i finished in two days the story itself isn't too complex and the narrator's character is revealed slowly over the course of events leaving some ambiguity for the reader this book is unlikely to change your life but i found it more enjoyable and accessible than i had expected","2766":"very quick read","2767":"the premise of the lifeboat reminds me of one of those moral dilemmas that often come out when people are around a campfire or in a car together for too long imagine you're in a lifeboat with a priest a doctor a mother and it will sink unless you get rid of one person whom do you choose while the book ends up differently than that it does present the same underlying question are you a murderer if you survive at the cost of other lives set in the summer of 1914 the lifeboat is in part the diary of grace winter as she recalls the days following the sinking of the ocean liner upon which she and her brand new husband were passengers grace finds herself in a lifeboat along with 38 other passengers it quickly becomes clear that the boat while built for 40 was in fact not meant to hold more than 30 or so people as she writes from a prison cell where she awaits her trial and verdict for murdering one of the passengers she recounts the storms power struggles lives and deaths of the others aboard the small vessel interspersed with these chapters the reader learns about grace's husband and their elopement to london and a bit about grace's life before that beyond that background knowledge about grace charlotte rogan does not give the reader any insight beyond gossip shared by the other passengers into the lives of the others hoping for rescue and fighting for survival thus the reader is left to pass judgement and draw conclusions about the motives and justifications of the others i closed the lifeboat on its final page without answering many of the questions about those very judgements and conclusions which i suppose is where grace was left as well at its heart this is a story about survival it's about grace's survival on the lifeboat but it's also about our very own survival what would you do if your boat is over capacity and dangerously close to sinking and you see a child in the water close enough to reach and pull into your boat what would you do if you know the boat will sink unless someone gets off and the captain asks for volunteers what would you do if the most powerful person on the boat the very person who would help you survive told you to throw someone who endangered that survival overboard how far would you go to survive and once you had could you live with what you had done","2768":"hard to follow mundane","2769":"great cover synopsis sounded compelling but it was so boring i almost dnf'd it because i didn't know if i could suffer through until the end","2770":"pretty good written by dallas author good book club book","2771":"couldn't get into it didn't finish it","2772":"boy did i ever have to drag myself through this book the parts in the boat were quite boring only toward the end when the trial is taking place did it get interesting besides that nothing special could have been","2773":"i read this one for book club and it's a good thing i did i probably wouldn't have finished it otherwise that being said i think it was really an interesting piece for dissection and discussion for me this book was somewhat flawed it seems to have a feminist message to it yet at the same time it also seems subtly judgmental towards feminists this made for good discussion but i didn't really enjoy reading the book or find it well crafted it was a pretty short and quick read though and i would definitely recommend it for a book club choice","2774":"my review 'death off the lifeboat' can be read by clicking on the link here at 'word by word'","2775":"good not great read about people who are in a shipwreck and trapped on a lifeboat sort of a thought provoking what would you do if book","2776":"wow what a suspenseful novel rogan made you see feel and live aboard that lifeboat","2777":"this book was so close to deserving five stars from me as it was fascinating thrilling and i simply couldn't put it down finishing it within 24 hours of buying it the only thing that held it back from 5 stars was how incredibly frustrating it was i understand that the unreliability of the narrator was a plot device and its one i adore in movies but when it comes to books especially those set in a historical time i prefer all the ends to be neatly tied up i don't enjoy having a narrator who skips over things to preserve a good opinion or who muses on snatches of conversation between other passengers but never finds out the answers while to book was incredible and so psychologically real i was left with the same feeling i get when someone turns off a great movie right at the climax the last few chapters which i had expected to answer all the questions posed throughout the novel simply furthered the fact that grace is a most unreliable narrator whether through the effects of shock or in my opinion to manipulate the book was very real for in life you rarely get all the answers to philosophical psychological or practical questions but because life is like that i kinda like my books to tie up all the lose ends just for something different and that the lifeboat certainly did not do its now been a few weeks since i finished reading this and i am still thinking back on it almost daily so despite the frustration it was a truly brilliant book and i look forward to reading anything else rogan writes","2778":" more like 2 5 for solid writing but not my favorite for several reasons the passive voice of the narrator this sort of vanilla observational telling of dramatic events made the book a drag i didn't feel that any of the passengers were full fleshed out active characters the writing itself was good but i skimmed the last 50 pages because the monotony was getting to me the slowly paced disjointed way that the story was told in dribs and drabs and out of order just never gave me a clear picture of the boat accident the trial or who the main characters even were bummer it was a great premise","2779":"i had a difficult time putting this book down it is a fascinating look at the decisions one faces when in an overloaded lifeboat and no one comes to the rescue who lives or dies who makes that decision are there legal consequences to your decision once you are rescued all this the author looks through the thoughts and actions of grace our completely unreliable narrator","2780":"one of my favourite books from book club i was enjoying it so much that when i didn't finish in time i missed book club so as not to have any spoilers the whole time i didn't trust the narrator as she would do what needed to be done to put herself in a good place to survive after all she did set out to meet and marry another woman's fiance i didn't love the main character but her story was incredibly compelling worth the read","2781":"it's amazing what the mind and body can and cannot endure being stranded on a lifeboat it's all about strength of character that gets you through","2782":"this book i thought it would be good the writing style was wonderful and descriptive but at times too descriptive the book was interesting and it kept me reading but it wasn't a read in one setting type of book the issues discussed self preservation the line between life and death conscience in it are interesting but at the end it was quite forgettable","2783":"unique well written and definitely worth your time great premise and execution","2784":"excellent premise the sinking of a liner and the subsequent events in a small lifeboat it started really well lots of mysterious events and actions an unreliable narrator and then it just fizzled out too many loose ends no engaging characters u0026amp no real linkage between the then and now segments","2785":" about 1 4 of the book was fascinating the story starts with a court case then the story cuts to the beginning of a journey on a lifeboat after a ship capsizes then just as the reader believes the group is going to be saved the story skips to the court case the whole time the court case is going on i kept thinking that i missed how and who was saved from the lifeboat after the court case it goes back to the rescue from the lifeboat while the timeline might be considered artistic or suspenseful to some readers for me it took away from the story","2786":"muddled at rhe end but the oppressive feeling of being on a lifeboat with no food or water for days and days was well expressed questions remained for me at the end and not ones i liked having","2787":"no idea how this book made bestseller list excruciatingly slow","2788":"it was an okay first novel but less than great i found ms rogan's style to be too cold and clinical it never did pull me into the story","2789":"great book for book clubs action and ethical questions","2790":"while this is a pleasant period piece i didn't find it to be the must read that others have i would have liked more detail in some of the main characters' back stories and a more satisfying ending hard to get deeply invested in characters who are too thinly woven together","2791":"this book grabbed my attention for the start it was one of those with which i looked for opportunities to sit down with who would have thought the myopic claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat would produce such a story brilliant story telling","2792":"a review keeps appearing here which i did not write bizarre","2793":"i liked this book i thought it was somewhat haunting not that it was a scary story just that human nature can sometimes be scary the book left me wanting more but i'm not sure what more i want","2794":"interesting premise but confusing narrative jumped around so much i'm not sure how it ended have to agree with reviewer who said huh just huh","2795":"i know it is only january but so far 2014 has found me on a trail of book duds and the lifeboat by charlotte rogan can be added to the list of stinkers it's 1914 and a mysterious explosion on a luxury ocean liner results in a group of unlikely match ups all stuck in the lifeboat for several days their boat is overcrowded and they are hungry bored and desperate gossip runs rampant and alliances are quickly formed in order to survive some most die but who the concept in theory sounded awesome plus i loved the alfred hitchcock film of the same name same basic concept of a stranded lifeboad but totally different story at first i was intrigued i thought so much exciting and dramatic things would throw down but alas not much happens i found myself bored most of the time the drama or lack thereof dragged on and on the characters were not interesting and i feel like we didn't get to know most of them enough to feel attached the writing and details are bouncy and all over the place i feel like the writer kept changing her mind if she was writing a drama or a mystery and failed to make it a combo of both the saddest part is when the moments started to get tense and interesting things could have happened it just isn't quite enough and i was left wanting more i felt just as dull as the people in the lifeboat like i said story wise she hops all over the place and this adventure soon turns into a yawn worthy court room parade of lameness i could have cared less who was found guilty or innocent in any of the crimes involved i just wanted this book to be over so i could start a new one my advice for this book just go down with the ship don't hop on this lifeboat","2796":"an exquisitely written slowly peel the onion incremental creeper you can't help but admire but are liable to loathe unless a la lord of the flies the lottery leave u feeling warm u0026amp fuzzy","2797":"a transatlantic ocean liner has sunk and in an overcrowded lifeboat a group of survivors fight to stay alive a little reminiscent of lord of the flies and the perfect storm definitely an entertaining and engrossing read","2798":"despite the cliched straight out of a movie looking book cover the lifeboat is a quick read that catches you early and keeps you turning the page in anticipation i loved rogan's crafty unrolling of the narrative and finished the entire book on a delayed flight home from california read the lifeboat for something fast light and well written it's a touch of guernsey literary and potato peel society meets the realities of endless days and nights on a lifeboat","2799":"a fascinating read but don't try this book unless you're prepared to consider seriously whether you would be willing to kill to survive charlotte rogan places ordinary flawed people in extraordinary circumstances very few make honorable choices but what does honor mean in such a situation i wonder what i'd do","2800":"a lifeboat adrift in the atlantic with more passengers that is should hold the story takes place in the summer of 1914 a time when women were constrained by the laws and rules of cultures and society well written although you know that grace survives you learn how she discovers how to take advantage of situations in order to do so","2801":"i found it hard to care about the characters in this book the story never went anywhere","2802":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here started out reminding me of the dressmaker by kate alcott but turned into a completely different kind of book despite the similar situation a group of people on

the titanic's sinking on the cusp of wwi there is an explosion on an ocean liner called the empress alexandra and it sinks a just married young woman named grace is thrust aboard one of the last

struggle to survive and hope for rescue rescue does come though not before several people sacrifice themselves or are sacrificed to the sea post rescue grace and two other survivors mrs grant and hannah are put on trial for the murder of mr hardie there are a variety of people in the lifeboat all from different backgrounds with different worldviews and moral codes many have secrets that raise questions about the events during the ship's sinking was the radio working did distress calls in fact go out where was hardie before he appeared near the lifeboat what is his relationship to blake the sailor on the other lifeboat in sight and why won't hardie approach the other boat did henry strike some sort of deal with hardie is henry still alive most of these questions are not answered yet it doesn't feel like the book has loose ends quotes i wondered not for the first time if some of life's tragedy arose when people put themselves in situations they were not by nature suited for 24 the plaque perplexed all of us but it perplexed colonel marsh most of all for he was a man or order who expected not only a certain regimentation to the universe but also a gentleman's agreement about meaning among users of the english language 24 the bounds of a person's thinking quickly expand in such a situation 30 i thought of the ship the empress alexandra as i have often thought of god responsible for everything but out of sight and maybe annihilated splintered on the rocks of his own creation 31 which goes to show that admirable traits are often exactly the same as negative ones only expressed in a different way 66 we are faced with the here and now of our situation and that the irreversible and unknowable events that brought us to this time and place not only cease to be important they cease to matter at all mr sinclair 89 am i to be blamed for this we do not ask certain ideas to enter our heads and demand that others stay away i believe a person is accountable for his actions but not for the contents of his mind 139 the thing that preoccupied me that night was the notion that a person's choices are only rarely between right and wrong or between good and evil i saw very clearly that people were mostly faced with much murkier options and that there were no clear signposts marking the better path to take 150 what do ye know know about doing without ye who have always had everything poverty is a shipwreck it's very easy to live moral lives when all of yer baser needs are attended to hardie 178 still it is never a good idea to form any hard and fast opinions at nighttime and by the next morning much of my old equanimity had returned 215 if you take for granted that some or all shall die if no action is taken should an action be taken to save some mr reichmann 219 i was again choosing without really knowing the consequences of my choice 229 what is this a witch trial is the only way we can prove our innocence by drowning i replied that perhaps there was a more profound point to be made about innocence that perhaps a person could not be both alive and innocent hannah and grace 237 i do not think that the only way to show courage is to face the world alone 264 but hope had always seemed to me like a weak emotion a kind of pleading passivity or entrenched denial i determined not to become a victim of it 267 it was not the sea that was cruel but the people 271 one couldn't inhabit the knife edge cusp of possibility for long without stepping off on one side or the other 272 more","2803":"this is about a ship that sinks in the early 1900's and one lifeboat in particular grace is the main character she and 30 some others are in the lifeboat for three weeks she and two other women stand trial for murdering one of the other passengers in the lifeboat i had to read it for my church book club it was a fast read and i wanted to see how it turned out but i wouldn't necessarily tell anyone else to read it","2804":"sadly i didn't enjoy this as much as i wanted to i found the language to be quite more modern than the novel's time period i didn't enjoy the jumping around from past to present and place to place i found the story a little hard to follow i also found it hard to find sympathy for most of the characters i didn't like the ending i feel that ms rogan has great potential she just hasn't tapped into it yet i also couldn't stop picturing the movie while reading so maybe that distracted me","2805":" read this one for work it was interesting not a difficult book maybe 280 pages tops it took me probably four hours to read altogether i am not a huge fan of the unreliable narrator plot device and while i do like ambiguously good characters this particular main character was more strange than ambiguous i am leading a book discussion on this book and i'm not sure what i will have to say about it the lifeboat situation was set up well and the tragic circumstances were very believable the book itself kind of read like a cross between a nathaniel hawthorne novel the lord of the flies on the ocean in a lifeboat grace the main character sets up lots of interesting suppositions and scenarios but clarifies none at the beginning she seems sympathetic on the lifeboat she seems bipolar at the end she seems like a psychopath i just don't know it was disturbing enough that i'll probably be thinking of it for a while which is a good sign technically on the other hand i could not with honesty say that i liked it my overwhelming reaction upon finishing hmmmmm however writing wise ms rogan is to be commended on a very tightly written and plotted debut","2806":"i read the book in 5 hours this saturday afternoon and i am not a fast reader need i say more","2807":"an addictive 'balloon debate' book but was let down by the ending","2808":"lifeboat by charlotte rogan was certainly a different book the story took place in 1914 when the ship the empress alexandra had an explosion and the survivors had to take to lifeboats the narrator of the story is grace winter she had recently married when she got on the lifeboat the story took place almost entirely in the lifeboat i thought the story was interesting in the way in which it was told i think charlotte rogan is a good storyteller i think she will be an author to watch one thing i did not ever think about until i read this book during a trial before women had the right to vote the jury was all men","2809":"meh i had higher expectations for this book i found it was a bit choppy pardon the pun and did not always flow well character development was not the best either as i could not keep track of who was who etc i found the ending to be less then stellar actually not really ending at all i did press on to finish since i did pass the 50 page mark","2810":"a quick read but i did not make me want to read any longer happy to finish and somewhat predictable","2811":"grace winter is an unlikely protagonist for charlotte rogan's debut novel the lifeboat in the opening scene she is standing with her mouth open in the middle of a downpour when reprimanded by her lawyers she admits to being \"thirsty for rain and salt water for the whole boundless ocean of it \" afterward she is unable to restrain her laughter and is asked to eat her meal in the cloakroom of a restaurant while contemplating the pros and cons of an insanity defense one of the lawyers gives her a diary and asks her to recreate the twenty one days she spent in a crowded lifeboat during the summer of 1914 in a dispassionate voice grace tells her story happy to be sailing on the empress alexandra with her new husband henry grace looked forward to starting their new life together in new york when the ocean liner suffered a mysterious explosion henry secured a place for grace in a lifeboat which is over capacity throughout the book different characters comment on grace's life of privilege and the unusual circumstances that led to her inclusion on that crowded lifeboat grace however had humble beginnings enduring the trauma of her father's suicide and her mother's subsequent breakdown she lured wealthy banker henry winter away from his long term fiancee admitting that she felt no guilt in freeing \"him from both tradition and from emotional restraint\" and in the process securing her own future as the castaways battle the elements and each other it becomes evident that some must be sacrificed for the majority to survive a brewing power struggle between a ruthless experienced sailor and a persuasive matron further complicates the situation throughout the ordeal grace remains passive and is easily manipulated by the stronger characters once i started reading i couldn't put the novel down in spite of my ambivalence toward grace i was fascinated by the other personalities and how they reacted when pushed beyond their limits of endurance to be truthful i did not find any of the characters likeable i tend to agree with grace's description \"we were stripped of all decency i couldn't see there was anything good or noble left once food and shelter were taken away rogan found the germ of this story while reading one of her husband's old legal texts she was particularly intrigued by the account of two drowning sailors who came upon a plank that could only support one person after considering the question--is it murder for one of them to push the other off--charlotte rogan started writing the lifeboat","2812":" i've never liked this type of book even in school growing up we'd have exercises about who would live and who would die it wasn't until two days ago that i thought about my own life and realized that it may be because of a personal experience when i was 5 years old where they found me in the dead man's float that perhaps that is why it is so hard for me this book was not as absolutely awful horrible as i thought it would be i'm looking forward to visiting with my book club to see their thoughts on it","2813":"as i began reading this book i was immediately engrossed fantastic concept interesting characters unfortunately about a hundred pages from the end i was bored and it took great willpower to see it through to the end","2814":"i little morbid but it was interesting suspenseful wat to tell a story","2815":" this is one of those novels that is reminiscent of the titanic disaster but isn't about that event the events that transpire might actually be worse more dramatic than the titanic if that is possible it is a compelling story of survival that really makes you think what you would have done given the same situation as the title and description above indicate the ship the passengers are traveling aboard encounters some disaster and the passengers have to disembark aboard lifeboats these early events happen rather quickly at the beginning and you never get a complete sense as to what sort of disaster the ship encountered - i guess it didn't matter for the passengers who might not have really known what happened but as the reader i wanted to know more set just 2 years after the titanic's fateful journey it is reasonable that the characters crossing the atlantic might have drawn parallels to the titanic themselves once in the lifeboats the deterioration of humanity as time passes and the situation worsens is extremely palpable and believable it goes from a sense of not so bad we will be saved to udder desolation panic and the making of decisions that would never have happened under \"normal\" situations i thought the author did a wonderful job with the characters seeing their \"real\" selves come out as the situation worsens felt very believable there were only a few small aspects of characterization that were a miss for me the first was in grace's husband i think i was supposed to care a lot more that grace didn't know if he was safe in another lifeboat or not however the author didn't do enough in the few short passages early on where he was present to make me care at all about what happened to him i also never had the sense that there were ever thirty people in the lifeboat we only ever really hear about ten or so so i had a hard time gauging how severe the situation was based on the overcrowding i couldn't believe how the events that transpired became the fodder for a murder trial this isn't a spoiler it comes out in the first few pages of the novel a matter of life and death loss of rationality can lead to negative consequences it was interesting seeing how grace would navigate this tricky situation this was a novel that kept me on the edge of my seat and waiting the next time i could pick it back up the narrator was very effective at evoking the various characters personalities and emotionally charged conversations that ensued job well done this review was previously posted @ the maiden's court","2816":"thoroughly enjoyed this book what a page turner would make a wonderful movie","2817":"interesting book but lots of unanswered questions","2818":"this book wasn't bad but i didn't love it either much like the characters i just wanted off the lifeboat i thought it could have been set up better especially the trial all in all just okay","2819":"3 5 stars unexpected in some ways conventional in others lilted the structure of the plot and the time sense","2820":"i liked this book well enough i couldn't decide however what i really thought about the main character was she not that bright not educated or way smarter than anyone could imagine and could she have figured it all out and how to survive","2821":"thought provoking","2822":" put aside some time and make sure you won't be disturbed when you pick this debut novel up yes it's that good but not quite good enough to receive 5 thumbs from this reviewer and i'll explain why later in the review this book makes you think and re evaluate everything you think you would personally do when faced with a survival situation will you become someone you don't recognise or will you be able to stand firm in your moral and ethical beliefs this novel was a page turner from the very first it made me really think and wonder how i would react in this kind of dilemma and do i know myself as well as i think i do character development is so subtle in this book that it almost appears there is none at all given the changing nature of each of those featured within its pages the author does an outstanding job of making all them credible and believable the reader learns a little of their background and the events that brought them to the place the book is set in and sometimes this makes the course of action they choose to take just a little bit harder to understand as i said it makes you question your own motives in certain circumstances and certainly makes you gasp as you read the decisions these lifelike and 3 dimensional characters make the only downside to the characters was actually the main protagonist she is the narrator for the story and an unreliable one at that whether this is a deliberate action on the part of the author i'm not sure but if it was i'm not convinced that this was the right way to bring the story across the story itself is very well written and carefully told not only does it have all the elements required of a captivating survival story it is peppered with all the ingredients of a mystery novel intrigue lies misdirection motives and manipulation this brings me to the reason i couldn't give this novel a five thumbs rating - the ending after all the ups and downs the author takes the reader through in earlier pages the ending came across as being rather flat and lacklustre in my opinion i was expecting yet another twist which led to a conclusion to the book that was just as unexpected as other incidents but this was not the case and i felt cheated in some way about this i would highly recommend this book to lovers of all genres as there is something in it for every reader originally

winter's reflections as a survivor of the sinking of the empress alexndra grace survived the sinking of the ship by escaping in a lifeboat however the survivors of this lifeboat are not immediately rescued but are left adrift and alone for three weeks grace narrates in the form of a journal how the survivors break down which ultimately leads to murder the murder of the crew member hardie is what causes grace to be put on trial for murder along with two other women the journal grace is writing is originally intended a proof that grace was manipulated and mentally unstable and ultimately not responsible for her role in hardie's death the fact that the novel is conveyed through grace's words makes grace's motivations questionable because she obviously does not want to be sentenced to life overall i feel kind of ambivalent towards this book it was really slow to get into it wasn't until grace started narrating more of her trial information that i was more interested in the story that said grace wasn't really a likeable character and there were moments when i thought it was suspicious that we were hearing this all from grace's point of view and she had already demonstrated how manipulative that she could be in snagging or stalking her husband henry however i did find the concept of survival and how people are likely to turn on each other very interesting i liked how the two leaders on the lifeboat were presented and how their leadership styles were contrasted it was ultimately those leadership styles that lead to both hardie's and mrs grant's downfalls","2824":"started off great and i certainly had high expectations for the book it hooked me at the beginning for sure as long as the people were in the lifeboat i found it compelling but honestly the last 70 pages just didn't go anywhere no real resolve and no decisive ending the editor publishers should have sent the manuscript back and said rewrite the end with same intensity as the first two thirds and you've got a best seller","2825":"i was disappointed you barely get to know the characters i skimmed through most of the trial because it really didn't seem relevant i was very confused by the end and it was not what i expected but i may have had a different expectation based on what i thought it was about","2826":"beautiful book about a grim topic many wars going on but woman vs man is the big one and woman triumphs this is a one sit great read don't miss it","2827":" the premise of this story has been explored many times in many forms take a group of people who do not know one another put them in a life threatening situation and see what happens there are many characters to follow in the lifeboat and it takes a while to get to know them usually the reader has a backdrop of information for why people behave as they do but rogan deals with her little population in the context of how they reveal themselves by word and deed over three weeks what interested me most are the complexities of memory grace the narrator peels this memory back layer by layer as she relives the events preceding the shipwreck and the subsequent time spent in the boat i found myself drawn into her intense concentration as she tries to remember what actually happened at the end of the book i am still wondering about grace was she really what she seemed to be","2828":"this book could have been so good but there are too many holes and unanswered questions it builds like it is going to be a great mystery and that the mystery will be solved it's not you are left with more questions than answers disappointing","2829":"started out great and ended up meh still worth a read though especially since you can get through it in a day","2830":"i just finished this book and really found it gripping 39 people in a lifeboat after their ship sinks 2 years after the titanic the protagonist is a young woman who is writing the story from prison as she awaits trial for the murder of one of the other occupants of the boat","2831":"thhe book begins with the protagonist on trial for murder you simply have to keep reading to find out what happens was she guilty did she kill wantonly was it justifiable in the end i decided i didn't really know this person i felt a bit taken in by her","2832":"this showed up on a list of good 'book club' books i can see why it would provide some good material for discussion however it really isn't much of a story","2833":"fantastic book reading books like this always makes me wonder what sort of a 'survivor' i'd be in a situation like this would i go mad or would i be a strong leader or would i throw myself over the side to make room for others or would people throw me over i'll stay on dry land and hope to never find out excellent book","2834":"what a great book when you thought things couldnt get worse it did the story is well told keeps your interest","2835":"a really interesting premise that in the end i felt was not fully realized the writing is beautiful and engrossing but i felt a bit disappointed by the ending","2836":"it was ok struggled to finish","2837":"4 5 stars one of those rare books that is eloquently written really makes you think and is still a quick easy read really enjoyed it i'm curious to see if it gets turned into a movie it seems like it could easily translate","2838":"the more i read this book the more i disliked it the more i was disliking it the more i began to hate it and wishing i had not wasted time with it i'm sure a lot of people will probably like this or at least give it a decent review but as i kept reading i found that i cared very little about what happened to any of the people on the boat there was no suspense the scheming going on seemed a little uncalled for or unjustified i felt like the author was trying to make me admire the heroine of the book and then throw me for a loop by giving me doubts whether she was a bad person or not none of the characters were likable and that's not necessarily a bad thing but in this case it is bad when the reader can't see the motivation of some of the characters there is nothing to explain why some characters behaved the way they did the writing is choppy and once it hits the part where three of the survivors go to court it becomes a total snoozefest i was wishing this to be over so bad that instead of the two stars i was leaning to give it i came to really hate it by the end great concept not a very good execution of it","2839":"my review remains the same i enjoyed the audio version and it didn't feel as pontificating and i'm looking forward to a good book club grace is a character of many contradictions which makes her both human and a great talking point i'm reading this again actually listening to it this time for book club i first finished it in may 2012 hope it's a good discussion title for book club this is a really good read it'd be 4 5 stars the tale centers on the sinking of the fictional ocean liner the empress alexandra in 1914 just shortly after the sinking of the titanic and just before the start of world war ii it is told from the perspective of grace winter a social climber who just married into a wealthy american family and she explains what took place on the lifeboat she ended up on during the 21 days between the liner's sinking and their rescue it is a fascinating story about human nature and the need for survival i think it'd be a great book club discussion book the only reason i gave it 4 5 instead of 5 stars is that there is a bit too much philosophizing and pontificating i think much of that should have been left up to the reader rather than the author rather clumsily pointing us in the direction she'd prefer however it is a minor quibble and i quite enjoyed the story and the questions about the character of humanity that it presents","2840":"i was surprised how much i liked this book as many have said 39 people stranded on a lifeboat for 29 days we get some lord of the flies moments here for sure i worried when it started that it would have a similar fate to life of pi but it has it's own unique story to tell there's a lot going on here you think the protagonist is passive but she's not she is a survivor and somehow a likeable one is she likeable because it's told in the first person and we're meant to be manipulated or is she likeable because she knows herself and knows want is needed to survive and this is admirable there's a bit of both this is the type of thing that might disturb some readers but this ambiguity is what i found interesting","2841":"not as exciting as i thought it would be from the premise i didn't connect with the characters didn't love it the way i thought i would","2842":"there are actually two sides to this book the details of how a sunken ship's passengers survive on a lifeboat and a character study of the narrator i thought the story of what happened on the boat was very well done with the dynamics of all the passengers coming into play the narrator's background and motivations are a big part of the story and her actions as well and i felt like there were elements that were hinted at but not quite followed through on","2843":"i would probably give this 4 1 2 stars i could hardly put it down 38 people are put into a lifeboat as their boat is sinking from an explosion in the 1940's who will survive how will they survive what does it take for a person to be strong in horrendous circumstances","2844":"ok very unrealistic at parts but good to see the other side of what would happen if on a life boat any amount of time","2845":"the lifeboat makes one pause we take our lives for granted everyday but in the blink of an eye the whole world we know and love can come crashing down what would i have done in grace's situation we can speculate but one never knows until one is put into circumstances beyond our control what we might do or be capable of i can imagine myself reflecting on what was rather than what is being in denial asking over and over why me but why not me none of us are immune to circumstance some bring bad fortune upon themselves with choices made but many are thrown into events over which they have no control what would you do when these trials are thrust upon us our true nature comes through are we ready will we endure with grace or will our basest most selfish self exhibit its true nature i ask you who would you be which of the survivors would you be most like i shudder to think what such a trial would reveal about most of us","2846":"i kept waiting for some big reveal but the lifeboat was just flat i guess i didn't bond enough to the characters","2847":"wanted to jump overboard by day eight or nine slow moving and adrift what happened only the author knows and she never tells","2848":"solid summer read with a fascinating feminist center enjoyable though it didn't resonate a strongly as age of miracle","2849":"have read the reviews that say this is a well paced book i found it rather slow and was glad to finally finish good story but long winded","2850":"good story kept my interest not a good idea to read if you are about to embark on a cruise i'd reckon but overall a powerful story on human behavior and the will to survive","2851":"painful sitting in a boat and no one changes glad to be back on dry land","2852":"it has a good plot survival in a lifeboat after the ocean liner sinks how do 39 people survive together with different points of view little water and even less food the moral dilemma and practicality of survival would make for some interesting discussions but the book falls short a lot short","2853":"not my favorite book but a great pick for an interesting book club discussion","2854":"good first novel titanic meets life of pi quotable letme rather easy read story moves along","2855":"complete disappointment i think the author gave up about five minutes after thinking up the premise there's nothing likeable or thought provoking in this book if the survival situation provided isn't able to bring about anything provocative then i think that's the author's failing thinking about the situation without reading the book is a better use of your mind and time","2856":"what would you do that thought prevailed throughout the book","2857":"this book is very proper it could easily have been written in 1914 nice holiday read but not really my thing","2858":"this was an interesting book i'm not sure i was moved by it but the main character grace had a lot of layers to her it was interesting to see how her logic played out","2859":" the opening chapters of this novel seemed promising but ultimately the narrator and protagonist grace winters does not emerge as fully developed specifically her actions or lack thereof are not completely convincing or credible in the context of the plot since rogan portrays grace as ultimately indecisive and passive in nature her central role as a participant in a shockingly violent act aboard the lifeboat does not seem plausible i also did not find the narrative to be quite as engrossing as the reviews had lead me to believe","2860":"good book although it was slow at the beginning","2861":" the lifeboat is an interesting and thought provoking book about morality memory and the the large grey swaths that exist in both the narrator grace finds herself marooned on a lifeboat among 38 other people and the drama unfolds almost entirely in the confines of the small craft this book is not emotional there is death but little sadness there isn't much to hope for either you know from the beginning that grave survives because the book is told in the form of a diary grace writes after she is rescued unlike with most books i read you aren't rooting for love or connection or triumph over evil it's a subtly gripping story where you are trying to peer past an unreliable narrator's description to glimpse some kind of truth i really admire this book and i think it will stay with me for a long time","2862":"i am not sure why i decided to read this book it seemed pretty grim and it was i could not put it down it was sort of mutiny on the bounty with women","2863":"confined to a lifeboat this plot depends also on how they got there kinda lags at times","2864":"i had no problem with the writing rogan is an astute observer of the psyche and is able to convey it through her writing i just couldn't wait to get through it it held no appeal after getting through about half of it i am truly more of a non fiction reader and find truth to be far more interesting than fiction in many instances maybe that's why i really didn't care about any of the characters on the boat or what happened to them or maybe they were just not developed enough for me","2865":"it was just ok i hate books that leave loose ends and even though the writing is good it drags on places","2866":"dark moody eerie unreliable narrator great read","2867":"wow i really loved this book the events on the lifeboat were completely riveting from the initial interactions between characters to the way those interaction evolve as their circumstances and psychological states deteriorate moral questions arise paranoia sets in and you begin to wonder how closely grace's accounts of events actually reflect reality how much has she purposefully or subconsciously altered her memories so she can live with the consequences of her actions i also loved the little hints and glimpses into the future that were given to the readers usually that kind of information frustrates me while reading because for me it puts the brakes on the momentum the story is building in this case however it made my sense of dread and anxiety increased in a good way as i was reading i still can't decide if grace is a plucky survivor doing what needs to be done to survive the societal limitations placed upon her as well as the actual shipwreck itself or if she is actually a totally chilling and cold sociopath i absolutely love that i can't make up my mind","2868":" this was not an enjoyable read probably one of the worst survival stories i've ever come across the writing was hard to follow and filled with to many details that turned into dead ends that lead no where for example hardie's little secret box that just gets conveniently dropped over board into the ocean and then nothing more is explained about it also it was boring and tedious having to read all the thoughts that went on in graces mind she comes across as a cold hearted gold digger then there's the prison court scenes which to me were as boring and tedious as the lifeboat this is one of those books that i had to force myself to finish i'm giving it 2 stars only because i read it in it's entirety","2869":"you had me until the last 1 4 of the book fascinating premise but the technicalities of the legal perspective along with a first person narrative was a bit much for me","2870":"i have to agree with some reviews of this story to say although it was an interesting premise the ending failed to achieve a thrilling conclusion the main character began to pull us in when unravelling her tale of survival but then seemed to disappear","2871":"really could not put this book down it was so fast paced a very good read and one id recommend main character grace winter tells the tale of what happens to her and the 38 other occupants of the lifeboat she is on when the ship her and her new husband were on sinks after an explosion","2872":"i found this a fascinating and very compelling book i don't often have the urge to start re reading a book immediately upon finishing but this is one that would be good to read again knowing the outcome to pay less attention to what was happening and more to the characters' psychologies there are also some beautifully written passages","2873":" if read as a straight recount without the currently so fashionable unreliable narrative underpinning this is a relatively pedestrian affair which it seems to me is what has happened in the case of a few reviewers here judging by their reactions to the novel if however you accept from the beginning that grace is a manipulative if not almost certainly psychopathic narrator who has either twisted the meaning of or conveniently 'forgotten' parts of the story that do not suit her purpose and has ensured that the characters that might oppose her version of events have all 'perished at sea' then it is a tale full of wicked delights particularly insightful are the testimonies of witnesses at the trial which grace recounts as blatantly false where in fact they are the truth of the matter without her take on things armed with a lawyer who has fallen for the feminine charms that she will often use to weave a spell over men for her own means she calmly includes the conversations she has with others both before and after her time in the life boat having taken place as she recounts but their meaning skewed to her advantage through the emotional spin that she puts on them either making out that that other characters have the malice of their own underlying agendas or wilfully misconstruing events to make herself seem as though she was an unassertive bystander caught up in events beyond her control instead of being a chess master manipulating other pawns in the story and driven by her utter determination to survive a very quick enjoyable and rich read full of nuanced clues and levels i think i will read again just to get more of the subtle clues that the narrator author leaves littered through the book as to what the real truth might be enjoy","2874":"not a bad read but some things were left annoyingly vague","2875":"i read this book for book club it grabbed me right away and i finished fairly quickly towards the end it jumped around a bit and i found myself flipping back to previous pages to figure out what was going on i was disappointed by the ending i'm not really sure how i expected it to end but it didn't seem like closure maybe that was the whole point","2876":"grace winter is traveling to america to meet her new husband's family their ship suddenly starts blowing up and the passengers try to get into the lifeboats henry makes sure grace gets into one she along with the other people in the boat are hard pressed to keep it from being filled with water the story is well written but the plot is a little predictable although there are some surprises","2877":"the lifeboat by charlotte rogan is a well written albeit awkwardly structured treatise on nihilism told as a first person account of the aftermath of a transatlantic sinking in which 30 odd survivors end up in a lifeboat manned by a thuggish brute of a seaman who wastes no time in telling the others when it comes ye'll see for yerselves that there are too many people in the boat the protagonist is grace winter a young newlywed with unusual attitudes for a woman of 1914 she scoffs at her traditional christian upbringing and rejoices that by stealing her fiance from his original intended she has freed him from not only tradition but the emotional restraint of proper society it is the knowledge that she has severed henry from the conventions and social mores of society that erase any residue of guilt she may have felt in breaking up henry's prior respectable engagement the bulk of the novel is a collection of vignettes in which radical ideas like suicide euthanasia mercy killings and plain old murder are held up as the height of enlightenment for the greater good grace's well formed cynical outlook pervades the entire text right up to the very end in which she declares i have lost patience with the idea of an insignificant human being standing up above the rest of us whether he is called reverend of doctor or judge and shouts at us all about this thing or that as soon as someone starts to pontificate in this way i am apt to cut him off or leave the room or if this can't be done gracefully i simply arrange that sweet vapid smile on my face that was so useful during the trial but that so infuriates dr cole readers of the lifeboat may wish to take grace's advice from the start of this depressing novel","2878":"i enjoyed this book such a unique point of view seemed timely especially after the titanic anniversary","2879":" i re read the lifeboat in january this year as it was chosen for my book club i had initially read it for the first time in 2012 i really loved it the first time around and enjoyed it just as much the second time it got very mixed reviews at my book club and i don't think everyone was as eager as i was about it i loved the fact that grace winter was an unreliable narrator therefore we couldn't believe the majority of what she told us readers i came to the conclusion that she was an extremely manipulative deceitful and untrustworthy character i ended up questioning everything about her and everything she relayed about the experiences on the lifeboat the story poses moral questions as to what we would do if faced with a similar life or death situation how we would survive what or who we would be willing or unwilling to sacrifice how long we would stand by our moral standards when faced with circumstances of survival it contains an array of different and varied characters different backgrounds beliefs and ethical opinions but mrs grant without really having to outwardly do much was a great character in the book a quiet but very effective influence it's a very good debut well written engaging well thought out and was a very enjoyable re read","2880":" this book would easily have recieved 5 stars if as i believed it had contained cannabalism yes i'm a little strange basic story 22 year old grace winter newly married finds herself in an overcrowded lifeboat after the ship her husband and herself were on mysteriously sinks as tensions run high food runs low and the boat slowly starts to fill with water the survivors need to start making some tough decisions such as who will sacrifice themselves to save the lives of everyone else i think this book was remarkably well written i found grace to be a very sympathetic character and very believable what i didn't find believable was the lack of cannabalism i'm sorry it just really bothered me","2881":"an interesting premise but sadly not very well executed","2882":"don't bother","2883":"pretty anti climatic i didn't really enjoy it nor hate it enough to put it down","2884":"i found the lifeboat to be quite unique and fascinating it made me wonder how i would have reacted if faced with the same dilemmas as grace i look forward to more books from charlotte rogan","2885":"for whatever reason i found the last 75 pages a tough read felt like a 500 page book instead of one of only 280","2886":"loved the story but the end fell flat","2887":"a good summer read grace is returning to new york with her husband henry after eloping to london henry was affianced to another woman someone who delighted henry's wealthy family and henry has not had the courage to tell his family about grace yet when the ship the empress alexandra sinks grace is marooned in a lifeboat with an interesting collection of people led by one of the ship's sailors mr hardy the only one with any knowledge of sailing or of surviving in the middle of the ocean as the days pass the survivors claim their unique roles and their interactions claim the better part of the book the reader knows that grace survives because the book begins in the courtroom as she is accused of murder the narrative consists of grace's thoughts as a succession of the lifeboat's occupants disappear overboard and their survival becomes increasingly less likely","2888":"i was really disappointed in this book i saw the author speaking and couldn't wait to read it i had to force myself to finish it and the ending sucked","2889":"very thought provoking a simple linear and engaging story on its face there are more layers underlying the story than one can count she is an author to watch","2890":"story of survival after a luxury liner sinks this is a first novel rather ambitious timed to be published when everyone is talking about the anniversary of the sinking of the titanic i didn't connect with the protagonist so i didn't care whether she survived","2891":"believable especially for the time period good character development and the story presents a profound statement toward the moral dilemma between self survival vs humanitarian responsibility both from a self perspective and how the law might see it set in the early 1900's and not long after the titanic the story follows the struggling events in a lifeboat from the memory of one of the survivor's reflecting back while she's on trial this is the author's debut novel i would have given her 5 stars but i never felt the extreme of the survivor's situation during the catastrophic events the dialog was matter of fact but then maybe a survivor may look back with more reasoning and calm after a time and mere rationale the situation i will definitely keep this author on my radar","2892":"i thought this book sounded really interesting a different view of a disaster i'm sure it is well written and will appeal to lots of people i found it rather dull and none of the characters had any sort of appeal to me i was hoping it might have a spectacular ending rather than a fairly predictable one just not for me","2893":"eh it was ok i was hoping for some more tension and drama actually it felt a bit anticlimactic due to the narrative style i think","2894":"the book was ok the story of a lifeboat filled with survivors of a ship for approximately 2 weeks it was interesting as i read it but toward the end i just wanted to find out what happens and finish the book it wasn't great but wasn't bad just ok","2895":"i think i probably read this book too soon after seeing life of pi too many lifeboat stories back to back","2896":"loved this quick read great plot writing and look forward to seeing what ms rogan does next","2897":"probably 3 5 stars it is well written interesting plot and fascinating if you are into group dynamics and relationships with authority male and female under a compelling story the author is exploring those issues as well as tendencies to self interest and blindness toward our own motivations","2898":"won't be taking a cruise anytime soon a decent read but not of the can't put this book down variety worth throwing in your bag for wait time reading","2899":" i've had the pleasure of reading some darn good debut novels lately eowyn ivey's the snow child is a beautifully written tale set in alaska that's based on a russian fairy tale now comes a novel where again the setting plays a central role in the story set in the early 1900s the lifeboat is about a disaster on a large shipliner the empress alexandra grace's new husband henry takes her to one of the lifeboats and then she never sees him again she is in the boat with strangers and they quickly split up into two factions following mr hardie the seaman with a wealth of experience will require making the necessary difficult decisions for survival mrs grant on the other hand tries to keep some semblance of morality when all seems lost both sides must do what society would deem terrible things we discover very early on that grace survives but she's been arrested for her part in the lifeboat saga what did she do where does she go from here the lifeboat is a quick read and very easy to devour in one or two sittings it keeps you on the edge of your seat knowing that grace made it out but not knowing why she's on trial part psychological drama part thriller and part survival story rogan has delivered a tour de force first novel...and makes it look easy my rating 5this review on www 1776books blogspot comhttp 1776books blogspot com 2012 05","2900":"grace winter has just gotten married and goes to england with her new husband on their return their ship sinks her husband finds grace a place on a lifeboat which everyone quickly realizes is overfull some people will have to die in order for the rest to survive a classic problem the young adults like to think about with some great twists grace is now on trial for murder","2901":" i love to read a debut novel lifeboat is charlotte rogan's first novel andshe is close to my age i wanted to love the book i did love the premise luxury boat shipwreck 39 people on a lifeboat charlotte rogan's writing style is descriptive and the book is well written but the plot is so tedious in parts i did not think i would finish it but something would happen in the story that would jolt me back to completing the book i am happy i finished it it is not a terrible book but it was not what i had envisioned when i started the journey in the lifeboat","2902":" as i read through this book something rang a bell and made me wonder where i had heard this sort of thing before r v dudley and stephens 1884 is something like it but read the book first unless you are a criminal lawyer in which case i'm sorry for spoiling it for you so what would you do if you were a woman who is newly married and her husband has gone down with the ship on your voyage to a new life you have managed to scramble into one of the few lifeboats to escape the sinking ship and it already contains about twice as many people as it should and because of this it is shipping water with alarming regularity you are lucky enough to have an experienced sailor in charge of the boat and he seems to know what he is about you are a more than a bit uneasy when he instructs that you don't pick up any more people from the sea even if they are children but he is firm in his conviction that you will be picked up by one of the many passing ships in a day or so this doesn't happen and the dwindling supplies of food and water soon diminish a feeling emerges amongst the boat's occupants that unless more people die then no one will survive people are dying but as the boat is tossed about in the worsening weather it takes on water it seems that less people will equal more supplies and less water to sink the boat there is a 'reverse lottery' where the losers agree to sacrifice themselves and indeed they do but a group of stronger characters move to get rid of the sailor who is now exhausted injured and not making much sense would you join in with efforts to get rid of him or defend him this is the dilemma facing grace the lead character the book was fine while we had to think about this but the outcome isn't as interesting or satisfying the story fizzles out somewhat towards the end","2903":"rogan explores the basest characteristics of humanity in this hybrid survival story court case the reader is forced to think about what they would do in the same situations when it came down to survival both on the open sea and in the court room through narrator grace's somewhat confused and haphazard account of those days at sea rogan has not created characters you are going to like but maybe that's the point rogan has received all kinds of critical praise for her lost at sea story and while the questions of \"what would you do\" will resound with you even after the last page has been turned it pales in comparison to the creativity and prose of bestselling and now blockbuster life of pi the lifeboat lacks the unique spin i thought it would have to raise it to the top of the list of survival novels and if not for rogan's skill as a writer would really fall flat the plot even for a story where the ending is given in the first chapter we know grace makes it off the lifeboat because she's in court seems to have a rushed ending where the rest of the plot is paced out well between the two struggles for survival all the loose strings just tie themselves up in the end and the final end to grace's story was a little too perfect even with the open ending questions written in to force you to keep thinking ending aside the book is about the struggle and the way rogan parallels survival at sea to survival in the courtroom was excellent and really does force the reader to ask themselves what we as humans are willing to do to survive the natural animalistic world and the man made world of justice maybe not being quite as different as they seem there is also the subtle power struggle between men and women in the era of women's suffrage that adds another layer to the questions you'll be asking yourself what rogan has created here is more of an insight into the mind of a human struggling for survival the circumstances surrounding how grace ended up in the lifeboat are almost insignificant and to that end it works well however with such a high bar set for novels of this kind i think rogan has added an interesting read to the collection but she hasn't raised the standard","2904":"very quick read and offered a few moments of reflection and pondering about what would i do the book isn't so much a historical fiction piece which i expected but more about survival and the never ending debate over self perservance and helping others good discusion book if you are thinking of reading for a book club","2905":"one of the first books i have ever given up on after more than halfway through the book i just couldn't read if anymore just wasn't my style i guess","2906":" the small confines of a lifeboat provide a perfect setting for exploring how a group of survivors interact as their situation becomes increasingly perilous charlotte rogan's detailed descriptions transport the reader to the cold north atlantic where we witness power struggles over both insufficient supplies and the best course of action to effect a rescue when the group ultimately begins to debate the fitness of mr hardie the sailor who assumes the role of captain it reminded me of the caine mutiny a novel of world war ii and the decision to overthrow captain queeg","2907":"the story was very good and gripping but the ending disappointed because it fell a bit flat","2908":"the book is more psychological than action many of the questions are left unanswered and left to your imagination like the waves the small boat rode you are left off balance and uncertain the protagonist is not your usual damsel in distress which was very refreshing as well as realistic it's an intelligent read with a focus on human nature","2909":"i thought this was a great first novel the setting is 1914 the story begins with the protagonist on trial for a murder after surviving a harrowing ordeal on a lifeboat in the middle of the atlantic the book not only keeps you on the edge of your seat but also asks some very good questions about human nature i couldn't help but wonder how anyone could judge another person's behavior in a life or death situation the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five was there were a couple of anachronisms czar nicholas of russia had not fallen in fact the revolution wasn't until 1917 but there was mention of the demise of the russian czar secondly the author showed a much more advanced form of psychiatry than existed in 1914 in fact most people referred to psychiatrists as alienists at that time freudian psychiatry was in its infancy otherwise the book was quite good and definitely worth a read","2910":"did not finish just could not get into the story","2911":"fascinating story about the survivors of a shipwreck adrift on the ocean in a lifeboat that holds too many people it's certainly interesting but leaves some gaps in the story and unanswered questions although the author is not trying to give easy answers sometimes she needs to provide more context for grace's decisions last part of the book is draggy maybe unnecessary","2912":" this is a very dense very internalized account of how one woman survives a shipwreck that happens right before the start of wwi the book starts with the young protagonist grace winter on trial for murder along with two other of the handful of eventual survivors so there's never any question whether or not grace will live through her ordeal what is questionable is grave's pov which is calculating very self serving and very self deceiving she certainly isn't a likeable protagonist though she does have a gift for surviving whatever the situation on the surface this is a well researched account of what it's like to survive in an overcrowded lifeboat on an open sea for 21 days beneath that though it's an exploration of morality and how it's one of the first things to go when people are forced to abandon all signs of civilized behavior in order to survive now that i've had a few days to think about the book i realize i really hated grace but admired the author's gorgeous prose and willingness to tackle complex moral and ethical issues without any traces of false sentimentality or romanticism like her protagonist though i do think she fudged the crucial moment when grace makes a fatal decision as to whose side she will take in a struggle for power while still on the lifeboat still this is a rich and ambitious book one that underlines the fact that none of us can be truly sure just how far we'll go to survive until our back is up against the wall even if it's a figurative one of water","2913":"i agree completely with the opening comments of poingu","2914":"ending was very disappointing too many unanswered questions it reminded me of the lost finale which i didn't like either what was in the box why did hardy have to be killed how the hell did she manage to become engaged to her lawyer i don't recall reading about any romantic relationship","2915":"a good read none of the characters are particularly like able but the story is very engaging","2916":"this book should be studied the moral conflict alone is rich entertainment for the appetizer course but the complexity of the protagonist and how skilfully rogan brings her self deluded psyche into existence could keep conversation going long after dessert's been served","2917":"a very good read shows how much we base our lives on saving ourselves at the risk of abandoning others","2918":"at times the book was interesting but also slow at times this is one of the few books that once i have finished it i realize i do not really like or care for the narrator the premise was wonderful but i would rather have watched hitchcock's movie on a similar idea","2919":"wow i loved this book i didn't really know what to expect when i picked it up i thought it was really well written and it kept me turning the pages late into the night at the heart it is a survival story but it is also so much more than that it asks some hard questions like what would you really do in

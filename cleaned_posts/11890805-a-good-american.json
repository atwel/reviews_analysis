alex george is a good american this novel had me laughing out loud an near tears at times george understand how an immigrant can feel like an outsider as well as he understands the pride immigrants feel in becoming american citizens i can still hear my mother who immigrated here from italy in 1950 saying god bless america when she was proud of america and its innovations such as central air conditioning i read this book in two days george understands the sacrifices immigrant family members make for the good of the family and future generations i look forward to reading more by alex george","2":"funny contains such strange and wonderful people","3":"although this multigenerational saga has received muchrecognition i would consider it a good read not a great read","4":"it was just ok for me most in my book club liked it","5":"4 5 out of 5 stars at the dawn of the 20th century larger than life frederick and jette come to american from their homeland of germany under less than ideal circumstances but full of love for one another they build their family and their lives in this new corner of the world and their story with all its ups and downs is eventually told by their grandchild okay i know rich evocative family sagas are a dime a dozen but i'm still a sucker for them i loved reading every word of this one the characters were interesting multidimensional easy to take to heart one character whom i was afraid was going to be just a caricature was much deeper than that although i would have liked to have known more about him the storyline was engaging but best of all the prose was beautiful i delighted in the turns of phrase of the images conjured of the metaphors that were lovely but not over the top my only quibble with this novel is that there was too much foreshadowing for my taste but that is a relatively minor quibble still this is a book that i so much enjoyed reading that i didn't want it to end i was given a copy for review by the publisher for which i am very grateful","6":"i really enjoyed this book the characters are well developed the story has sad parts but the overall tone isn't depressing","7":"here's what i liked about the book it's interesting the way the author used someone very very short and someone very very big the dwarf lawyer andhis friend who would eventually die because he couldn't stop growing giantism i once read a book about a giant and how he died for same reasons it was titled 'the giant's house' by an author named 'mccracken' i gave this a four and that i think was generous i didn't find the book 'held' me in any way there wasn't anything that actually drove me back to the story i didn't cast aside my games at facebook serious freecell gardening outings it didn't interfere with my naps y'know it was so 'average' everyday meander about family life it held no surprises with the exception of the part when james got murdered which i dunno' why i use the word surprise that like everything else in the story was predictable had i had anything really good on the go i might have cast this aside but the audio version did make for a good companion while puttering around on the computer no a four is for 'really liked it' and i didn't like it all that much i'll give it a 3 i have few books i've given a 3 when i've got a book going that i consider a 3 i close it long before i'm through with it so if anybody's life depended on my finishing this book hey you got lucky","8":"this was a really wonderful immigrant story the characters were really well written the picture painted of small town missouri was painted lovingly and respectfully i love when i feel like i am become part of a family in a book and though i have no german heritage i feel i am part of the meisenheimer family","9":"interesting history wrll written good read","10":" i liked how this book started out the immigrant story where a young german couple run away to america to search for the american dream but then subsequent generations of this family and their antics got a little tiring and the writing changed as if it started off as the great american novel but then the ideas stopped coming by the end i was ambivalent about the entire family tree as the characters were flat and unidimensional perhaps when my kids start having kids i might be inspired to write an immigrant tale of our family's experience coming to america","11":"the beginning of this book deserves five stars the end deserves none in between it's a steady arc downward it's unfortunate because mr george can obviously write extremely well","12":"this had potential the author is a good writer in terms of diction and syntax and while the novel could be engaging george just doesn't weave a story that is consistently compelling it felt piecemeal leaned heavily on soap operatic devices and lacked emotional depth i also think the british author doesn't realize how many times the immigrant story has been done well in american literature the bar is high","13":"good story about a young german couple immigrating to the states it follows their family down through four generations but it seemed like you were reading their life in fast forward if i'm going a read about 4 generations of a family i'd like it be an epic novel on the plus side the story was engaging and the writing was excellent","14":" interesting enough story just not the type of book i enjoy too long some of the tragic deaths seemed out of place i'm also a stickler for precise timing details the surprise ending didn't seem to fit the original timeline i was listening to the audiobook which was a nice narration but i couldn't go back and check the details at the beginning of the book as i remembered them i finished it but i was disappointed in the ending after meandering through the lives of the characters for 85% of the book the last couple of chapters seemed choppy and rushed to tidy up the ending too much sadness throughout the story too just not my cup of tea","15":"what a wonderful read i read through 2 3 of the book in one day the characters the story the food the music i just loved it","16":"i liked this not a page turner but a wonderful story that you wanted to get back to each night at bedtime very good ending","17":"absolutely brilliant read it now","18":"a quirky engaging family saga set in missouri the story has some interesting twists and turns the characters are likable yet they evoke a sense of pity or sympathy a good read","19":"a very enjoyable read about family changes and life sometimes funny and other times very sad well written","20":"growing up most of the kids i knew were either first or second generation americans whose parents or grandparents immigrated to this country i was always fascinated by my grandmother's account of leaving italy her family and all she was familiar with to sail across the ocean to ellis island in order to start a new life of promise i was hooked right from page one of a good american it was like reading a diary of my own family this saga of the meisenheimer family leaving their home in germany for a better life frederick and the love of his life pregnant jette flee her mother's wrath and find themselves bound on a ship for new orleans instead of the originally planned new york they marry on board the ship then land and set out across the mid west finally casting roots in beatrice missouri the birth of the baby prevents them from venturing further as planned but beatrice is a good place one resided in by many germans and seems the right place to start their family what makes a good american shine is the storytelling pure and simple four generations of meisenheimers come to life through the eyes of james the grandson of frederick and jette the author alex george an immigrant himself uses james and many other wonderful characters to paint a compelling picture of what it like to transition from the old life in germany to a future in america it is an universal story of the dreams and struggles of those finding their way to our shores hoping for an improved life while wishing to maintain their heritage this is a story filled with love laughter conflicts happiness sadness secrets and life's hurts i couldn't help falling in love with all who bring the story to life the four generations of meisenheimers and those who surround them from the first who cautions frederick to just be a good american to a jazz playing trumpeter and other quirky players music is weaved throughout a character in itself and nicely done \"we cannot exist without our histories they are what define us \" states james late in the story it is a telling quote and one that defines the book as well a good american has all the makings for a good book group discussion and seems destined to be a word of mouth best seller a debut it is due to published february 7 2012 by amy einhorn books an imprint i respect get yourself on the list","21":" i was not crazy about this book i thought it was just okay i feel like it's a story that i have read and seen in movies so many times before i kept thinking as i read if this were about my own family i might find this interesting but as a work of fiction it just isn't good enough to make me really care i never felt particularly attached to any of the characters i was annoyed by the narrator james somehow knowing things about frederick he never could have known about and james's personal story was so depressing i kept waiting for something really good to happen to him and it never did","22":"amazing wonderfully written great character development tackles history in a wonderfully honest and poignant way keeps the story flowing easily and kept me hooked","23":"a family chronicle that begins with a young german couple settling in missouri by accident and moves forward through the lives of their children and grandchildren music is a current running through the generations giving shape to their lives while the author excels at showing how the children respond to or reject the values and preoccupations of their parents and nails some of the quirky details and observations chess playing jambalaya making raccoon befriending and suicide by bicycle he has a heavy hand when it comes to issues of race and love i found the parallels between key events too obvious and some of the twists and quirks too neat or predictable or exaggerated to be plausible sometimes charming but ultimately too much of a linear family story of marriages births and deaths that lacked true heft","24":"very good it is not often that a book surprises me like this one did","25":" truthfully i did not think the premise of this book to be very interesting the synopsis on the inside cover did not do this book justice even if it did i would have waited for the paper back or downloaded as an ibook at any rate i was in the midst of reading book two of the hunger games triology however i picked up a good american at bu0026amp n one evening because it had a well designed cover and the first page immediately swept me away the rest of the story was so engaging i ended up buying the book two hours later just so i can read it on the train home this is s funny intimate portrait life and undoubtedly one of the most compelling books i've read in the past five years i love the characters in this book as each one of them resonates with someone i know the way that life takes many twist and turns and you just never know what will happen the book also contain two of my favorite things in life music and food and the way alex george writes about both takes your breath away and makes me very very hungry it reminds us of the human capacity for hope and kindness and that is no easy feat","26":"i enjoyed reading this novel it's billed as an uplifting novel about the families we create and the places we call home that's probably a good description it's the story of a family over the course of multiple generations from the perspective of one grandson son individual he tells of the origins of the family in america and how profoundly american the family becomes over time it's touching and well written nothing happens that's actually earth shattering or overwhelming no plot twists that send the reader into an uproar however the full roar of life as the generations move along is a very enjoyable read i might also add that it's very well written with an excellent choice of vocabulary alex george's descriptions are often laugh out loud perfect to describe a loved one a delightful book that's pretty low key but extremely readable","27":"this is the best book i've read in some time i could not put it down i think it has a hook for everyone it is simply a joy to read","28":" i received this audiobook for review and even though i was unfamiliar with the title i was eager to try out a new historical fiction of course now i'm seeing this book advertised everywhere a good american is an entertaining read about the meisenheimer family and their ups and downs across generations the book takes on the idea of what it means to be an american through the immigrant family's example it didn't take long for me to be hooked on the story and i finished the audio in no time the saga begins in 1904 when frederick and jette meisenheimer fall in love in hanover germany when jette becomes pregnant it shames her mother and the couple hastily leaves for america they finally settle in beatrice missouri home to other german immigrants with their new son joseph there's a language cultural and financial barrier to overcome as well as the stress of being new parents frederick and jette are challenged to build a new life in america from scratch for their family the couple's grandson james narrates their tale though times change throughout the book one thing that is consistent is that food and music are always present in the meisenheimer's lives the tradition starts with gifted singer frederick and the talent is passed down all the way to their grandsons the family also appreciates all kinds of music and at the different incarnations of their family run dining establishment you can see the styles of music as well as menu options change with the times each generation of the family has an interesting story to tell and even though i would get attached to the story i was listening to i was quickly caught up in the next generation's journey in addition to the meisenheimer family there are an entertaining cast of side characters woven into the story humor also keeps the book from ever becoming too heavy though the book loses a little steam for me towards the end there's an interesting twist that pulled me back in gibson frazier narrates the audio and his storytelling abilities complement the book well his reading drew me into the story and he conveys the appropriate emotion and energy throughout he uses different dialects for the characters but it is not overdone i'm sure the book is great too but i'm glad that i got the chance to listen to the audio i started in on a new audio right after but found myself missing listening to a good american i think this book will appeal to those that enjoy historical fiction or books like water for elephants or the help it's a really interesting look at american history as well as a wonderful family drama and it would make an excellent book club choice","29":"this was a palate cleanser for me as the other book i was reading got way too heavy and brutal and what a delightful palate cleanser it was it was a love story to america to the immigrant experience following one family through multiple generations and tying it all up in a bow in the end i adored it and related to it","30":"tells the story of multiple generations of the meisenheimer family from their immigration to america to their great grandchildren we spend time with many characters getting to know their thoughts and everyday experiences i do love me a good multi generational family epic highly recommended","31":"this was a classic story of family life and the american dream told simply with humor and sorrow a perfect summer read for all of us immigrants this could as well been anyone's story","32":"really enjoyed this one took me back in time quick read","33":"loved this book a multi generational immersion into the american life layered with song and music and the impact of political world events as well as humor and surprise twists in the family's lives made for time well spent with this family's journey","34":" george has written a enjoyable family saga about a german immigrant couple who arrives in new orleans in 1905 and settles because it happens to be where they are when their baby is born in tiny beatrice missouri george traces the family all the way up to the present so no age or incident gets intense attention but youdo get a good feel for the characters and the pacing is such that you want to keep reading while the book doesn't rise to the level of a classic it's a really good curl up on the sofa kind of read","35":"this book tells the story of 3 generations of one family beginning with the couple who immigrated to the u s prior to wwi i really enjoyed this generational story told from the point of view of one person who doesn't quite know everything that he thinks he knows about his family","36":"a good multigenerational story about imigrating to america enjoyed the midwest setting and history had many moods from sad to funny","37":"if you know small midwestern towns then this will be a nice comforting read a bit of schmaltz at times but that's not always a bad thing it struck me as two books welded together first the story of the grandparents who emigrated from hanover and settled at random in a missouri town second the story of the narrator's coming of age in the 1950s this second bit reminded me of garrison keillor's lake wobegon stories","38":"i can't say enough good things about this story it's more than just a book and i'm sad that its over","39":"great people story deep and lovely characters","40":"good old fashioned storytelling makes this novel a delight","41":"i liked this book it didn't really go deeply into plot but it was a fun read with likable characters","42":" http owltellyouaboutit com 2012 03 11 a good american when i began this book i knew i was going to like it maybe even love it there was just something about the way everything was presented i loved the narrator's voice by which i mean the character's voice within the book i did also enjoy the actual audiobook narrator i do think the cover is slightly misleading it left me with the assumption that there would be a lot of jazz involved in the story and there really wasn't it's very pretty though on the surface this book chronicles three generations of the meisenheimer family from friederich and jetta's immigration to the u s to the trials of their grandchild james as he tries to find his place among his family his town and in the world while there are some pretty improbable occurances in the book i never really questioned it i just laughed at the ridiculous and kept listening i found james's dry humor about the shenanigans his family seemed to find themselves in a good addition to the story had the events been told in a different voice or perspective i'm not sure they would have had the same effect i did have a moment toward the end where i felt a little unsure of how i felt about everything after a particularly jarring twist in the plot it took me a few days of thinking to decide that i really did like this book i think some of the characters felt a little mysterious i think it's mostly because james is telling the story and his personality is more introspective than anything for instance he doesn't dig into the personalities of his younger brothers very much they felt more like surface characters and his older brother was just a mystery to me i found this interesting mostly because it seemed like there was so much insight into what his granparents and parents were thinking it felt a little inconsistent that said his grandparents and parents and james himself seemed to be very well developed i thought alex george's writing style was perfect it really fit the story and james's personality it just felt like james was writing the story which is kind of important in this book rather than someone writing it for him i think that feeling also speaks to the depth of his character gibson frazier did a spectacular job narrating this audiobook he read with pefect sincerety and his voice became the voice of james's voice that's something i love in audiobooks it's what i hope for every time i begin a new one he didn't really change up character voices but i don't think that would have been appropriate for this story since it was told from james's point of view he delivered with perfect natural flow while still enunciating the only teensy little thing that bothered me was the way he pronounced culinary like cyulinary have i been pronouncing that wrong my whole life or is it just one of those words that people say differently in different places like pecan or something i think this book is definitely worth picking up i can understand why it's on the indie next list i don't think it particulary appeals to a certain group or anything though i would say if the synopsis sounds interesting to you or this review draws you to it pick it up this book was provided by the publisher for review i did not receive any payment in exchange for the review nor was i obligated to write a positive one all opinions expressed here are entirely my own and may not necessarily agree with those of the author the book's publisher and publicist or the readers of this review this disclosure is in accordance with the federal trade commission's 16 cfr part 255 guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising","43":"truly delightful","44":"a solid 3 5 stars well written story about an immigrant settling into american with his family agree with many of the reviews that the first three quarters or a little more we're great and it fell off and went in a little different of a direction at the end","45":"this book surprised me it's wonderful as an audio book not sure if i would have enjoyed it as a printed book it reads like a memoir even though it is fiction told by james the story starts with his grandparents who come to america from germany and end up in beatrice mo i loved how the story covers three generations of a family and how things change in history and in the family i don't care that there is almost no dialogue i found this mesmerizing and so entertaining as i was driving to from work i'm so glad i listened to this book","46":"overall a great read though i think the ending flubbed a bit i didn't really care about some of the details toward the end so that the ending felt loose and ineffective","47":"i loved this book as an italian american whose great grandparents all came through ellis island it was very endearing and close to the heart","48":"loved it just a really good story with some crazy stuff thrown in","49":"i wasn't expecting much from this book but it became really hard to put down b c the author would put teasers at the end of many chapters so i'd end up reading far far too long into the night really liked this writing style and will definitely see if this author has any other books","50":"it was funny and i couldn't put it down it spans generations starting with a couple who immigrates to mid missouri in 1904 i miss missouri a lot and because it was set on the river the descriptions of the setting brought me right back to college i loved it","51":" reading a good american is a bit like reading what could be your very own family's history alex george chronicles four generations of the meisenheimer family as they put down roots in america's heartland and live the quintessential immigrant experience frederick and jette first arrive in new orleans hoping they can make it to their chosen destination in missouri before their child is born through happenstance and a lot of good luck they are directed by a friendly cornet player to a steamship which takes them northward toward their new home they make their way to beatrice missouri which is short of where they had originally intended to go but infant joseph makes his appearance there as they are passing through and the new family stays put what follows is a view of the family making their home in this small town populated with other german immigrants the bar frederick buys eventually becomes a diner and four generations of the family will feed the town first with traditional german fare and spicey creole reminiscent of their brief time in new orleans followed by cheeseburgers and eventually mexican food frederick well into middle age feels compelled to volunteer for wwi and is killed overseas leaving jette bitter and lonely raising joseph and his sister rosa alone frederick's grandson james tells us the story of his family through his own eyes a good american gives us lots of humor and asks us questions about what it means to be american and part of a family it tells the all too familiar coming of age story of teenagers whose life doesn't seem to go as they want it to but in the end goes just as it should after all as james' busy and ever growing extended family moves busily through their lives james must come to terms with a family secret that makes him question everything he has known to be true a really warm story that will make you feel like you are a part of the meisenheimer family too","52":"i enjoyed this book less and less as it progressed near the end i just wanted it to be over many of the characters introduces in the last third of the book are fleeting and i just didn't care it's a story just that nothing compelling or intriguing","53":" this was actually a really well written book it's the best novel i've read in quite a while i would like to give it 4 5 stars it reads like a memoir it's told by the grandson about his paternal grandparents and how they immigrated from germany to the united states in the late 1800s he gives a history of their key life events and i found the stories delightful and kept my interest and attention there are some nice twists that make it interesting i thought this was a great read and recommend it to who want a fun light hearted novel that has really good story telling","54":"wonderful book to escape in","55":"loved this book beautifully written story of an immigrant couple who settle in missouri and begin a family and a business a fascinating look at the early history of missouri while the family faces many tragedies the overall story is one of redemption and is uplifting","56":" this is a wonderful book george tells a fascinating tale of three generations of a family that begins its american story with a couple who immigrates from germany in the late 1800s he seamlessly weaves american history in with the everyday dramatics of the family who live in a small town in missouri it is a truly great story by george it apparently took george six or seven years to write this novel and i can understand why he may not have wanted to leave these characters i really didn't want to leave once i got to end of the book either","57":"good start great ending a bit tedious in the middle i particularly liked this paragraph on page 371 i want to tell her that frederick her great grandfather would be pleased because this is the american way we are all immigrants a glorious confection of races and beliefs united by the rock that we live on as the years wash over us and new generations march into the future family histories are subsumed into this greater narrative we become simply americans adeline is wondering if she will be able to love babies who are not quite like her but she's missing the point they'll be exactly like her they'll be americans too only more so","58":"i have not read many any books featuring families over many generations so i can't compare this book to other similar stories with that warning in mind i enjoyed reading this book it spans approximately a century starting with an immigrant couple from europe and follows their descendants i was drawn to this book because the couple ends up living in a small town in missouri and i have family who still live in that area in fact i spent quite a few summers in small town rural missouri and was interested in comparing my experiences there with the featured family","59":"i enjoyed this book it started strong and grabbed my attention i enjoyed the humor in the descriptions of characters it was fun and exciting after about 3 4 of the book it felt like it switched authors or the author had put manuscript down for awhile and then resumed the book had a completely different feel when it turned to james and his life not as light and fun less interesting","60":"the book was very readable and enjoyable mainly because the author is from mo however it reads like an autobiography over several generations and it kinda loses its punch when you realize the author is british i think it would have been a better read if it had been written in 3rd person it is about an immigrant family and their adaptations to north missouri life","61":"i won this book through readinggroupguides com love this contest this was a good book i would give it 4 1 2 stars i thought the writing was really good but the first stories of coming to america and the setting up in america seemed a little long i enjoyed the large span of time that the book covered with so many different generations' stories i especially liked the twist of the family lineage at the end of the book the author did a great job of bringing things to a close at the end of the book and not leaving you hanging for any information","62":" this is the history of the meisenheimer family that begins with the immigration of jette and frederick from hanover germany to beatrice missouri at the beginning of the twentieth century alex george has depicted a family assimilating into american life and struggling to become what they perceive to be good americans in a small town it is always interesting to view immigrants' perception of america so i found it entertaining however it didn't resonate with me as other fictional immigration family sagas have","63":"this is another good immigrant story narrated by the grandson of a young couple who left germany in 1904 came through new orleans and landed in beatrice missouri the story spans 4 generations and touches on many events in us history when frederick and jette first arrive in america they are helped by an unlikely person and frederick is told to go be a good american he spends the rest of his life trying to do just that while figuring out just what that means there is an interesting twist at the end of the book at first i thought there was a unrealistic amount of tragedy in the character's lives but i just read a letter mini memoir written by my husband's great grandfather and i am reminded that tragedy and early death wasn't all that unusual this was an interesting and well told story but for some reason i didn't get emotionally invested in the characters the writing style puts some distance between the characters and the reader or at least this reader","64":"this year's 2012 capital read selection join other readers in cole and osage counties for a heart warming read growing up in a small missouri town with a family history of german immigrants coming to missouri my great great grandparents i was surprised at how well the author captured life in a small german heritage town since he is an immigrant to the us as well from england but we all search for what it means to call a place home and to find a place we fit in in our communities and in our own families you follow a young couple in 1904 who flee her disapproving family to america they plan to settle in new york but end up taking a boat to new orleans not realizing how different that could be and end up taking a journey up the missouri river and finally settle in the fictional small town of beatrice missouri a town with many other german immigrants the story is narrated by the couples' grandson james who discovers at the end that he doesn't really know his own story and his own family at all you follow the family through prohibition wwii when frederick joins up because he wants most of all to be a good american the kennedy assassination and beyond music plays an important role in the family relates to the community and how the family members relate to each other each member of the family has to find their place in this new country in their town and in their family and what it means to be a good american if you've ever felt like an outsider in your own hometown your school or even your own family you will relate to these characters search for a place to call home","65":"i actually didn't realize this was fiction and felt cheated when i figured out it wasn't a memoir otherwise i would have rated it higher","66":"i enjoy historical fiction and this is a good one memorable characters and a fun look at the history covered","67":"i absolutely fell in love with this book about halfway through reading it i've knocked other books before because they didn't have any sense of direction and this one did too in a way but it was a pleasant wandering it was like you're listening to your grandmother and grandfather tell their story then your father and then your friend the way the alex george writes is quite charming in my opinion it's simple and to the point he doesn't dwell too much on things that don't need dwelling on a characteristic i value in people not just in books while at the same time he describes things in an almost gentle way that proves extaordinary yet again simple this book could be anyone's story of ancestry and in the characters i saw so much of myself here and there in rosa and joseph but mostly in james that it was very easy to relate to how they were feeling and their decisions throughout the book another thing i enjoyed was the snippets of history that the story builds around mentions of the wars prohibition the invention of the radio along with the evolution of music all put things on a unique timeline that wasn't stictly one subject it put things in a broader perspective than i've seen before this is coming from someone that loves music loves cooking loves books all things that the story focuses on for sometime i even got chills at a mention of someone mastering a recipe or at the thought of an a capella quartet singing because i was so into the story","68":"a friend gave me this paperback edition she found it boring i enjoyed the story having recently spent a great deal of time sorting boxes of photo family history written as if the author was tracing the lives of four generations of his family i found my family far more interesting but i'm not writing their story","69":"stunningly beautiful and one of my favorites of early 2012 would recommend to anyone looking for a book to get lost in just do yourself a favor and make sure you're wearing your comfy pants you'll want to stay put for awhile and enjoy it","70":"an uplifting and sometimes humorous story about four generations of a german immigrant family and what it really means to be american in all of its diversity since i'm of german descent my grandparents came to america about the same time as the narrator's grandparents like the grandfather in the novel my grandfather enlisted and fought in ww i they were fiercely proud business owners too just the story a great read for anyone who tends to like historical fiction or even memoir this reads a bit like a memoir or autobiography","71":"loved this multi generational story of family as i was reading i kept hearing the narrator from the movie a river runs through it remember the old guy fly fishing yep my brain read the whole book in that guys voice","72":"much to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed this foreigner turned american tale despite some glaring flaws in the writing a german man and his girlfriend soon to be wife travel to new orleans to escape her parent's wrath they end up in missouri an unusual place for a tale of this nature the story goes on to detail the family's plight in america and at times the tragedies begin to pile up george has an annoying habit of ending every chapter and sub chapter with a pithy dramatic sentence aside from that i enjoyed the classic immigrant tale from the german point of view","73":"not perfect but good multigenerational tale quite a bit of sex stuff in second half of book","74":"i truly enjoyed this book i love the way he used language the characters were well developed plot was interesting and had lots of twists wonderful read","75":" spanning the years from 1904 to present day this is the story of german immigrants frederick and jette and their descendants woven through the story are historical events that helped to shape their destinies and those of their children and all of america as well the narrator is their grandson james he is a brilliant observer of the lives all around him yet almost misses a pretty big surprise twist in regards to his own life toward the end of the book i have to say i didn't see that one coming most of us can relate our own family histories and get an idea of what it was like coming to a new land not knowing anyone not speaking the lanuguage not having a job or home to go to these were some pretty brave and rugged individuals good americans all","76":"i wish goodreads would allow 1 2 stars i would give this one 3 1 2","77":"liked the first part of the book then it felt a little like forrest gump","78":"a beautiful tale of an immigrant family that becomes a true american family loves losses betrayals dreams aspirations and secrets all nicely woven together with a memorable cast of characters well done","79":"for some reason this failed to surprise i kept feeling like i have read it before the author should write more though there is an easy flow to the writing which is welcome","80":"i'd seen this one listed in the about new books magazine that is free at books a million and it seemed like the sort of thing that really is my kind of book i did enjoy the story particularly the beginning parts with the original immigrants to the country the rest of the book i liked too but not quite as much it's definitely worth reading","81":"this was a beautifully written history of a true american family","82":"lots of death not much conflict ok story of a family written from the perspective of the grandson","83":"a cross generational story of one family's american dream poignant and funny in equal parts the story of meisenheimer family will stay with you long after you have turned the last page","84":"had i spent a lot of time on this i'd be much more disappointed it wasn't a great story the characters weren't particularly compelling and plot resolutions were far too neat and tidy far too many times for my liking meh","85":"stunning this novel just hits the spot the characters are wonderful i wanted to read it but didn't want to finish it it makes you smile and it brings a tear to you're eye it's so good it's a story of immigration and love and loss weaved around some unforgettable people a real epic a must read the end was slightly rushed maybe but that's my only small criticism fab","86":"i thought this was a great book i would recommend it","87":"i was hooked from the first page this story follows a family through several generations of ups u0026amp downs tragedies and celebrations told with a great sense of humor it captures the essence of family","88":"thoroughly enjoyed this family epic that spans several generations you breeze right through it because of wonderful writing that seems so effortlessly crafted","89":" i'm a bit confused by how many good ratings this book has which was primarily my reason for reading it although the writing style is easygoing the story is labored and trite it is also obviously written by someone who is not an american it tries so hard to be an epic american immigrant story but instead is a cliched slice of americana that falls completely flat there are parts of it that border on the ridiculous like when our protagonist writes a fictional story about a presidential assassination that is nearly identical to jfk and gasp sends it off to publishers a month before jfk was actually assassinated this is not a spoiler in any case this is one of many moments of pure silliness that makes no sense and adds nothing to the overall story a big disappointment","90":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the narrative of a grandson of a german immigrant had my interest from the get go from the great war through the great depression the multigenerational meisenheimer story includes music italian arias forbidden love not romeo u0026amp juliet randy teenagers yep boys yet though some parts were intensely funny harrowing or bittersweet in turn this tale didn't deliver that 'feel good' story that i was hoping for probably more my fault than the author's","91":"i thought this book was boring i'm not sure why i continued to read it except that it was beside my bed and i would pick it up between other books there is nothing terrible about it but it just sort of drags on and on the only part that really caught my attention was the very beginning","92":"always there was music what a wonderful opening i fell in love within the first few pages beautiful writing fascinating story by the last third of the book though something got lost what is a good american do we know do we have a story read and find what james discover the cover is beautiful and i love this line like the improvised melodies that lomax was spinning from the bell of his horn every single life was a galaxy of permutations and possibilities from which a single thread would be picked out and followed for better or for worse the book is abundantly filled with such lovely descriptions i received this as an arc from putnam","93":"started strong and then meandered with no point until the very end needed a lot of refocus","94":" remarkable riveting some writers have a good command of the language but don't know how to tell a story other writers know how to tell a story but don't have a good command of the language this guy has both a good american sucked me in like an electrolux historical reference grin the moment i finished it i called my husband and howled it's over it's over arrrrgggggggg he said well that's how you know it's a good book you dread its ending sigh i am so attached to the characters i feel like i've lost friends alex george is one good american writer well great not good someday he'll be an american icon","95":"alex george is an excellent storyteller u0026amp i will watch for his next book for certain he presents this multi generational saga of characters with delightful quirks with dreams impossible to be crushed and with the passions u0026amp beliefs u0026amp perseverance that are a part of all our family trees my regret is that i listened to the audio which was well produced but i think i missed the opportunity to leisurely read back over meaningful passages to savor the story of these good americans","96":"this story spans the generations and presents a genuine portrayal of the ups and downs of the immigrant transition to the american lifestyle as the novel begins jette pregnant and unmarried persuades her love frederick to abandon hamburg germany and escape to new adventures in the united states despite that it was jette's decision primarily to make the trans oceanic journey it is frederick who immediately embraces his new country and devotes all that he can to become a good american i enjoyed the character james lomax for his kind hearted ability to ingratiate himself into the meisenheimer family and blend his love of new orleans jazz and soul food into their developing livelihood even though prejudice surrounded him in small town beatrice missouri lomax became a devoted friend and mentor to frederick's son joseph meisenheimer and the rest of the family i also liked how music was such a dominant theme throughout the book especially when joseph's four sons began their own barbershop type quartet this story emphasizes the powerful influence that family members can have on one another the competency to bounce back after horrible challenges and the notion of making the most out of what one is given","97":"i listened to this and thoroughly enjoyed it a family history over many generations that manages to keep things upbeat overall","98":"i really enjoyed this charming book i liked how it spanned across one family's legacy in the united states i also enjoyed how this book used a historical timeline and interwove important events into the plot now that i'm finished i would like to start over and re read it again","99":"a good historical fiction set in missouri enjoyable read","100":"major events are seen through the eyes of the meisenheimers and narrated by james in this novel which is humorous sad touching and full of unforgettable characters although events begin to lag somewhat toward the end of the novel the author has one last detail that adds to the plot and definitely makes it worthwhile to finish reading the story of american and its immigrants is told well in a good american","101":"very good read three generations love that stuff of a family that came from germany around the turn of the century i liked the stories from each era i really recommend it","102":"really this is more like a 2 5 the story was okay but the writing was pretty awful","103":"loved this book love historical fiction this book was a fast read for

frederick and jette meisenheimer to america in hanover germany in 1903 frederick first serenades jette in a garden jette's mother opposes the romance to no avail then jette becomes pregnant and steals her grandfather's medal given to him by the kaiser frederick fears jette's mother will mistakenly believe he is the thief and turn him in to the authorities their solution is to leave germany for america ttheir destination is new orleans and not new york which means the meinsenheimers' experience will be different from the usual one neither speaks a word of english frederick has never even heard of new orleans that's in america the united states jette assures him it does not really matter where they go new york new orleans what's the difference they're both new that's good enough while on the ship to new orleans frederick and jette marry and decide to settle in missouri tonce in new orleans frederick explores what he can of the exotic american city frederick loves music and the sounds of jazz lure him to a bar in the french quarter he has never heard jazz before and proclaims it chaotic and loud but full of hope and life it is he believes the perfect new music for his new country so begins frederick's rapturous love affair with america whatever homesickness he may feel is eradicated by his first excursion onto the streets of america everything he'd seen had been unimaginably different from the dry dour streets of hanover and to his surprise he was not sorry in the slightest frederick is absolutely smitten by the beguiling otherness of it all his affair with his new country continues until the day he dies tfrederick and jette never reach their destination jette goes into labor in beatrice missouri and there they stay in his adopted home city frederick sets out to be a good american for frederick this means many things learning english being a good husband and a good father to joseph and rosa and saving to buy the business where he works he does all these things frederick buys a bar and turns it into a fine dining establishment for frederick being a good american also means fighting in world war i against the country where he was born tgeorge writes a good american with broad scope as he takes us from world war i to the present he paints a portrait of a nation on the cusp of becoming a superpower interestingly the same could be said of the meisenheimers as the family develops and grows as each generation must answer the question of how to be a good american the united states also changes and grows the meisenheimers and the united states come of age together this concept is apparent in later generations of frederick and jette's progeny the restaurant frederick is so proud of morphs in each generation just as the country's tastes change over the years frederick's becomes a diner and then finally a mexican restaurant although george never says it outright i do feel he himself would never define what it means to be a good american tin a good american george continues the family saga through to the present day with james the narrator joseph's son two generations after frederick and jette james is unconcerned about fitting into a country he feels like he does not even fit in with his family he thinks he is an outsider he does not fit in with his boisterous brothers and would rather play chess instead james is fond of his aunt and reading the novels of p g wodehouse a discovery later in his life leaves him reeling i am left reeling too since george makes the reader feel like a part of the story that is the beauty of a good american i feel as if i know these people i feel as if the meisenheimers are family tnever before have i read a novel with such an interesting and hilarious cast of characters in addition to the meisenheimers george introduces us to a preacher who believes he has witnessed the second coming an evil bicycle riding dwarf and a young harry truman as much as i love the character of lomax an african american cornet player from new orleans i see him as too much of a bagger vance type character lomax helps jette he helps rosa he helps joseph once he is no longer needed the character exits the story i for one think george could have done more with lomax tgeorge writes a good american with feeling and truth perhaps partly because he is an immigrant too george lives works and writes in missouri but he was born in england he moved to the united states in 2003 and has worked as a lawyer before becoming a writer tat its heart a good american is an immigrant's tale the author is an immigrant and the story is about a family of immigrants george's story is a tale that can be seen as representative of an idealized representation of emigration into the united states george writes almost every family living in the united states today has a story similar to this one somewhere in its past whether ten years ago or three hundred years ago whether through due process or by way of a midnight ghosting across an unmanned border whether by slave boat or luxury airplane we all came here from somewhere no truer words were ever written","105":"i loved the first half of this book almost wanted to give it a rare for me 5 star rating last half maybe last third was about a 3 so i guess i'll settle at 4 perhaps 3 5 if was a wonderful premise equally filled with hope and tragedy but by the end i couldn't even muster very much sympathy it was more like pity i think we could have cut off the disastrous waning end and had a solid immigrant story that could be loved by anyone","106":" a good american is an engrossing novel about a german family that immigrated to missouri in the early 20th century the historical details are colorful and authentic the reader never feels they're inserted for special effects the book is seamless and moves at an even pace through events and characterizations chapters are superbly organized and handled and if the author's method is to sometimes summarize emotions rather than drill down deeply into the psychology of characters it is always controlled interesting and frequently amusing","107":"follows 3 generations of americans living in small town missouri heartwarming and heartbreaking at times","108":"rachel's choice for dec 2013 this is one of those family epics that just keeps going and going it reminded me of a tree grows in brooklyn or other such family sagas where there isn't really a main conflict except life","109":"found this in a random way and enjoyed reading it historical fiction passage of time","110":"this is a beautiful story of a family that begins as german emigrants and over the next several generations becomes simply americans the characters are colorful and real and they find a way into your heart as you ache for their tragedies and feel for their all too human struggles the author does a beautiful job with changing the tone of voice as the generations and viewpoints change along with the american culture this is one of the few books that will be remembered as a personal favorite","111":"4 and a half loved it","112":"a lovely book that explores 4 generations of a family carefully drawn characters and a love of music permeate this novel that begins in germany in 1904 and ends in missouri in 2009","113":" greetings our new friend alex george our book club in kansas city under the guidance of vivien jennings of rainy day books had the good fortune of having a good american as our monthly book due to her recommendation friday march 8th we will host the meeting in our home of the 25 or so members of our book club a few minutes ago my wife and i finished the book as life long mid westerners that also came back home we loved the entire story albeit the twists and

in kc you are welcome to come by as well we love local area writers that live and or are from the area like yourself thank you for your consideration and thank you for this great story we loved it best to you and yours always mark and melissa anderson","114":"liked the progression of the characters and build up of their lives and values","115":"a sweet tale following three generations of a family descended from german immigrants to the us it didn't quite pack the literary punch i had hoped for i enjoyed it none the less","116":"interesting book and a fun read the author kept you engaged throughout and even managed to surprise me patricia","117":"we dh and i really enjoyed listening to the audio book a great story believable characters real life situations an engaging story this is my first experience with alex george author but i will definitely look for more of his novels","118":"very flat writing that didn't do much to draw me in or keep my interest so i gave up before i got too far","119":"this tale of a family becoming americans was a good read the story told through the voice of one of the grandson of the immigrant couple was at times heart breaking funny and bittersweet a few unexpected twists led to a satisfying conclusion","120":"a good coming to america story interesting characters and nicely paced as in moves right along author is english so makes for a slightly different point is view which is always refreshing","121":"this is a sweeping multi generational family tale that is beautifully told it touches on the hope of immigration and the resilience of the american spirit i enjoyed it very much my only complaint regards just how many generations the story does discuss because the novel covers over 100 years of a family's history i found it a little more difficult to connect emotionally with any one particular character i liked everyone i was able to relate to many but i didn't feel truly emotionally invested in anyone having said that i still considered it a worthwhile read","122":"the story of a couple moving to america in the early 1900's and their children and their children's children was great the middle of the book was a bit slow and seemed as if there were way too many random details however the end of the book tied everything together and the twist at the end was well worth the time spent plowing through all those random details","123":" what a journey i was drawn to this story mainly because of my deep appreciation of genealogy and my own family history while this book is fiction i like how it told the whole story of the meisenheimer family even the scandalous parts which every family has if we are being honest there were times i was upset with the characters for their stubbornness which only led to great regrets certainly a lesson within the story an unexpected twist made me like this book more than i expected to in the end","124":" three and a half stars this is one of those books you can read even when there's a lot of distraction it's an uncomplicated tale of three or so generations told from the perspective of one of the grandsons and starts with his grandparents' emigration from germany to america it's not an over the top story but there are enough surprising moments to keep one enchanted plus more than a little sense of serendipity i have to admit the final reveal in the story was totally unexpected on my part at the end of the day it's a feel good book and great for some escapism","125":"listened to audiobook a quick march through a couple generations of family at least more time was spent developing the frederick jette relationship unfortunately unsatisfying poor communication between them i wanted to like them but didn't really care for them the one really likable character came to a horrible end of some historical interest but just ok for me","126":"enjoyed this book and how the story weaved through several generations found it humorous and that it kept my interest throughout the entire book","127":"audio not sure if it is an epic or a slice of life pretty general and looks at 1 family over generations pretty simple reading with little violence and pretty normal sex","128":" the short of it a sprawling multi generational tale of an immigrant family in a small missouri town in the 20th century good writing and a promising author but lacking a coherent focus the long of it this feels like several different books crammed together where the alternating protagonists happened to share the same genes and live in the same small town i guess i'm not a fan of family dynasty stories but i really liked the legacy of eden the thing about that book though was that the family dynasty had a point it was about a crumbling farm empire and how the machinations of the grandmother matriarch poisoned the succeeding generations there was a common thread throughout to the story the destruction of a family from its rotten roots it tied the whole thing together in a coherent way the problem with the good american is that it doesn't have that and immigration americana does not count those are old worn themes and nothing new has been said on the topic in this book and taking the story out to the third generation and even cramming in fourth and fifth generations in there in the epilogue like final chapters does nothing it should have stopped at the second generation it was when frederick u0026amp jette's grandkids took over as protagonists that i realized that nothing was happening this was essentially a biography of the meisenheimer family and any tension drama came from short vignettes not an overarching plot i liked the book up until the grandkids took over essentially family biographer narrator james and the cast of his surprisingly forgettable brothers the writing is strong it flows well there is some decent depth to the standard characters frederick a cheerful optimistic german who works up from having nothing to earning the american dream of owning his own business and embraces his new country with such fervor that he goes off to fight for it against his old countrymen in wwi jette his headstrong wife who responds to the strangeness by holding fast to the old country until widowhood makes her accept and prosper in the new country lomax the african american jazz musician and cook who helps bring some spice to the whitebread midwest but ultimately can't escape prejudice against his skin color joseph the good son who takes over his father's restaurant and placidly enjoys his smalltown life etc etc but it is really just the lack of any point or drive beyond chronicling this fictional family that got to me and the hamfisted way the changing of america was stuffed in at points the restaurant seems to be this giant metaphoric expression of the evolution of america through the 20th century it's a bar oh but prohibition happens so now it's a restaurant not just any restaurant one that blends good german fare immigrant food with spicy cajun food american but still a blend of cultures out of nowhere it stops with those two things and moves on to american food like hamburgers seriously there was no hint that lomax was teaching jette anything but cajun cooking so how the hell did it become an american food restaurant of bland hamburgers fries etc now thanks to a convenient flood it's been remodeled into a prototypical '50s diner complete with jukebox and chrome countertops okay don't quote me on the chrome part i'm too lazy to go back and check but you get the idea now it's worried about the encroachment of the golden arches oh now it serves mexican food i mean really let's try for some subtlety here instead of a giant hulking building of a metaphor the other thing is there was a point in the book i just went no fucking way this is the part where little joseph's psychotic best friend shoots his joseph's sister's semi domesticated raccoon the psychotic best friend stefan has no idea that this raccoon is this girl's pet seriously seriously i call bull fucking shit this is a small town a weird event like a little girl befriending a raccoon or even a friendly raccoon that enjoys sunbathing on roofs would be well known gossip and even more than that these two kids are best friends no way would he not know about his best friend's sister's strange wild pet this kind of thing happens too much in the book it's like george wanted to add some quirky forceful events to smalltown life and ignored the wtf factor like the music teacher who seduces all the local male high school students i mean not saying that doesn't happen it just seems bizarre and irrelevant and silly also in a town that size it would not be kept secret she was apparently seducing every single male in the high school some kid would've bragged long ago and even though no one might admit it to the woman's husband they'd all know what was going on apparently this is the world's most secretive small town or maybe no one talks to each other all that said i really did like the first half except for the raccoon incident alex george has talent as an author and if he'd apply himself to something with a little more plot i'd really enjoy it and if family dynasties or immigrant tales is your thing this is a good book to pick up","129":"good read enjoyed learning a little of the history of that time and the struggles people coming from other countries wen through a little slow to strat but worth the read","130":"i think this would be good for a book group discussion","131":"i enjoyed this book i really liked the beginning with the immigrant experience and the years ticking by and then generations the end seemed like a different book to me and i didn't necessarily get that the two parts should be in one book but all and all it was good","132":"i was really surprised by this book i liked it so much i'm actually considering starting it over again and i never do that","133":"i had a really hard time ending this novel because it told a family saga in america and how the narrator was the grandson","134":"loved the story loved the characters","135":"excellent loved this book u0026amp shared with several friends that also loved it wonderful story of the immigrant experience in america in the early 1900s it was fascinating to see how these two immigrants survived through several historical events world war great depression etc and impossible not to become invested in this family's life highly recommend","136":"quick read a couple of surprises","137":"i loved this book the story of te meisenheimer family draws you in from the first page the first line always always there was music was the original pull and then the fully drawn characters made me want to keep reading i wasn't really expecting the twists at the end but all in all they made sense would highly recommend to anyone","138":"more like 4 5 fantastic characters great development lots of hardship on the story but lots of humor too check it out","139":"i loved this book i loved the characters the setting the narrative i loved it all considering this is alex georges' first novel i would say he is definitely an author to watch for in the future","140":" man i hated this book it has dwarves and giants and jesus and harry truman and oprah and death so so so much death usually by strange or early circumstances i feel like the author worked very very hard to make each small story clever but the effect grew old very quickly oh gosh he taught him polish instead of english how clever over and over and over it went there were several 'teasers' about things to come but they were so completely obvious each time that the effect was just annoying i did finish the book but only because it was both our town's summer reading book as well as our bookclub selection for the month i am very glad to be finished with this one","141":" this is a love story of an immigrant family who eventually become the living epitome of the american dream and way of life that all immigrants dream of having when moving to america the story is narrated by the grandson of the german immigrants fredrick and jette who began the dream following the pregnancy of their first child joseph that was severely frowned upon by jette's family as it was out of wedlock their story is full of love triumph anger and sadness their marriage ended too soon due to war but again the telling of their story via letters from the war was heart wrenching and beautiful the family that was then 3 grows to many a century later the narrator moves the story gently forward ensuring all the pivotal american historical moments are captured entwined somehow in the characters lives as wells as the town and townspeople of beatrice the characters of beatrice are integral to the story and i had several favourites inclusive of mr jim music fills this book from start to finish at weddings and funeral a catalyst for at least 2 love stories within this book the way the song is written throughout the book through the changing time is beautiful at times the story takes you from extraordinary happiness and peace to sadness initially i was put off by the style of writing as i never saw the sad points coming however by the end it is this honest and rawness of writing about a century worth of life that moves the reader and has made this one of my favourite reads of 2012","142":"what a totally absorbing tale encompassing three generations of one family a family that immigrates to america in the early 1900's the story is told with such mastery that it keeps you invested in the happiness of its members all the plot lines with its twists turns and revisits to it's own history are masterful storytelling the prose is so smooth as it glides along the reader is swept away into a another's memories like they are an old dear friend","143":" alex george's a good american sweeps across the atlantic to tell the story of the meisenheimer family as frederick and jette emigrate to america to raise their family their story and that of the future generations of their family is gently narrated by their grandson james a good american encompasses so much of what makes families unique secrets that build walls simple gestures that break them down and the love and history that links generations together even when geography and even death stretch them apart read the rest of my review at angela amman","144":"you know how the fresh clean palate cleansing rush of a zingy sorbet can erase the hangover taste in your mouth from the previous course at dinner the good american is exactly like that george has written a novel that reminded me of how i was raised to appreciate the whole melting pot goodness of the country i love given all the chest beating ethno us centric mess that is going on now reading this book was like revisiting my grammar school classroom where we celebrated all the different cultures which made up the country's tapestry should be required reading as we head into election 2012","145":"a great story about an immigrant family from germany and what it means to be a good american","146":"didn't see that twist coming","147":"despite some plot twists that stretch credibility this is a great story","148":"i'm between a 3u0026amp 4 star book here it caught my attention right away u0026amp by the end i cared about the characters and what happened to them there were however some parts in between that seemed to drag a bit overall a good read","149":"this unassuming novel focuses on three generations of the meisenheimer family after frederick and jette arrive in america from germany in the early 20th century through all of the tragedies and surprises the pace of this story is unwavering life continues and people cope though some better than others there is a matter of factness even when strong emotions are suggested about the way that death disappointment and unwanted expectations are dealt with that is refreshing","150":"this was an awesome engaging story about a man's family's emigration from germany and their assimilation into american culture it spans multiple generations and covers everything that happened in the main characters life and family during his entire lifetime including births and deaths adolescence the many faces of the family bar and restaurant and the hardships and triumphs experienced by him and those he loved i'm a picky reader but this book had my attention throughout it was sometimes funny sometimes sad always insight and nostalgic i loved it words don't do it justice","151":" a really fun story with lots of interesting plot twists and turns some of which doesn't get explored enough for my tastes the essential storyline reads like an immigration story 2 people who want a better life and to love each other without family disapproval journey to america for their new start they link themselves to a german community in missouri out of familiarity but soon learn to juggle all the new trappings of an american life early in the 20th century the book has lots of great characters a whole intriguing family history is laid down in almost 400 pages a fast easy read","152":"german born frederick and jette come to american at the turn of the twentieth century to make a new life for themselves a set of unplanned events leads them to beatrice missouri a typical midwestern town while frederick flourishes in this environment jette longs for home frederick's desire to be a good american forces jette to

born grandchild tells the story his unique perspective and knowledge of his family brings a special understanding of them the people in their town and americans as group the story is told with humor and tragedy - two key components of anyone's life","153":"one of the few books i have found recently that i read in one sitting good story without all the over the top embellishment that many authors feel are necessary covers a full century in the life of a family of german immigrants well worth the read","154":" this was a good family saga story beginning with the 1904 immigration of jette and frederick meisenheimer to new orleans from germany the narrator is james the grandson of jette and frederick he was not a particularly interesting character himself family sagas are not my favorite genre and many times it's because the sections are not equally interesting to me or compelling this was the case with a good american i really liked jette and frederick's story but each succeeding generation became a little less interesting and by the time the author got to the end he seemed to just be reciting the next leaves on the family tree with no real passion or reason for me to be interested","155":"this novel begins with a love story and continues with the results of that love affair for four generations it's both the story of a family and a place a town in missouri i found parts of it slow going but particularly enjoyed the earlier and later chapters james who narrates the story makes the reader come to feel like part of the family","156":"a multi generational story of

ellis island they arrive and are assaulted by the smells and sounds of the big easy which makes the at first reluctant to leave his native country frederick fall in love with his new homeland however the non english speaking frederick hears from another german immigrant about a land that has fertile soil and many other ex pat germans as well called missouri aided by a kind french speaking black musician named lomax whom frederick hears beautifully playing some unusual music called ragtime on his coronet outside of a colored only nightclub frederick u0026amp jette hop a steamboat that takes them to tiny beatrice missouri the story behind the town's name was very amusing and they start their new life there frederick starts out working at and eventually buying a tavern called the nick nack with the help of an amateur prize fighting friend who makes money by winning every fight he's in and splitting the winnings with him he also lets a small black man with a big talent for playing the piano entertain the drinkers btw what happened to him as the author introduces him and then he drops out of sight 50 pages later however when america gets involved in wwi frederick takes the long ago advice by the other immigrant he meets in new orleans to be a good american and enlists only to be killed by one of his former countrymen heartbroken jette widowed with two children is left to take over the tavern which thanks to prohibition becomes a restaurant luckily she's aided by lomax who coincidentally shows up in beatrice and helps jette with the restaurant and introduces the sauerbraten eating citizens of the town to cajun cooking he also becomes a father figure to young joseph u0026amp rosa however he also deals in moonshine with tragic results i really got into this book even though i felt besides introducing a character and then dropping his story line completely some of the characters and situations were kind of stereotypical the horny high school music teacher who instructs u0026amp seduces james and his three brothers who sing in a barbershop quartet started by their father who inherits his love of music as well as his voice from his father but his unable to sing in public himself due to crippling stage fright which doesn't help when he tries to serenade the lovely girl next door cora who later becomes his wife anyway in sharp contrast there's the old maid schoolteacher aunt rosa who goes off to college but then drops out and teaches at the one room schoolhouse she also plays a mean game of chess teaching james who feels like a misfit in his own family as well as introducing him to p g wodehouse's writings which inspires him to start writing himself most importantly in a great plot twist she carries a secret that affects james greatly finally there's the fire and brimstone preacher who makes an odd vow after joseph distraught over losing his wife after she gives birth to twins becomes a staunch atheist the other thing that kind of bothered me about the book was the fact that none of the brothers move out of beatrice which i felt was unrealistic americans are a nomadic people and the author who's british born but lives and works in missouri should've shown that other than that this book is a very fast involving read that'll maybe make you want to look up your own family history more","158":"i really enjoyed a good american a different genre than i usually go with the historical part was subtle enough but interesting and you really care about the characters it was interesting to follow their journey through the generations i would reccommend this book the few twists in the story make you laugh or cry","159":"i finally came back to this book and finished it it was a good read and i recommend it","160":"the story of a family immagrating to america with hopes and dreams and building a family here reminded me so much of my grandfather arturo's dream to build a home in america where his children could have better opportunity it also reminded me of my father's family who have deep deep roots in this country","161":"so far i can't put this book down i'm halfway through it hope it stays great","162":"a beautifully written story about a family that immigrates from germany to the united states in the 20th century in hopes of a better life and the challenges they face in their new home","163":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here first of all this book does not really match the description on the book jacket perhaps that is why i was a little disappointed in it there were parts that i really liked in this book but it seemed like there was just too much going on almost as if it were two separate books i get that the book chronicles this family through the generations but the chapters about the later generations seemed like they were written by a totally different author than the earlier ones there were so many chara first of all this book does not really match the description on the book jacket perhaps that is why i was a little disappointed in it there were parts that i really liked in this book but it seemed like there was just too much going on almost as if it were two separate books i get that the book chronicles this family through the generations but the chapters about the later generations seemed like they were written by a totally different author than the earlier ones there were so many characters that i wanted to like but there just wasn't enough details in the book for me to really develop a relationship with them before they died which happened to so many characters in this book overall i enjoyed reading it but i wish there would have been a few less story lines and characters so i could have really fallen in love with only a few of them p s all the death did kind of bother me i mean all the different ways that were included death of a soldier awful racial lynching death during childbirth dwarf suicide death of the young man who out grew his bodyprobably even more that i am forgetting too more","164":"a great historical fiction novel","165":"great book and not what i expected when i started extremely well written throughout would read him again","166":"i really enjoyed the first third of the book then it lost me for a bit but came back at the end with a nice closure","167":"this is the story of a family who immigrated to the us from germany in the early 1900s they become good americans this is the story of their lives their children and their grandchildren i really enjoyed this book it is a coming of age story combined with humor and glimpses of history definitely worth the read","168":"one story with history of family well written pretty warm","169":"\"a good american\" is a tale of immigrants family and small town living it spans a good amount of time from roughly the turn of the 20th century up through 2010 the best part of the book is the beginning the story of frederick and jette meisenheimer their journey to america and the life they made in a small missouri town once the story focused on frederick and jette's children and their lives it wasn't as captivating for me not that it was bad it was a smooth and quick read through to the end no for me i think it was just that i really liked how the author captured the struggle of the immigrant experience the leaving behind of friends and family the promise of a new beginning learning a new language living day by day for a while until settling in and the free flow and constant change of plans while adapting to a new life in a new place since the meisenheimer children were born in missouri they were not therefore immigrants the story took a new direction that was a bit more like a small town tale i did like the anchoring effect of the bar restaurant diner it seemed to hold the family and to some degree the town together and help tell the secondary character's stories and tie them tighter to the main characters it was interesting to see the progression of the establishment's importance go from frederick's dream-made-into reality passed down to a son who views it as an obligation and on to the next generation who views it merely as a money maker i liked this easy tale of having and living the \"american dream \" especially in this climate of political sniping and backbiting from both international and internal sources this is a refreshing oasis of hope of a new life in america 4 stars","170":"just ok well written and i liked the pace but the characters lacked passion i will reserve my more indepth review for bookclub","171":"an ok book i felt like the author really rushed the book at the end and parts of it did not make alot of sense the first parts of the book were much better than the later parts","172":"this book has history immigrants music southern charms foreign language food love family and it's well written to boot is that how you use that phrase i have no idea but it sounds kind of right it's all set up for me to love it and i do i am the grandchild of one immigrant my grandmother left france for america when she was around my age her story couldn't be more different from that of the family in this book but i still love to read about people discovering new worlds in other countries this book is not perfect of course some of the characters are flat and the last quarter of it felt a little strange but i loved following the story of frederick and jette a german couple forced to flee to america at the beginning of the 20th century due to jette's untimely pregnancy they head for louisiana but end up in missouri and there they raise a family it's funny and sad and sweet and ultimately just a really nice read i'm always confused how to classify books like this it's not historical fiction like the next book i'm going to be reviewing set during the times of odysseus and mostly one person's imaginings built on the clues we have left but until the end it's not fiction about the modern day either whatever it is i think it is totally worth being picked up if you're in the market for a new read","173":"the classic immigrant story however without much of the struggles and heartache in fact positive coincidences are too common in a good american depth of characters and plot was lacking in this highly publicized novel yes it is a good story of three generations emigrating from germany coming into the port of new orleans but left me with a feeling that the author simply brushed the surface of what could have been a great book","174":"this is the tale of one family's immigration to america and continues through three generations it has heartbreak compassion humor and a big historical and music thread running through the entire story","175":"early 1900's a german couple comes to america and starts their american story the family is followed through 3 generations in a small town in missouri","176":"this novel was a disappointment to me while the publisher's description sounded intriguing i found the book to be not at all what i expected the writing was unimaginative and flat the characters lacked depth and the plot was often just dull the first few chapters held some promise the story of how the two young lovers frederick and jette meet and decide to leave germany to escape disapproving family members was interesting as was their choice to go to new orleans new immigrants in the new orleans of 1904 lots of potential there for a novel but inexplicably the author takes his characters away from the vibrancy excitement and possibilities of new orleans and drops them in a tiny farming community in missouri that ends up being about as exciting as it sounds once they are in nowheresville missouri the novel gets duller and duller as do the characters the characters meet boring people and do boring things and you get the idea supposedly first time author alex george an immigrant himself was interested in the theme of what makes a good american hence the title honestly i can't see where this theme was explored at all odd at least one reviewer on goodreads and a book critic have compared this novel to those of john irving i see absolutely no comparison between irving a master storyteller and a genius at character development and alex george as with erin morgenstern's the night circus this is another case in which i'm surprised a publisher thought this novel was ready for release both books i feel were good ideas for a novel but a decent premise and a well written fully realized novel are just not the same thing not at all i am adding this to my original review as several others on goodreads have pointed out this novel rather astoundingly for a book published in 2012 includes a magical negro character let me expound on this for those not familiar with the archetype which has been spoken of by spike lee the magical negro in american films is a supporting african american character whose sole purpose in the movie is to help out the white main character often by virtue of some special power knowledge or wisdom he or she is only in the story to teach the white character a lesson or help the white character learn something about himself think will smith's magical black caddy in the legend of bagger vance and many characters played by morgan freeman once the magical negro has helped the white character he or she usually disappears from the story sometimes with a noble and sacrificial death a good american has a textbook magical negro in the absurd and implausible character of lomax he magically appears with no backstory to teach jette how to cook soul food thus saving her restaurant and teach her son how to score with the ladies lomax lives for years in the back room of the white family's restaurant despite the fact that he is the only african american in a hick white town where everyone but jette and her family hate him oh and the fact that he was supposedly a coronet player but dropped that because he just loved this white family so much needless to say lomax comes to a terrible end when the white characters have learned what they needed to from him this kind of thing has thankfully been disappearing from american films in recent years kind of offensive creepy and just plain yucky to find it in a just published novel","177":"this is story of german immigrants coming to a america is a rich story with appealing characters the author tells the story with a sense of humor putting in details from the time period and using music as a way to experience the passing of years","178":"storytelling at it's best a multigenerational family saga that showcases the lure of the american dream and the resiliency of families i was surprised at a subtle humor that appeared through out james' story laughed out loud a couple times read this in one day","179":" alex george's debut novel is about a hard working immigrant german family frederick and jette meisenheimer who arrive in america in 1904 and settle in beatrice missouri and it tells about how the generations of the family live the american dream and assimilate narrated by the couple's grandson we read his romanticized views of his family and of the many characters' secrets ambitions and hopes and responses to the immigrant experience tied in too are historic events the thread of musical talent passed through the generations much irony and foreshadowing while i enjoyed reading about the characters but this book is very far from perfect i would have liked more detail rather than the sweeping generalizations nevertheless it was an enjoyable read","180":"following a family's history a lovely love story to america from an immigrant's stepping off the boat to his family spreading their roots and becoming an integral part of america written by his grandson","181":" i think 3 stars is being a bit generous this story is generational story about a family's immigration to america first of all i am not a fan of first person omniscient it rarely works and especially if the omniscient part is only some of the time so i could buy the book through the generations until it hit present tense then it stopped working for me and i did not like any of the characters i thought it was a book about several generations being unable to achieve any sort of self actualization","182":"a good old fashioned novel of immigration to america and the course of the family over several generations i wouldn't say it was overly dramatic things happen but it is much more subtle i loved the narrator's voice and felt like the story flowed really well parts of it reminded me of middlesex and parts reminded me of moon flower vine both books i really love i hope george writes more as i think he is a voice to watch","183":"wow a friend recommended this book and so i picked it up i am so glad i did it was amazing ever sentence skillfully crafted deep u0026amp true characters it speaks of true life and true family real in the best sense of the word now that i have finished the book i miss the characters if you like books with good character development and a realistic plot this is the book for you","184":"george's debut novel is amazing a compulsively readable epic spanning several generations of an immigrant american family a good american should appeal to all americans and i look forward to seeing more from this author review by lauren","185":" a good american is a memoir style fictional account of the meisenheimer family as told by james a second generation german american he recounts the stories and secrets of his family beginning with his grandmother and grandfather's immigration to america in 1904 and continuing through the next 100 years his stories are told with humor and candor and though lacking in emotional impact made for pleasant enough reading however following the story of frederick and jette the grandparents many many characters are introduced quickly and dispatched just as easily especially in the second half of the book without any real development and the larger themes of belonging and what it means to be a good american are explored only superficially","186":" a good american follows the path of a single family as they emigrate to america and become deeply rooted in the small town of beatrice missouri from the escape of the lovebird grandparents frederic and jette from germany through the present life of their grandson james the narrator of the family story the reader is immersed in a beautiful heartwarming tale of the characters that inhabit our lives the impact our random choices can make the secrets family keeps and the steady onward march of progress in the desire of fulfilling the american dream a good american is that rare novel where the scope is sweeping and yet the story is incredibly intimate the characters the language and of course the music are all created with beauty and care and george a brit does a wonderful job of tracing the changes in what it means to be an american across the generations do not be surprised to shed a tear at the end and have the desire to turn back to the first page and start again","187":"this was recommended to me by one of my library patrons it is story that encompasses several generations and deals with immigration race relations small towns and more loved it","188":"the story was entirely predictable the book reminded me of something i would have liked in junior high but i did not find it engrossing as a much better read adult the characters are one dimensional the plot is almost non existent but it would be perfect for a made for tv movie i classify this as a beach book as it is only good for a mindless summer read","189":" meh it started out really well then became tedious the surprise ending wasn't quite enough to salvage a 2 star it was ok to a 3 star i liked it the writing style was strange and almost seemed to adjust to the time period being described sort of formal at the beginning 1905 and becoming increasingly familar casual to the point where jerking off becomes a familiar phrase hated the trite chapter endings and little did i know my own tragedy was about to unfurl or some such drivel intended to segue into the next chapter felt very childish a story about immigrants to america morphs into a story about a family narrated by a miserable man very reminiscent of the narrator in the dreadful prayer for owen meany thankfully this one was a lot shorter and the narrator while miserable wasn't completely unlikable eh it was ok","190":"i really liked the beginning of this story and was interested to read about a different immigrant experience jette and frederick are both colorful and interesting characters and their journey from germany to new orleans and up the missippi river to missouri was entertaining once they settled down in the little german town of beatrice the story seemed to lose its momentum and the characters became a little boring the story is told to us by jette and frederick's grandson james and through his eyes we see three generations of his family grow up and grow old in this small midwestern town","191":"i loved all the character this book had it was so full of descriptive detail that i was able to easily put myself in every scene i stayed interested in the story and enjoyed reading about the different generations in this family and what being american meant to each i was not able to emotionally connect as much as i would have wanted and couldn't find a tear to spare for any of the sad revelations a very interesting read though and one that really takes you back in time i loved it 4 stars","192":"this book was better than the drop and some luck but not quite on a level with all the light we cannot see hence i'd like to give it a 7 25 started slowly but built to a nice pace in the latter half an interesting inspection of what it was like to be newly arrived in this land of opportunity","193":"i was riveted from the beginning to the end the struggle to survive and the lasting love were wonderful themes from which the narrator drew","194":"4 5 stars loved this book overall the author did maybe a bit too much foreshadowing but the book was so readable that i'll forgive him for that can't wait to read this author's next book","195":"a real good book for those who enjoy multi generational family sagas with a historical background it is both funny and sad amazing first novel i hope to read another by this author soon","196":" let me start by saying that it took me quite some time to decide how i wanted to rate this book i was given the opportunity to read it in advance of its official release through a giveaway from goodreads i am grateful that i had this chance the plot of this book is nothing short of amazing and is written with an easy flow the detail is well written without being overbearing i read the book quite quickly and enjoyed in a sense tagging along with the meisenheimer family with as much as i enjoyed this book and as much praise as i would love to give it there were however three main issues that prevented me from giving it five stars the first problem nearly caused me to stop reading the book altogether i place a lot of stock in an author's integrity in this case i found it somewhat lacking this all came about through alex george's use of a character named rankin fitch as i came across this name something turned a switch in my head i knew i had seen it before rankin fitch is not a very common name in fact as it turns out not only is rankin fitch an attorney in a good american he is also an attorney in john grisham's runaway jury another odd point both john grisham and alex george are attorneys turned authors though the similarities with the character end there i was so incensed by the obvious theft of the name that i nearly quit reading what had the potential to be an amazing novel giving him the benefit of the doubt i searched for an indication that the use of the name was perhaps an homage there was no such mention the idea that the author would try to pull one over on the reader by having the laziness not to come up with an original name was insulting i am hoping that the author was wise enough to alter the name of this character prior to sending the book for it's final printing if not i hope that it does not cause other readers to give up hope as i nearly did the other two issues were less problematic but still prevented the story from attaining that five star mark the other issues an overused thesaurus and a heavy handed use of allusion for the most part the book's wording flows easily however there are occasional bits that are overloaded with ten dollar words in a way that detracts from the simple storytelling and may make the reader lose some interest momentarily george also has a tendency to end chapters with a sentence that will all too heavily indicate what is to occur later on in the book a sentence meant to highlight hey you should pay attention to this for later it's as if he doesn't have enough confidence in the reader's ability to link events or identify ironic situations the writing of these sections can stand alone and really doesn't need the additional assistance in fact the book would flow more smoothly without them they detract from the overall easy progression of the novel i would have really liked to have been able to give this book five stars it certainly had the potential and in all honesty had the character of rankin fitch been named anything else the chances of that happening probably would have been very high","197":"i had a number of people recommend this book it is about immigrants who come to america to escape but learn to love their new country the husband warms up more quickly but with time the wife comes around enjoyable read quick and easy","198":"http bibliophibian blogspot com 201","199":"this book tells the story of three generations of a family beginning with a couple who are immigrants from germany i listened to it on audio cd which is such a different experience for me than reading a book for the most part it was fascinating well told and the last third of the book was absolutely hilarious and had a twist the story is full of irony and serendipity the author does a great job bringing that out","200":"started out great but second half disappointing","201":"a good american by alex george 5 stars for first 3 4 of book 3 stars for the rest as a second generation american i identified with the epic tale of a family learning to live in a new country the hardships the joys i heard stories all my life about loving this new country not wanting to speak german in public because we are now americans my mother sitting with a dunce hat in the corner at school because she did not speak english every letter i received from my grandmother ended god bless america i felt as if i knew these characters i also identified with some of the locations in nyc and long island as i was born there and lived near music permeated the meisenheimer family as it did does mine it seems as if i was growing up all over again even though the narrator was born before me and our families had nothing in common except for german language german food music emigrating loves and losses but that is a great deal and the reason for 5 stars at this point alex george knows how to turn a phrase i found myself underlining words and phrases that were too good not to remember the creativity in some of his descriptions made this creative writing tutor chuckle allowing visions with greater depth the lights of the mirror ball bounced off the orthodontic strips on her teeth he moved with awkward staccato stiffness the author's writing at times was magical and humorous as the novel progressed times changed food changed morals changed affairs happened kids got in trouble teacher student relationships were unacceptable the thought of a ghost writer popped in my mind as i read the last section since it seemed quite far from the writing at the start there was a plot twist near the end but i had guessed it long before not totally obvious but available to a reader with a calculating mind and a bit of insight so downgrade to 3regardless the book remained at my side and in my hands as i could not leave it for long frankly i did rather rush through some of the more sordid tales at the end even tho written with humor some of it a tad odd and not my kind of funny the impact for me was to realize that we all have stories the good the bad the ugly we all have secrets of some kind our families all grow old new generations take over with new thoughts and ideas no matter how hard we trie to instill our ways my nostalgia was heightened and my desire to live life to the fullest in each moment was imprinted in my mind with a bold crescendo and fermata not to ignore how drastically important it is to experience family in all triumphs and disasters to love deeply to have a sense of humor and to never give up to always communicate and to realize that we are all human in all shapes and forms i enjoyed this read","202":"just a lovely read about three generations of an immigrant family it was so easy to read and beautifully written that i kept staying up later to read one more chapter all of the pain tears pathos and glories of a family becoming american four and half stars at least","203":"alex george artfully crafts a delightful story of generations of an immigrant family richly colored with well drawn characters and events through triumph and tragedy the story weaves itself into american fabric wonderfully written and narrated","204":"i loved this book a sweeping story that kept me looking forward to stolen moments when i could read more the author's note at the end of the book made me really like the writer","205":" one of the things that i rarely read are novels that cover the span of a hundred years i don't mind novels that play with time a little grandma's history mixed with the present or perhaps the majority of the life of a single person but i rarely pick up a book that covers the history of multiple generations turns out i don't enjoy it so much the first half of a good american by alex george is really interesting jette and frederick immigrate to america around the turn of the century and settle in beatrice missouri they are german as is the majority of the town they have a couple children and then frederick goes and joins wwi with predictable results the book continues on through american history with jette and her kids and grandkids the first half with the immigration experience and a lot of great detail about blues jazz and other music of the time is quite enjoyable i loved seeing them set up a life and the struggles to keep up with the times i often turned on songza to a blues or jazz playlist while i read turning songza on to a blues playlist is incredibly common for me but i have yet to learn to love jazz unfortunately the second half which begins about when the narrator is born completely changes the entire book is narrated by jette's grandson james so perhaps the change happens when it starts to talk about the parts of his life that he remembers but i much preferred to read his history the small bits of foreshadowing in the first half become and every other page bits of foreshadowing the believable history of a family in the first half becomes a series of ridiculous people and their actions and deaths by the end it felt like a parody of a family history the focus on music changed and was not longer about the love of music itself that said the book does have some really great moments i loved watching frederick learn english and the romance between cora and joseph james's father there's a scene in new orleans at the beginning where frederick hears jazz for the first time that is wonderful there are some memorable characters as well lomax who plays music and cooks soul food polk who works at the bar freddy who has the best story of anyone except frederick himself there are also quite a few that seem to be there for impact morrie the gentle giant rankin fitch mrs fitch the entire sub plot of reverend gresham and teddy i'm sure i won't stop thinking about some of the final revelations for a few days and i'm going to have to go back and re read a couple pivotal scenes to look for clues overall though it was just ok and i don't see myself ever choosing to read or recommend it this is a paid review for blogher book club but the opinions expressed are my own","206":" stunning just stunning meet the meisenheimer family through the eyes of grandson james as he relates the story of his immigrant family through nearly a century of american history peppered with remarkable characters a jazz trumpeter who cooks a mean gumbo a promiscuous school teacher a dwarf and of course frederick and jette need i say more you will laugh out loud then be brought to tears the prose is oftentimes poetic ie my grandmother's life had been one long opera this novel is priceless and a gem of a read","207":"i was surprised that i didn't love this book it purports to weave music through its pages but i mainly felt a theme of disappointment and despair sure over the course of three generations many friends or family members are going to die but pretty much everyone you meet in this book dies or leaves plus they get robbed have their pets killed lose their farms and don't live the lives they hoped for in their youth very depressing as for the writing about a third of the way into the book jarring cliffhangers or hooks are inserted abruptly at the end each chapter and carried through the rest of the book they made the book seem cheap i really wanted to love this book as it is by a local author and about life in a small missouri town but i didn't","208":"disappointing there were too many side stories that went nowhere i expected a great conflict but the book was overall dull","209":"i liked this book a lot","210":"absolutely fabulous read definitely one to watch for this winter review to come closer to pub date","211":" thank you good reads giveaway for this wonderfully written historical work of fiction it is difficult to imagine how an author from england was able to so fully immerse himself in the lives of immigrants share their experiences from 1904 the present day and make us laugh and weep with them through it all the foreshadowing throughout the novel allows you to prepare yourself for tragedies without taking away from the suspense the weaving of the families and their interactions and disappointments in this small missouri town sweeps you along through the years until you feel like you know them intimately when it is time for them to leave us you feel their loss as though they really are someone you've known and shared their struggles and successes with definitely a book i hated to see come to a close","212":"3 5 this was a generational saga that started in the 1900's and meanders up to the present day it's a nice story albeit a tad long there were several lol passages and plenty of heartache too","213":"finally finished it was hard to get into enjoyed that it took place in missouri i did like it","214":"this is an historical novel that follows an immigrant couple and their children grandchildren and great grandchildren and their lives in a small middle american town the narrator is probably the most bland of all the family members which makes the reading sluggish especially when he is narrating his time i enjoyed the first portion of the book which focuses on the first generation however as the family expands the narration drifts and begins to lose focus there were also unfair reveals about some of the family drama during these events i felt the author was being dishonest with his readers and that put me off for the ending of the story","215":"i thought it was a great read the way each new generation learned to adapt with the progress of the world was very interesting","216":"this book is one of my favorite kinds to read it spans over an almost 100 year period following an american family that began with the immigration of a young couple frederick and jette from germany it tells an absolutely beautiful story of them and the generations that followed a lovely sweeping family epic that i would read again funny tragic uplifting hopeful sweet sad one of the best i've read this year","217":" a quiet and unpretentious story of three generations simply trying to live the american dream when jette finds herself pregnant she and her fiancee frederick flee to america wedding on the ship they find themselves in beatrice missouri there their son joseph is born followed by daughter rosa frederick embraces his new home and wants to be a good american for jette though she longs for germany and the home and family she left behind with time she too adapts to her new home interspersed is the historical events and how the family weathers two world wars the great depression discrimination and the kennedy assassination singing and music are the common bond shared throughout the generations i felt part of the family sharing their heartaches and joys","218":"i love multi generational stories and this one caught me both laughing and then crying i never thought i'd end up loving this book this much","219":"a gift from my brother this book was interesting in that it was written by an englishman about a german family who came to america before wwi having been smitten with the downton fever i enjoyed a different perspective on the wwi and ii phenomena from this angle the author was a master of giving every type of experience to the main character which felt a bit over the top to me","220":"more of of 3 5 for sure a very likable book with likable characters with playful prose that made for good storytelling","221":"really enjoyed the first 2 3 of the book unfortunately i felt it started to bog down in the last 1 3 finish strong as my dad would say","222":"i liked but did not love this book it is the story of a young immigrant who moves to missouri with his wife in the early 1900's they have a child who subsequently has other children so it basically ends up to be the story of 3 generations i can't say i got any great insights into the human condition or anything maybe i was expecting too much","223":"enjoyed this story of a german immigrant family in missouri the book follows the family from the early 1900's when the grandparents met through their journey to america then follows the family's story after they settle in a small missouri town","224":"i enjoyed how this book covered multiple generations of a beloved family i laughed cried it was a good read","225":"loved the book and the generational aspect i thought the book was much stronger at the beginning and lost something in the ending i can't quite explain it other than that but i still recommend this as a great read","226":"loved this family saga","227":" this is a must read to all american's who have ancestors that have came from far away lands this book moved me unlike any other book i have read i pictured my ancestors that also came from germany and what they must faced in forging a new start in a land where most people were kind but some took advantage of their ability to learn must read to understand this part very funny i laughed i cried and i cheered through this book and will miss these lovable characters like i miss those that have i lost throughout the years i cannot say it enough you must must must read this book thank you alex george for touching my life in a wonderful way those 6 years were worth the masterpiece you created","228":"a terrific well rounded tale a definite favourite for me for 2012","229":"i really enjoyed this tender gentle book told in the style of a memoir it traces the history of one american family the story was told with compassion and humour the second half of the book was a little slow at times as we moved from the grand sweep of history to the minutiae of the narrator's teenage years particularly his sexual angst however the ending wrapped things up beautifully an engaging book","230":"the flow of this story reminded me of forsest gump winding one character's life through time and intersecting with major historic events i really likes that you either live or hate the characters which keeps you wanting more","231":"i picked up this book after listening to an excellent radio interview with the author from the beginning something about the scope of the plot and the way the author uses words reminded me of steinbeck's east of eden but this book has it's own unique story and life i quickly grew to love all of the characters and the town they live in","232":"i loved this book it made me laugh out loud and cry real tears i was completely absorbed it's not often that i finish a book and want to read it again but this one already has me flipping back through the pages to reread portions loved it","233":"such an amazing story about a german couple who immigrates to america in the early 1900s fabulous read","234":"an enjoyable immigration story","235":"good multi generational tale of life coming to america missouri in the early 1900s that takes you through the end of the 20th century it's told in 1st person narration from the perspective of the grandson who tells the tales of his grandparents parents and siblings throughout the decades it keeps you reading even though there isn't a major climactic moment pay attention to the foreshadowing as there are some intriguing twists","236":"this was a nice fairly quick read i thought it was quite interesting to see how the decision of where to live in america was made and can imagine that thousands of others truly made the decision in such an unplanned way i think the author did an excellent job of presenting this family in such a way that i immediately cared a great deal about them u0026amp was intrigued to see what would happen to them over the generations","237":" from scanning the other reviews for this book i think i am in the minority when i say i really did not like this one i actually think i would have given it one star except the author looked cute in his little bio pic gah i just didn't like it for the life of me i can't understand how something like this gets published i'll say i liked it in the beginning the early tales of the first couples life in germany and then coming to new orleans but then i just got over it big time the foreshadowing at the end of each chapter so 7th grade and spoiler alert but seriously why did everyone die it started to be like a game with me by the end oh new person introduced into story they will most surely die a horrible death and what do you know they did the twists were just absurd to me when he had sex with the teacher in the piano room when his friend died from masturbating i seriously almost threw the book across the room too bad i was on the train and that probably would have resulted in an arrest for assault you know what i like retrospective books historical novels but this was just as lame as it gets sorry alex you're cute but stick to your day job","238":"although i loved the story of the his ancestors the authors own story is far less compelling which ruined the magic of the rest of the book for me would not recommend it","239":"so so good might be the best i have read all year","240":" i love to read books that are sweep me quickly into their story line whose words read like lyrics and prose that reads as beautifully as poetry alex george offers a book that you will long remember that has been elegantly and eloquently crafted in a way that i have not read in many years it is a book that i found myself reading paragraphs aloud to my husband simply because they were written in such a descriptive manner that you felt as though you were watching a movie \"always there was music \" the book opens with frederick an amateur opera singer serenading an unlikely girl named jette who is tall in stature and just as equal in her elegance u0026amp family upbringing frederick quickly woos jette in a whirlwind love affair and jette discovers she is pregnant forcing the couple to leave as quickly as possible from her family's disapproving eyes the year is 1904 jette and frederick board a ship to new orleans instead of their originally intended boat to new york when they discover that the boat is full \"what's the difference they're both new \" they say they end up settling in the tiny town of beatrice missouri where we meet a cast of unlikely characters who all find refuge in this german speaking town the book chronicles the journey of their family through prohibition the great depression and the kennedy assassination despite the depth of the book and the plots it carries it moves swiftly and is well executed leaving the reader hanging until the final page i loved this book so much that i emailed the author when i finished it to tell him just how much i enjoyed this book he immediately replied with heartfelt thanks for the compliments which makes a reader like me feel even more connected to this amazing story i can't recommend this one enough not enough great reads for you check out our books section of our site for monthly recommendations and ideas for making reading a priority again in your busy mom life","241":" i almost gave this book 5 stars the writing is just wonderful not for it's beauty but for the perfect word or phrasing just where it belongs an effortless read with quirky but very believable people and no real plot it's a fictional family's history but plenty of twists and turns and a totally unexpected surprise ending it lost 1 2 a star for changing in the middle from one story to another which left me rather perplexed however it did come together in the end read it you can't help but enjoy it","242":"i read very little fiction but i enjoyed this one until the ending that i thought was unsatisfactory i like family history like books still dream of writing a good one i'm still attracted to anything missouri and anything with german immigrants as i am still researching mine when you put german immigrants into missouri i really get excited i did like one quote p 353 my grandmother's life had been one long opera there had been drama heroes villains improbably plot twists all that but mot of all there had been love great big waves of it crashing ceaselessly against the rocks of life bearing us all back to grace describes me and i hope my children and grandchildren some day also think it describes me the love i've received the love i hope i've given","243":"fun read for book group sweeping novel over 4 generations and immigration story to america while it wasn't necessarily remarkable it was a very easy pleasant read","244":"something about this book irked me it was somehow cheesy annoying but it wasn't badly written it just felt somehow cliche","245":"couldn't finish it too boring and didn't seem deep at all not sure why this was ever recommended to me i tried to like it really","246":" let me first say that i almost returned this book to the library i currently have a large obligation cough thesis cough and books have been my temptation for this past semester needless to say i decided to read the first chapter to see if it was worth keeping an hour later and several chapters later i was still reading the book i eventually forced myself to put the book down to work on my paper by 3 am i decided that i would read one more chapter and once again i failed at that goal crawling into bed at 6am i decided i would finish the book when i woke up now that i am finished the book i am extremely happy that i did pick up this book george has masterfully created a family's history from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day interweaving history life romance and heartbreak with a graceful touch george allows the readers to grow up with the meisenheimer family through several different generations george also incorporates elements that you hoped he would explain in the next chapter only for them to make an appearance fifty pages later even now i have am having an \"aha\" moment of little information he disclosed this book will make you laugh and then break your heart it is must read for this year","247":"this is book is great when it's telling an immigrant story kind of falls apart when it morphs into a coming of age novel","248":" i'm being generous it's really more like 2 5there times reading this book that i really didn't know why i was still reading but i kept going hoping there was going to be a payoff at the end it started charmingly enough the story of a doomed love affair between two young germans of different social classes who flee their home and family to be together in america at the turn of the twentieth century and the author does know how to turn a phrase even if the tone of the book is relentlessly upbeat for the first 2 3 and unwaveringly melancholy for the last 1 3 the book never finds a heart though it's a generational story spanning over a hundred years and it feels like alex george was trying to pull off something like gabriel garcia marquez's stunning classic one hundred years of solitude but he just doesn't have anything close to the skill and genius of marquez as a result this book reads like several seasons of a televised family drama every episode in the family's history is given equal weight and time on the page the most horrifying lynching is treated with the same brevity and emotional resonance as adolescent masturbation george should have written a series of short stories instead of attempting an epic family historical novel i think his writing is much more suited to a shorter form","249":"many of the blurbs about this book describe it as funny but i found it rather more melancholy however it is a wonderful book very well written lovely story generations of meisenheimers and their lives in america thanks to help received in unexpected and long reaching ways a few surprising elements and intriguing twists fully satisfying strange but i thought that every character in the book had a more interesting story than james the narrator","250":"a sprawling story about four generations of the meisenheimer family beginning with frederick and jetta who moved to the u s from germany in 1904 they leave with no real plan except to get away from jetta's disapproving parents life deposits them in the little town of beatrice missouri where they put down roots i found the story interesting enough to stick with but the writing seemed a little vague at times there were long stretches without any actual scenes or specific action happening i also had occasional problems with the narrator being a character in the book and yet coming across as an omniscient narrator how did he know the thoughts of people who died before he was born and who never shared those thoughts with anyone else still i did care about the characters enough to want to know what was going to happen to them","251":"an absolute brilliant debut novel that will want you to delve into your family roots and make you want to be a better american","252":"i laughed out loud i cried my jaw literally dropped open at more than one point what a fantastic story i am excited to read that he is writing another book it cannot be done soon enough for me did i mention this was a fantastic story five stars","253":"interesting intergenerational story about a german immigrant family who settled in the midwest and made their living in restaurants told through the point of view of the grandson of the original immigrants you can definitely tell you're reading a man's story interesting scope and caused me to think about the time period it was interesting to me because of my own german heritage but in the end just okay","254":"i thoroughly enjoyed reading through this novelized story of four generations beginning in germany venturing over to new orleans u0026amp settling in missouri told though a grandson's eyes it mesmerized me heartbreaking u0026amp lovely a good read","255":"i enjoyed this although i felt it began stronger and more focused than it ended i thought the author did an excellent job depicting the mixed emotions that someone leaving their home and coming to a new country would would experience the book also brought to life the ordinary tasks involved in daily living over the years in a small town in a very real way there was a bit of a twist near the end that was not fully explained and i even went back to see if i had missed something but as far as i could tell there was nothing to miss this book could have been a five star for me had the author not gone off in so many directions and had he not thrown the twist into the mix it just seemed to me that he had too many things he tried to cram into the one book","256":" the book gave a great representation of life as an immigrant who had to run from their country it clearly showed that the american dream was possible back in the 1900's and the most interesting thing about the book is to compare it to a book like tcboyle's book tortilla curtain on immigrants today from mexico the experience is completely different in a good american things were hard but possible to achieve goals and integrate into society in boyle's book things were represented as clearly not possible there were times i was reading the book that i thought it was very good and other times i thought sections were slow and irrelevant to the story line","257":"not literature but a nice combination of john irving and garrison keillor","258":"i just didn't love it not even close this story meanders lazily through a family's history it's made up of long stretches of dullness punctuated by something unusual that comes out of nowhere more often than not at one point the main character makes a statement that perfectly sums up the author's writing he says this time i just wrote for my own amusement the journey not the destination became the thing the story drags on over such a long time that when the author finally starts tying up loose ends you've forgotten that the ends existed and needed tying up to begin with it there's so much in it that is gratuitous giving it 3 stars was generous it is really more of a 2 1 2 star read","259":"i really liked this story of 3 generations of a german immigrant family some unnecessary descriptions of teenage boy activities but the rest was great","260":" one of the best books i've read in 2012 savored the last few chapters which were filled with unexpected surprises great writing i would love to discuss this with someone or my book group the family experiences so many deaths during the three generations of this book don't know why and at one point a dwarf and a giant die at the same time i was trying to find a deeper meaning in this there are also important scenes related to religion and faith and the book poses questions about whether we receive the blessings in life simply based on our faith and prayers i highly recommend this and good luck putting it down","261":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book had an enjoyable meandering pace i thoroughly enjoyed the first three quarters but towards the end i thought the writing became a but choppy i wasn't that interested to read about the fourth generation who were only introduced and mentioned almost is passing in the final chapters","262":"i knew from the first page that a good american was going to be a great read i love a well written family epic and this one is particularly beautiful there were times when i wished for a little more development of pivotal events i loved the family and i wanted to know more which is why i am giving it only four stars","263":"i loved this story migration hard work generations loved this story am i repeating myself","264":"i enjoyed reading the book but it wasn't until the last 50 pages or so that it really resonated with me these are the two lines that really made it worth the read and pulled it all together we cannot exist without our histories they are what define us and the comforts of home and family wash away every disappointment by the end it's much more than a generational story","265":"this was an excellent book that began with a young couple in germany who immigrates to america the story spans many generations i would have never guessed that the author was a recent immigrant from new zealand","266":"just a really really good book","267":"good story of german immigrants who wind up in missouri raise their family father dies at the end of ww ii and the family works together in a their resturant covers three generations enjoyable read","268":"a very interesting family saga that kept you interested almost to the end i would highly recommend this book about family and becoming an american","269":"loved this book my grandparents were also european immigrants to this country i am sure there were many similarities in their experiences great characters and a wonderful story with a great ending this book would make a great movie","270":"loved it i laughed and cried slowed reading down at end because i didn't want to finish it","271":" a multigenerational family epic a good american's amiability and lack of pretension differentiate it from the usual saga esque sufferfest e g the treatments of leon uris or james a michener this light whirlwind is loosely told by family grandson james meisenheimer like any rtrs the story unfolds in alternating phases of constriction and expansion an initial period of wretchedness and stepping out into the world is followed by modest early successes which are in turn countered by a central crisis a period of maturation is followed by a final ordeal and a final union the latter a big act of liberation as we say in missouri that dog'll hunt frederick and jette fall in love in hanover germany around 1900 while they are happy to find each other everything else is pretty damned miserable for these two misfits who share a passion for food and music themes recurring throughout the generations after jette gets pregnant they boogie away from her disapproving family and are soon the hottest young couple in tiny beatrice mi there they begin a generations long tradition of restauranteuring then frederick's death in world war i throws the young family into crisis suicides murders births successes failures--all very booker ish constrictions and expansions--push the narrative forward two generations with deft fast descriptions of dozens of characters which sometimes approach pastiche after james's mother dies while birthing his younger twin brothers the drama seems to lessen in intensity and concludes with a protracted period of descendants happily going forth and multiplying not as immigrants but as 'reglar 'mericans james is increasingly preoccupied with self identity but one gets the sense that the meisenheimers have achieved booker's ideal state complete loving union lasting indefinitely into the future find reviews of books for men at books for dudes books for dudes the online reader's advisory column for men from library journal copyright library journal","272":"enjoy the first half but the second half was way too much teenage sexual angst pg 13","273":"quite possibly the most elegantly heartbreaking novel i will ever read","274":"this book i just finished reading july 2012 and since i had a grandmother who was a german jew and immigrated to this country the book meant a lot to me","275":"perfect summer read reminds me of fried green tomatos in the midwest with an immigration twist","276":"great characters and excellent storyline good three generation saga with a couple of twists that only life can deal could have done without the dwarf character","277":"3 5 stars a multi generational story starting from german immigrants in early 1900's it focuses on the changes a small missouri town and family absorb as they move thru the 1900's it was a bit slow moving at times a it seemed to really focus on the ordinariness of small town life however the end has a very surprising twist","278":"i received a good american through a giveaway on bookreads it is the story of three generations who began in germany and ended up in missouri the first half of the book was more intriguing the characters were defined and had much harder life obstacles to overcome i enjoyed the story as a whole but would have loved a more intense second half","279":"this book was wonderful i laughed i cried i suffered many moments of shock the stories and moments family members keep from one another this was truly a wonderful refreshing read i suggest it","280":"i really liked these books i felt that the first part of the book about james' family was a great story the second part of the book where james relates the story of his generation i felt became another book entirely i laughed so much at the improbable series of events i give it a good rating for keeping my interest and making me laugh","281":"loved it highly recommended for book clubs and enyone who would enjoy a multi generationl tale that is well planned well plotted well written quite pleased with it","282":" this book starts out so well the writing so amazing that i've given it an initial rating after only a few chapters really really excellent writing style and so far lovable clearly drawn characters alex george a newcomer to america himself writes an multi generational immigrant tale in a good american this elegy to the rites of forging a new life in a new land traces father to son in a rich stew of food and music and love george's writing is generous and his characters are boldly drawn","283":"dollar tree store keep 'em coming this bargain novel is really well done alex george's writing style is very descriptive u0026amp flowing it surprised me when i read in his acknowledgments at the end that the first draft of this manuscript had been rejected obviously he had some excellent guidance in order to produce a well done book especially in view of the complications of tracing the lives u0026amp times of four generations as i read it particularly towards the end one of his passages reminded me of how serendipitously timely the book is when one of the descendants morrie marries rita a lawyer who is also a beautiful brown skinned puerto rican morrie's mother adeline is obviously discomforted alex george writes morrie and rita are planning a small wedding in manhattan we're all wondering whether we will ever see them again adeline has been staggering around the town as if she's mislaid a winning lottery ticket as she contemplates the prospect of mixed race grandchildren i want to tell her that frederick her great grandfather would be pleased because this is the american way we are all immigrants a glorious confection of races and beliefs united by the rock that we live on as the years wash over us and new generations march into the future families histories are subsumed into this greater narrative we become simply americans adeline is wondering if she will be able to love babies who are not quite like her but she's missing the point they'll be exactly like her they'll be americans too only more so","284":"a couple fall in love in hanover germany at the end of the nineteenth century her mom is not in favor of it so when they discover that a baby is on the way they emigrate to america this is a tale of a family through four generations who settled in missouri they lived through trials tribulations and joy","285":"the story of a family from the beginning of the twentieth century to today loved the insight into the immigrant mind the patriotic theme and a good story besides good writing please write next book","286":"probably a 2 5 but not quite a three its a typical epic american story and as also happens frequently the first narratives characters are more compelling than their children and grandchildren the characters are well drawn and believable its worth the read if you like family stories spanning generations","287":" i really enjoyed this book a lot more than i thought i would it's now one of my favorite adult novels the writing style has a storytelling vibe to it which makes it very pleasurable to read it is simple and sentimental and it is the thing i like most about this book the story itself is wonderfully fulfilling and i was content at the end which suits the book much more than a grand dramatic ending the plot is interesting yet ordinary a combination that can be hard to achieve i think most people can relate on some level to the story","288":"this one came highly recommended by bookreporter com it took me a while to get into it but i definitely liked how the loose ends were tied up at the end the immigrant experience seems to be one that i'm reading about lately and this one was more unique focusing on german immigrants in missouri","289":" i enjoyed this family saga which begins with the immigration of a german couple to the united states in 1904 a baby on the way the title of the book initially refers to frederick the immigrant father reflecting his intention and his love of his new country as well as his influence on his wife and later generations of his family the narrator is his grandson and the story extends into his old age many reviewers describe the book as humorous but i would caution that the reader must wade through a great deal of family tragedy before much humor is evident i did however laugh out loud at one section involving the local preacher","290":"the book starts slow meticulously tracing the story of one american family things are good things go bad yada yada i thought i was in the middle of a pretty good occasionally whimsical tale yawn the writing is a little self conscious but it goes down easy a solid three but one of those books you forget shortly after reading but then something clicked for me i think it was the thread of music that runs through the generations of the family meisenheimer the characters started to feel more real more distinct and their stories were more engaging and the ending was a nice twist made me go back and re examine earlier parts of the story and that's always a good thing when an author makes you re trace your mental steps also when i woke up this morning i was thinking about the meisenheimers they'd followed me into a new day also good so three and a half stars","291":" thank you to g p putnam's sons for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review wow i don't know that i would have rushed out to pick this up if i hadn't won a copy but that's what makes the early reviewer's program so great for me i get exposed to books i wouldn't normally gravitate to and sometimes the result is an absolute treat like reading a good american once i started reading i was so hooked into the story that i could not put it down the story begins with jette and frederick in 1904 germany they get in some hot water and they are forced to flee and wind up in america not speaking a word of english in short order they find themselves in missouri where there is a large german population through the years they establish their family as they join their community and work to become a good american the book is populated with a large cast of fascinating characters many times someone will enter the story just when the family needs their help the most a particular favorite was lomax the family is witness to a lot of pivotal moments in history as well as lot of wonderful and heartbreaking events in their lives through it all the meisenheimer's hold tight through the bonds of love family and music i don't want to give too much away i went into this book not really knowing more than the bare bones of the plot and i loved how the book unfolded for me the story is an excellent one and i highly recommend it the characters come alive and you genuinely root for them to succeed i especially loved the character of jette particularly in the beginning of the novel she was the foundation rock of her entire family i am amazed at how much story the author got in in only 400 pages this a charming family saga that is a joy to read","292":" this was a very interesting story told over several generations of an immigrant family in mid missouri narrated by one of the younger members of the family this novel takes us through the travails of the meisenheimer family's struggles to fit in and survive in their new country after going through all their ups and downs with a fair bit of humor thrown in i grew attached to the individuals and regretted each of their passings this book surprised me i liked it more and more as i went along it was just a good story","293":" i got this book to listen to in the car and when it first started i wished i was reading instead of listening to it the characters were interesting and i loved the writing it seemed like a world i wanted to get lost in a luxury i can't afford while driving but about a quarter of the way through the book the character who i thought to be the main character died i realized then that the author intended to pass the baton to another character the whole book in fact turned out to be a series of stories ending in death and the passing of the baton granted it's a genealogy story covering many generations but i got frustrated as soon as i got into the story of the next character it changed again worse as the book progressed it seemed to run out of steam years flew by then decades between events before long it disintegrated into a list of events rather than a story in a way i though it reflected the way we romanticize our ancestors imagining their lives to be so much more interesting than ours the author definitely was more interested in the people in the beginning of the book near the end it feels as if he couldn't wait for the book to be over which subsequently is how i felt","294":" i can't decide between four and five stars so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt i really really liked this but is it going to go down as one of my favorites time will tell this story spans over three generations starting with a young german couple who fall in love and immigrate to america they settle in missouri and this is where the next few generations are born and raised it is told by their grandson it's fiction i love american stories and this moves from pre wwi to prohibition to the depression to wwii through the 50's and 60's and then with bigger jumps continues on to end in 2004 it has all the love tragedy and whims of real life the only reason i am hesitant to give this 5 stars is that the grandson who is telling the story ends up having a boring adulthood and never has a family of his own also near the end there is tension about a kid in the family who marries a puerto rican girl but the year is 2004 and i didn't find this tension believable i understand that this is a small town but maybe if it was the 60's one aspect i really loved is that the grandson telling the story and his three brothers sing barbershop together p s the author's picture on the back flap is so handsome","295":"loved this book so well written with fascinating characters i felt like i knew these folks would love to be in such a family but of course that makes me wonder what untold stories are waiting to be told in my own family tree we always grow up dreaming of escaping our hometown only to find it is where our heart truly lies","296":"i liked that the story was written from the voice of an adult grandson telling the story about his grandparents journey to american i enjoyed hearing the story of his grandparents and his own parents and siblings toward the end however the story slowed for me when the storyteller began to focus too much on his own part of the story which i didn't find as interesting but all in all i'm glad i read it","297":"the book begins a century ago in germany where the large opera singing frederick meisenheimer falls in love with the robust ungraceful jette and woos her with a song from over a garden hedge their enthusiastic walks and conversations lead to an enthusiastic enjoyment of one another and the inevitable happens jette becomes pregnant fleeing jette's unforgiving mother and a village where they have no future the two embark upon a journey that takes them to new orleans where they marry and then meet a black cornet player named lomax whose kindness saves them from ruin he sends them upriver where jette's labor forces them to settle in beatrice missouri the rest of the novel unfolds generation by generation one unforgettable character at a time over the sweeping backdrop of american history i can't remember the last time i read a story that covered a century so comprehensively but that also helped me get to know characters so well that i laughed with them cried with them and gasped at the choices they made or witnessed as a history lover i could identify with the narrator james looking back over photographs and old marriage licenses trying to make sense and meaning of the past james' commentary made him and his flawed but colorful family very endearing from world wars to prohibition to the assassination of president kennedy alex george gives world events emotional resonance and life through the unforgettable characters he creates reminiscent of forest gump for its connection to the past and for its profound emotional impact i have no doubt that a good american will inspire readers everywhere if you are a fan of epic family drama you will love this novel","298":"frederick and jette fall in love and escape germany and jette's outraged mother and so begins the multi generational tale of the meisenheimer family in beatrice missouri a good read","299":"great read story of immigrant germans who come to america for freedom and end up in a little town in missouri the book about their lives and the following generations is funny and interesting and sad even has a bit of a twist","300":"this book is a great tribute to all of the people who have emigrated to america which is just about all of us i loved it","301":"an all too familiar tale that never really rises above some of the common stories that many of our immigrant families share it does include an angry suicidal dwarf and a randy female music teacher but aside from that it is all a little humdrum","302":"i loved the writing style but the way it ended was so abrupt and anticlimactic it ended up feeling like a waste of time which was disappointing given the fun characters and interesting story line","303":"i couldn't put this book down it is a sweeping tale that covered 100 years and several generations of a family and it does it with so much beauty it is heart warming romantic incredibly sad at times and altogether a very moving book","304":" this was a first reads give away pros i really enjoy anything about american immigrant history it is fun to read about people coming here the when and why of it all there are likable characters and it's also always fun to read about generations of a family versus just the initial couple a lot of chuckles and some very laughable situations and one or two burst out laughing spots cons there are some mild crudities here and there eventually by the time you get to the third generation there is one character who is really fond of masturbation seriously this is not an element that needs to be covered over and over additionally there is a teacher in town who seduces teen boys it happens i don't object to that as a part of the story in fact the circumstances surrounding this teacher's seductions and the situations that result from it add some of the best moments to the story but one scene is a bit descriptive and for me that goes into the yuck i don't want to read this category","305":"i had a really hard time getting into this book although there was nothing discernibly wrong with it the writing is solid the story is interesting so why was i struggling with it and then it hit me there are huge sections without dialogue in fact most of the story is written in narrative form which makes sense from the pov of a grandson who wasn't even born for the beginning of the story it's told with the familiarity of a lifetime's listening to the stories of parents and grandparents the problem with this is that there is an almost lack of connection with the characters even when someone dies it is mentioned cursorily moving on to the next chapter without giving the reader a chance to feel grief life and death chatted casually over a cup of coffee in a more positive spin i loved the feel of missouri i've never traveled there myself but i was still able to conjure a vivid image from the book's descriptions by the time the narrator's story arrives at his own childhood i was able to become a little more entrenched in the story and for this reason was a little disappointed by the way it wrapped up at the end it was all tied up nice and tight no loose threads but i felt that the story closed with a sigh","306":"discovered this through goodreads and really enjoyed it touching honest epic just a great read i'm an author myself and it makes me happy when i read something that makes me say hmm i wish i wrote that well done love bomb and the pink platoon","307":"slows down at the end but overall delightful read it","308":" i grew up listening to the family stories of my german ancestors so i was immediately attracted to this book although i found the sections and chapters a bit episodic they present a lot of themes akin to many immigrants from all over i only wish it would have explored these themes a little deeper at some points it felt like george was trying to squeeze in too many details and the jumps in time between chapters were unpredictable making it hard to know exactly what year or where i was at in the timeline of their lives overall though i found this to be a good enjoyable read i live in missouri in the same town as the author so it felt local to me","309":"loved this book charming epic concise and filled with rich characters a great read i hated to find myself on the last page of be sure to read the author's note at the end","310":"i love historical fiction u0026amp this is a great story there were a few great surprises u0026amp i was sad to finish this book","311":"interesting tale of an immigrant family starting back in germany in 1904 to almost the present day written by an immigrant himself from london who lives in missouri good believable characters and some twists and surprises a pleasant read good for book clubs","312":"i liked this book the story spans the ages from newly arrived immigrants to the age of fast food good characters interesting plot nice twist at the end worth reading","313":" i really enjoyed this one i grew up in central mo in proximity to the fictional beatrice mo george made it so real to me that i searched for it imagining that i had missed one if mo's many small town's filled with descendants of german immigrants he integrates a myriad of sub plots in the main narrative in a believable and thought provoking manner although some of his unifying devices were a bit too apparent they definitely worked i have 4 people lined up to share my copy with and will definitely recommend it to my book club buddies","314":"surprising twist at the end","315":"in 1904 in hanover germany frederick and jette fall in love when jette discovers she is pregnant the couple flees to america by chance they sail to new orleans and then make their way to beatrice missouri there the couple learns to be americans george does a masterful job of telling the immigrant experience through generations of the family an engrossing read","316":"just okay it was kind of a depressing read and i was hoping for it to be a little more interconnected then it was disappointing","317":"started out slow but interesting read about one german's family sowing its roots in rural america","318":"i did enjoy reading this book till about 3 4 the way through the novel starts off with the story of a young couple emigrating from germany to the united states the author did a wonderful job of developing these characters and getting the reader to care about them even the second generation story was compelling however by the third generation i felt that the author was trying hard to get everyone in the story regardless of how interesting their story may be i would have much preferred the end of the book focusing on maybe one descendant who was still finding their hopes and dreams in the united states regardless of setbacks the story just fell flat at the end instead of a good novel about immigrant americans the novel read like someone's christmas letter catching us up with one or two sentences about each and every family member boring this novel had potential to be great but got lost in the end","319":"i am from a very very small rural community in nebraska i love this book just because it could be anyone's story in an small rural town around it rings so true even down to the odd and and unusual events to the way people act and are","320":"a tender tale of family that invites the reader into its fold","321":"i loved this book it was absolutely beautifully written and left me wanting to cry as well as laugh out loud it is the story of 20th century america told through one family's stories i loved it's themes about family and what it means to be american the author does a great job ending each chapter with a one line statement foreshadowing what is to come that makes putting this book down very difficult the plot has more twists and turns than san francisco roadways and the characters are lovable and believable there is plenty of fodder for conversation which would make this an excellent choice as a book club book i couldn't recommend this book enough","322":"a story about three generations of a family immigrated from germany in 1903 to a small town in missouri it was well written and held my interest from start to finish this is not a remarkable wow type novel but a portrait of the immigrant experience in an ordinary way an easy read","323":"i loved this novel the romance the history the tragedy the love great writer","324":" frederick and jette are two german youth in love in early 20th century things happen ahem and they find themselves on the outs with jette's mother worried about what drastic measures her mother might take for the sake of the family's reputation jette urges frederick to go to america where they can start a new life they end up making their way into america through new orleans rather than through new york which sets the course of their lives forever as they haphazardly plant their family roots in beatrice missouri their story climbs and reaches out revealing the colorful branches of the meisenheimer tree ahh where do i start with this novel first off i loved the way the author described music as it was played or sung here are a couple of examples he delivered languid anthems shimmering with funeral grace stately marches their formal pomp showered by share syncopation and breezy romps melodic lines prancing onward light as air they swooped and rumbled creating layered confections of a cappella harmony cross pollinations their voices would stack up with exquisite precision for a dazzling instant then they would move on tearing down the edifice they had just created and constructing another of equal wonder in its place their last note a big fat sunbeam of harmony that refracted through the room in warm shafts of beauty rang out for several beats too long the singers reluctant to bring the music to an end along this same thread his metaphors gave beauty to an otherwise tragic sentence it was the war's final shake of its monstrous fist second it was relatable in ways that all families have their story they experienced disappointed lost opportunities dumb luck and brute honesty i fell in love with the characters frederick and jette joseph and cora their children and friends that seemed like family like lomax all of the characters played a part regardless of how big or small in telling the meisenheimer story the meisenheimer legacy is revealed through events throughout their lives birth death coming of age marriages love affairs jobs and friendships this story played like a movie in my mind to quote author erika robuck reminiscent of forrest gump there are witty dialogues funny misunderstandings heart twisting tragedies ironical unveilings and throw you for a loop plot twists throw in a stubborn german heritage and you have a great story i was entertained throughout the entire book which garners a big ya gotta read this from me plus he lives in missouri okay maybe that is a strike against him he lives in the midwest plus you will someday be able to say i read the book like so long ago while you are sitting in the movie theater noshing popcorn waiting for the 203 previews to get over to see the main feature a good american be a good american and give this book a chance","325":"read as a book group selection enjoyed the family history and especially the setting of missouri","326":"this is a mufti generational story of the meisenheimer family immigrating to the u s and settling in missouri it was a good read despite not being my favorite genre","327":"a good read similar style to trigiani s the shoemakers wife nice story","328":"loved this book i really liked the different generations and of course that it was set in missouri","329":"i enjoyed this intergenerational novel about a family i had a hard time putting it down at times","330":" a family saga covering four generations beginning in 1904 when frederick meisenheimer and jette furste leave thier homeland and flee to new york but end up in new orleans and then up the mississippi to missouri where frederick hopes to find work they sheer ordinariness of their lives is the hallmark of this book we see the immigrant experience as the family traverses history world war i prohibition the great depression and world war ii beatrice mo is populated by unforgettable characters who serve as archetypes for the american experience at its core this is a novel about being an outsider and the universal search for home","331":"i loved the first half but second half seemed more tedious great characters","332":"in george's debut novel james meisenheimer tells the story of his family clan from 1900s hanover germany where frederick woos jette with opera arias to beatrice missouri where the immigrants settle and become an integral part of the community it's a warm hearted amusing story full of quirky minor characters among them a giant and a dwarf with a definite debt to john irving music is the joy and legacy of many generations of meisenheimers who keep a family bar cum diner where some of the earliest ragtime is previewed the 1920s bring prohibition and racial tension but also sweet jazz music from lomax a black cornet player from new orleans from opera to jazz to barbershop quartets music keeps this family thriving george's novel certainly has its failings - chiefly that his only method for advancing the plot is to periodically kill off a character - but he's got definite talent and style frederick and jette are terrific characters and there is an absorbing if gentle mystery about the narrator's parentage this attempt at encapsulating the immigrant experience of becoming american a process george began in 2003 when he moved to missouri from the uk and started his own small law firm may not be entirely successful but it's a likable tale of family identity and community this review formed part of an article about books on music for bookkaholic","333":"my grandparents came from italy and most of the people i knew their grandparents came from another country this story makes you appreciate your own story","334":" eh i had such high hopes for this a good american is the story of a german couple who immigrates to the united states in 1904 they end up in missouri where the remainder of their story for generations to come plays out i was in love with this book at first the prose is absolutely beautiful and i was so intrigued by the characters of frederick and jette as they began their life in america however at some point and i can't really pinpoint where the story began to drag most of the characters i cared about died and the book took on this weird quality the chapters became very brief and they were mostly telling not showing in other words the author just started to use narration to move the story along often skipping long stretches of time with a single sentence each short chapter then seemed to end with a pithy little statement that usually held some kind of foreshadowing basically the book got a little too cheesy for my liking and the end really upset me with how bizarre and out of nowhere it seemed to be at 400 pages this book could have been great if it had just ended sooner this was a bummer overall especially since a good historical fiction epic is normally just my speed","335":"an immigrant himself england to the united states alex george writes a masterful story of a german immigrant family told by grandson james the author captured me from the start it's a funny sad and human story every american should read in short i loved it","336":"the characters just didn't go anything for me and i quit reading it after not very long at all an interesting part was that the immigrants went to missouri initially aiming for rocheport","337":"didn't finish this this historical fiction tried to span too much time and rarely moved me","338":"this was probably the best book i've read in a long time","339":"very interesting book about a young couple coming to america in the early 1900's from germany parts made me laugh and others were upsetting and surprising to me i thought the ending was a little rushed and left me wanting a little more information about the third generation of the meisenheimer family it was interesting for me since some of the locations mentioned in the book were in my native state of missouri","340":" a genealogist's dream read a sort of ultra american epic story traveling through generations a la isabel allende minus the supernatural stuff very much appealed to my obsession with family history wish a past relative wrote something like this about my family quick synopsis james meisenheimer recounts the story of his family starting with immigrant grandparents from germany and tales of his small missouri town spoilers ahoythe reason i only gave this book three stars is because i saw behind the curtain at times i was very aware that i was reading the author's first novel correction not his first novel which actually makes me like the book a little less i felt like the chapters adopted a predictable structure narrator introduces an interesting character narrator tells a few very interesting anecdotes about said character anecdote ties character into the main story of the family in some way narrator tells the story of how said character leaves the plot arc chapter ends with something like and he would never know how he had affected the family to me some of the character's ends were a little predictable as well but the big twist of james's mother was a pretty big shock to me i wish the story had built up to more but the author chose a quieter route and gave the drama to the twins alex george's talent lies most definitely in character development but in this sweeping format i didn't feel like enough time was spent with any one character especially since as i mention above we got a character's life story in the span of one or two chapters for his next book i hope the author chooses two or three grabber characters and flushes them out really well i also enjoyed the author's folksy style of writing which reads a little like mark twain's work that's probably the author's intent since two of the main characters actually travel up the mississippi by steamboat i will definitely be keeping my eye out for alex george's next work","341":" i had hopes for this multi generational family saga but the story fell far from my expectations it could be anyone's family history in that the immigrants arrive in the us have trouble adjusting then adjust then make a go of it then raise a family life goes on this way with nothing terribly compelling happening decisions are made consequences happen and life goes on the only unique part of the story is the part music plays in the family's life and their openness to people of all races that wasn't enough to make the story a page turner it was ho hum for me","342":"easy read very enjoyable","343":"really liked this book loved the time and age that it went through and the bittersweet story telling was very touching","344":" a good american begins in germany in 1904 the story of frederick and jette short for henriette who fall in love jette's parents consider it a bad match one they will never approve of so when jette falls pregnant and it is discovered by her mother there's only one option emigrating to america jette is heavily pregnant on the long journey over but the young couple marry and look forward to their bright new future in the land of opportunity the book is narrated not by frederick or jette but by their grandson james he guides us through their journey across to new orleans and the choices that lead them to settle in beatrice missouri it spans in detail three generations with frederick managing a local bar and then purchasing it for his family the birth of frederick and jette's children and their lives growing up with the choices they made we see the arrival of our narrator james and his three brothers and track this generation as they grow the story chronicles the changes of a nation as it goes through two world wars prohibition and startling progess frederick and the future generations of his family must learn to grow adapt and change their business and cater to the ever changing wants of the town when they're not being dictated to by the law it deals with politics prizefighting farming religion and barbershop style quartets but a good american is more than a story of a nation's growth it is a family saga a story of love family friendship and food i started reading a good american at about 9pm last friday night and i was immediately hooked i was so drawn in to the story of frederick and jette and the unconventional way in which frederick courted her and their subsequent flight to america they find a strange country where they don't speak a word of the language where people trick frederick when he tries to learn but also where they find wonderful generous compassionate people without which they might not have made it they form lifelong friendships in the town they choose to settle in - beatrice missouri although perhaps it chose them they make their lives there despite crippling homesickness long working hours and tragic events the characters are so well portrayed amazingly fleshed out and real from the main family down to the passers by that might only enter their lives briefly frederick passionately embraces his new country loving everything there is to love about it he finds strength in becoming part of the community in 'fitting in' he wants to do everything he can to prove that he is american now from becoming a citizen to fighting in a war when he is almost 40 years old by contrast jette who was the one who insisted they had to leave germany for america finds the assimilation hard refusing to learn english for a long time she suffers crippling homesickness for her unrelenting family writing them letter after letter detailing their new lives it isn't until after she suffers some personal losses that she takes steps to join the community it is mostly out of necessity rather than desire but it is a step she finally takes i found the narrative style having the whole story described to us by a grandson whose name we do not learn until he reaches the point in the linear story where he is born really worked for me it was casual almost like someone sitting down with you and telling you the fascinating story of their family history but also thorough and well elaborated the details are meticulous and reading this book made me so hungry - pages and pages are devoted to food from the first new orleans feast that frederick and jette are greeted with upon their arrival into the country to the myriad of incarnations their business goes through over the years all in the name of feeding the locals in their town just as much time is devoted to music each generation of the family having their own special passion and interest and aptitude for the craft a good american is eloquent beautifully written and constructed it's an amazing story from start to finish full of wonderfully happy moments and achingly sad ones it is love and loss in all its forms throughout the generations it is a portrait of small middle class america and the people that populate it especially the immigrants it was amazing reading the scene where they arrive at america and just how easy it was to make it your home back in 1904 anyone could hop on a boat providing they could pay for the tickets and be welcomed at the other end having to only fill out a form how times have changed both there and here - it is a significantly more complicated and difficult process now this novel is a sensitive story a perfect understanding of what it must've been like for two foreigners to be in a new country utterly alone - until they weren't the friendships and small town community spirit with all its trials tribulations and quirky characters makes for a great story i enjoyed every page of this and would've read it in one sitting if i'd started it earlier","345":" quite liked this multigenerational story from alex george one of the better books i've read this year and would recommend to most although there are some adult moments jette and frederick flee from germany due to her delicate condition and her parent's disapproval of their union by a twist of fate they end up heading toward new orleans not new york and begin their lives on american soil eventually making their way up to missouri i love how music is as much of the story as family is and how the story is able to encompass many important events in history there are moments in this book that i will forever remember check this one out","346":"a wonderful tale of a german couple's immigration to the united states and their subsequent generations in missouri while it took me a little while to get into the story it became well worth it in the end","347":" reading alex george's novel a great american was like climbing back into the pages of a family tree uncovering historical secrets as i navigated through the story george begins his narrative in the early 1900s with main characters jette furst and frederick meisenheimer two young misfits living in germany as george says at the end of the first chapter \"it was frederick's capacity to dream that dazzled jette the most when she was with him anything was possible \" establishing one of the themes of the novel the capacity to dream the american dream was possible the novel continues in an operatic rhythm as the reader discovers the dreams of not only frederick and jette but subsequent children and grandchildren alex george's characterizations are so realistic and endearing that i often found myself wondering if these were real characters from his family tree so fleshed out and vibrant were they characters fall in and out of the course of the novel their stories deftly woven together under the question of what a good american really is to read more of my review visit http jenniferwolfe net 2013 02 read","348":"this was a book club read one i didn't vote for or want to read however i really enjoyed it it's a good multigenerational story that is fun and interesting without being overly serious or pretentious it has very funny parts and twists and turns that i didn't anticipate there is nothing too deep here but it is a worthy read","349":"i really enjoyed this book especially the characters i couldn't put it down toward the end and i got a great sense of their town","350":"i started this book and liked it it is the story of three generations of a family that immigrate to american the story of the first two generation are good then we get to the third generation and the story turns to trash i couldn't finish it","351":"i loved the first half of this book i was sorely disappointed in the second it seemed almost like two separate books to me therefore it is really hard for me to rate the first half would get 4 stars the second half 2 that is why i settled on 3 i think it had to do with the fact that this is a multi generational story and i liked the characters in the first and second generation and didn't like the rest of the characters including the narrator of the story bummer","352":"not my favorite i think it was just too meandering a story and too many characters","353":"kind of slow but a nice read","354":"this was a wonderful story that takes place over a lifetime i had trouble putting it down loved it","355":"frederick and jette leave germany in 1907 to go to america they end up in beatrice missouri and frederick begins his life as a good america the story is theirs their children's and their children's children with music the thread that ties the generations together","356":"not my usual book choice as it was written by a guy and really dealt with the male perspective of a coming of age family generation chronicle it was slow going but in the end it was a fulfilling read about the american experience for 1st 2nd generation americans","357":"this is a really good immigrant story","358":"this was an interesting fun read it crossed a lot of time and touched on many things but for once i would have liked a book to have another 100 pages or so so that it did not seem like he was rushing the ending especially when the ending holds a pretty big wow moment great read","359":"after just three pages this book was a winner we meet frederick and jette at the beginning of their love affair in the early 1900s and we follow their family's story through the present you will fall for frederick right along with jette and hopefully love reading about the family u0026amp home they create in america if you enjoy historical fiction and family sagas then definitely read this book","360":"enjoyed the first half but near the end i have to agree with another review here the author seemed rushed to finish and the last quarter was not as satisfying liked it didn't love it","361":"nice uplifting read about the people who immigrated to the united states at the turn of the 20th century","362":"well read by gibson frazier solid character development i'm a fan a james michener so this well told generational story really had a appeal for me throw in the fact that i also share a german lineage from early 1700's it had to be a really like for me","363":"3 5 multi generational family story liked the people wanted more from the narrator foreshadowing a little clumsy for me prob just me","364":"i bought this book on the recommendation of my local book seller and liked it more than i expected german emigrants in small missouri town sounded boring but book turned out to be hard to put down i enjoy multi generational stories and came to care about these characters and what happened to them some nice plot twists too","365":"loved loved loved this book it made me laugh and cry i couldn't wait to continue reading to see what happened next i was so surprised by the ending that i had to read it twice to make sure i was understanding what was really happening great story","366":" this book has one of the best first lines ever i was struck so much by it that upon reading it i had to stop just to take a quick snapshot always there was music l o v e a good american is the story of a german immigrant his family and their story the story spans through 4 generations and covers nearly a century although told as one continuous story the book is definitely separated into parts and i found i liked the bookends the first and last parts of the book better than its middle while the story kept my interest i felt that the writing was better in the beginning as the novel went on especially as it moved into the experiences of 4 teenage boys it got a little too hormonal for my liking but then in the end things wrapped up neatly with some pretty surprising twists i did like the music motif that ran throughout the book and i liked how everything was connected in its own way it was almost an epic considering how the author wove parts of american history right into the novel and showed how even a family of german descent in small town american still has its brushes with important historical moments 3 5 of 5 stars","367":"my rating 4 5 starsi really enjoyed this multi generation family saga it is prbably my favorite book so far this year","368":"i enjoyed it set in small town missouri details struggles and challenges of immigrants","369":"excellent multi generational tale of immigrants and how life is full of twists and turns being that it's told from james' pov we miss other perspectives but it's still very good","370":"i really enjoyed this book the story flowed well and i enjoyed the characters some parts seemed a bit too far fetched to work out so smoothly but even so i laughed and cried while i read this one glad i read it","371":" actually i didn't quite finish this book i had a very hard time getting into it and never was really interested finally not quite 20 tracks left of the cd version i thought why am i still listening when i'm so anxious to have this book finished so i quit i've never quit that close to the end of a book i have quit midway through and i have finished books i ended up really disliking intensely just so i could write a really blistering review i didn't really hate this book it had some really good moments but somehow i just couldn't really care about it","372":"this was a well written book portraying several generations of one family it began with their immigration to the united states and progressed through the tribulations and joys that occur in a family good first effort from this author as he has a writing style which reminds me of some of my favorites felt a little rushed toward the end as dramatic books often do but certainly worth the read","373":"a multi generational family story originally from germany jette and frederick flee to america and settle in beatrice mo they raise children and each generation partakes of the american experience restaurants jazz the world wars jfk etc and they and the reader learn what makes a good american a person who lives well","374":" i'm a big fan of stories that tell the story of a family many generations is the key to my heart and this is one of the best i've read lately we're introduced to frederick and jette in 1904 and we part with the meisenheimers in the 2000s they are a family attracted to music and filled with the gift of song they are real there are problems there are solutions and occasionally there are just happenings the story never felt rushed it just always felt right i really enjoyed this book and if you've enjoyed middlesex or empire falls or cold sassy tree then i think you should give this book a shot","375":"i would give this 2 1 2 stars if i could i enjoyed the time i spent reading it but the scope of the book covering three plus generations of the same family meant that many characters lacked the necessary depth it's telling that a week after finishing the book i had to go to my library account to find the name of the book i was hoping this would resonate with my husband's family whose ancestors also emigrated to missouri from germany via new orleans and in whose lives music also played a large role alas i can't recommend it","376":"an enjoyable read i really liked the story telling u0026amp style i thought the last half would have been better if there were half as many references to sex i thought it overdone","377":"i loved this book it's about fitting in and finding your place within the family unit your community and even your country you will laugh and cry as your read this novel and see yourself and your own family as you turn each page because deep down we all want to fit in and find our place in the world we all just want to be loved","378":"it started out as a 4 star book and each 1 4 of the book it lost a star shallow characters far too many of them and so unbelievable such as the whole lomax character crossing their path 2 times unbelieveable nope sorry just too much dwarf lawyer on a bike married to the bombshell nymphomaniac music teacher that claims a multitude of high school boy's virginity creepy disgusting trashy the 8ft best friend who dies and just so happens to have the funeral on the same day as the dwarf was the cast of characters taken from hbo's 'carnivale' dumb i could go on and on about the epic cast of characters but honestly i didn't really care about them a couple places i laughed out loud but it sure didn't save the book for me disappointing","379":"what can i say loved it","380":"my actual rating 3 5a very compelling and irving esque story this family saga follows one german family for 100 years as they put down roots in a small missouri town it is quite entertaining and includes a cast of zany characters reminiscent of a john irving novel i enjoyed the look into a small midwestern town and all the secrets and escapades of the meisenheimer family a fun and very entertaining read","381":"what a wonderful book","382":"i find that if i'm yelling at the characters advising them not to do something then i must really really like them","383":"this book is made up of family love loss twists turns and humor in short everything you need for a good book it follows several generations of a german immigrant family and their struggles to make it in america a great read","384":"i read this for a book club and although there's a lot here for discussion i just didn't relate to any of the characters in this story of the immigrant experience in beatrice mo in the 20th century","385":"i didn't finish this one i couldn't figure out why he was telling me this story","386":" finished 6 13 but will wait till our book club discussion next week before i rate and review it 6 21 mixed reviews at book club 2 loved it a few thought it was ok and the majority didn't like it personally i thought it was just ok it was slow at times the writing was average and although there was a lot of death i felt unaffected because i never really got to know the characters in depth then 2 3 of the way into the book the story took a fantastical turn with the suicidal dwarf the nympho schoolteacher the giant the unfortunate death of a child as he was engaged in the favorite solitary pastime of most teenage boys the pastor and other colorful but totally unrealistic characters some of us found it funny but we're not entirely sure that was the author's intention i didn't dislike it but didn't love it either","387":"the american dream four generations of an immigrant family originally from germany live out their lives in a small missouri town the story spans significant historical events and their effect on our culture over the past century told as a love story of america","388":"one of the authors i follow on facebook or twitter recommended this one and i'm glad i listened a sweeping family drama that follows several generations through life in small town missouri from the very first chapter i was captivated and stayed that way til the last","389":"picked it up as a pass the time quick read but was quite surprised at how the characters and their story drew me in finished it in a day quick read certainly but not a throw away wanted parts of it to slow down especially as the pages left dwindled","390":"i am an avid reader and this book was hard for me to finish it was slow and boring i also didn't like how the book was written i would pass on this one","391":"a view into generations of family that have trials and problems just like the rest of us i am relishing in the afterthought having completed the book","392":"what a beautiful book about life for several generations in a small town in mid missouri since i'm from that area i was captured from the start with the authenticity the author captured in his writing the book is so well written and develops so naturally with twists turns and surprises i enjoyed so much can't wait to read more by this author","393":"i liked this book although the author's writing was fairly simplistic i enjoyed the characters and some of the dialogue was terrific parts of the book were sad and you felt it because you were so connected to the individuals in the story it truly was a snippet of an immigrant's story in america","394":"great book and story probably one of the best books i've ever read","395":"this is a story of a family who comes to america from germany near the beginning of the 20th century i enjoyed the story until near the end when it all fell apart for me the narrator is a grandson of the original immigrants and i loved his story telling until he got to the part about himself something seemed missing at that point and the end had some questions i wanted more resolution to","396":"a light easy read that was hard to put down i loved some of the phrasing the author used putting words together in unique ways an entertaining story","397":"\"a good american\" by alex george published by amy einhorn bookscategory - fiction literaturethis is a far reaching novel in that it covers the years from 1904 to 2003 frederick and jette are living in austria and due to unusual circumstances find their way to new york to start a new life in the new world although they are headed elsewhere due to jette's pregnancy they settle in the town of beatrice missouri this suits them well in that most of the residents are german and speak german the only language they know frederick in awe of this new land and feeling he owed it something enlists in the army at the age of forty five and is sent off to fight in world war i this does not sit well with jette but she has no say in the matter frederick did leave behind ownership of a bar and jette took over the management of it the bar falls on hard times though when prohibition is passed in order to sustain themselves they turn the bar into a restaurant the restaurant flourishes and becomes the mainstay of the family the story is rooted in the family and the trials and tribulations that they must face the family has secrets within itself that cause doubt and mistrust it is how they face these problems and overcome them that form the core of the book a good read but one that sometimes finds itself a little long and a little to alliterative","398":"excellent book thanks for the recommendation bern x","399":" a good american is a fictional memoir of the meisenheimer family from the 1880s through the present day that sounds like a lot of ground to cover in a 400 page novel and indeed it is but what starts as a slow dance through the early years of frederick and jette's life together builds an uneven tempo and we quick step through some generations while gliding sashaying gently through others music is a key element to the story and it's fun to follow its through generations beginning with frederick's display of adoration through opera and aria moving through the seduction of jazz and ragtime and culminating in family barbershop quartets strangely or not so strangely as the story moves to the present we stop hearing much about modern music grin keeping with this musical theme i must say that author alex george has a penchant for the use of a literary secondary dominant dale mcgowan describes this musical device here ctrl f not a coincidence or just read the whole thing as a kind of momentary harmonic trapdoor into another key and explains that the result is an unfulfilled yearning that all is to say that almost every chapter break and transition break within a chapter ends in a cliffhangery statement that encourages you to keep reading it's a good and relevant device yearning for home is also a theme of this tale if a bit overused here frederick and jette start their affair in their home country of germany much to the chagrin of jette's parents to escape their disapproval the couple decides as so many did in their day to cross an ocean and try to build a life in the land of shining hope and supposed opportunity america while they originally plan for new york they find themselves instead heading to new orleans well they're both new muses jette and setting in motion a multigenerational smalltown life for their family with all the quintessential angst and adoration that brings though most of the book's cover blurbs describe the book as alternately hilarious and heartbreaking i found it to be more often the latter than the former a good american begins as a hopeful tale of romance escape and new life and while those themes continue as the book goes on it seems the characters are buried in tragedy after tragedy in an endless march of death i know you expect death in a story that encompasses four or was it five generations but i'm not talking about your typical old age death though of course there are many of those there are an inordinate number of characters we readers are drawn to and made to adore who as soon as we begin to love them are ripped from the story in a gruesome death consider yourself forewarned but like life this book is worth the heartache though it's a fictional memoir i found myself constantly imagining the narrator sitting in a room piled with history his grandmother's diary beside him love letters between she and his grandfather in a pile on the desk photos strewn across a bulletin board pinned above the narration is clear and true and i'd love to read it again as an audiobook in all i thorougly enjoyed a good american and while there were a lulls i frequently found myself picking up my book instead of my laptop eager to return to the hopeful history of the meisenheimers their joy at this country with which i have become disenchanted and the tangled web of love and sorrow weaved through their lives this is a compensated review by the blogher book club but all opinions expressed are my own","400":"this is one of those books where the characters stay with me long after i've read the last page it was a treat to read as it's been awhile since i lost myself in a good piece of fiction i highly recommend it","401":"and 1 2 i toggled between three stars and four stars for about 2 minutes i just can't decide what i think about this book sometimes i loved it sometimes i got frustrated with it but i never actually put it down and stopped reading i will say that as i was reading it it brought up several interesting ideas about what settling in america was like history classes are almost always taught from the perspective of those that already considered themselves americans i enjoyed thinking about our country's past in a new way","402":"a wonderful story of being an outsider in a country a town and in your own family a story of how we create our place in the world every life is a galaxy of permutations and possibilities from which a single thread will be picked out and followed for better or worse by such delicate threads does all our existences hang","403":" a very well told story of a pair of immigrants who escape their old life in europe to begin a new life in america the story is told by james their grandson as he himself reaches the golden years of his life the story follows three generations in a small missouri town each with its own struggles and highlights the timeline runs through many of the significant events of our nations history and alex george does an excellent job telling how those events affected our nation and the people who lived though those times i especially enjoyed the way the story is narrated by james as he is looks back at his family's story it is as if i'm sitting down with my uncle or grandfather and listening them tell about the family while looking through a box pictures and clippings that have been gathered over the years like any family there are some wonderful times and some tough times and some significant tragedies he also learns that there are some dark secrets in his family and that his own life story may not be all that he thought it was my one criticism of the book is that there are a couple places where the language gets rather coarse now i'm not a prude so it isn't the language itself that bothers me but the problem i have is that it doesn't fit with the way the rest of the story is told there are some very difficult subjects tackled in the story and they are told with a grace and gentleness that is a joy to read then there are a couple of places where the language simply clashes and it stood out rather obviously to me i have a feeling that if the rest of the story wasn't done so well done that i wouldn't have even noticed the places that didn't fit i really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction or simply a story well told this is first reads review of an arc","404":"if you are looking for a good story this fits the bill well developed characters and the continuing generations of this family will keep you reading and when it's done you will be satisfied","405":"most everyone will identify with these characters their small town lives and man's uncanny ability to live as they should rather than as they would colorful vivid personalities abound and yet the boldness they show in some of life's events is offset by the true human need to please others this multi generational family serves up a wonderful ambrosia of characters and a truly good read","406":"wonderful story of immigration to the us and the century that follows not a big fan of male authors but really liked alex george's writing style and story fast read there were only a very few slow sections","407":"love how mr george puts words together","408":" solid middle of the road read this is a story of a german family immigrating to america and settling in missouri and their family saga over three generations it is a classic becoming an american story and i really liked that about it the characters were all likable and relatable however the writing is pretty basic and some of the foreshadowing techniques were disappointing i appreacited that not everything that affected the us over the 100 years of the story affected the family that would have been pretty cliche however some of the trials and tribulations that faced the family where wham bam over and done the lingering affects and or the lead ups to the incidencts were underdeveloped and fell a little flat the ending downright bugged me all of a sudden time sped up and 20 years were compressed into about 20 pages i hate that kind of pacing in a book and the very last reveal of the book was just not called for and didn't do anything for me in fact it left me with a weird taste in my mouth","409":"i really enjoyed this book it's my 3rd audiobook an certainly not my last so nice to pass the time running errands and picking up kids with an audiobook i'm much less stressed hmmm anyhow the book it read like a family history no real plot just a nice century spanning family story i liked that it was an immigrant family's story almost every american save north american native americans has family that immigrated at some point mine was different from this story varied in time and place from the mayflower to my mother moving from canada as a teen the characters were interesting i would have liked a little more about some and little less about others but still a nicely written and interesting story worth the read","410":"at first i thought this was going to be just another enjoyable read the more i read the more i thought the book improved easy read but that did not dimish my pleasure","411":"a saga with an unexpected twist","412":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really liked the beginning of this book i would have scored it higher than 3 stars before james took over the story with his own narrative of his teen college years but once we got to james own life and in particular his high school years i started losing interest i didn't appreciate all the discussion about his bathroom stall activities and had to be very diligent while listening to it lest my young daughters entered the room had i just been reading i probably would have just skipped la i really liked the beginning of this book i would have scored it higher than 3 stars before james took over the story with his own narrative of his teen college years but once we got to james own life and in particular his high school years i started losing interest i didn't appreciate all the discussion about his bathroom stall activities and had to be very diligent while listening to it lest my young daughters entered the room had i just been reading i probably would have just skipped large sections i don't think it helped that james is not a character i cared for very much i did enjoy the narrative of watching the generations grow however i felt kinda sorry for the family and for all its loyalty and togetherness there was a lack of warmth and love i liked the history part of it as it was a generation that went through a lot of changes i also liked how the music connected each generation and the author's descriptions and expressions along that line were very well done and a joy to listen to overall its a decent well written book with an interesting story line the characters especially the main character narrator just didn't captivate me enough to warrant more stars for me more","413":"this is an exquisite story that wraps itself around itself and moves seamlessly from one generation to the next it is funny and heartbreaking at the same time and makes you want to re read it from the start once you've finished it highly recommended","414":"1st book for our book club interested read for fiction i would recommend it to a friend","415":"it kind of reminded me of angela's ashes","416":"another great book club pick","417":"a story of german immigrants written very well interesting and believable with very real and likable characters lots of things happened which held my interest lots of strong stubborn germans in this book","418":"i liked this story never knew much about the immigrant experience in the south this is well written","419":"super readable family tale frustrating only if you want to spend more time with one of the dozens of characters introduced which i did but once i got the hang of reading in the breeze created by rapid passage of time i relaxed and enjoyed it great for folks who don't cringe slightly when the see the word uplifting in the book blurbs i would guess","420":"a multi generational story of an immigrant family's move to america definitely not the best written book and a little formulaic in the way it brings in wider historical events and people but i found it to be a page turner and it definitely kept me up reading way later at night than i should have been","421":" i am not generally a fan of epic sweeping novels that cover wide expanses of time and characters preferring books that settle in on a single event and show the intimate details so i was surprised to like this book as much as i did i did find myself longing for the details for a better understanding of the characters but when the little snippets of this family's history were all put together the result was a touching portrait of what it means to be family and to live a fulfilling life despite all the challenges life throws our way","422":"i was intrigued by the description and usually enjoy stories whose plots focus on immigrants coming to america while i did enjoy reading parts of the book overall i found it slow and plodding also i was not satisfied with the last few chapters which threw in a huge twist to the story without fully resolving how it came to be the book wasn't bad but i woouldn't recommend it","423":"some books are so lush and beautifully written you simply want to savor them a good american is such a book in 1904 germany jette furst has fallen in love at first sound having heard frederick meisenheimer's magnificent voice through a garden hedge on one of her walks jette is smitten and soon the young couple are pregnant fearful of her mother's disapproval jette and frederick decide to start a new life in a new land bound first for new york they find themselves rerouted to the small town of beatrice missouri a change in course that will change the path of their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren when frederick has the opportunity to purchase the town's only tavern the nick nack inn he inadvertently secures his family's legacy and the pub--and the music and food it offers--will grow to become a defining fixture not only in the town of beatrice but in the lives of the meisenheimers and their closest friends but while the meisenheimers learn to settle in their new home the world shifts around them--and even in their small town they are never safe from its reach while the story is expansive in its chronology and covers an impressive swath of history and some of its most defining world events at its core a good american is as intimate as a family dinner alex george has a true gift for knowing the hearts and minds of his characters no matter their age gender or background in his capable hands they move through heartbreak and victory with equal passion and we the reader can't wait to follow their journey we cry with them we laugh with them we face fear first loves and disappointment with them most of all we root for them","424":" random thoughts about the book i love multigenerational stories this one worked for jette's generation and joseph's generation and the childhood of the narrator's generation the end felt a little bit like a roll call of the family instead of the story of the family i cannot for the life of me understand the won't read open letters from someone tactic that writers use so often in historical settings it's like the equivalent of getting a text message and never opening it i refuse to believe that curiosity wouldn't override any anger after reading the character can still be angry they don't have to reply but to not read it i can't understand it this family alternately had extremely good luck and depressingly bad luck for instance after a few years in america they could buy the nick nack tavern and when prohibition came it was easy to convert it to a restaurant and during the depression they managed to survive despite the fact that this one little restaurant in this one little town had to feed three generations and their bad luck well it seems that if you are not a direct descendent of jette you were destined to die seriously no one who wasn't a meisenheimer was in serious danger of dying for dramatic moments friends in laws random members of the town the reader met for approximately two pages they all died ok so not everyone died but there did seem to be a lot of deaths jette's story was fleshed out really well so too was joseph's but by the time that we got to james it seemed that there was a grocery list to get through much of his story focused on naming the deaths weddings and births of the townspeople and his family there wasn't much plot or story instead we just had funeral wedding funeral baby funeral etc despite these shortcomings i enjoyed the book a great deal ever since john steinbeck's east of eden i'm always ready for a family epic","425":" to those who have yet to read this book drop what you're reading go immediately to your nearest bookstore purchase a copy and begin reading immediately i'm usually a library girl all the way but you will want to read this one over and over again so go ahead and get your own truly i was charmed by this treasure of a book i fell in love with jette on page 1 and with frederick on page 2 and kept falling in love page after page with them their offspring the friends they encounter the little town of beatrice their music their restaurant in all its incarnations the whole family history everything alex george does such a great job of capturing life in all its joy pain heartbreak simplicity confusion sadness silliness the ups downs in betweens how one seemingly small decision can change the course of your life for generations the inevitability the surprise the different personalities those who get it those who don't feeling trapped feeing connected obligations making the best of things living up to expectations or not and just when you think you have it all figured out in all its normal boring glory you discover suprises a sense of history the true meaning of life love and family i loved how i could be reading along with big grin on my face only to find myself reading about some tragedy the kind that no family escapes then the story continues as life does the pieces get picked up and fitted back together life is changed a little sadder a little wiser perhaps but it always continues on the next generation the new players their own twists and turns one moment that captures the essence of the wonderful book and the tremendous writing was after joseph loses his beloved cora and with her his faith drained out of him in one sickening evacuation your heart is broken for him and yet on the next page you are laughing out loud as the town pastor tries to reach out to the distraught man by bringing him reassuring words and a basket of freshly baked rolls as reverand kellerman recites his platitudes joseph arms himself with rolls and begins pelting the poor well meaning minister with them joseph continues his barrage and the pastor finally retreats he turned stiffly and made his way back down the garden path an aerial bombardment showered down on him as he went by the time he reached the gate the basket was empty and our front yard was littered with sweet smelling grenades just one of many many great moments you will not want to put this book down and you will not want to get to the end and when you do you will want to pick it up and do it all over again","426":"i enjoyed the first few chapters but later it just failed to keep me interested","427":"i really enjoyed this book it was interesting how the author tied in many aspects of american history with the narrators personal story history i recommend this book for those who love historical fiction","428":"the saying all because two people fell in love comes to mind i recently discovered that my ancestors came from germany and while reading i found myself many times pondering my family history this is so beautifully written incorporating music food and wars from the early 1900s to present i highly recommend this one","429":"what a great look at 20th century america it is a history lesson populated with characters from one family that you will love connecting many generations surprise ending that i did not see coming due out in february","430":"this is a book club read thad i anticipated i might not like and was pleasantly surprised it is a sentimental lively family saga spanning four generations of a famiy of german americans learning to live in 20th century america it is based on the author's grandparents that immigrated to the united states the author resides in columbia mo","431":"i loved this book it was well written and made me think about our immigrant ancestors the challenges they faced the sacrifices they made and perhaps more important the richness that immigrants bring to our crazy quilt of culture highly recommend","432":"any book that i pick up and finish within a 24 hour period gets my vote this book entertained and distracted me i get that other reviewers thought the writing and characters at times were two dimensional and that it wasn't a challenging read but i liked the multi generational aspect of this german family that settled in missouri the twist at the end was a it of a surprise too","433":"arriving in paris the first time i was overwhelmed by its beauty everything seemed historical even the waitresses in the cafes seemed to have old world manners they wore starched aprons and french twists in their hair being alone they teased me to death i even searched out apartments having no idea how high paris rents were until i cautiously asked gosh wow it's high coming back to the states everything seemed very country grass in the front yard was most surprising and i was glad to be back","434":"loved loved loved this book","435":" the book has a good flow of the story never felt like a drag though it covers three generations i liked the way relationships and human emotions are shown differently in different generations no judgemental view on actions of any generation we change with time and circumstances and that's the fact nothing was better before as older generation belives nor is it better now as new generation thinks i also like the wholesome personalities of the characters noone is perfect everybody has some strength and some flaws","436":"this was a good book to listen to a bit of humor a bit of romance and a bit of sadness if you're looking for a fun easy book this would be a good choice it gets a 7 on my 10 scale","437":"what a lovely book about immigrants although isn't everyone in the u s originally an immigrant and amazingly written by a brit almost made me want to visit missouri loved it","438":"loved this novel a wonderful story spanning generation and continents demonstrating the strengths of the immigrants that formed our country","439":"a riveting story of a german immigrant family settling in a small missouri town wonderful characters","440":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed the storytelling in the first 2 3 of this book but once i actually was in james' timeline i felt like that aspect gave way to more predictable storylines and the book lost my interest not even the twist at the end was enough to pull me back in good in places but overall probably not one i'll go back to again","441":"i loved this book it could have been even longer i thought the ending was rushed","442":"very enjoyable read nothing horribly griping or wowing but good read none the less","443":"wow this was a great book i devoured it a lush family saga just read it and see for yourself","444":"loved the first half not as much the second half","445":"oh how i wish i could write as beautifully as this author he creates characters the reader loves and keeps us wondering what's next yet the ending left me feeling comfortable that all of his characters will be just fine","446":"i like this book and then at times i really didn't pros i couldn't stop thinking about the characters i'm not sure this was the best written book but i did get to know each character and loved the way george brought in american history to flesh out these people i do not know much about the midwest of america especially not during that time period so i enjoyed learning more while also reading an interesting recount of events the ending of the book is quite a surprise i liked the feeling of not really expecting the turn of events and being just as surprised as the narrator i zoomed through the end as shocker and surprises kept popping up cons i have a problem with authors that tell you what is going to happen next in the last sentence of a chapter george did not do this for the first quarter of the book and then all of a sudden those foreshadowing sentences started appearing everywhere it was quite bothersome and tended to jolt me out of the story i'd be left feeling a little disappointed that i knew what was about to happen the last quarter of the book also felt a little rushed whereas the first 3 4 felt like the story was going at a good pace and i really got to know the characters the last part with all its twists and turns felt like a bunch of scrambled eggs it was thrown together mashed about and then eaten at a fast pace i put the book down thinking wait what wow those events were really cool i just wish he let me savor them slowly the main part of the ending the revelation of his parents felt strange and almost unnatural how in the world did that happen was it a one time thing or consistent maybe we're not supposed to know but there was no real inclination that his parents especially his mother would have really been able to keep it a secret in that town maybe i missed something while reading it overall i did love the characters and it kept me turning the pages during my break but i don't think it was written well enough for me to read it again or read anything else by alex george","447":"family saga interesting sometimes slow sometimes predictable","448":"this is the story of the meisenheimer family told by james a third generation american living in beatrice missouri it's where his german grandparents frederick and jette found themselves after journeying across the turbulent atlantic fording the flood swollen mississippi and being brought to a sudden halt by the broken waters of the pregnant jette a good american tells of jette's dogged determination to feed a town sauerkraut and soul food the loves and losses of her children joseph and rosa and the precocious voices of james and his brothers sometimes raised in perfect harmony sometimes in discord but above all a good american is about the music in frederick's heart a song that began as an aria was jazzed by ragtime and became an anthem of love for his adopted country that the family still hears to this day","449":" this was a wonderful story that weaves its way through three generations of a family through each generation people leave home whether it is to a house up the street a different state or even to a new country there are those who will adapt easily and those who will struggle mourning love and loss affect all of us and we all react in different ways with humor and touching sweetness the author takes us through one american family's journey beginning with german immigrants jette and frederick running away to america due to an unplanned pregnancy unwed lovers jette and frederick seek a new beginning however once on american soil and after the abrupt birth of their child jette and frederick's feelings about their new home country take on different views jette who had originally come up with the idea of going to america begins to miss her german identity frederick however is enthralled with his new country and seeks to embrace all things american i was surprised how much this book hooked me i had heard the first couple of chapters on book radio on sirius radio during my morning commute i was fortunate enough to email my local library in the evening and find out that a copy of the book was in stock i was able to pick it up the next day light touches of humor occasional sadness mixed into the span of a little over a century i thoroughly enjoyed this story my only regret was that the one character james through whom much of the story is told never found true love i felt he deserved that but that's just me","450":"liked this story not loved it it was a family saga but i cared little for any of the characters finishing it seemed more a chore to be done rather than a hang on every word moment","451":"3 1 2 starsi wavered between rating this one 3 1 2 or 4 stars probably would have given it 4 stars if i could have connected with the characters more i did enjoy the book and liked most of the characters i just couldn't get emotionally connected to any of the characters it was a wonderful family saga and was well worth reading","452":"readable multi generation family saga with plenty of quirky characters and unexpected turns","453":"finally read for book group not my type of book at all it was interesting and if you like historical fiction then you would love it","454":"almost 3 stars for the most part i enjoyed reading this family saga due to the somewhat zany interactions of the various characters it had a very john irving the early years feel to it dwarf included but as the story continued i began to question just how many generations we needed to meet how many tragedies would befall this family and how many names i needed to keep straight in the end i think it was just little bit too much of a good thing","455":"liked this one very much #22 of 52 for 2014 historical fiction light on the history part but a really good multi generational story","456":"not one of my favorites but a good read","457":"a good early 20th century immigration story from germany to missouri that covers 3 generations surprise ending","458":"this was a library journal book of the year so i expected a bit more than i got out of this novel that follows the lives of a german immigrant family in missouri over the course of the twentieth century there were lots of engaging interesting details such as how the patriarch of the family wooed the matriarch and interesting characters but it wasn't quite as rich as i had expected it to be","459":"incredible start lulled as too many generations converged but really liked the bit of a surprise ending","460":"i hadn't realized that i had left this book out it is wonderful well written true engrossing easily could be a major movie the story and characters are so endearing kind of crazy location i am surprised that it didn't get more acclaim badly needs to be discovered for prosterity through a cult following odd relationships odd restaurant in the family musicians generational american immigration success and who doesn't love a small town familial setting don't miss this one","461":"3 1 2 i enjoyed reading this charming novel about frederick and jette who immigrate to america and by chance end up in a small town in missouri frederick is so taken by how well the people in the states have treated him that he does everything to become a good american too much of the novel seemed inevitable and too carefully plotted but the style of the novel and the story put together of four generations kept me reading","462":"read well sort of it was one of those rare books i couldn't be bothered finishing","463":"i loved this book one of my favorites of 2012","464":"frederick truly enjoyed life most other characters seemed sad and unhappy with their lives throughout most of the book","465":"this book grabbed me from the very first page and i couldn't put it down it reminds me of winesburg ohio in how it paints a picture of small town life and shows that the ordinary is anything but the author did a wonderful job of taking the original character frederick and bringing his dream of being a good american and take it full circle to be realized by his grandson and the later generations","466":"i enjoyed reading about this families immigration experience and it made me consider what my family's experience might have been it was a heartfelt story told by a grandson and he had a comfortable manner of speaking","467":" having long been a fan of multi generational sagas i was pretty pumped to read this book it meanders in a delightful easy way in fact it reminds me of the kind of book all the editors at all the conferences tell you can no longer find publishing homes it breaks all sorts of rules for plot etc and yet as a reader i was curious to see how it all turned out and as a writer i was comforted to see that yes there is room in the marketplace for such tales and yet ultimately i was disappointed somewhere along the line we learn who the narrator is it was at that point for me that the story began to falter the more i learned about the narrator the less i liked him the story just kind of fizzled my favorite characters were frederick and jette and lomax unfortunately they were no longer around to save the ending","468":"i would have given a good american 4 stars except for the ending the book seemed to lose steam at the end however the story was unexpected at times and i really enjoyed it","469":"a light and easy read a good story too","470":"an american family saga beginning with jette and fredrich fleeing germany and landing in new orleans in 1904 and ending with their grandson in a small missouri town in 2000 filled with prohibition the great depression the kennedy assassination barbership quartets a diner and quirky small town characters i highly recommend this tale of the meisenheimer family","471":"a deceptively simple book that grew on me after a few chapters the story of three generations of a german american family starts with an immigration in 1904 and spans world wars and the evolution of the american dream since most of us are the descendants of immigrants this is really the story of americans and what changes us from other to a united people","472":"read the entire book in two days as book manager of a university and mother of six it is a rare book that steals my full attention and beckons me to my reading chair for hours on end i found your writing style mesmerizing and the interwoven lives of many generations both lovely and very real","473":"listened via book on tape kept me interested the whole way through i didn't feel like any of it was boring it had twists and turn that made my jaw drop that i didn't see coming","474":"such an interesting initial concept but it didn't live up to my expectations great moments of joy and sadness but i was left feeling pretty neutral by the end disappointing since i normally really love historical family sagas","475":"this was an interesting story sort of it gets bogged down here and there but an interesting story nonetheless some nice plot twists that surprised me","476":"i would give the first third of this book 4 stars the second third 3 stars and the last 2 stars the story just got too convoluted as it progressed with the last bit painful to read why do i want updates on a 4th generation which was never previously mentioned i don't care who was married to who or what careers they chose it read like a really bad family christmas card with that said there were some lovely characters frederick jette lomax joseph and rosa i loved their stories even with all of the heartbreak and tragedy that accompanied them it was james the narrator who i struggled with i kept waiting for his story to pick up and it never did he never appeared really happy and seemed to settle in every aspect of his life where others found beauty james seemed to only find beauty in snatches ending with his story was a downer for me i think i would have preferred the book to just focus on frederick and jette and their two children","477":" \"a good american\" is a century long story of two german immigrants a few generations of their descendants and the most influential people in their lives in beatrice mo all narrated by the immigrants' grandson i'm not a huge fan of epics and squeezing one into fewer than 400 pages was highly ambitious of first time novelist alex george i like getting to know characters their strengths and foibles their encounters with life their growth or lack of it i don't like hopping from one diverting amusing or tragic anecdote and historic event to another till we've hit the 100 year mark and the storyteller signs off indeed there were highlights george's excellent writing premier among them many characters were engaging even if they were more chronicled than developed and some of his descriptions were just breathtaking his observations about the human especially immigrant condition astute here's one about immigrant frederick's attempt to learn english \"a year after their arrival in america frederick had amassed a fair vocabulary and was rarely caught out by the army of irregular verbs that lurked in ambush but for all his hard work frederick had no gift for english after the dour rigidity of his native tongue its anarchy unnerved him \"the first portion of the novel focusing on frederick the one devoted to becoming the \"good american\" of the title his wife jette and their children is the strongest by the time narrator james is telling his own story his teen age sexual exploits and those of his three brothers consume an inordinate part of the tale events intended to be amusing are just plain strange a dwarf and an 8 footer both make appearances and there's an inexplicable revelation in the final pages and many chapters end with a line like \"his world was complete or so he thought \" after enough of these little alerts you can rightfully assume that someone will die in the next few pages george clearly has talent hence my 3 stars and i would like to see another of his efforts preferably with fewer attempts to be clever and more to create characters with depth it would help to shorten the timeframe or lengthen the book if he really wants to go epic after his grandmother's death the narrator writes \" her life had been one long opera there had been drama heroes villains improbable twists all that \" in a nutshell this aptly and sadly describes \"a good american \"","478":"i think this would be considered a saga a good american follows a couple who immigrate to america from germany the pace seems a little uneven but the story line is gripping with some unexpected plot twists along the way i was sorry to see it end the characters had grown on me","479":" frederick who sings opera and jette go to us from hanover germany in 1904 they are in love and jette's parents won't let her marry frederick the book is a story of their life written by their grandson james jette is very pregnant when they arrive in new orleans heading to missouri they are travelling north when jette's waters break in beatrice missouri where they remain they are taken in by a kind couple and frederick is given a job by the doctor in his bar when their son joseph is still young they become american citizens frederick and jette later have their daughter beatrice who never marries frederick eventually purchases the bar even though he is old for it frederick signs up for wwi when prohibition arrives they make the bar into a restaurant joseph marries the woman he has idolized for a long time and has four children including james who narrates the book music is always a big part of the family life the family goes through prohibition the depression wwii and the fifties in small town middle america","480":"the story of an american immigrant family told through the years in a folksy simple way some things are extremely predictable and some things are a complete surprise it seems to skim the surface of the characters at times perhaps that is because the story is narrated at a distance from the events","481":"long too much detail started out good and went downhill a saga of a family that comes from england and goes into great detail of the family until 2003 it covers occupations marriages divorces secrets and so much more too much and rather boring lives as i read them","482":"great story fast read and really enjoyed the book","483":"i wish i could give it 2 5 stars i liked the first half of the story but eventually got bored with it i finished it but it was a struggle to keep me going","484":"i loved the first 1 2 of this book the next 1 4 when the narrator begins to reflect on his own life was enjoyable but then the book not only goes downhill but within a couple of chapters it takes a swan dive off a cliff i had to stop reading it when i found it became a chore i'd give 4 stars to the first half 1 star past that bummer","485":" i was pleasantly astonished at the important place music has in this book music became a character that defines the plot i can't decide if it is tragically comedic or comedically tragic but this generational story had me hooked from the first page i don't want to copy everyone else's reviews but it's hard not to i loved it and i will continue to recommend it to my friends who love to read the only further comment i have is my feeling that this family could be a legacy from john irving this is a good thing did anyone else have that impression","486":"this was a wonderful multigenerational story of a german immigrant family and their ideas of what a being a good american means their journey is funny and sad and i couldn't put it down","487":" oh my i don't even know where to begin this book was epic it is part romance part drama part mystery and all good i had the pleasure of reading it for my book club and i was not disappointed one bit being from a family that escaped hungary during the war this book struck a personal cord i especially enjoyed the first part of the book and will even go as far as to say that the first part of the book is now my favorite piece of written work probably ever and i have read a lot of books if you were thinking of reading this book stop everything right now and pick it up once you start reading you will not be able to put it down","488":" a good american was my book group pick for july and everyone loved it it's a wonderful story about the german immigrant experience from 1904 through 2010 when jette's mother rejects the man she has fallen in love with she convinces frederick meisenheimer to set sail for america the couple with a baby on the way eventually settle in beatrice missouri a small town with other german immigrants while frederick immediately falls in love with all the possibilities american has to offer jette with new infant son joseph is homesick and restless and when a second child rosa arrives the couples relationship becomes strained when world war i calls eligible young men to duty frederick although now 39 and running a restaurant enlists in the military feeling a sense of duty to the country he loves jette is furious music is of significant importance in this story jazz and blues helps the family through the tough times and keeps the family close there are several wonderful characters who come to life on the pages as the reader follows the meisenheimer through the generations wwi prohibition the great depression and wwii heartbreak and tragedy comes often to this family and to the people they care about but despite this they remain stronger together the story has a nice balance of love life romance and loss although i definitely enjoyed the first half of this book more the entire novel was a transporting experience with an unexpected revelation as the story wound down alex george is a talented debut author to watch for if you love well done immigrant stories be sure to check this one out the audio was excellent 4 5 5 stars","489":" i echo those who say they were surprised this book was actually published the characters are cardboard even minimal authorial comprehension of cataclysmic events of the 20th century appears absent and the understanding of race relations in the u s is nil in an author's note alex george mentions that the book was initially rejected for publication only to be accepted a year later which makes one wonder what the initial text was like horrors such as lynchings and rope suicides occurring on foreclosed farms where barn flames dance are side by side with some very twee writing i strongly suggest you avoid this one i made the mistake of buying the book based on an indie next list write up i finished it only because i had spent the money the book was quickly donated to my local charity bookstore do not waste your time","490":"i loved this book so much it's beautifully written full of humor and has twists that take you by surprise i can't wait to see what this author puts out next","491":"i thought the writing in this novel was uneven lovely some of the time prosaic at other times there were too many characters that weren't fully fleshed out and often a situation would lead to a predictable outcome it was engaging enough and once in a while profound so overall i found it to be a worthwhile read one that had the potential to be great but didn't quite get there","492":"interesting multi generational story good character development found myself not wanting it to end","493":"a great swath of american history is let loose in this beguiling tome it all starts in a garden in germany where fredrick lurks behind a hedge preparing to serenade his ladylove jette it is not a union smiled upon by jette's social climbing mother she forbids them contact so of course they go underground and soon are fleeing the mother's wrath heading for the new world narrated by james their grandson the story is an endearing and insightful family drama with a full cast of entertaining extras including jazz musicians nefarious bartenders and a malevolent dwarf","494":"review coming soon","495":"i adored this book from start to finish each page kept my attention and i wanted to read it every chance i had this book is the type of story that drags me in because i want to know everything i can about the generations of this family it reminded me of shaghai girls and dreams of joy but with a different race of people really any books that have a generational story keep me entertained would love to see this made into a film as the stories of everyone in the family are just so interesting to read in short i loved this book","496":"loved this book very good","497":"loved this book of family saga the whole plot is built around german immigrants coming to america in the early 1900s the story follows the family as they settle in missouri well written","498":"listening to the audio book very good so far this is a local author so wanted to make sure to read it due to that and because of the good reviews 3 5 stars enjoyed the storyline and thought the characters were well developed","499":"my blog post about this book is at this link","500":"i would rate this closer to a 4 but language always bugs me great story though","501":"i love this book great writing interesting plot with unexpected twists and characters best book i've read this year","502":"this was an interesting epic about an immigrant american family the author over simplified some things and made unexplained jumps on other things overall a thought provoking book","503":" george has an unusual narrative viewpoint that i found engaging i often forgot the novel was told in the first person but the style worked and there is good reason the author chose this perspective yes there are similarities with john irving but they are not over the top or even derivative a good american is one of those subtle generation spanning epics that echo from another time the voice and point of view of the narrator reminded me of writers from the first half of the 20th century one thing that's important you've got to get to the end of this novel to understand what george is doing there's a twist you see i find myself attracted to sweeping epics that span multiple generations although this novel was set in a time and place that were much different than the usual historical novels that attract my attention a good american delivered what i wanted an elegant story arc with highly developed characters that made me actually feel something","504":"this book starts out telling the story of frederick who falls deeply in love with jette showing his love through song unfortunately their love is forbidden and with jette's pregnancy they are set on the run the german couple finds themselves on a boat to america however they don't land in new york but their boat takes them to new orleans and the book is the story of their manly progeny i feel a little dimwitted because i really didn't see the ending coming whereas many could see it a mile away for me the ending is what brought this book from an awesome five star read to four i just didn't like the ending this book is so lighthearted and uplifting until you come to the downer of an ending","505":"this book is filled with rich engaging characters at the end i was sad that it was over and almost wanted to begin again","506":" i enjoyed reading about the family but i guess i wasn't thrilled with the writing style the author continually foreshadowed teased upcoming events so you always knew what was around the corner he would talk about one character and say we would find out soon enough how bad it could be and sure enough the character died or had something bad happen to them so it took away any kind of suspense or surprise i thought the early part of the story with jette and frederick were the best once we got into the twins it got a bit convoluted to me and each character's individual story was diluted","507":"it was interesting to me because my grandmother immigrated to the midwest iowa with her parents and siblings in 1901 and i'm guessing had a few similar experiences although they were farmers not business people the story didn't hook me as much as i'd hoped since it was a library journal best book of the year but it did give me an idea of what life was like during that time period there were many characters i would have liked to get to know on a deeper level it was ok but i wouldn't read it again","508":"very enjoyable read although very very sad in parts there are many humorous stories as well a good snapshot of the last hundred years of american history through the eyes of one small town immigrant family","509":"a great novel i loved loved loved this book grandson writes the story of his grandparent's romance journey from germany to america in the late 1800's this book is filled with self discovery lots of deep character revelation music humor and food a woman decided to escape her overprotective mother in germany with the man she loved and they find themselves eventually as owners of a restaurant in missouri living a routine but drama filled life their children and the next generation are an unforgetable mixture of quirky loveable characters so well written","510":"lost interest half way through and did not finish","511":"3 5 stars it was a bit wordy for me but i did enjoy it","512":"another good american immigrant family story with some unexpected mystery and twists","513":" this is a multi generational story about an immigrant family to america they land in the midwest and stay there through four generations there are lots of secrets and some lives turn out more successfully than others depending on your own values but i think the author's point of view can be summed up in a line from the book as long as you have family around to love you and care about you that is all you really need there is love of family music and country little rancor over money ironic how the bad penny turns out a very good read","514":"this book was difficult to put down i love reading a story that takes you through several generations the characters came alive for me beautifully written","515":"a story of the many ways one can show love and be loved beautiful","516":"while i liked the premise of the book about an immigrant couple who comes to america and their family's journey toward becoming gully american i thought the plot was a bit contrived no sooner did one bad thing happen to the family then you knew something else bad was on the way the beginning was very good but the end seemed the author was in a hurry to be done with the book however i did like the characters and i think that's what kept me reading","517":"for the most part i very much enjoyed this novel my great grandparents would have immigrated from germany and switzerland around the same time that jette and frederick immigrated to the states in this novel i was fascinated by their journey and their first experiences with america i found myself imaging my ancestors on a very similar journey the first half of this novel follows jette through her experiences as a new american and i devoured this part of the novel i was in awe of her strength in even the worst of adversity unfortunately i wasn't such a fan of the second half of the novel the narrator of the novel james jette's grandson comes of age and becomes the main character i recognize that jette and james lived very different lives in very different times and that would warrant a marked change in the pace and tone of the novel i feel that having the same narrator throughout there could have been more consistency with the tone the novel felt like two separate novels hastily sandwiched together we go from jette's valiant struggles as a new american in the first half to discussions of james' frequent masturbation and a shall we say amorous high school teacher in the second half i just couldn't reconcile the differences in the two halves reviewed at http theinsomniacbibliophile blogsp","518":" i'm kind of torn about this book i liked many of the characters rosa and lomax were my favorite but i also liked jette and frederick on the other hand george tried to tell too many stories all these stories ended up being kind of surface y instead of deep and meaningful much of the book felt like an afterword of the and this is what happened to every character in 50 words or less variety i liked where the beginning was going with jette and frederick and then their part of the story abruptly ended and we were trying to follow too many people at once another beef i had with this book was how time passed one minute joseph is ten years old and falling in love with the neighbor girl and about five pages later he's old enough to propose to her it just felt like a summary of lives instead of anything meaningful also there are way too many crazy characters for one small town i realize that it takes place over about 100 years but it still made it hard for me to suspend my disbelief but despite the things i didn't like the book was fun to read because of the writing i think if george had an idea that wasn't quite so sprawling i would read another book of his","519":"this book was a lot different than i expected i had to jump over a couple of scenes and there is some profanity it is a lot sadder than i thought it would be","520":"a pleasant novel that aspires to be sherwood anderson's great winesburg ohio while it doesn't quite reach that level it still is a nice read","521":"beautifully written i don't think so very much like forrest gump in the sense that every possible historical highlight or cliche was touched upon during this epic novel i couldn't wait for it to end","522":"i love family sagas and this one was quietly engaging with some surprises along the way","523":"classic story i have had this on my to read list for quite some time i should not have postponed it for so long easy to read and so enjoyable great characters","524":" a grandson's narrative of his family's beginnings in this country and all the joys and sorrows that went into their lives a true feel good book that will have you laughing and crying in the same breath we follow the journey of frederick and jette from hanover germany young newlyweds who are making their way in a strange new land full of promise their journey ends in a little town in missouri where they make their way as barkeepers and begin to grow their family the people they meet and how their lives are affected makes for one wonderful truthful story a good american is a joy and gives the reader a glimpse of why this country is called the melting pot","525":"i just received this firstreads book today and am excited to read it thank you goodreads for selecting me as a winner of this soon to be published book","526":" i saw this book in a bookstore a few years ago and knew from the cover that i needed to read it it's from an author who lives in my hometown and it has music notes on the cover after moving away i finally picked this book up at my local library and it blew my mind all of the things i love music history genealogy german and damn good literature can be found in this book i've found myself wondering about how frederick and jette's story compares to the stories of my own german ancestors' journeys to america the narrator james takes the reader through a range of emotions while seeming to remain somewhat distant and impartial i would compare it to a cross between steinbeck's east of eden and john irving's a prayer for owen meany prepare to laugh have your heart broken and be utterly transfixed by this book","527":"i really enjoyed the middle of this book though i found the beginning a bit hard to get into and the ending a bit rushed it seemed like the older the story the more time it took to tell by the time the author got to the present time it felt like he had hastily skipped over decades i thought i was in the 1950s and then all of a sudden reagan was elected and then it was 2001 i guess i understand the need to spend more time with the older generations but it was a little annoying i did enjoy it though and i think anyone who likes history and stories of ordinary families will like this one","528":"a true family saga that spans the 20th century points high and low absorbing and lyrical i thoroughly enjoyed it","529":"enjoyed the story and character development for the most part but every time they were happy there would be some kind of tragedy it was just a bit too much for my liking","530":"a great easy read was a wonderful escape and a beautiful story","531":"a good book a mix of an immigrant story and a boy coming of age not overly gripping but entertaining","532":"seemed to go on forever and yet never got anywhere george captured the description of the town and its inhabitants just right i guess i just didn't care that much something felt missing to me","533":"a good american is a good book especially if you're familiar with the mid west i particularly liked the references to music pg wodehouse and general quirkiness","534":"this book was excellent rarely do i get attached to characters in the way that i did with a good american i thought this novel was beautifully done","535":"this is the story of three generations of a family begun as a young couple emigrates from prussia to a small town along the missouri river and concluded more than a century later by the narrator a grandson of that couple now in his own retirement years this is a story of birth and death of marriage and illness of boys climbing trees and going to the prom of preachers who preach of musicians who make music and of widows who pull themselves together to make a life for their children this is a story of how the ordinary rarely chronicled events of living shape individuals and families each member of this family was drawn with depth possessing their unique configuration of weakness and strength predictability and growth if this book had a flaw it is that it was over written adjectival phrases were layered in luscious alliteration piled precariously their towering tiers threatening to topple onto the page toweling the narrative in a tangle of descriptive words apparently alex george writes by the motto \"why use a simple word when a 20 letter alternative exists\" at times i felt as if a thesaurus had thrown up its drunken hang over onto the page but this is a petty complaint for a beautifully told family story","536":"very good tale of the european american migration at the turn of the 20th century everyone has a family story and this one is really intriguing from germany to missouri the story of the meisenheimers takes the reader through 3 generations this story takes many twists and turns but as it weaves its way to the end their is an interesting twist which makes it a truly good and memorable book","537":"a great start the story of a young couple coming to america as it progresses we see the next two generations figuring out their own lives a lot of good bits but overall it felt too contrived like the plot and characters were made up as he went along","538":"this was a very easy read i enjoyed reading it","539":"a multi generational story of a german family who emigrates to the u s and ends up in beatrice missouri the story follows the family through triumphs and tragedies coinciding with historical data such as world war i jim crow the kennedy assassination and so on only moderately interesting","540":"i love this book that follows an family from it's immigrant roots to today and how music weaves it's way through their lives there were time when my heart was in my throat as i read about their sorrows and joys at times i found myself wondering if it were true very enjoyable","541":"by the end of the book you feel like a member of the meisenheimer family i'm so sad to be finished with their story loved it","542":"this was an interesting twist on one family's quest to become american i agree with others in that the author did drag the story out longer than i would have liked but the ending was very interesting and not something that i imagined it to be","543":"started strong then fell below my expectations good story nice book but nothing that hasn't been told before nothing really new or interesting would make a good beach book no effort required to read or understand","544":"started off strong but then fizzled","545":" this book reminded me a lot of ragtime it follows the life of one family of immigrants from 1904 to the present it's presented as a memoir but is apparently fiction which took away from it a bit for me especially in the last half or so which is presented from the 2nd son's perspective although i think his brother teddy's perspective would have been more interesting since it's a fictional memoir it would have been easy to tell the story from that more interesting perspective james' perpetual hang doggedness about his solitary life and his thinly veiled autobiographical novels kind of irritate after a while however the writing is still engaging and often humorous even if what befalls the family is often saddening","546":" this book started out really well up until the perspective changed to following frederick's grandson who to be fair is narrating the book from the start i was thinking it would end up with a 5 star rating from me but then the book just got weird when the story opens frederick and the love of his life jette live in germany and jetta has become pregnant to the horror of her family who refuses to speak with them after this on a whim they decide to move to america to start a new life end up on a boat to new orleans instead of new york what difference does it make they're both new and of course their lives change drastically frederick loves his new country and attempts to absorb it completely and be a good american while jette isn't so sure but they bring their children into the world in their new country and raise them to be good americans as well it's a generational story the narration begins by following frederick and his acclimation to the us which was immensely interesting and powerful then it moves onto his son joseph first generation american who has to bridge the gap between his german parentage and his american peers for both frederick and joseph music plays a big part in their lives as americans and the music plays a big part in the lives of the grandchildren as well as they take part in a barbershop quartet singing pop tunes at parties and hymns at weddings and funerals but when the narration turns to the grandson james things turn weird james seems to have very little personality and is sort of in this go with the flow sort of mentality the oldest grandson stands up to joseph and says he doesn't want to take over the family business so the responsibility comes to james who complains about it non stop but never actually does anything about it this is just one example and he whines constantly additionally sex becomes a main theme of the book and not in a good way i realize that he was a teenage boy but we did manage to make it through both frederick and joseph's sections with no cases of view spoiler masurbation related deaths shared masturbation stories between boys who are whacking off simultaneously in the boys bathroom at school seduction of multiple high school students by a teacher whose husband commits suicide as a result seduction of one twin's girlfriend by the other twin leading to fights pregnancy and the guilty twin quitting school hide spoiler certainly there was sex involved in the lives of the first and second generation after all they ended up in america due to premarital sex and well there's the issue revealed in the ending as well but the focus on the abnormalness of it all was off putting and certainly went nowhere to endear me to the characters and the ending was just really disappointing i guess the moral is no matter how awesome you are trying to start an amazing new life in america your family will still go to shit after two generations sigh but the music tying everything together throughout was wonderful and made me miss my musical family","547":"i really enjoyed this immigrant story of a young couple who come from germany to new orleans and then settle in missouri it's full of great stories lots of action compelling characters and goes through the next two generations so quickly you will completely lose track of time fun fact the british author now lives in columbia mo","548":"when i received a copy of a good american by alex george i was surprised to find a musical instrument and musical notes on it's cover i found the cover to be rather beautiful but was confused as to why or how music ties into the story of a family then i read the book and i realized what a pivotal role music plays in the lives of the people of one particular immigrant family however what i really realized after finishing this novel is that i will forever remember this book as being one of the most lyrical and eloquent gems i've ever come across in the literary world filled with emotion drama warmth compassion and extraordinary detail this novel is sure to amaze you in every sense of the word the author with his lyrical and lush prose takes us on a journey with a couple who migrate from germany in order to start their family and onwards with the many other members of the same family as they grow assimilate to the culture of their new home and slowly transform each following his own dreams and aspirations to become a good american their roots entwining in the american soil and nourished by their fondness of music and their love for each other incredibly poignant tremendously joyous full of grace and poetry filled with humor and sadness love and heartbreak this novel is sure to take your breath away it is an absolute shocker that this is alex george's first novel for it does not read like a debut novel at all historical fiction and a family drama this wonderful story will transport you into an enigmatic and endearing world a must read","549":"interesting family saga in their adjustments to establish a life in the states and to be a good american","550":"really enjoyed the writing of this book interesting story of a family that comes to the us told thought several generations","551":"a good american got an extra star or two for being the multi generational tale of a family of german immigrants i love a sweeping saga and could picture my own german ancestors in similar predicaments the prose was clever and i liked the frequent use of foreshadowing almost like teasers very cleverly placed some surprising twists kept me turning pages till the very end and i will forgive the inclusion of a barbershop quartet","552":"story of a young couple coming to america in the early 1900'sthey take over a bar which eventually becomes a restaurant by the time the grandson takes over","553":" if i could i'd give a four star rating to the first third of this book for me that was when the voice of the narrator was strongest and sweetest the conflicts and characters focussed on in the middle of the book too closely resembled those of the first third and not in a good way and the final third didn't live up to the promise of the beginning i found myself wondering if the author considered keeping the entire book in the third person point of view reading his afterword it is clear that the larger themes of the story are borrowed from his experiences and those of his mother perhaps the characters got a little too close to home in the last two thirds of the story as always take my review with a grain of salt my taste in books is a bit odd and you could well read this and come away adoring it","554":" this book came as my literary book club pick of the month with increadible fanfare such as best book in 20 years what a dissapointment editor amy einhorn the help and author alex george my guess is ms einhorn did most of the writing took 5 years to bring this thing to print john jakes could have written it in 5 months what this is is typical pop culture fiction telling the story of a multigenerational family being born living and dying with the events of the 20th century occuring in the background though mostly as brief mentions the characters and there are many are necessarily shallow and the author tries to make the reader feel empathy for them by adding a sentance or two of pop psychology background for each the book is written in the third person but then suddenly switches to first person for a while for no apparent reason and then back again it does this three or four times and seems to serve the sole purpose of allowing the otherwise omniscient narrator be unaware of a single event that four other characters know the author tries to distinguish himself from john jakes by adding two john irving characters to the story for very short stretches a dwarf lawyer who rides a bicycle to work and is married to another character and a preacher who is stupid enough to believe one of his congregants is jesus becaue he thought he saw him standing on water one day the book is fast reading thank goodness it will apeal to fans of john jakes but not john irving","555":"i'm ditching this book a two thirds what could have been a good story quickly degrades into a cheesefest of predictable plots written in a language so sentimental and riddled with cliche it makes you cringe at least once every page life's too short to waste it on bad writing","556":"a good read story on many levels spanning early 1900's to the present including many generations of a german immigrant family and their various attempts at being a good american the historical aspect was right on and the personal history of jette and frederick's family was involving","557":" a classic immigrant's tale expanding through the generations to a family that could be yours or mine this is a beautiful story of what truly makes america great a melting pot country created through hard work loyalty and the sweat and dreams of ordinary men and women each day the meisenheimers lived lives that were those of good americans broken and imperfect often stubborn and opinionated but filled with courage and conviction one of my favorite lines is near the end of the book and comes from james the narrator writer looking back on his life he remembers his infatuation with a young woman who marries another leaves town and returns years later she is no longer the lovely ingenue that he remembers but a somewhat shrewish older woman he wishes that she had stayed away and left his memories untarnished but he feels no rueing of the past or even gratitude at his lucky escape instead i feel just a vague sense of regret that the youthful innocence of my dreams was no match for the bruising banality of real life alex george an immigrant himself has told a tale as big as this great country of ours the tale of a good american well done","558":"a well done story of america through the eyes of a german family whose parents immigrated just after the turn of the 20th century knowing nothing about america except exciting bits the couple were naive enough to think that taking a ship to new orleans was just as close as one going to new york i wonder if that is how a lot of stories start they end up chasing a job prospect into missouri and end up rooting their family history there the book is funny and poignant as it takes us through 100 years of mesanheimers with enough twists and turns to make it a page turner","559":"loved the author's descriptive use of words and characters it was just the book i needed for summer george's storytelling took me on an entertaining journey","560":"story of a young couple who leave germany and come to america they end up settling in beatrice missouri and become americans story covers four generations and the events that happened during that time a good read","561":"i almost gave up on this book after reading about a quarter of it it did get better a lot better after that i'm glad i stuck with it","562":"i agree with the other reviews that stated this book is shallow and formulaic i kept wishing for the story and characters to develop and to take off but it never did there are many worth while stories of immigrants who have come to america seeking their dreams this is not one of them","563":"i picked up this book in the early afternoon and stayed up late to finish it i was that engrossed when i first finished it my rating was a high 4 but on thinking about it overnight the best i can do is a 3 spoiler alert at end of review so keep reading at your own risk i loved the story especially having grown up with immigrant grandparents who prided themselves on being american boy could i relate to frederick he sounded just like my grandmother when she described herself as i'm no foreigner i'm an american the story of the generations could be the story of any immigrant family here in the us so all of that kept me reading and the author's style is very readable which is why this would be a good book for an airplane you can get lost in the story and forget that you are in metal tube at 30 000 feet here's why i can only give it a 3 if this were a debut novel i could overlook some of the twists of plot that are just too convenient and or too contrived but this isn't a first novel it's just the first one to really hit it big here in the us i just didn't believe the rosa story the author introduces her as a manipulative hypochondriac and then all of that is conveniently forgotten when she becomes the teacher and the doting aunt only here's the spoiler she's not really the aunt she's the mother of the narrator really where did that come from did i miss that she had hooked up with stefan who by the way turned out to be despicable the line about the cornet being used to kill lomax took away any redeeming qualities stefan may have had not that he had many","564":"alex george has a way with words the entire story reads easily and poetically this was a story of a family over a century filled with love and regret","565":" a good book i liked the beginning in between i felt losing the pace and thought of quitting but as i continued to read it was worth it it's a book where you feel you know the idea in very beginning but as it takes time to build up further you may feel a loss of pace but it demands persist ency and in the end its a feel good book its a story about a family moved to america and how they and their future generations settle there accepting america as home the story is a narration from one of the story character you will laugh and will relate to the situation as you proceed and it reveals surprises also in the end and for me that's what makes it a story with unconventional end","566":"beautiful family saga about life love friendship and becoming an american loved it","567":"a wonderful book about a german couple who came to america and made a home in missouri as they raised their young the story continues through 4 generations many surprises and secrets some sad parts and quite a bit of laughter a feel good book","568":"enjoyed this book so much and since i found a zinger in it i will read again read at thousand trails in orlando clermont florida","569":"this possibly would have gotten four stars if the constant attempts at foreshadowing didn't go so annoying it felt like every few chapters ended with lines like but that was all about to change or other sentences like that and what could've been a huge twist in the story was done so nonchalantly i had to go back and re read to make sure i didn't miss something so yeah just so so due to the frequency of annoyances","570":"the writing makes it easy to put yourself into this story imagining what life was like for the characters in the town of beatrice missouri and to fully experience the range of emotions captured by the story a truly captivating book utterly re readable likely the best book i have ever read","571":"pleasant semi historical read tracing a family through

story through two more generations to present day it has some humor some sadness some quirky characters nothing too deep but kept me interested throughout","574":"started out a little slow but soon i was hooked hated it to end","575":"the first half of the book is actually worthy of four stars but the second half drags it down to three","576":"great book the story from generation to generation was wonderful","577":"this novel revolves around the story of the meisenheimer family's transition from german immigrants to americans as told through the eyes of their great grandson i loved the characters the telling of middle america's history through immigrants' eyes and the connection i felt to the story as my great grandparents were immigrants too george adds unexpected twists and uses foreshadowing in the book to keep the reader intrigued and guessing what might come next in this family's saga i truly enjoyed every minute of this read","578":"this is a slow starter but would recommend has a thoughtful ending that makes think about our families as new americans","579":"excellent read a timeless story of an american family","580":"began a little slow twist at the end was good however it ended a little too rapidly great read for historical fiction not great for pure entertainment","581":"a good american starts in 1904 in germany where frederick meisenheimer and jette furste a lovelorn couple decide to flee to new york after jette is disowned by her family for getting pregnant they hop the first steamer not realizing it's headed to new orleans from the coastal louisiana city they head north to missouri where frederick hopes to find work they settle in beatrice mo where generations of the meisenheimer family will flourish and fulfill the proverbial american dream so many lives past through this novel but the main focus is around the meisenheimer's there is nothing extraordinary about the meisenheimers instead they are ordinary people living ordinary lives and being grateful for their opportunities and their family i enjoyed reading this novel it was well written for a first novel","582":"novels started off fantastic it had a great story line about german immigrants coming to america they lived the life of the american dream the characters were easy to like the book would have been fantastic if 30 pages werent missing toward the end of this advanced cpcopy leaving out the denoument","583":"jette u0026amp fredrick flee germany in order to be able to wed the come to the united states and end up in beatrice missouri the power of music weaves throughout the book a family story with secrets and anger","584":"i really liked this book it was a great story and i enjoyed how it covered several generations if i had to give a criticism it would be that the author spends alot if the book on the first part of the story and then almost rushes through the second 50 or so odd years would definitely recommend it though","585":"this was a great book if you love historical fiction and intergenerational books it also was the perfect blend of humorous and sad parts which is what life is like right","586":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the first half of this book was great it took a little while to get going but once frederick and jette were in america i was hooked i couldn't put the book down yet once the narrator was born the story seemed to stagnate jette faded into the background and it stopped being about immigration and more pseudo fantasy ie with the dwarf and giant and minister thinking james's brother was jesus the twist at the end was just out of nowhere and didn't make sense i understand that the author was tr the first half of this book was great it took a little while to get going but once frederick and jette were in america i was hooked i couldn't put the book down yet once the narrator was born the story seemed to stagnate jette faded into the background and it stopped being about immigration and more pseudo fantasy ie with the dwarf and giant and minister thinking james's brother was jesus the twist at the end was just out of nowhere and didn't make sense i understand that the author was trying to surprise the reader but it didn't work for one thing if rosa was pregnant wouldn't someone in the town have said something and furthermore it didn't correlate with the narration the narrator was omniscient telling us details about jette and frederick no one else knew but at the end he didn't know about rosa because everyone had covered it up rosa was one of the characters i was most interested in if the author was going to include that i would have liked to have known how she felt i was also a little annoyed because rosa specifically said she was going to stay independent without children and then the narrator gave her one the story left me frustrated by the end another thing the author did which really annoyed me was putting in sentences at the end of each chapter along the lines of 'little did he know his happiness was short lived' show don't tell it was so annoying let the reader find out for themselves overall the first half was great but the second half was a disappointment very readable though more","587":" 3 75 stars felt like i was sitting across the living room from the author as he sat back in an armchair and told this story totally readable entertaining multi generational immigrant tale related from perspective of a middle son stuck in family restaurant business starts with young couple falling in love at first sight and impulsively eloping to the new country a few things were far too glossed over kkk violence and the original couple's flip decision to emigrate most notably the spinster aunt was a fantastic character charming voice","588":"started off pretty good but somewhere around the middle part of the book my interest went kaput i stopped reading it but might pick it up again down the road","589":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here overall a very interesting story spanning several decades and generations not quite the epic i had expected and i felt that i was supposed to be connecting with the characters more than i was i wanted a few more in depth characters as opposed to several quickly sketched individuals who for the most part appeared to simply to move the plot forward and whose deaths became expected and commonplace","590":"such a good book i laughed i teared up and i couldn't stop reading i can hardly wait for bill to read this","591":"i get why people raved about this book but there was something about it that just didn't do it for me the blurb talks about all this 20th century american stuff that supposedly happens in the plot but the storyline merely touches on these things and doesn't go very far into depth with them also the twist ending yawn","592":"a solid immigrant story that takes place at the turn of the 20th century the novel takes us through the full gamut of emotions over years following multiple generations of a family that settled in the heartland of the country it is the story of a small town american dream the path from rootlessness to family tradition and pride","593":"loved this book it follows a family for 5 generations as by follow their dreams and emigrate to the united states a plot twist that i didn't see coming at all adds to the interest at the end of the book","594":"while browsing through costo's book section i came across a good american with a title like that of course i was going to pick it up after reading these words on the inside cover and so began my grandfather's rapturous love affair with america of course i was going to buy it i made a good choice that day a good american turned out to be all that i expected and more james meisenheimer is a proud third generation american living in beatrice missouri and the narrator of his family's epic tale james lovingly shares how life in america began for his grandfather frederick and his grandmother jette it was the early 1900's when frederick and jette met in the the grandest municipal garden in hanover the grosse garten frederick ambushed her by singing an aria from puccini's opera la boheme as the story goes they fell in love but jette's family did not approve rather than end their relationship our young lovers set out for a new life that new life was to begin in america frederick and jette stepped off the copernicus on june 5 1904 with only the clothes on frederick's back one suitcase for jette and two hearts filled with music a good american is a saga that spans through four generations of the meisenheimer family their journey takes us through many significant events in our country's history such as world war i the influenza epidemic prohibition the stock market crash and the list goes on alex george does a excellent job of incorporating these historical events into the lives of this family george has filled his novel with a wonderful cast of characters that do an amazing job of bringing the meisenheimer's journey to life as in every book that i read i always have my favorite this time it's james lomax an african american cornet player from new orleans a good american is a sentimental heartwarming read just as frederick's love affair began the moment he set foot on american soil my love affair for this book began the moment i turned to page one alex george i'm going to give you five stars","595":"really enjoyed this one although i wish there had been more detail yet at the same time it was a good concise family epic more later","596":"i absolutely loved this book and cannot wait to re read it someday soon the author's syntax and word choice frequently made me smile and even laugh with delight as i read some of the best sentences i have ever read the story itself is so truly american and each generation of the meisenheimer clan's story weaves easily into the history of america itself the first person narration makes it feel like you are just sitting down a being told a story which made the story more intimate and personal i hated for this book to end","597":"the beginning and end were the best","598":"as my family emigrated from germany to missouri i thought this would be a good read to get some insight as to how things may have gone with them it did not hit the mark there the circumstances of the books characters were too different to relate to but in general it was interesting and entertaining as it followed the family through a few generations","599":"i love family sagas and this one was outstanding nice unexpected twist at the very end","600":"i enjoyed the book but something about it left me feeling apathetic i never felt like i really connected to the characters the story line was good but i was never engrossed like i am with some novels my thought upon finishing was meh shrug it was pretty good","601":"alex achieved something remarkable he put together a cast of cabaret characters there was the dwarf the kinky teacher and the uber tall person set against a vivid musical backdrop and made it entirely believable i honestly thought i was reading a true story such is life","602":" this was a very comfortable read for me while visiting my family for christmas the chronicles of this families lives are so similar to many of ours even if you have no german ancestry which i do or have never lived in missouri which i have you will see your own family history in these pages i need to pack it up and send it to my dad thanks to nantucket bookworks for their basket of uncorrected proofs which i paw through every time i'm in town another winner make sure to add it to you shelves for summer reading","603":"i love generational novels it was a joy to read especially the first 4 5ths of the book the end seemed a little choppy and rushed but i enjoyed the twist and didn't see it coming at all i loved the voice the author used and the characters leap of the page and seem so real to me","604":"i would describe this book as one man's fireside chat about his family some nice antidotes but not too big on details","605":"reading this book is like eating your favorite comfort food you feel warm delicious and satisfied during and after you've stopped reading lot's of twists that made my eyes pop in surprise and more than once i laughed out loud while in a few chapters i might be quite angry love this book","606":"this is a hard one to rate i loved the multi generational story and the characters but halfway through the book the author starts narrating strictly from a teenage boys' perspective and goes overboard with the frequency and detail of the boy's masturbation habits and sexual thoughts we all know how teenage boys think and what most of them do and i didn't really want to read details about it in a story like this the rest of the story was captivating and made the book hard to put down i was impressed that the author who is an englishman that now lives in missouri has so accurately depicted life in the midwest over a period of time","607":"lucid and easy read historical fiction of a generational family drama","608":"an interesting multi generational family story full of sadness told from a male point of view","609":"this book was not at all what i expected i expected the views of young immagrants adjusting to life in a new country i didn't expect the humor and touch of wonder years this book delivered with a few twists and turns i didn't see coming","610":"maybe 3 5 stars kept me interested and there were a couple of twists i never saw coming the choices the author made with both frederick's and limax's characters made me angry but i suppose that if a writer can generate an emotional reaction that's indicative of the ability to tell a story well","611":"a readable family saga of a german immigrant family that settled in the small town of beatrice missouri in 1904 the story ends in contemporary times with the death of the narrator's father at 105 the novel captures historical moments and how the family through the generations came to adjust to america there is a lot to ponder about relationships family and love in this saga","612":"great writing i really was drawn into the characters' lives an excellent read","613":"i listened to this on cd in the car i could hardly wait to drive somewhere it was so engrossing i loved the characters following the families throughout the years and all of the surprises i was sad when it was over","614":"sweet storybook quality book following several generations of a family thru u s history","615":" greatly enjoyed this family saga of a young immigrant family that migrates from germany to a small town in missouri in 1905 following them and their descendants for the next 100 years the first half of the book dealing with the couple frederick and jette and their children and then the focus switches to their grandchildren i was disappointed that jette who starts out as a strong female character evolved differently than i would have expected but coming to a strange land and having children could certainly have an impact reminded me of the master butchers singing club by louise erdrich with the german immigrants and the focus on music and also empire falls by richard russo which has a small town setting and a restaurant in common","616":"i really enjoyed this book for the first 250 pages then we came to what sometimes seems to be the obligatory teenage male coming of age scene where he is seduced by the middle aged woman i hate that story line felt like a different book the last 150 pages or so hmmmm","617":"a great read i felt like a part of the family","618":"\"we cannot exist without our histories they are what define us \"i love this quote from the book as it sums it up well and reminds me to appreciate my own history and heed my choices as it will become a part of future generations histories frederick and a pregnant yette immigrate from germany in the late 1800s to america ending up in beatrice missouri a good american follows several generations of meisenheimers through the good times hard times secrets lies war prosperity and death a good american is a sweet family saga that is richly written with intriguing characters with a lot of depth i'm not sure i'm in the i can't believe it's over camp but it was a good solid story","619":"interesting story about immigrants and the generations that follow holds your interest and is a good read","620":"nicely written gripping story however i had a different expectation as i was looking for more details about the life of first gen immigrants in the story it goes on to cover the next two generations as well so details get lost still it is an enjoyable read","621":"good book but kept renewing it at the library and didn't end up finishing it","622":"storylines that sweep me in and keep me there have always been a favorite and this one deliveries from start to finish","623":"i really enjoyed the themes and sweep of this book but felt that the characters were unevenly developed still a great read","624":"the story of a german couple who immigrates to missouri in the early 1900s then you follow the lives of the 2nd and 3rd generations a good read with a plot twist that i never saw coming but loved","625":"i enjoyed the beginning of the book with the adventure of coming to a new country and the excitement of new things and a new culture as the book went on i started to dislike its characters and became disappointed in them it is solid writing however and the book was a quick read","626":"in search for a home the family finds many interesting characters that help them in america this book caught my attention right away and did not lose it i found it hard to put down at times it was fun to be a part of the family laugh with them cry with them and watch as they endured and came through very difficult times","627":" it's 1901 in hanover germany and frederick and jette are madly in love despite jette's wish for her daughter to be with someone that is more financially stable she goes against her mother wishes and wants to be with fredrick deciding to escape the town they grew up in they set to board new york but at the last minute they change to new orleans thinking there is not much of a difference when they settled in new orleans they experience a new word of lively food entertainment and bliss they each learn english purchase a home to stay in and live the life they always dreamed that is until jette becomes pregnant with her first child and fredrick must work to take care of his family tensions arise when he wants to go to the army leaving jette alone with the kids and jette must decide if her marriage is worth fighting for narrated by their grandson james he recounts their history together and what they learned about moving to america i really hated to give this book a two i wanted to really like it it stated off very promising i was dazzled by the descriptive images when the author described the music and the scenery of new orleans and was overwhelmed at the writing style however this book was very inconsistent towards the end what started off a story about two characters it came a story about several characters that was not relevant to the original characters my advice with authors is if you are going to write a story about different characters at least try to separate the stories together that way it does not trample the plot's intent too much was going on for me i became bored and lost interest all together","628":"even though the writing seemed choppy at times i thoroughly enjoyed this story of german immigrants set in mid missouri the setting mirrors so much of my own family roots a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction","629":"a saga about an immigrant german family who makes their way to missouri and subsequent generations no depth to anything or anyone","630":"in general i love books that follow a family through the generations i loved that this one started the immigration of germans jette and frederick to missouri i do have to say it was the first third of the book i enjoyed the most i liked the whole book but i could have done without the tidbits about the narrator's nieces and nephews","631":"wonderful read","632":"an interesting read about several generations of one family i liked the stories and the cast of characters but the author ended most chapters with his version of a cliffhanger and it drove me crazy like but they didn't know what was just around the corner or they never would have imagined what happened next really annoying otherwise it was quite well written","633":"i won this book as a goodreads first read it was hard for me to get through and i found myself losing interest multiple times there were some twists and turns but ultimately it was not a book i loved or would suggest","634":" a good american is a multi generation story of a german family who immigrates to the united states in the early 1900's still unmarried when they learn that they are expecting their first child frederick meisenheimer and henriette \"jette\" furst embark on their journey across the atlantic ocean after jette's mother tells her daughter that she will 'die of shame' because of the unorthodox position jette has placed her in after all jette was 'carrying the bastard child of a man she jette's mother despised' intending to travel to new york frederick and jette come upon the ship copernicus which is destined for new orleans jette proclaims \"new york new orleans what's the difference they're both new that's good enough \" so off they go to a location they had never heard of their dreams of starting a new life together with their unborn child full of promise as well as apprehension once in new orleans frederick learns of an employer in missouri who is eager to hire hard working germans because 'most americans are lazy' determined to continue their journey and get settled before their baby arrives frederick and jette set off again - this time their destination is rocheport missouri - a town midway between st louis and kansas city however fate prevails and the young couple get as far as a little town named beatrice where their son joseph meisenheimer is born so it is in beatrice missouri where the meisenheimer family takes root and this is largely the setting for the story that unfolds that chronicles the dreams hopes and struggles of what depicts the life story of so many european immigrants during the early 1900's being a 2nd generation american myself my grandparents too immigrated to the united states during this same time period from what would eventually become the czech republic i found myself relating to one of the main characters james - the grandson of frederick and jette who tells his family story in simple yet poignant terms humor sadness joy and tragedy are all depicted in a very real way and i appreciated the author's level handed approach to unraveling and revealing family secrets - avoiding an overly dramatic flair that some other author's may have pursued a good american is not a masterpiece but it does represent a family story to which many readers will relate and perhaps offer them an opportunity to reflect on the adventures of their own grandparents who once dared to begin their journey in a foreign land 'full steam ahead'","635":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it is the first novel for alex george well crafted lots of humor but deep meaning along with the fast moving narrative","636":"i liked this i didn't love it but i zipped right through it","637":"i loved this book the story flowed along and i couldn't turn the pages fast enough i did feel like the story was a little rushed through the ending and would have appreciated a little more character development of the third generation characters","638":"some of the twists and turns in this epic novel were totally unexpected a good read","639":"i can't blame anyone but myself for having to slog through these nearly 400 pages i'm the one who chose this novel as the first selection for my book group with my in laws i found a good american to be rambling cumbersome and centerless i had high hopes for the development of the theme of music in the book it brings frederick and jette together before they immigrate to the united states frederick is enthralled by the distinctly american genre of jazz when they first arrive but its larger meanings diminish rather than build over the course of the book i took issue with the impossibly omniscient first person narrator the character in the book in whom i was perhaps least interested and that is saying something as alex george introduces a parade of barely fleshed out characters i could have hardly cared less about i was underwhelmed by the revelation near the conclusion of the book and am still scratching my head about its significance i am giving it two stars rather than one because i did enjoy the early part of the book about frederick and jette's courtship their passage to the united states and the contrast between frederick's eager embrace of becoming american with jette's more cautious and conflicted assimilation once the story has to move beyond their relationship it becomes a clunky aimless series of anecdotes about the next several generations i'm frankly a bit mystified by how much positive attention this book has received","640":" three generations of a missouri based german american family come alive as a grandson unwinds the tangled tales of his heritage plot elements include the power of music the family business of food and beverage religious matters requited and unrequited love immigration sibling rivalry race and war so there is a lot going on in this novel giving it an old fashioned feel plenty of tragedy along the way perhaps a bit more than i would have liked but all the dark turns were entirely believable in the context of history","641":"fast moving family epic","642":"this book was great it is covers 3 generations of a family one of the best books i have read in a long time a must read","643":"i loved the first 3 4 of this book it was a beautiful story about an immigrant couple settling in america and making the sacrifices for their family i loved feeling the struggles of frederick and jette and particularly as frederick went back to germany to fight in wwi as an american it gave you a real feel for what it might have been like coming to this country the last 1 4 of the book dealt with more modern times and felt a bit more like our current country it was cheapened with things like affairs and it felt as if a different author wrote this part still worth a couple of days of my time i enjoyed it","644":"really liked most of this book the story of the first two generations was wonderful but i thought the last third of the book was less a story and more just a listing of events in the family for me it lost a lot of its appeal at the end still a good read just didn't hold to the promise of the first two thirds would probably give 3 5 stars","645":"i was quickly immersed into a good american the story of young frederick and jette un wed german lovers running from the disgrace that their unborn child would bring to jette's well to do family grabbed me from page one their story brings them across the atlantic ocean to new orleans up the mississippi river to missouri where the couple finds themselves when their child joseph makes his unannounced way into the world this begins the saga of the meisenheimers a meandering story that follows the meisenheimers for generations spanning a century in beatrice missouri a good american started out so promising i loved the adventurous wild fun stories of frederick and jette making their way in a foreign land and wanting nothing more than to be good americans frederick is a wonderful character and by far my favorite in the book funny stubborn caring and proud frederick absolutely stole the show sadly the story slows with each passing generation i am almost disappointed that such a wonderful chance at a great novel morphs into a generic cliche' of small town americana at one point at the senior prom i thought biff george mcfly and doc brown may show up i'm still not convinced that they didn't from the middle to nearly the end the book lacks depth character energy and imagination the book redeemed itself a little towards the end but not enough what started out as a sure fire favorite fizzled to nothing by the end i wish i could give a good american a better review but i just can't half the book was really great the other half was terrible almost like it was written by two different people","646":"i loved the first half of the book the characters just grabbed me and held on but the 2nd half just started plodding along and delved into some needless sexual plots to move it along these needless sexual references and inclusions seriously disappointed and cheapened what began as a wonderful story","647":"i think in different circumstances i'd really like this book need to re visit it when i'm not so bogged down with life in general","648":" this big juicy multi generational story features a bizarre and eclectic cast of characters and has more unexpected plot twists than an m night shyamalan movie starting out in germany and set against the backdrop of small town midwest america a good american covers 100 years in the meisenheimer family and is told from the point of view of grandson james historical events--from wwi to the great depression to race relations kennedy's assassination and beyond--are seamlessly woven into the story as they inexorably impact the meisenheimers their friends and their neighbors this book has everything comedy tragedy dwarves giants young love murder and lots and lots of music i couldn't put it down","649":" i'm a sucker for a let's go to america story i admire those who leave all they know with the hope of making a new successful life here in the u s alex george creates a somwhat eccentric family although whose isn't and follows them from germany to new orleans to missouri the last two destinations chosen purely on hunches the generations are woven together in their musical talent and in their bar restaurant diner business these were people i grew to care about and at the end the huge twist i didn't see coming ended up being satisfying","650":"i enjoyed this book it's the story of a young couple from germany immigrating to the united states at the turn of the century it spans three generations a good life story","651":" frederick and jette meisenheimer flee germany when frederick and jette's swift romance brings forth the unwelcome news - to jette's mother - of jette's impending motherhood jette begs frederick for the only chance at happiness she sees a new life in america in 1904 the couple board capernicus leaving their homeland for a new life in a new world together upon landing in new orleans frederick sets off to explore the streets while jette who is by now heavy with child stays at the hotel frederick is entranced by the chaos and music of new orleans and returns to a sleeping jette under its spell \"any lingering homesickness had been eradicated by his first excursion onto the streets of america everything he'd seen had been unimaginably different from the dry dour streets of hanover and to his surprise he was not sorry in the slightest he was smitten by the beguiling otherness of it all \" thus begins their multigenerational story the love story of frederick and jette and frederick's love story with his new country","652":" what a wonderful book immigrating from germany jette and frederick make it as far as beatrice missouri and there they set down roots frederick loves america and everything in and about it jette misses her home in germany this is a generational novel filled with wonderful characters and narrated by a grandson continuing threads are a bar that changes as the times dictate a love of music from opera to barbershop quartet and a love of chess the author seamlessly traverses all the great moments in history from world war i to prohibition by allowing the reader to follow this family through all these trials their sadnesses and losses their victories and joys we are left with a book that captures the immigrant experience in wonderful detail and brilliant descriptions","653":"at times interesting narrative of german immigrants that settle in missouri and includesseveral generations although a surprise is revealed near the end this is not the most exciting readnor a page turner","654":"epic tale of the first two generations of a german family who have emigrated to the us if you had masked the author and asked me to guess who wrote it i would have guessed louise erdrich it was that good another reviewer compared the author to john irving the characters have depth the story line is consistent and entertaining and i wanted it to go on when i reached the end perfect go for it","655":" this is a very interesting book it start in 1904 in germany with jette and frederick and quickly moves to beatrice a small town in missouri to which they settled not knowing how to speak english but they quickly learn my own great grandparents immigrated from sweden this book is narrated by james the second child of joseph and the grandson of jette and fredericks the beginning of the book is of course telling about how jette u0026amp frederick meet and their travels here to the states and them establishing themselves as good americans once i hit about halfway through the book i felt as if a different writter had shown up and was now writting which almost made we want to give the book 4 stars but then i thought perhaps this was done on purpose because the beginning of the book is telling about only what was shared with him from before he was born but as you move further in the book steven is talking about himself and what he knows for sure there are so many sujbects in this book that it could indeed be several books but that is life isn't it or rather the lives of many who are included in this novel i especially enjoyed the ending of the book although it did seem to move a little to quickly for me but what i enjoyed the most was an unexpected ending and i love that just when i think i have it all wrapped up i get a surprise i also got a believable story one that truly seemed more like non fiction than a fiction book this is fine small town drama at its best and i would highly recommend this book","656":"started out great but i lost interest towards the second half and gave up reading the rest","657":"the story of an emigrant i found it very slow in some places the story of the lovers takes too long to set up then the author skips years at random then ending drags on forever","658":"i read this book because it was the costco book of the month in february i loved the start of the book following the family as they immigrate to america the life they have and the people they share their lives with were wonderful but as the generations changed the book started to loose its charm i would rate the first half four stars and the last two stayed with two because i didn't feel like it was worth the time in the end","659":"american immigrant saga with especially quirky characters","660":" this is a wonderful book it is a real story the tale begins in 1904 in hanover germany when frederick falls in love with jette frederick does not meet the expectations of jette's mother and the two begin a love affair jette gets pregnant and the pair run away to america frederick's dream is to be a 'good american jette and frederick ultimately end up in beatrice missouri when their son arrives ahead of shedule the saga unfolds we follow the pair through their generation and that of their children and their childrens children this is an immigrants story of starting life in a new place with a new wife and a new baby through the years there are two wars influenza the depression racism births and death i found myself turning the pages late into the night and rooting for jette all the way a twist at the end was both unexpected and relished read it you will like it","661":"this book was a wonderful story about our previous generations journey as new americans and their hardships and joys one of the best books i have read in a while","662":" i loved this book it was the kind of read that brings you in gently and holds your attention until the end it's not flashy and there's not particularly much going on there but it's just nice sometimes i'm just in the mood to become invested in the characters i'm not really looking for some suspenseful page turner i just want to lose myself in a time and a place and this book does that perfectly it spans the time of three generations two newlywed immigrants and their children and grandchildren and details their experiences as new americans in the heartland and just when you find yourself thinking those days were purely idyllic reality swipes back in believably yet surprisingly i would love to read something else by alex george he writes beautifully simply easily and without being pretentious plus and i'll admit it the end actually made me cry a bit not an easy feat","663":"i paid 50 cents for this book i could hardly put this book down a wonderful multi generation novel words can't express how i felt reading this","664":"i really enjoyed it","665":"this was a really enjoyable read there was a lot of subtle humor and characters i enjoyed getting to know it wasn't terribly deep or moving no high literature here but still a fine read would have been perfect light vacation reading","666":"this is a 3 5 stars parts i liked but other parts were a little boring","667":" this is a beautiful story of an immigrant family and their lives in america frederick and jette are a young german couple who head for america when faced with an unplanned pregnancy they wind up in small town missouri where they establish themselves and try to become good americans the story is narrated by their grandson and includes love heartbreak quirky characters tragedy success for the first three fourths of the book i was enthralled totally engaged by the story and delighted with the smooth lyrical writing but the last part of the book disappointed a bit it seemed that the author decided he'd written enough and just had to get done the flow of the writing faltered the story became choppy and the characters faded in intensity and humanity there was a surprise twist at the end but by then i'd stopped caring and was eager for the end just like the author 3 5 stars for superb writing and engrossing story would have been 4 5 if the writing had maintained throughout","668":"this is a story of german immigrants who settle in missouri you will want to cry at times but you will also laugh at the crazy events that happen to this young german couple an easy and delightful read","669":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here kind of one big cliche filled with sentence level cliches but an easy story to listen to","670":"it was an interesting family epic for the first third then after what has to be called a climax scene it went seriously downhill a recitation of all the things gone wrong where the narrator even laments that he does not have his own tragedy unlike the rest of his family i finished it because i was ever hopeful that the cadence of the beginning of the book would return it didn't","671":"another really good one recommended it's a slow burn and it is subtle and creeps up on you but you won't believe the ending so heart warming and nicely done i loved how it was told from the point of view of the grandson the author did this very nicely and it really had the tenor and flavor of a younger family member repeated oft told family stories some very surprising and very emotional events pop up without apparent warning and really tug at your heartstrings","672":"this book surprised me i wasn't expecting to even pick it up at the library but the book i was looking for ended up not being on the shelf so i looked for the next book i could recognize on my tbr shelf and this was it it wasn't the best writing and at one point in the middle of the book the teen's sexual exploits were written so poorly it was distracting but it was a lovely small town family saga with just enough comedy and tragedy to be just what i needed","673":" \"the thought occurred to her that like the improvised melodies that lomax was spinning from the bell of his horn every life was a galaxy of permutations and possibilities from which a single thread would be picked out and followed for better or worse \" ~alex george a good americana single thread a strand of melody from behind a privet hedge in hanover germany spins out across two continents and a hundred years the story told through the eyes of a short order cook with a love of barbershop harmony love journeys the coming of age of a nation patriotism and ragtime heartbreak and tender humor a good american carried me along like the operas the novel's ebullient patriarch loved so passionately read more of my review on my blog","674":" this is one of those books that falls between ratings it deserves more than the 3 stars i'm giving it but when i compare what i've given 3 versus 4 stars in the past it's closer to those 3 star books anyway this was a page turner i enjoyed the story and the characters but i kept feeling like something was missing with the storyline the protagonist doesn't really achieve anything that the story makes you think he will but maybe that's the point as a generational story it's much more satisfying there are plenty of eventful moments for the other characters the last part of the book did feel rushed as though the author had spent too long developing the story and was hurriedly trying to wrap it up still it's worth reading the story engages you from the beginning as it jumps right in rather than providing a lot of description it's a good immigrant tale meaning that you get a generational view you see history through the eyes of different perspectives though i always find it annoying when an author has his or her characters meet a couple of famous people from real life and you have to think about the national character here it's what does it mean to be a 'good american '","675":"a good american is like the big rivers mentioned within its pages the mississippi and missouri large sprawling things from a distance they appear to flow along at an almost leisurely pace but within that flow are currents demanding attention a good american flows along like a big river never rushed and confident in its direction but just like the two rivers so important to the story once you get in for a closer look you realize that while the overall pacing seems calm there are lines running through the story that will pull you in and take your breath away","676":"great book following about 5 generations of a family here in the usa it followed the ups and down of their lives what was important to them u0026amp why we all should be proud of our heritage and this leads itself to this way of thinking","677":"really liked it alot","678":"very much enjoyed and would recommend","679":"loved the beginning but the book lost steam when it got into too many generations of the family","680":"nothing outstanding but a good story about 3 generations the first generation were immigrants from germany who settled in a small town in missouri interesting characters and intertwining lives i enjoyed it","681":"i started off thinking that this was based on a true story but figured out in the end that it was fiction because things were getting tied up too neatly but the story was enjoyable and entertaining the book chronicles 4 generations starting with the immigrants to the us up through the 2000's it was sometimes hard to keep things straight as the narrator switched from talking about his parents grandparents to talking as them","682":"great family saga type book about german immigrant couple who land in a small town in missouri in the early 1900's narrated by their grandson covers 5 generations of the family lots of quirky u0026amp unusual characters along the way has an interesting twist at the end that i didn't see coming i really enjoyed this book writing was excellent","683":"i'm angry with myself for reading the whole book boring the characters were flat and one dimensional i thought the omniscient grandson narrator was an awkward tool for the author to use there was no nuance or sublety to the writing just da dum da dum da dum da dum da dum da dum da dum da dum","684":" this was on my to read list ever since one of my favorite book bloggers said that it reminded her of east of eden and a tree grows in brooklyn both of which are my jam now that i've read it i can bestow my confirmation on such a high claim it's a multi generational family saga of immigrants starting around the 1870's and following them over the next century those kind of books really work for me even though their format can be so different from one another this one is a pretty straightforward history telling no jumping around in time or changing of narrators or any other tactics like that the sentences are short and to the point there are some heartbreaking parts and a lot of people die but it does span a century so that's probably going to happen big historical events take place in the background but the focus is always on the family there is a huge theme of home and what that means which hits my heart just right lots of happy things happen too and more than anything it left me with a sense of hope i think the only drawback to the story might be that as time went on and more and more children were born and thus more and more characters introduced i started losing my connection to them i was really tied up in the lives of the matriarch and patriarch along with their children u0026amp lomax the family friend i became the most emotional over events happening to them which was probably two thirds of the book after that it was harder to keep track and connect so by the time we met our narrator one of the grandchildren i didn't even care about his fate as much as i probably should have still the last third of it was enjoyable and kept with the same themes so it did flow naturally also i love it even more knowing that the author spent seven years writing it in the mornings at 5 a m before his day job as an attorney i obviously relate to this method of squeezing in creative time and for him to have produced something this lovely deserves high praise","685":"a good family saga of germans coming to america in early 1900 i have read this a while back but read all over again for book club","686":"just ok some good parts but it frustrates me when an author won't let anyone be happy","687":"excellent read i didn't see the twist at the end coming first book by alex george","688":"very good it starts in germany and ends in missouri starts in 1800's and ends in 2000's ~ susan","689":"this book starts out a quick read but then gets a little slow stick it though because there is an unexpected twist","690":"this is one of those books that doesn't really have a central storyline but rather tells of the ups and downs of multiple generations of a family and their surrounding community it was well written and held my attention although i would have liked to see some major climactic conflict to make it a little bit more exciting","691":"i really enjoyed the story ad the characters however it didn't really have a main conflict also it was quite anticlimactic the purpose is identified as the narrator tells the story of his grandparents this changes throughout the course of the book","692":"if you're looking for historical fiction about an immigrant family searching for the american dream through the ages look no further than a good american by alex george the novel begins with german lovers jette and frederick and follow their lives as they settle in small town beatrice missouri in the early 1900s we follow the meisenheimer family as each generation discovers their version of the american dreams i fell in love with jette and frederick as soon as they fell for each other their romance was so charming i couldn't help it read the rest of the review at http www fromlefttowrite com book r","693":"i kept waiting for something to happen it was not at all interesting for me","694":"i was really looking forward to reading this book but i am sorry to say it was a disappointment the only truly interesting character is killed off about a quarter of the way through the book i started to lose interest in the story shortly after that but i read on anticipating an upswing in the storyline pages and pages of bland uninteresting characters with mediocre lives there had to be a twist coming and then it came seriously is that the best this author could come up with good gracious reminded me of a twist straight out of a cheap harlequin romance novel","695":"good insight into the lives of immigrants in the early 20th century different from what i normally read but i liked it","696":"i'm very impressed i knew alex wrote but didn't realize that he was a 'writer ' i bought it at our little local local bookstore apparently it was the indie book of the month i enjoyed the multigenerational story set in a small town in missouri","697":"this is a very good tale of immigrants making their way in a new land it moves quickly and has a few twists along the way the role of music in the lives of the family continues throughout the book","698":"had it been an option i would have given it 3 1 2 stars it was a simple telling of a family's life in america shown through the generations just like in real life people died businesses failed arguements arose and disagreements abounded that is what made the book so enjoyable it could have been a family history of many of us","699":"this is a modern classic loved every minute of it great storytelling with flawed but compelling characters","700":"i loved this book big and sprawling but with characters i won't soon forget recommend","701":"started out okay but got progressively more shallow and ludicrous totally lost steam after the initial immigrant story it's like the author had this sweeping multi generational family saga in mind but was just going through the motions for the last two thirds of the book trust me go for east of eden instead","702":"i wasn't that wild about this book the plot was okay it just didn't stand out that much to me it just an okay read","703":"i picked this one up after seeing it on a list of best summer reads and it certainly fit the bill a good american is a refreshingly different take on the coming to america immigrant family story full of fun and surprising plot twists and giggle worthy characterizations of small town inhabitants alex george's novel entertains and absorbs","704":"this book would be hard not to like i think unless you need something a little more fast paced to hold your attention it was extra special for me being a rural missourian since it's an area of the country that's not typically featured as a locale for the kind of books i read i thought george did a good job at capturing the personalities of the various family members and even though the narrator's perspective was necessarily biased when it came to the characters he personally knew he came across as fairly neutral and even handed rather than the center of the universe it's a good length for a book which covers so much territory and while a lot gets thrown in at the end that doesn't happen in an unsatisfying way","705":"brilliant book","706":"a good start and decent middle lead to the last 75 pages which simply were 75 pages too many","707":"this was a quick read i enjoyed it","708":"overall an engaging book it lost momentum towards the end and the story fast forwarded and it wasn't as much of an immigrant story as i hoped for but i enjoyed and looking forward to reading it","709":"first half is great totally loses focus second half reviewed on my blog for blogher com bookclub http nycjenny com 2013 02 21 book r","710":"i feel like i've just sat by a fire with a dear old friend while he told me a tale of his family you all know this type of friend the one who weaves a great story and takes you back these friends teach you something but you are not clear on the lesson until days later thanks good friend thanks great writer","711":"i liked how it started with the grandparents' stories and continued on through the generations i was a bit shocked by the ending as i didn't notice the clues when i was reading it","712":"best book read 2012 so far","713":"i loved this story and was sad when it ended","714":"i enjoyed this book it was different from most of the books i've read in settings situations careers ambitions and has a wonderful mix of personalities and it has a wonderful ending i don't mean that everybody has a happy ending but instead it is the path that they author has devised for each character and so easy to read","715":"alex george's multi generational story articulates the meisenheimer family's modest beginnings in beatrice missouri after frederick and jette flee hanover germany to start a new life they end up in the small town of beatrice after their original plans to settle further west take an unexpected turn along the way we meet a plethora of bizarre but lovable characters that come in and out of the lives of the meisenheimers and it is this rich character development that makes a good american so difficult to put down from opera to jazz to barbershop quartets i felt that music was an incredibly important character in the book between the three generations music connected the meisenheimer family and story together i found the meisenheimer family's restaurant to be an important character as well and found parallels between the gradual metamorphosis of the restaurant and the family's integration into american society william henry harris and lomax are the only black characters in the book and both are received with poor treatment by just about everyone in beatrice outside of the meisenheimer family i was disappointed that there was no depiction of fairer treatment of blacks as the book's timeline edged closer to the 21st century i even speculated at one point that the plot was leading towards the meisenheimers becoming a multi racial family and the town's adjustment and eventual understanding along with the lomax plot i felt there were several other plots that went unresolved and were to me unsettling i don't doubt that this was george's intention the novel not intended to be a fantastic escape from reality but rather a work of literature that aptly depicts love loss lust and the gamut of dramatic emotions from grief to joy which includes not always having closure perhaps it is this that makes a good american truly successful and a good read","716":"quite the story it tells of a family over a period of more than 100 years i'll miss hearing about the meisenheimers","717":"really should be 3 1 2 stars i picked this book up at the library because i liked the title the story is interesting and it is a quick read","718":"after the first chapter i just had to read on to see what happeneded next we read it as a book club and it was enjoyed by all a little more graphic in some areas that i normally read although was done in good taste and didn't make me feel like i needed to go bathe in lysol i loved the characters and their development throughout the book loved how mr george threw in twists and turns now way could they have been anticipated imho made me proud to be an american","719":" this story spans three generations and is told by a grandson from the youngest generation we start in 1904 when frederick and the love of his life pregnant jette flee her mother's wrath and find themselves bound on a ship for new orleans instead of the originally planned new york they marry on board the ship then land and set out across the mid west the birth of their baby prevents them from venturing further as planned they are offered a place to stay from the kind local doctor and quickly find the town of beatrice is a good place inhabited by many germans to start their family frederick is offered a job as bartender at the town bar the knickknack to help when the longtime bartender passes out each night the customers enjoy frederick's style and music especially when he dusted off the piano and brought in the music of a black itenerant musician business prospered u0026amp frederick was finally able to buy the bar through his risky bets placed on his friend's fighting skills the meisenheimers have four sons all with some musical talent frederick the father had a wonderful operatic voice with which he wooed jette in germany and he passes his love of music and ability to adapt to the time to his four sons sing in barbershop quartet providing free music for the weddings and funerals of the town frederick feels he owes it to his new country to fight in the war wwi and leaves despite jette's pleading to stay with the family he is killed and she takes over the bar when prohibition comes and she can no longer serve liquor jette turns the bar into a restaurant with the help of lomax an itinerant black musician despite the racial complication lomax plays an important u0026amp comforting part in the family i disliked his horrible death which was treated casually considering how interwoven he was in their lives poof he was gone and little more was offered the last remainder of the book was unremarkable for me the characters are not developed well the strange flitch's margaret and the midget attorney rankin could have been a fascinating sub story but their unusual pairing was completely unexplained i was underwhelmed by the revelation near the conclusion of the book and am still scratching my head about its significance","720":"this is a sweeping epic that takes an american family from 1904 to the present very engaging i especially liked how these were ordinary people not characters conveniently at the site of every major historical event of the period","721":"i would call this a great american novel about a life of a family i can see why this is to be a readers choice at our library","722":" 4 5 5such a great story this book follows three generations of meisenheimers all the way from hanover germany to the town of beatrice mo being from missouri myself and having married into a family of several generations removed german immigrants made me love the book even more this book kept me laughing and reeling from heartache i loved the characters and of course the setting of rural middle america i also must mention that this book was written by a british attorney which totally blows my mind he did an amazing job of capturing the spirit and feel of my home state his afterword explained the parallels of his own experiences of being an immigrant which he vividly captured in this fantastic novel","723":"this humorous family epic about a german immigrant family to missouri reminded me of forrest gump with touchstones through america history","724":"i really enjoyed the first half of the book about frederick and jetta a young couple wanting to marry and the only way to be together was to immigrate to america then the second half of the book seemed to change focus and there were just too many unimportant characters and events to keep the book interesting it was almost like two books","725":"this book was good i guess i think it was difficult for the author to connect the stories of the narrator's grandparents with those of the narrator himself it got kind of weird as the story progressed towards the end but the plot twist was alright if not mostly expected","726":"enjoyed this book author is funny and taps into all your emotions","727":"this was an enjoyable book to read it tells the story of a young couple migrating to america and settling in a small town in missouri spanning time from the early 1900's to present day you are taken on the adventures both good and bad of the lives of three generations the story is told by one of the grandchildren james who makes a surprise discovery towards the end of the story i love how the author ends by providing an update of the families still living a relaxing easy to read book","728":" as a nation of immigrants the united states has millions of stories of arrival finding a way in a new country creating a new self some are bold some mundane some are tragic others joyous \"a good american\" starts off with two of these stories frederick and jette brought together by their love of music but forbidden to marry by jette's family elope from germany to the new world around the turn of the 20th century -- new orleans instead of new york because that's where the next boat was going \" what's the difference they're both new that's good enough\" jette tells frederick as they depart they make their way up the mississippi winding up in beatrice mo where frederick eventually buys a tavern and can once again be surrounded by music told from the point of view of frederick and jette's grandson james the novel spans three generations of the meisenheimer family frederick and jette their children joseph and rosa and joseph's four sons the family like any family has its trials and triumphs its small joys and aggravations -- and its secrets as well but the idea of being a good american runs through the family lending it an optimistic uncomplicated patriotism that is dampened and even lost at times but finds its way back music too runs through the story beginning with the old songs frederick sang to jette and the first notes of jazz he heard just off the boat in new orleans the author himself an immigrant captures the fresh look new arrivals take at the u s as well as the challenges and sadness of abandoning one's native home and trying to belong someplace new it makes the occasional sentimentality of \"a good american\" forgivable and george's lively writing and strong storytelling make the book an engrossing entertaining read","729":"multigenerational american saga the writing is decent but i felt that characters were lacking depth i've read titles with similar themes that i felt more connected to","730":"good reading about german immigrants to missouri","731":"the first third of this book promised a very interesting family immigrant story the middle third was predictable and the writing became amateurish the last third not any better the message of being a good american with all it's cliches was loud and clear i would give this a 2 1 2 but because some parts were promising and i kept reading it i upped it to 3","732":"this is just a beautiful well crafted book spanning generations of the same family the characters all weaves their way into my imagination and it will be difficult to let the meisenheimers go highly recommended","733":" i always like a good first sentence and george delivered a great one always there was music this was a well devised family saga beginning at the first part of the twentieth century with germans frederick and jette immigrating to the us to just past the next century following the life of their grandsons in particular the narrator james there was humor in how frederick and jette wind up in beatrice missouri of all places to make their fortune but it's also the townspeople over the years who become wonderful eccentric players in the story of the lives of the meisenheimer family","734":"an engrossing story of a young german couple who emigrate to america early in the 1900s ending up in missouri where they raise a family start a business and become good americans the story is told by their grandson james who leads the reader through tales of success and failure love and death prejudice and acceptance two world wars and some discoveries of his own","735":"loved the characters and the epic story i laughed and cried","736":"the book started out so funny but them went melancholy for a few chapters and then ended with some very funny twists alex has a wonderful way of writing at times he writes very complex while others he is so down to earth a very enjoyable book","737":"well what can i say about this book it is definitely my new favorite it deserves at least 10 stars and what is that guy alex george why is he not a celebrity he is a first class author no week moments not even one and by saying first class i mean classic like no kidding read that it is amazing","738":"june 11 to june 17 2012 reminded me of midlesex in scope great story loved it very sad though lots of people die","739":"you know you've read a good book when you turn the last page with tears in your eyes and realize it's 6 am i bought a good american from the miami airport while waiting for my flight i was attracted to the beautiful cover of the book the book travelled with me for quite a while but i just never found time to read it even though i'm a fan of historical fiction finally during the summer months i decided to grab the book and it caught my attention with the first page a good american is very well written beautiful story it made me laugh as well as cry definitely one of the best books i've read lately","740":"the early descriptions of new orleans in the 1890s are colorful and vivid","741":"seward's all read book for 2015 enjoyed the beginning of the book immensely but the second half turned me off enjoyed meeting and hearing alex george the author while he was at the seward memorial library so glad they brought him in","742":"easy enjoyable read follow the journey of a family's new life and all that follows them in a new land","743":"review copy courtesy of the publisher via goodreads first reads programi have a hard time figuring out where to begin in my review of this book i sped through this over the span of two days where i read giant chunks on my train commute i loved it but when i started thinking of how i would review the book i didn't know where to start i find it very hard to do this book justice without including some gigantic spoilers george tells the story of the american experience by following the lives of one family through the generations and like any good family saga there are moments of supreme joy heartbreaking tragedy and everything in between in 1894 a pregnant jette and frederick leave germany for america to escape her disapproving mother and settle in the small town of beatrice missouri there they set down roots the family's story is told by their grandson james four generations of meisenheimers revolve around a restaurant which changes over time symbolically with america and along with this restaurant is the music which intentionally or not is also a symbol of the united states a good american doesn't shy away from some of the darker sides of america george's characters have to deal with world war two and the soldiers who do not come home racism prohibition and the great depression to name a few there are also smaller closer to home tragedies that pepper the book but this is not a dark book nor is it a happy book it is a book that captures the heart of american history for the past century or so where there are good times and bad but we as a country keep moving forward","744":"i plowed through a lot of reviews before i decided my 3 stars was fair i can't stand to be a contrarian when so many of my friends loved a book and gave it 5 stars but the primary weakness in a good american at least to me is its predictable chapter structure that renders a predictable plot like someone else has already said the author chose a 1 set up scene 2 unfold scene predictably along set up 3 foreshadow what will happen in the next scene at the end of chapter structure that quite frankly made me want to scream this author repeatedly told me what was going to happen not by spelling it out but by using devices like and that's why we were so surprised devastated elated defeated by what happened next just let the thing unfold for crying out loud and yes some of the descriptions and sections were rhapsodic just gorgeous writing i swooned several times only to turn the page and have a sentence like so and so felt tired or it seemed like such and such might happen after all the times that i have heard show don't tell i can't believe the instances of this kind of writing that slipped through in a major work i absolutely loved the beginning of the book i adored jette and wanted to devour everything possible about her and the author just seemed to forget about her as the book unfolded i was so disappointed she was a force a real dynamo and it broke my heart to see her relegated to the shadows while the author paraded other less interesting characters across the page another thing that really threw me which may or may not be a problem is until the moment where the narrator revealed he was male i was picturing a female voice in my head men tend to be sparse with their words descriptions and i had it in my head that some of the symphonic prose could only come from the hand of a woman that is likely my limitation not the author's still i don't think i ever got back on track after i realized the narrator was male if you enjoy american history this book is quite a walk through every major event of the twentieth century i loved the way the author flavored the atmosphere with music it really helped ground me in the different eras in spite of what i consider to be a few major weaknesses parts of this book made for a really enjoyable read","745":"lots of unexpected twists i found myself laughing crying and astonished","746":" excellent book one third of the way through the book i had laughed and cried it is the saga of a german immigrant family beginning before wwi as told by an elderly grandson a young german couple lands in new orleans rather than new york and travels upriver to a small town in missouri there they start a business that evolves as the family grows and changes over four generations throughout the generations the love of music continues as they all become good americans the writing style is so good that i didn't gallop through the book i wanted to savor the language","747":"i enjoyed the premise presented of the american dream strived for attained and of course lost the all to real lives crossing so many generations that lead to and fro from the nick nack establishment the fulfilled altered and depending on the readers perception destroyed lives of each character in time i shall once again return to the journey in coming home to beatrice","748":"a good american by alex george is a sweeping family saga that spans three generations of the meisenheimer family the story starts out with the narrator's grandparents frederick and jette falling in love and then emigrating to the united states in 1904 this ship on which frederick is attempting to buy tickets to new york turns out to be sailing to new orleans upon hearing that this alternate destination is indeed in america jette urges him to take the tickets saying \"new york new orleans what's the difference they're both new that's good enough \"this exchange sets the tone for the book the young couple's lives are filled with humorous adventures that occasionally almost cross the line into absurd but somehow frederick's earnestness and goodwill makes them believable the young family as their first child is born shortly after their arrival in the new world ends up in the small town of beatrice missouri frederick finds work for himself and a home for them to live in even fixing it up himself despite the lack of skill described so well here he was not a natural handyman his only assets were a cast iron will and a newly acquired phlegmatic streak that saved him from being crushed by disappointment when his efforts failed the book is actually narrated by frederick and jette's grandson james and takes us through his grandparents' story to his parents' and then his own generation we watch as each family member faces the questions of what they will believe and where they belong and how they fit into the family story having just seen two grandmothers buried in the last month and getting ready to start a new phase of my own life i can't help but realize how much i am influenced by my past even as a i try to create the future that i want for myself and my son i highly recommend a good american as a fresh look at the importance of family and a sense of home in our lives as well as a great novel about the role of immigrants in our country and what truly makes someone a good american","749":" the story had a promising beginning two outsized young germans meet in a public garden at the turn of the 20th century he wins her heart by singing opera songs in foreign languages when she becomes pregnant they escape her disapproving mother on a boat bound for new orleans settling in a small missouri town with a predominantly german population but this story isn't just about the emigrant couple frederick and jette it's also about their two children four grandsons countless great grandchildren and a multitude of townsfolk and strangers that pass through their lives the narrator of the story is one of those four grandsons james the events that occur before his birth he describes in too much detail for his limited perspective there's no way that his relatives would or could have told him that much some of the events within his lifetime are beyond his realm of knowledge so we can only assume that he's supposed to be making them up i think it would have been more effective to either use a third person omniscient p o v or to let various characters tell their own stories the themes and plot became too diluted and convoluted along the way in the beginning music is a strong theme in the novel a source of inspiration and unifying force although the narrator claims that music is important in his life that really isn't shown instead literature and chess become just as important within james' lifetime too many characters dance in and out of the story introduced just to die it seems in one rather elaborate set up view spoiler a gentle giant victim of an overactive pituitary gland and a cuckolded dwarf have funerals on the same day hide spoiler seriously with many of the main actually important characters it felt like the author was trying to figure out what to do with them the results were mostly interesting but not always plausible for example view spoiler frank's fling with teddy's girlfriend which resulted in an actual shotgun wedding after she became pregnant was hilarious but not really believable hide spoiler the young minister view spoiler thinking that teddy was the second coming of christ hide spoiler was just flat out ridiculous and not something that the narrator could ever have known about also the foreshadowing one liners sprinkled through the novel got on my nerves after a while even with all of this the novel would still have earned three stars from me if the author hadn't felt the need to throw in the g d twist ending out of nowhere he smacks the reader with view spoiler a change of parentage for james hide spoiler i went back and reread the earlier parts of the book and i can't honestly believe that the author intended to put that twist in when he wrote the original events the only indication was one tacked on sentence view spoiler although it turned out that stefan did leave one thing behind hide spoiler seriously so i looked at some dates view spoiler lomax was killed in 1927 and rosa started teaching that same year stefan's father killed himself in 1932 and he begins working at the diner cora announced she was pregnant in 1935 and apparently stefan's jealousy is what leads him to seduce rosa that's me reading into it he takes off sometime in early 1936 a few months after freddy is born apparently not knowing that rosa was pregnant because she couldn't have been very far along how did rosa hide her pregnancy when she was teaching more importantly why the hell would she ever have gotten involved with the person who killed her beloved raccoon and wasn't even remorseful about it and why would stefan have participated in lomax's murder he would have been maybe 21 or 22 at the time so perhaps he was one of lomax's moonshine customers but we're given absolutely no connection or reason why he would have participated hide spoiler throwing that ending in just felt cheap and lazy to me and obviously it pissed me off so sorry mr george but two stars for you i do enjoy mr george's writing style which manages to be both descriptive and straight forward with very specific word choice i think he was overly ambitious with this first novel so perhaps his next one will have a more focused plot to match the language","750":"story of an immigrant family becoming american ending was a surprise and i thought made the book","751":"frankly how this book got published is beyond me no wait i know the author was able to weave in enough politically correct convenient historic revisionism it pleased the sensibilities of the publisher don't waste your time the author's a to b to c storytelling is so pedestrian you'll find yourself wishing for its end like i did","752":"i really loved this as an audiobook captivating story had a little mystery a little romance history comedy etc","753":"fascinating read very well written","754":"i enjoyed this book tremendously it felt like sort of a throwback a family saga set mostly in america over the 20th century what distinguished the book for me was the humor a lot of serious american issues and problems were dealt with but there was always a sense of humor about them i am not sure i would put this in the category of literary fiction the writing is not beautiful or high reaching but it is a delightful story well told","755":"this was an interesting story but it veered chaotically at times i think the author shows promise though and i look forward to him honing his craft","756":" contains spoilers the general consensus of my book club was that this book had amazing unrealized potential we all liked most of the characters but several could have been developed far beyond their light handling in the novel which would have allowed us to view their development in greater depth and detail jette for example she was the initial force behind the move to america and yet her character fades into the background rather quickly eclipsed by frederick's obsession with the nick nack we learn near the end of the book that she had strong political views but we missed out on all of the luscious development of this aspect of her character the strange flitch's margaret and the midget attorney rankin could have been a fascinating sub story but their unusual pairing was completely unexplained lomax his appearance was unexplained yet could have yielded a wonderful story his relationship with jette wasn't elaborated his side business came out of nowhere his horrible death seemed a mere speedbump to the family's lives considering how interwoven he was in their lives poof he was gone and little more was offered personally i didn't like that the narrator james provided so many details that he never could have known but perhaps that's just literary license i did like james however and i thought it interesting how he ended up solitary pretty much detached from the family also i didn't think that the supposed premise of the book i e the idea of a good american was developed very well it was mentioned early in the book but never referred to again unless i overlooked it i think this is another missed opportunity with the book well i've rather picked it apart haven't i and yet i am glad that i read it and enjoyed the characters but i will say that i believe that the author should rewrite the book perhaps after he has grown a bit as a writer and triple its length fleshing out all of the wonderful people that he has created to make them richly dimensional","757":"wonderfully written a story that takes you on the adventure of the excitement of hopes and dreams the sorrow and heartbreak of loss the love and wonderment of life as well as the pride courage and faith within journey through generations of a family each with a vast array of aspirations and hope and life lived the experiences and decisions of one shaping the future of the next generation assuring that no matter how spread out or how dramtically different life may be the future is always connected to the past great read","758":"soooooo good as i was reading this book the review was sooooo good but now that i have finished it i want to read it again immediately and for me that is an excellent sign i loved these characters and this town and i am grateful to have gotten to know them","759":"i thought this book was ok","760":"great book loved it way to the end","761":"a good book about family and struggles it slowed down a little for me in the second half of the book","762":"interesting immigrant to real american story a few twists well written","763":" this books is excellent it caught my attention with the first pages and except for 1 2 spots it didn't lose me i found myself laughing out loud and also crying i literally found it hard to put down alex george is a wonderful storyteller i loved following the family history from germany to beatrice missouri and all the in between times especially since both sides of my family immigrated to the us from germany also in fact frederick was the name of my grandfather there is even a surprise ending that i did see coming before it was mentioned this didn't ruin the book for me though","764":"the good i enjoyed the multi generational aspect of the story how it spanned like 100 years of time growing up with the characters and moving on the younger generation as the characters aged and ultimately died it is always amazing to think about our ancestors before us how their decisions shaped not only where and how we live but who we are i think that is the fundamental aspect of the story frederick the first character we meet on the journey aims to be a good american and he does so simply by moving to the united states and putting roots that branch and grow into a large american family tree what bugged me the author had this habit of ending a lot of his chapters with phrases like character xyz would break his heart he just didn't envision the way she would do it that is paraphrased from an actual statement in the book and those statements basically told you that the character was going to die so i went into each chapter anticipating the upcoming death with gloom and then at the same time i was annoyed that the author basically spoiled his own story if he hadn't included these teaser statements i feel like what happened would have been more impactful and shocking instead it just annoyed me that nothing that happened was actually surprising and speaking of death i felt like the number of characters who died in the story started to border on the absurd there was like 35 chapters in the book and about 1 death per chapter and not all of said deaths were of old age i realize it was a different time people died young in the olden days yadda yadda yadda i felt like half the characters never fully developed before they were killed off i half expected the protagonist to be writing his story from beyond the grave or something i don't know i guess that's the downside of a multi generational style story","765":"good beginning boring middle confusing end i get sucked in by immigrant stories this was nothing special","766":"loved this story of german immigrants and their next two generations amusing yet remarkably written like an artist painting on a canvas got a lot sillier towards the youngest generation in the 50s u0026amp 60s want to read anything else he may have written","767":"good immigration novel good characters history parts interesting","768":"an interesting story very believeable i enjoyed reading how one family started out as immigrants in america and following their descendants at times the story was really sad","769":"i loved this book a nice love story and a bit of american history","770":" when i began this book i thought i would give it a 2 star than in the middle a 3 star and finishing it a 4 star the ending was so satisfying one thought i don't understand is the tile of the book a good american the good american was frederick the father who with his wife jette immigrated to america the story is of that family the book has a cast of characters kinda reminds me of fannie flagg's books i especially liked rosa and uncle jim i enjoyed it and look forward to other by alex george","771":"a great story of an immigrant family told by the grandson about three generations of his family it didn't take any time to get into and jumped seamlessly through the years the author knew just what to write about and what to leave out great read","772":"i had no expectations of this book and only requested it because it is the story of the meisenheimer family my husband's family i was curious to see what it all about and if there were any family references that were familiar what i got was a wonderful surprise this book unfolded so quickly and beautifully and engaged me from the start this is a tale of the promise of america and the realities of life it is about the good and the bad and the extraordinary and the mundane it is wonderful and engaging and i was sad for the end because i was sad to say goodbye to the friends i made in the story it is a quick read and i highly recommend it i gave it 4 out of 5 stars because i didn't get one thing that i wanted out of it i can't say what that is without giving away part of the story i will be looking for this one in 2nd u0026amp charles this one will withstand the test of time","773":"i had my local library put this on hold for me because it was on amazon's list of the best books of february i love when the library emails to say my book is waiting for me how can something so enjoyable be absolutely free a good american was very very good in the beginning i loved the love story of the first couple who escaped to america and set up shop in missouri it was quite a page turner for me and i had a hard time turning off my lamp each evening to go to sleep the first half of the book i really liked the second half seemed to plod along for me though the storytelling sort of devolved into 'this happened then that happened then this happened and so on and so forth oh and i just remembered something else that happened ' this is the story of a family across a few generations and so it really is like someone sitting you down to tell you their family's history some of it you will find terrifically interesting some of it will cause you to have a hard time keeping your eyes open all in all a good solid book i'd read another book by this author","774":"stilted over wrought writing blech","775":"interesting story but the writing could have been better considering all the hype this book has gotten i was expecting more enjoyable easy read nonetheless with a nice little plot twist at the end but which is left only partially explained","776":"being an american immigrant and missourian i completely understood almost every character point of view whether it was james joseph or frederick it is a book that hits on every emotional level probably because it is about life it is very well written it's a love letter to the author's adopted state and small town living he making it very appealing which is hard for this city girl at heart","777":"from 1904 through the end of the twentieth century we see how major historic events affect the extended family that springs from jette and frederick the story is always moving ahead without spending much time in one place or time period there are a lot of characters many with quirks but the reader doesn't spend enough time with any of them to get to know about them and care for them","778":"i liked the characters in this book view spoiler even though most of them die hide spoiler i did not like the way it was told from the grandson's perspective whenever he would go into detail about the courtship of his grandparent's or other random events i couldn't help but think there's no way he would know what his grandmother was smelling as she walked through the park a different perspective would've been nice in order to transcend the generations better i also didn't like the last 1 4 of the book there was far too much wrapping up and making sure everything worked itself out perfectly view spoiler for instance stefan and rosa ending up being james' parents weird then james going to meet his brother and being given lomax's cornet if the author had wanted stefan to be involved in the murder of lomax he should've addressed it when it happened bringing it up again at the end of the novel was just opening up a whole new storyline without giving us any clues as to why or how it had affected stefan i just thought it was stupid to bring it up at the very end of the book the way it was hide spoiler all in all for a book about dozens of people spanning a time period of more than 100 years it kept me interested and was well written","779":" i may return to add a fifth star in a few days i'm five minutes removed and my heart is pounding you know i'm into a book when i'm reading during time outs in my son's basketball game and red lights and brushing teeth waiting for water to boil you get me i just finished a fairly intense historical drama surrounding an event so to read about a family and its changing dynamics was a welcome peek into a world not so unlike my own i don't know my family's immigration story or many intimate details of my ancestors but i know sibling rivalry i know about dashed dreams and close calls and i know about love and angst now thanks to alex george i know the meisenheimers at least his version of them and i'm happy to have met them i loved 3 4 of the book but perhaps knowing the end was near brought up my guard towards the narrator and his conclusion i want to read a good american again even though i usually read it and leave it","780":"the first third of this book the story of two brave german immigrants and their early years in missouri with a new orleans cook as their guide was great the writing is clear and direct music flows through the story tying together loose ends but after a seminal character dies i started to feel like the narrative went off the tracks with vignettes that seemed increasingly disjointed and unrealistic the final twist was out of left field and i'm not sure it did anything to make the book richer","781":"the history of the german immigrant meisenheimer as told through one of their descendants from their first landing in new orleans to their settling in a fictional missouri town their history is linked through music food and periods of american history i enjoyed this book for its unusual characters the jazz playing gumbo cooking friend the preacher who issued a challenge and wouldn't cut his hair etc the incorporation of these and other unusual characters u0026amp events made the story more believable to me surprising ending","782":"very nice i loved the twist on the secret i predicted but could have done with more details wrapped up nicely and sadly at the end felt a little melancholy for the narrator's fate but he was a good guy and loved how epic following 3 generations of the same family was","783":"i'd say this was 3 5 stars there was a lot of time crammed into a book of less than 400 pages but i liked it the characters were diverse and there were twists at the end that were quite unforeseen i enjoyed this book but i doubt it will linger in my mind for long","784":"probably 4 1 2 stars i enjoyed my time reading this tale","785":"loved this book","786":" frederick meisenheimer woos jette with his singing when jette discovers she is pregnant they flee germany in 1904 intending to go to new york the first ship leaving the wharf to the united states is heading to new orleans not knowing anything about the geography of the united states they take it following directions from someone they met on the boat they make their way to st louis and then west their son joseph decides to enter this world when they are passing through beatrice missouri when they are forced to rest there for several days they decide to stay the story of the immigrant family is told by their grandson james and spans the 20th century well paced and full of the love and heart break of small town america it is the story of us all","787":"this wonderful novel is an immigration tale an uplifting story and a lovely portrait of 20th century america through the lives of one family the meisenheimers it's not really a remarkable family but a representative one exquisitely described i found it the most skillfully written book i've read in years there is history u0026amp humor tragedy u0026amp triumph love u0026amp lost chances simply all the ingredients i count on to sweep me up and carry me to the final page fantastic","788":"3 5 stars this book has amazing potential i'm happy i read it it is not one of those books that after you read it you wish you wouldn't have wasted your time on it it took me a couple of weeks to read because i just never felt compelled to pick it up the story or the characters never brought that driving force to have to know what happens next in the last half of the book alex george does add in you're never going to guess what happens next kind of chapter endings but they are quickly summed up in the next chapter if you have a couple of minutes to read further i often got the names of the four brothers confused and kept getting their stories mixed up also it seemed that alex george got a little wild in the last half of the book with some crazy character scenarios i'm not saying i didn't enjoy them but they seemed to not fit in with the writing style in the beginning of the book all in all i think alex george has great potential as a writer i'll have to research if he has written anything more recently spoiler alert i loved the plot twist at the end and never saw it coming this style of this book reminds me of driftless and jewelweed by david rhodes but mr rhodes always gets a five star rating from me check him out","789":"this was a lovely story it was an enjoyable read i liked that it took place in missouri","790":"alex george tells a good american story","791":"i loved this book it is about a man and his pregnant girlfriend who travel from germany i think to the us during the early twentieth century it shows how this immigrant family ended up where they did then it follows the family through the generations it seemed historically accurate too it was just a very good and interesting read","792":"loved this book wonderful characters who i truly cared about and rooted for i was sorry it ended because i wanted to know more about additional generations of the family i picked it up used and was surprised that i could not put it down","793":"the title intrigued me my ancestors came from ireland through canada it did take me several chapters before i really got involved with the story the character jette bogged me down a little bit i liked the way the author included important historical event in the lives of his characters","794":"i normally enjoy family sagas and this one hooked me from the start however about half way i became less interested and actually started speed reading it until the last 50 pages good writing just got too bogged down for my taste","795":"this is a generational story that begins in the early 1900s and ends nearly 100 years later the story begins with two large lovebirds and it's narrated by their grandson he tells of wars ocean crossings births deaths dreams murder and music i loved the story dearly until the narrator comes to his own point in the story his life was disappointing to me but he suffers perhaps the greatest disappointment in the book so i suppose it's fair i'm sure it's easier to be honest with your own story than with an ancestor's and sometimes the truth is less grand mystical and far more depressingly normal than the handed down stories of a family","796":"i enjoyed this book lot's of events going on i liked the story","797":"the story of a family that immigrates from germany to a small town in missouri at the turn of the 20th century as the years go by each new generation discovers afresh what it means to be an american i really liked it at first and then an overly long and unnecessarily so detour about one of the main character's er masturbatory habits made me cringe and give it 3 stars instead of 4","798":" this is a hard one for me to pin down i started out absolutely loving the story of jette and frederick about halfway through the book it took a complete nose dive for me i seriously considered not finishing it because i didn't like spoiler reading about all the teenage boys' sexual encounters and i really couldn't tell where the story was going or what the point was however i kept reading and the ending of the book redeemed it somewhat i do think this is a talented author and the book made me consider my own american story i look forward to discussing it with our book club","799":" the first half of this book i found fascinating and i was really impressed how the german immigrant truly became a good american i love hearing stories about how family roots started in america with hopes and aspirations of dreams coming true the disappointing part of the book was that the grandson revealed that he was not such a great person this was suprising to me to find out half way thru the book when the first part had been so delightfully interesting i loved the journey thru history and the realities of what communities in missouri were like in the past one hundred years there was a nice surprise ending too that was unexpected but not so necessary","800":"enjoyable at times humorous other times sad it shows a love of country and people","801":"i was astonished by how much i loved this book it's a multi generational saga of a family that immigrates from germany in 1904 and winds up in rural missouri i only picked this book up because there's a discussion of it at an event i'm going to but i'm so glad i did the characters are all incredibly developed and there are a couple of pretty shocking plot twists in case you're worried about it being a humdrum country tale if your book club hasn't read this one yet put it on your list","802":"we've all done it while traveling we see a small village and wonder how did this town and its inhabitants come to be here alex george's novel a good american introduces readers to a set of quirky german immigrants who find themselves putting down serious roots in the small town of beatrice missouri in 1904 fredrick and jette meisenheimer flee germany and jette's parents' disapproval in 1904 when the young lovers discover that jette is soon to be an unwed mother intending to go to the famed new york they obtain passage on a ship to new orleans a good omen since both are new they assume on board they meet other germans who they plan to follow to a farming settlement on the mississippi river they get as far as the small town of beatrice where they are forced to stop due to jette's sudden labor what follows is the story of the meisenheimer family's attempts to become good americans over the next several generations george creates a cast of delightfully quirky characters that witness great historical events such as world wars prohibition and the assassination of president kennedy this is not a literary saga instead it is more like sitting at a kitchen table listening to some great family stories a good american is at its core a novel about family and home it is quite simply an enchanting novel that will have readers laughing crying and identifying with several generations of the meisenheimer family","803":"i loved it from the first page on i thought about it when i wasn't reading it loved the story","804":"one of the reviews on the book jacket said that this was one of those rare books that when you're finished you want to go back and start it all over again so very true i was completely surprised by a twist in the final chapters that i want to re read with another perspective beautifully written","805":"good read loved seeing all the generations and how they make up a family","806":"this book was a nice summer read nothing amazing it was entertaining enough to keep me turning the pages the book follows an immigrant family's beginnings in america through the grandchildren's lives and briefly great grandchildren i liked a lot of the characters but some of the characters i gravitated toward did not receive enough spotlight i had been reading a lot of fantasy so this book was a nice break to read about real people in our nation","807":"my favorite line from this book that sums it up we are all immigrants a glorious confection of races and beliefs united by this rock that we live on as the grandchild of german immigrants i enjoyed this story and always have a tendency to like books that tell the stories of family history however 4 stars maybe be a little high for this book but there isn't a way to show 3 5 stars i would give the first third of this book 4 stars the second third 3 stars and the last 2 stars at the end of the book it's unnecessary to give us updates on a 4th generation which was never previously mentioned to quote another reviewer i don't care who was married to who or what careers they chose it read like a really bad family christmas card with that said there were some great character frederick jette lomax joseph and rosa i loved their stories even with all of the heartbreak and tragedy but as a descendent of german immigrants i can tell our own families' heartbreaks i struggled with the main character james i kept waiting for his story to pick up and it never did he never appeared really happy and seemed to settle in every aspect of his life where others found beauty james seemed to only find beauty through other people's lives i would recommend this book though but with the comment if you don't enjoy family history this might not be the book for you","808":"the story of jette and frederick as they move from germany to america to start their new lives is an endearing one and full of hope they are people you can truly root for a good american is a thoroughly enjoyable read","809":" i started this book because it was the book club selection i finished it because i wanted to all of us have a new to america ancestor somewhere in the family this book explores the adjustment of an immigrant family to their new country and to a new and changing culture even families who have been in one place for generations still have to change as the culture changes i hadn't quite looked at it before but i can see major culture changes that have taken place just in my own lifetime we are a very different country now than we were in the '50s or the 60's this book has accomplished 2 goals of good writing entertaining the reader and making him think","810":" a good american is a wonderful account of the immigrant experience to the united states from germany in 1904 the lives of frederick and jette change dramatically when they decide to immigrate to the united states to escape controlling parents alex george does an excellent job of describing the trials and tribulations of frederick and jette and the generations that have come since george has researched his novel well by incorporating historical events throughout the generations of frederick and jette's family it is an enthralling account of life of a people but a nation as well this very satisfying read will stay with the reader for a long time","811":"this is a quiet story although lots happens it is not a knock you over your head novel there is shape to it the characters and setting are well drawn there was no get on with it fella no i can't believe that the reveals of who dunnit are sly and genuinely surprising a perfect book to curl up with on the sofa or front porch","812":"i just put the book down for a few minutes and thought to myself what an honor it is to be reading such a great piece of literature if nothing else borrow this book and read the author's notes at the end it will make you proud to be an america or even to migrate here as the author did","813":"this is a very sweet story of a 4 generational german immigrant family it is told from a male perspective which i found interesting","814":"this is one of those books i considered giving up after about 75 pages in retrospect i should have but i plowed on there was entirely too much unnecessary sex in the second half clever plot twist but in the end i wish i had those hours back","815":"hated to see this story end wonderful story wonderful characters","816":"i loved this book","817":"loved this family story spanning almost 100 years it's beautifully written creating images of the setting that are beautiful character development creates depth and enhances the believability of the novelistic historic fiction passed this book onto a good friend worthy of sharing","818":"i didn't care for this book at all it was like reading a very long obituary a report of sorts with flat prose and contrived characters i'm not even going to describe it except to say it covered a long period of time from a couple's journey to america from germany around the turn of the previous century and what happened to their family over the years i say don't bother","819":"wait for it wait for it 5 stars perfect novel hated for it to end it was everything my idea of a perfect novel should be literary lyrical poignant u0026amp laugh out loud funny at times don't miss this one","820":"great intro hooked me and wouldn't let go the rest of the book is not as well written as the first two pages but it's worth the read","821":"it was an ok yarn but books that span a century and incorporate a million different characters never quite hit the spot for me just as you get familiar with a character and start to develop some depth you jump to the next generation and then start again it was interesting and there were some unexpected plot twists but it wasn't fantastic","822":"this lush epic tale of one family's journey from immigrant to good americans had me alternately laughing and crying but always riveted it's a rich rare treat of a book","823":"it was just o k got off to a great start but as the book progressed all of these great characters kept dying they could have been developed and made the book much more enjoyable","824":"beautiful transgenerational story telling one of my new favorites","825":" so much was missing from this book too many generations one couple and their children may have been enough i would have liked more details about jett and frederick more about their romance and her heartbreak about her parents especially after the packet the of her letters are sent back how she developed that relationship with her one neighbor friend and george wrote poorly of the natprrator's origins more could have told after an illicit affair i only saw one clue her stirrings when seeing stefan that's it juicider stories were related so a juicy deflowering would have been entertaining and made the letter packette more titillating the narrative didn't need to change for an addition of the deflowering the welcoming of the narrator into storyline was just right i will not seek out other novels by alex george","826":" i absolutely loved this book i'm so excited that it just came out so i can recommend it to customers at the bookstore this story grabs you from the very first page and you stay extremely tied to it until the very last i haven't even been able to start a new book because i miss the characters so much you follow this family through multiple generations and through an entire century you get to see the hardships of immigrants who first came to america and you get to see the decades and time periods unfold throughout the story as they pass before i even finished it i thought this book fulfilled everything i wanted in a story then i got to the twist at the end and it only made it better you'll never guess what happens but you'll have the urge to reread the story all over again after you read the ending i absolutely adored this book the story the characters the way it showed america throughout the different time periods everything a must read","827":"thank you goodreads first reads for my free advanced readers copy of a good american alex george is a writer to watch he writes his stories lovingly and with great care and diligence to his characters the perfect read for anyone who enjoys long family sagas where the reader truly gets the opportunity to know and love the characters a good american spans four generations beginning in hanover in 1904 frederick and jette fall in love unfortunately they belong to different classes and jette's family does not approve when jette becomes pregnant and they can no longer hide their relationship they decide to flee to america and end up in missouri frederick loves america he truly believes in what the country stands for and commits himself to being a good american for 381 pages the reader gets to follow frederick as he and jette create a new life for themselves and start a family they take over a business and live the american dream until world war i upsets the wonderful lives they have made for themselves throughout the story we meet frederick and jette's children then grand children and finally great grandchildren as readers we get to spend over 100 years with the meisenheimer family from 1904 to 2008 and what a special adventure it has been","828":" i enjoyed the book but it was not as dramatic as i had expected it's not adventure it's not drama it's not really historical although it covers the 1900s there is some comedy and there is some tragedy it is just a simple story about a german couple who immigrated to america in the early 1900s the author himself is an immigrant who came here recently from england noting that we are all immigrants or descendants of immigrants he decided to write a book about immigration the story is told from the perspective of the grandson of the immigrants he tells their family story as you can imagine it covered a lot of historical times but i felt that the author brushed over most of those histories but then the story is strictly about how things affected his family not the nation i thought that some of the situations were a bit far fetched but after i finished the book i thought about the kennedy family if one were to write about all the kennedys from joe kennedy to the present there would be many stories of tragedy of comedy of weirdness so given that maybe it was not so far fetched after all since my grandparents came here from italy in the early 1900s i found the story interesting to the point that i could associate it with my own family they immigrants in the story ended up in a town which was mostly german my grandparents ended up in a town that was mostly italians it is just a simple story that follows three generations of an immigrant family","829":"3 5 slow start but increasingly captivating packed an awful lot in and tied to many historical events but has a lot of heart","830":"lots of great discussion in book club about the events in this book and what it means to be a good american","831":" 3 5 stars 1 i was surprised to find out the author was male after reading for a bit 2 i appreciated his beautiful writing and descriptions of the music ex the twins may have hogged the melodies but my own notes fattened those tunes into glistening slabs of sweet harmony 3 the novel was going along just fine and then 75% of the way through it's as if the author realized wait a minute this is my own book i can write whatever i want i can make the characters do anything i want and he started creating these situations that were a lot more outlandish 4 i liked the simple way they lived in the early 1900's no car few choices for housing and food they walked to and from work and anywhere else and stayed in one little town without ever exploring nearby states for the most part 5 i liked how he summed up a marriage that was forced arranged and didn't start out with any love still they seemed happy enough frank and darla muddled through their marriage just fine better in fact than many couples who had chosen each other by more orthodox means when they had exchanged vows they were strangers with no hope or expectations of the other and this had equipped them well for married life they were immune to the quiet creep of disappointment that can sour more optimistic unions there was no heady first blush of romance to be mourned as the years passed from that joyless ceremony in the empty church there was nowhere for them to go but up kinda makes a case for arranged marriages","832":"i just finished the last page of a good american and i want to open it right back up and start reading all over again the meisenheimer family had me captivated from the first page to the last a wonderful story that could be the true story of so many american families a truly wonderful and captivating book and anyone who wants to get lost in a story should read","833":" this novel is a sweeping generational tale that embodies the ideals that created america and the american dream it begins with a love story as most great life adventures do and evolves into a series of love stories with family with strangers with friends with america there are so many great moments in this book captured brilliantly enough to be visible to the reader and something to be held dear like their own personal memories especially relatable for someone like me a great grandchild of german immigrants who settled in schleswig ia this story will appeal to those whose families have been here for ages and those whose stories are just beginning in america throughout it all the reader will experience hope pain love faith and the twists of destiny that intertwine all americans perhaps the only downfall was that the book didn't stop when it should have but continued to meander for the last few pages while it is nice to tie up all loose ends i think this book would have had a more dramatic impact by stopping on p 368 with the first six sentences however i was reading an arc so perhaps this has already been done by the time you are reading it in that case please disregard this note as i'd hate to tarnish such a great book regardless i couldn't put this novel down and the stories will stick with me and i continue upon my family's american journey","834":"a good americanbyalex georgewhat it's all about jette and frederick meet in germany their love is denied by jette's

meticulous in allowing us to know these characters i never forgot names even as my list of names grew and grew it is a lovely book more","835":"a good fun book but nothing too ground breaking","836":"loved it loved it loved it centering around a family and its tavern then restaurant then diner it captures the immigrants and americana throughout generations that make it great to be an american fantastic historical fiction that is not too weighty for those of us who ultimately read for pleasure but don't mind learning a thing or two about history in the process","837":"interesting story about generations of a family who started out as immigrants to america you really get attached to these characters","838":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the first part of this book immediately captured my interest and like the majority of readers i started to fall in love with the characters and the story i cared about these people like they were my own family and wanted them to find success and happiness in america reading this also encouraged me to start fantasizing about the human aspect of my own ancestors immigrant experience and i was excited to recommend this book to friends as a good summer read here was a book with easy readability the first part of this book immediately captured my interest and like the majority of readers i started to fall in love with the characters and the story i cared about these people like they were my own family and wanted them to find success and happiness in america reading this also encouraged me to start fantasizing about the human aspect of my own ancestors immigrant experience and i was excited to recommend this book to friends as a good summer read here was a book with easy readability that wasn't completely dumb and then after the fourth or fifth sixth seventh character death it started to lose me some of these deaths added to the story but most of them were emotionally manipulative or else just plain ludicrous even though the book spans nearly a century it was just too much after a certain point it felt like the rest of the plot functioned only to move the story from one death to the next i was also able to predict which characters would be the next to die because shortly after becoming a primary focal point in the story the character would be sent into the great beyond now without further ado the following list contains all the deaths that occurred in this book all considered spoilers they may or may not be in order because there were so many that after awhile they became a bit muddled in my brain 1 the narrator's grandfather enlists in wwi to prove his patriotism to his new country and is killed by sniper fire this death made me cry--i loved frederick 2 the lovable town drunk drowns in the river 3 the narrator's grandmother's best friend dies of influenza 4 the narrator's father's bad best friend shoots the kid sister's pet raccoon 5 the narrator's grandfather's best friend sets fire to his barn and hangs himself after his family's farm is foreclosed on by the bank during the depression 6 the black \"sidekick\" is viciously mutilated and lynched by a group of white townsmen 7 the narrator's mother bleeds to death after delivering his twin brothers 8 the chicken strangling piano teacher dies of old age 9 the narrator's best friend falls into the river while masturbating into the river and drowns 10 the narrator's matriarchal grandfather dies from old age 11 the town doctor dies from old age 12 the narrator's brother's best friend dies from complications arising from an overactive pituitary gland 13 the town \"dwarf\" commits suicide after he finds out that his wife has developed a taste for normally proportioned peen and has been porking teenage boys in the choir room at school 14 the narrator's grandmother dies of old age 15 the narrator's aunt dies of old age 16 the bad friend who shot the raccoon dies of old age 17 the narrator's brother's boss dies of old age 18 the narrator's sister in law dies of breast cancer 19 the narrator's step mother dies of old age 20 the narrator's father dies of old age the first half was 4 stars the second half was 2 it became too predictable even the adoption so i'll go with 3 more","839":"the beginning was great a young couple leaving for america for they thought new york but when they got to the ship they find out that the boat is going to new orleans not new york oh well as long as it was new something it had to be ok so off they go lots is good about the book ... the music themes the restaurant business that changes through the years the family life and the people they meet when they first arrive","840":"this is one of those sprawling multi generational books that when done well suck you in to each thoughtful chapter as it slowly unfurls the tales of the family this one centered around the meisenheimers jette who is courted by frederick when jette's mother has already picked out someone for her to further ensure family wealth prestige etc she is wooed by his singing and the two flee europe to start new in america jette is pregnant as they travel and when she has the baby they stop mid trip in missouri and decide to settle there the marriage isn't perfect of course frederick is distracted by other things trying to make money and then enlists in the military and as the two write each other to rekindle their marriage he gets shot and dies jette has to figure out how to support her now growing family she has 4 children and running a restaurant where she cooks is just the thing until it's not more characters are introduced and through the eyes of the second son we find out about the trials and errors of each of the children i can't explain it it's just so much yet it doesn't seem that way as you read it the story is entertaining and realistic and lighthearted with some farcical events i was sad for the book to end the book takes place over about a hundred years","841":"i liked it a lot at first though somewhat less as the book went on the grandparents and parents generation were more interesting than the narrator for me","842":"george's debut novel is amazing a compulsively readable epic spanning several generations of an immigrant american family a good american should appeal to all americans and i look forward to seeing more from this author","843":"it was ok that's all","844":"i was hooked right after chapter 2 i'm always a sucker for a coming to america multi generational story line i liked how it was set in missouri and how world and national events impacted the people in the small town the characters were such that i found myself thinking of them even when i wasn't reading a definite sign of a great read","845":"this i guess would be classified as historical fiction and was captivating it chronicals the lives of a family beginning with the experience of two german immigrants arriving in new orleans around 1903 it was really a masterful account and so believable i found myself on google maps trying to locate the small town in missouri where most of the story takes place multiple generations are portrayed through their times of joy and tragedy in a gentle telling of life in small town midwest as the nation comes of age","846":"i really enjoyed this historical novel it is from a time when most books portray the immigrant in new york so a great new perspective here","847":"the best book i've read in the last year alex george gave it his all and i hope he writes another someday","848":"once again i wish i noted where i got this rec from the basic outline of this story i enjoyed but it read like a slightly better than average real life account it could have come out of a nonfiction book at times there were entirely too many characters in this book and i frequently had to stop and try and figure out who the heck they were talking about i didn't love this one in fact i skipped quite a bit here and there just anxious to get to the end","849":"first 1 3 of the book 4 stars last 1 3 2 so an average seemed appropriate characters got thinner and less genuine as the story progressed and plot elements more contrived in my humble opinion","850":" this story began in a beautiful way with a young couple seeking a new life in the united states in the early 1900's they came by way of new orleans and made their way on up the river to missouri settling in the fictional town of beatrice here they ran a business raised their children faced world war i and all the day to day occurances that happen to all of us frederick was determined to be a good american in every way he had won his love through musdic and wanted his children to also learn to love music and to perform with their voices for the first two thirds or so of the book the story was good believable and enjoyable then it appeared that the author decided to take a turn at writing by way of say garrison keillor he developed a thread where almost all the boys in town had a one time fling with the music teacher at her request he then contrived to make the minister of the christian church believe that he saw the 2nd coming of christ due to seeing one of the boys on the river with his hands spread out as he stood on a pier but with no other changes happening in the town or to anyone else most christians realize that the 2nd coming will certainly cause a multitude of events to happen rather quickly these last threads seem to denegrate the book for me what had been a good family saga with their struggles through life and history became a comical farce disappointing","851":" arc giveaway u0026amp book review this is another book cover that intrigued me my family is very musical which is probably one of the reasons i was drawn to it i really knew nothing else about a good american by alex george when i received an advance readers' copy from the publisher as i read the inside cover blurb i realized i had other connections to this novel's subject matter through my ex husband's family that made this a much more personal read for me in a good american alex george writes about an immigrant family's journey to america and their quest to become and to continue to be the epitome of good americans we're all immigrants in this country unless we're native americans so this story is our story no matter where our families originated i'm really glad to be able to host a giveaway for an advance readers' copy arc of a good american read the rest of my review and enter to win at http popcornreads com p 2802","852":"heard it on audio very good","853":"couldn't put this down lovely read through the generations of one family","854":"i can't tell you how much i loved this book but here's my review where i try to explain it http bookaliciousbabe blogspot com","855":"full of cliches and boring story lines predictable and not worth finishing","856":"what an engrossing story of a family over the years so many good characters so many tears shed","857":"recommended by haleycheck our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","858":"loved this book","859":"a well crafted multi generational story of german immigrants and their coming to america many interesting characters historical events and coincidences from now on her relationship with her son would be defined by her inability to save him form his own mistakes amen","860":"the first 2 3 of the book were worthy of four stars the grandson james story could have done without a few chapters","861":"i liked the beginning part with the immigration story and how our lives can be altered very quickly and sometimes by chance the last quarter of the book seemed to just peter out for me as i didn't like the characters or story of the third generation","862":"multigenerational story of the descendants of an immigrant from germany","863":"the story of an immigrant family as they travel from germany to america their adjustment to american life and the children they raise it is a multigenerational story of the american dream and everyday life that comes in their way i like this book because the author tells the story through james the third generation american living in beatrice missouri","864":"i loved this book so much three days later i still miss the characters","865":"i read this for book club and generally enjoyed it i don't think it's the type of book i would normally read or chose for myself but i'm happy another reader picked it for our group very well written sometimes a little too much so there was a fair amount of $10 words interesting story overall","866":"meh first half was fascinating but second half seemed very whiney i just wanted something good to happen so badly even in the end it seemed like it was still so gloomy","867":"a family saga it felt more like a lark than a true piece of historical fiction all in all it was good at times it felt chatty while at others more in the voice of the main character it needed an editor with a more in tune with midwestern expressions i am not aware of missourians calling their bar or liquor cabinet a drinks cabinet these small complaints in no way take away from the splendor of the tale","868":"i enjoyed this multi generational story after reading several books where i saw the next development coming from a mile away it was nice to actually be surprised by the twist ending would have loved it if it weren't for the forrest gump style gimmicky historical and contemporary references that i felt littered the beginning and end respectively they only distract from the heart of the family's story","869":"really liked this funny articulate good story i thought at first that the language was occasionally over the top but later decided i didn't mind it wasn't too much and it seemed to fit somehow","870":" i picked up this book on the recommendation of several other readers on goodreads at first i didn't think it was the right choice for me but as i read deeper into the story i enjoyed it more and more it's a slow start in some ways but the characters grow and their lives develop the last half is better than the first but the whole thing is a wonderful story of what it means to come to america and make a life to invest in this country and in one's family the narrator becomes especially interesting as the story reaches its conclusion in the beginning the author's writing is quiet and solid but hardly exciting but that changes as the story moves closer to the present the narrator's voice becomes more distinctive and at times i was completely taken over by the beauty and acuity of expression an author's note at the end tells the author's story as well as the genesis of parts of the book and this adds another very interesting dimension to the story","871":"alex george you sure can draw a reader in when i first started reading about jette and frederick i thought ok another immigrant comes to america story it was light reading and i figured i'd quickly finish the book and move on well that lasted until chapter 5 when it turns out the english lessons that frederick paid for were actually polish lessons and the words he was shouting on the street in new orleans to try and get directions for he and jette from somebody anybody why was no one at all coming forth to help he and his very pregnant wife were things like i like big mustaches my wife is a witch i had to laugh and as i read on i grew to love the story and the characters this is the entirely believable story of 3 generations and how twists of fate can shape your life it's really funny in places sad in others and all in all a truly great story i would highly recommend this book","872":" a good american is a multi generational story about a family of russian emigrants who plant their roots deep in american soil the novel spans from 1904 2003 almost a full century and the author alex george takes us expertly through it not missing a single historical event of the time period this may be fiction but its theme - that of settling down in a foreign land and creating for yourself a true home - is very real to the author his wife emigrated from new zealand to america and he recently made a similar move from england he continues to make a home here while never forgetting his birthplace similarly his characters look toward an enterprising future even while paying homage to the past this novel is so easy to get lost in you could very well read 100 pages and then look up having no idea you'd been reading for that long the writing is smooth and fluid with a calming transporting effect reading this is like sitting by the fire on a cold winter's night - there will be nowhere else you'll want to be content to sit with james the narrator as he tells the story of his family--first his grandparents then his parents and then him and his siblings all of the people in this book live full colorful lives and you'll be glad to have met each one of them a good american is elegiac - interesting and compelling in its own right but held up by george's strong writing and james' welcoming voice what a pleasant enjoyable read ~kelly massrywww readlately com","873":"the narrator is speaking from the future recounting the history of his family that by itself is fine but the author just loves ending chapters with cliffhangers like in two days that all changed they happen a lot and they're almost always sad numerous vague hints that this small moment of happiness won't last or this one or this other one either basically life is just one long journey from hardship to hardship and then you die i don't agree with that and i also don't enjoy reading books that leave me depressed i enjoyed frederick and jette's story of carving what they wanted out of almost nothing but once the focus shifted from them to later generations it felt like the book was one big downer","874":" a really really good book the story of a family that immigrated from germany told through a grandson nicely written easy to fall in love with the full complex characters the author has a lovely way with foreshadowing that makes it very hard to put down a story at the end of a chapter a quote that i must write because it is the reason for the story we are all immigrants a glorious confection of races and beliefs united by the rock that we live on as the years wash over us and new generations march into the future family histories are subsumed into this greater narrative we become simply americans now that i have taken that quote out of context it sounds a little preachy but the book isn't like that all the way through it is a story of becoming an american and all that that means and having that continue on even when we've forgotten that we all started basically as immigrants i would still love to have a box on those annoying forms that simply says american","875":"unlike the missouri river rolling slowly past beatrice missouri alex george's story of the lives of its residents has zero depth it's almost as if george attended a writing seminar where the instructor told him to be sure to include scenes a b c and d in his work and he did over and over and over and over again characters are hastily introduced in one chapter only to be killed off one or two later we're supposed to believe their death affects the whole town even though they existed on the page for only a paragraph others overcome adversity after the briefest of struggles mostly because of the sort of predictable coincidences that even charles dickens would hesitate to use even the comic relief feels formulaic by the time the as another reviewer put it magical negro showed up i was ready to toss a good american aside but i stuck with it amazed that one book with so many characters and so much action over such a long period of time could be so damn shallow what am i saying it's perfect for hollywood someone get julia roberts on the horn","876":"what a fabulous book this would be a 5 star read if it hadn't been for a few parts in the middle that i didn't enjoy as much overall i loved it and highly recommend it it's simply a great story of generations of a family that migrated from germany to america there is romance triumphs and tragedy and all very well written","877":"loved this story the generational story of the meisenheimer family who live in beatrice mo they have a diner sing together and have a love of chess best story i've read in a long time","878":"this book seemed to leave me wanting something more until about half way through when the boys reached puberty from there on the story was so funny the author has a way of mixing comedy and tragedy in such a way that you are aware of the tragedy but with a smile on your face i can't say that this book would make it to my favorites list but it was a good read and worth your time","879":"a thoroughly enjoyable book","880":"good read lots of surprises","881":" what a great family saga from frederick and jette traveling from hanover germany to america missouri where they began their life with frederick bartending and jette cooking german meals frederick was an excellent singer operatic and regaled his customers with his music as well as hiring other artists such as rag time pianists and singers coming through town his son joseph was an excellent singer but developed stage fright and couldn't sing in front of an audience the story takes us through joseph's marriage to cora and the 4 boys they raised joseph took over frederick's diner and wanted his oldest son to work alongside him after graduation but he chose the seminary instead as the book begins to wind down it becomes more humorous and the antics of all of the boys are funny and bring them to choices and places in their lives they never imagined for themselves there are secrets between the boys aunt rosa and father gresham that determine the fate of all involved i loved the ride","882":"the story of one family's journey from immigrants in the 1800's through three generations of descendants' heartbreaks and triumphs we are all immigrants a glorious confection of races and beliefs united by the rock that we live on","883":"strong start convoluted finish","884":"this is a delightful book full of twists and turns in the lives of immigrants to the us the players in the story all have human frailties but still manage to construct meaningful and interesting lives a lovely story written with keen observation of the lives of the characters the ending is particularly good with surprises that are refreshingly unexpected thank you alex george for a lovely story","885":" i enjoyed reading a good american even though my first impression was not great my early thoughts were these only a few chapters in and i can see i am going to have some difficulty staying with it the writing style is easy to read and the characters interesting but little things keep distracting me from the experience from the story for example jette and frederick traveled 70 miles to bremen by carriage in 1903 they left early in the morning and arrived in the late afternoon i assumed it was a horse drawn carriage because automobiles were not common until after the creation of the model t in 1908 a horse drawn carriage will not go 70 miles in a single day it can be expected to average about 4 miles an hour and a driver isn't going to push them for 18 hours normally if they were making superhuman efforts or had a change of horses somewhere the author should have said so so i was distracted by what struck me as too unrealistic and i was distracted then thinking about how fast they were traveling and the details of the ride does the author just not know the speed of a carriage traveling at this point i begin thinking about the air speed of an unladen swallow and whether it is an african or european swallow and how it is going to grip a coconut not where the author wants my mind to be i presume but it improved as we went along mostly i think because there were fewer esoteric details to stumble over i do not agree with many of the other criticisms i have read the magical negro element to the story is no more contrived than any other part of the story i think it's reasonable for a story to have unlikely coincidences because they are only unlikely not ridiculous the author keeps the story moving along doesn't leave any loose ends and brings out the drama in the usually mundane i found myself caring about these characters it was an enjoyable read and i have forgiven this british lawyer transplant to the midwest from specific errors beyond his knowledge and experience","886":"a multi generational story that even includes barber shopping","887":" covering six decades in less than four hundred pages is no mean feat and it does mean that character development is sometimes neglected in favour of plot as the storyline continues ever onwards apace nonetheless a good american is a very engaging book the covering of such an expanse of time in a modestly sized novel means that there are constant twists and turns to keep you interested i ended up reading whilst walking from the tram a few times so eager was i to find out what happened next and therefore so unwilling was i to put the book down don't let the emphasis on plot mislead you however a good american packs a powerful emotional punch and with a story encompassing several generations of the same family the over arching narrative as opposed to any particular character's journey is the point frederick and jette's journey to america becomes a journey through time and a journey continued by their children their children's children and so on this passage of time and the love and lives contained within it becomes the focus of the novel the last 60 pages or so bumped this up from a steady 3 5 stars to a 4 for me really adding an extra layer and change of pace which had previously been missing","888":" this is one of those novels that sticks in your head for a long time after you read it it's definitely one of the best books i have ever read and i have read a whole helluva lot of books if i could inject books directly into my eyeballs i totally would that's how big of a bookworm i am a good american is very high up on my top ten list it's practically art this book the whole story is told by jette and frederick's grandson but the fact that there's only one pov doesn't mean that it's slow or that you don't get to know the characters on a deeper level the story is both happy and sad i both cried and laughed out loud while i was reading then i quickly looked around to see if anyone were giving me funny stares i was happy to get through it without being spotted by the men with the butterfly nets","889":"so far one of the best books i've read in a long time","890":"good story","891":" i liked this book but never did i get to a point in the book where i felt that i had to keep reading every time i sat down to read it i enjoyed it but it never captured me enough to make me keep reading everything is described in such great detail but when the climax came for james the narrator it was told so quickly that i had to go back and reread it came out of nowhere the next few pages felt like i had jumped into a different book the writing style context and pacing were completely different than the other 380 pages i had already read and again the last twenty pages went very quickly compared to the rest of the novel's pacing i felt like someone said it's time to end this and so the ending had to be told quickly that all being said i did like the story line and i loved the vocabulary","892":"well written lots of great characters multi generational sadness and silliness and just a good solid read i enjoyed this one very much i would recommend it","893":"i love a well told story and that is this book alex george an englishman now living in the usa was able to capture a piece of america and an immigrant story in a wonderful way he tells the story of germans frederick and jette and then that of their descendants i love that it wasn't the usual arrive in new york story it's of small town life adjustments and growing becoming an american he brings in the history of that time the good and the bad i recommend this book","894":"follows 4 generations of 1 family as they immigrate to america music and food service are themes throughout","895":"i stopped reading about halfway through there was no emotional content to this book just a string of occurrences i didn't care about any of the characters it read like a bad family narrative actually written by someone's relative","896":"originally published at reading realitya good american by alex george is one of the quintessential utterly and wondously american stories it's the schmaltzy neil diamond classic coming to america played loud and proud in fred's diner in alex george's midwestern american town of beatrice missouri a good american is the story of one family the meisenheimers from hanover germany who come to the u s in 1904 and yet the cadence of the story is every family's story and that's what drew me in james meisenheimer is telling the story of his grandparents not just how they came to america but why the hopes and dreams they came with and the dreams they left behind the dramas and the heartbreaks that faced the first generation who came to america in search of a better life for themselves or at least for their children and how well that worked or how much they had to give up when it didn't how their compromises affected the next generation and the next those good americans they gave birth to in this new country that they found themselves in we like to say that america is a nation of immigrants all of us have stories like these behind us for some of us those stories are close james story felt like not just the story of his family or the story of america it didn't feel distant or fictional or historic it felt like my history and my history because in a way it is escape rating a part of my fascination with a good american was that i could hear my own voice telling some of these stories not the exact same ones but the same type of stories like the fictional james all four of my grandparents were european immigrants and they all came to the u s in the early 1900s unlike james my family did not come for romance they came to the u s for much more prosaic reasons but reading this story brought back memories of my grandparents and their lives and family secrets that weren't revealed until i was an adult one almost as surprising as the one james discovers in the book sometimes it seems as if families are made up of their most colorful individuals and the secrets in the dark history on the other hand is made up of all of us living our lives and all of our families contributing their bits to the tapestry we don't know what pieces the ones who come after us will find interesting or amusing we all have our parts to sing","897":" i wasn't sure at first whether i would finish this book or not it's not the kind of book that grabs you from the first sentence but after a few chapters you find yourself hooked it's a very gentle story in a way that treats of the mundane rather than the extraordinary george weaves his story and his characters so closely that one shortly becomes immersed but the events that shape their lives are entirely plausible even in the strange twist in the plot near the end of the book and you shortly become a cheerleader for the various members of the three generations whose activities form the thread of the story if you enjoyed jaber crow by wendell berry don't miss this one","898":"like some other readers i enjoyed the first part of this book but found the second part tedious and the denouement unconvincing too many minor characters appear then disappear and the narrator is just too passive with the result that his voice becomes boring","899":"started strong but fell short during the coming of age of the youngest generation","900":" a good american by alex georgein 1904 frederick meisenheimer flees germany with his wife from her disapproving parents their destination america but when they find a boat set to sail to new orleans instead of new york they figure both are new right the two of them settle in missouri and what fallows is the story of their family over the next hundred years we live through wwi with the meisenheimers wwii the korean war all the way through to the 21 century i wound up really enjoying this i want to say i was a bit surprised except from its summary i was expecting to enjoy it so it doesn't quite fit i loved all the history throughout and that it took place in the south i do read a lot of historical fiction and while quite a bit takes place in the south i've haven't really read any that takes place in the early 1900s speaking of the early 1900s i loved those parts of the books part of me does wish the book was longer so that way there could be more of a focus of that time period specifically also since there was so much time and so many different characters it was hard to really get to know all of them yes there were a few a really loved and some i understand but part of me wanted more from the book at 400 hundred pages the book is by no means short but i wish it was longer because i would have loved to have read more and kept reading this family's story i do think this is a book you'll be hearing more about soon and i do feel privileged to have discovered this book so early disclosure i was provided this book through a goodreads first reads giveaway all opinions expressed are my own","901":"i loved the book most of the way through but thought it petered out toward the end it starts in 1919 and ends sometime after 2000 it is a fictional history of a family living in beatrice missouri narrated by the grandson of a german immigrant to the u s and was a very enjoyable read for the most part merged review this is a fictional history of a german family whose ancestors emigrated to the united states at the turn of the century i thought it started out great but was disappointing by the time we get to the present day","902":"i think this is the best book i've ever read ever","903":"well written family saga about german emigrants strong music theme very enjoyable","904":"dont waste your time boring never went anywhere","905":" this was quite a saga about the history of a german family that started with frederick and jette in 1904 they head for america after jette gets pregnant and can't face the consequences of her family they end up in new orleans and then beatrice missouri the tragedies and triumphs that follow seem over the top at times but what pervades the story is the indomitable spirit of the meisenheimer family and other immigrants in the novel i see this in my husband's german family the values of family self sacrifice and hard work i also liked the theme of music in the story and the twist at the end good book it would make an excellent book club book","906":"a unique story of immigrants and ultimately americans in a multi generational family in the midwest usa the story was well written and compelling but maybe contained a few far fetched characters that seemed too made up a good summer read","907":"this is a story of a german couple from hanover who leave for america in 1904 they cross the atlantic and arrive in new orleans on their way to missouri the novel follows this family to the present time it is a story of small town america it is an easy read","908":"i really liked the first 2 3rds of this book a story about a couple who immigrated to the us as told by their grandson a touching story of family love and loss the last 1 3 i can do without the more present day portion of the story where the grandson isn't really that likable and the twist at the end seems too deliberate","909":"excellent book heart warming a good honest read","910":" i am stunned that a book that started out so so good could have ended so terribly i spent the first 1 3rd of the book ravenous for it i was sucked into the story and loved everything about it even the slightly weird writing so they did this but little did they know that this was about to happen chapter break i'm also going to admit that i had no idea it was a male narrating the book until james himself is born in my defense i didn't see anything at the beginning talking about the narrator being a boy and i thought the author's name indicated they were female too so oops james' teenage hood was when it devolved for me his experience with the prom and then his brothers' encounters with that woman were way too much for me i decided i could no longer wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone and then i got to the end and became totally pissed what the crap was with that random story line twist view spoiler james being rita's son wtf hide spoiler why would you introduce something completely out of left field with only 15 pages left in the book something that never actually gets resolved anyway i just why that was so dumb and so unnecessary and so random and weird the ending was just bad it went from a personal story to a christmas card as one reader said an accounting of well he and she married and they had kids and they had kids and there were lots so they didn't remember all the names but that's okay because they were happy anyway and apparently the narrator decides to go have affairs with married women everywhere although thankfully that was never described in detail what in the what i just loved this book the first half or so so much so the crappyness of the last half makes it feel like a betrayal to my poor little heart i don't know if i could read another book by alex george because i don't trust him or his girly name","911":"rating 4 5 out of 5 starsgenre realistic fictionage recommended 14 and upi found this book very interesting because it was from a third generation's point of view this meant that every character in the book was referred to as my aunt my grandmother my mother or my grandfather this is also one of the only books i have ever read that has such well developed characters which made the book more enjoyable a good american-------------------------- frederick and jette have moved to america from germany in

- their future is very uncertain...will the family survive","912":"well written family story read it in one sitting","913":"john got this book for me for my birthday it is by a first time author it was an easy read and i enjoyed it it is about a couple that moves to america from germany end up in missouri it is the story of their life and the lives of their children it was one of those books that was just an enjoyable read it won't win any awards but i enjoyed it","914":"oops i've already read this","915":" well written book about three generations of a family starting with the couple who immigrated to the us from germany i liked the tie ins with music particularly i was interested in the first generation to see how they settled into a missouri town toward the end though i felt bogged down by all the descendants and what they were doing and actually started forgetting who was who it was just too much and i didn't need to know all of it also we tried to span the entire time with dabbles into this war and that sometimes it just felt like we were marking off a checklist still a great book i liked it more than i thought i would another awesome dollar tree find","916":" i really wanted to give this book 3 5 stars i picked it up because i'm of german descent too and i spent nearly 8 years in missouri the writing itself was good the characters were well drawn and i liked the narrator i also thought george did a really good job of portraying the gradual changes by which a family of immigrants from germany became truly american but there seemed to be a lot of extraneous deaths in this book to the point where they lost all emotional value it seemed like characters appeared and died only because he couldn't think of any other way to move the plot along it began to strain my willful suspension of disbelief the other thing was i thought the book was really overly concerned with sibling rivalry and as a mother of identical twins i thought that he didn't really get that twin relationship quite right that's probably a minor quibble but it kind of poked at me most of the way through that part of the book","917":"a must read could not put down","918":" what a wonderful surprise i received this in audio for review and knew little about the book other than it was historical fiction as i began listening i was immediately swept away into the saga of the meisenheimer family the story opens in 1905 germany frederick serenades jette with beautiful opera songs and eventually wins her heart but jette's mother does not approve of frederick and when jette becomes pregnant the only real option available to the two young lovers that will allow them to stay together is to leave for america they book passage on the first available ship marry on the journey and eventually arrive in new orleans finding it difficult to fit in and not understanding the language they continue traveling and when they reach beatrice missouri they find other german immigrants and settle there frederick takes a job at a local bar and eventually buys the establishment music food and family are themes that runs throughout this amazing story while much of the novel is upbeat there is also sadness tragedy and secrets the writing is rich the characters are vivid and i was carried away with their tale never boring and rarely predictable the story takes turns i wasn't expecting and kept me engrossed the entire novel is told from the point of view of one narrator fredericks's grandson james many of us can relate to being the grandchildren of immigrants my grandparents came to america in the early 1900s to escape the aftermath of a europe devastated by world war i seeking employment and a better life for their future children but i know little of their story and while i was listening to this book i kept thinking how i wished someone in my family had written some of it down for sadly it is now lost in time the audio was a pleasure to listen to gibson frazier's narration was superb and his storytelling had a perfect rhythm and just the right amount of emotion and inflection i highly recommend this to readers who want to try an audiobook for the first time as single narrator makes it an excellent choice to become familiar with the audiobook format and i'm sure it's wonderful in print too","919":"the story moved along it seemed like a new plot two thirds in but came to a good conclusion","920":"this novel is a multi generational story that begins with a pair of german immigrants who leave germany under some unusual circumstances the reader follows the family until modern times starting before 1900 the writing is realistic things happen to this family that happen to all families there is happiness sadness and humor place in the book where the sadness is very real and places where i wanted to laugh out loud i enjoy books like this so i found this a good read","921":"loved this book for a couple of reasons as a child of an immigrant and a teacher of newcomers to the us i am always interested in the story of their journey and the process of their acclimation to a new country however this story is multi generational and once we go beyond life in a new country there are still many other stories to be told some with twists you didn't see coming the writing is excellent and i loved the dry humor hidden within the story","922":" a good american is my new gold standard for family sagas all family stories now have to live up to this book and that's going to be a tall order this is the story of the meisenheimer family and their life in america a good american begins not in america but in hanover germany in the early days of the 20th century where frederick meisenheimer is secretly in love with a young woman jette frederick wins jette's heart by hiding in the bushes as she goes about her weekly sunday stroll in the park serenading her with his clear tenor but unfortunately as easy as it was for frederick to win jette's love it's just that difficult no impossible to get her disapproving family on board it's not long before jette is pregnant and the young couple steals away to a new life in the still young united states when they can't get a boat to new york they head for new orleans instead what's the difference they're both new as jette points out and travel north to missouri their journey ends abruptly in the small town of beatrice missouri where jette goes into labor and their family decamps in beatrice for the long haul frederick and jette make their lives together in missouri as frederick tries to be what a helpful stranger encouraged him to be a good american as their progeny grow up america grows up with them there are friends laughter tragedy frustration love and all the ties that bind a family together across the generations including secrets the biggest of which the book's narrator frederick and jette's grandson james finally unearths in a surprising twist i can't say enough good things about a good american it's a book that made me well up and laugh in the same chapter sometimes on the same page i was torn between wanting to read slowly and savor the lovely atmospheric writing and to feverishly turn pages so i would finally know everything that happened to the family now that i'm done i'm sorry it's over in fact that's my only complaint this book could have been twice as long and it still wouldn't have been long enough for me i could have read it forever five stars and applause","923":"this started out like gangbusters for me i fully expected i would give it 5 stars however it lost steam about halfway through and it became just a little tedious more like 3 5 but it was enjoyable enough to round up to 4","924":"what a delightful delicious book this is a real treasure hidden between the covers it is so well written and fascinating and fabulous i read it in one night i could not put it down and stayed up all night to follow the incredible lives of the frederick and jette meisenheimer and their family what a raucous rambunctious rollicking riveting family alex george has captured the essence of the midwest throughout an entire century with a deftness that is surprising for someone born and raised in new zealand i wept out loud and laughed out loud i was totally mesmerized by the intimate stories and antics of this family as they trudged their way through life i wish i could give this ten stars salute to alex george for such a well written and engaging story","925":"loved the beginning but it just kept getting more and more slow","926":"one of a quartet of brothers tells his family's story starting with grandparents who immigrated from germany mostly sweet sometimes bittersweet humorous tho sometimes missing tact story of family friendship twists of fate and community mostly g rated with occasional pg 13 scenes a good book to read when you want something on the lighter side but not devoid of meaning","927":"boring i didn't like the title it was unclear who was the good american and why it was a rambling story which hinted at many significant parts of us world history but without any detail or depth several subtexts were introduced without any real development narrator's true parentage none of the characters were adequately drawn so that you could attach yourselves to them","928":" louisa clark loves her job as a waitress at a small coffeeshop but the shop is sold and she needs to find a job not an easy task in her small town she finally agrees to a position where she helps care for a quadriplegic young man will had been a top venture capitalist daredevil sportsman man about town who is now confined to a wheelchair with only slight movement in one hand although she had qualms about the job she signed on to a six month contract can she bring some life back to the sullen dispirited man who had already tried to kill himself a good story with lots to think about our book club book for may 2014","929":"loved this book about families and immigrants alex george is a god story teller","930":"i really enjoyed this book i kept my interest all the way thru","931":"this is a beautiful story of the hardships or immigration the strong love between family and those quirky friends you meet along the way from start to finish this book had me laughing crying sighing smiling and completely immersed in this wonderful story","932":"i thought this book was amazing following a family from 1904 until present day as narrated by james the grandson of the initial two characters it kept my interest and managed to tug at my heartstrings if someone loves family sags spanning generations this is a must read","933":"good family story down to earth","934":" i don't like to write bad reviews so my review will be short this time i liked the concept of this book and the story did move along but i thought the book was very depressing the characters focused on everything bad that happened instead of the good it seemed as nothing ever went right for this family most of the time you could tell the story was being told by james a character in the story but other times it seemed as if it was being told by someone else it was not what i was expecting but i am glad that i read the book anyway","935":"this book isn't without it's problems but i really enjoyed reading it just the same i hope one of my friends reads it soon so i can ask a question that is bugging me","936":"a touching multigenerational novel about a german immigrant family and their gradual assimilation into american society the reader sees the family live through wars marriages businesses births and deaths and we see our own families through many of their stories this is a very different type of immigrant novel as the author explores what it means to be a good american","937":"fabulous story great characters","938":"i really loved this book the story was very well told and had a few plot twists and turns along the way my ancestors came from germany via new orleans to missouri and it was fun to imagine them having similar experiences on their journey i hope this guy writes some more books","939":"i can't say how much i loved this book the writing is wonderful and the story moves quickly and unexpected and satisfying directions alex george paints a world that is all his own and makes it tremendously real for the reader","940":"mediocre tries to cover all historical eras in too shallow a way skip it","941":"an epic tale of the meisenheimer family told through the eyes of james a grandson of frederick and jette emigrants from germany","942":"really good read immigrants adopt a new home relationships communication family dynamics","943":"i liked this book so much i laughed i cried got attached to the characters and didn't want it to end read it","944":"i did not fully get into the characters very interesting that it chronicled 4 generations originating in coming to us in 1904 and very aptly portrayed their lives against the social and political history of the era part memoir in a sort of stream of consciousness way the author had lived in england and within past decade settled in us","945":"the best book i have read in 2012 it's a tender story of german immigrants who move to america near the turn of the century and end up in a small midwestern town the book is narrated by the grandson of the couple we are first introduced to and follows the lives of their children and grandchild what made this book so strong for me was that the birth and development of america and the mood of the time touches perfectly on the characters in the story the story was perfectly paced linear which you know i love and the writing was clean thoughtful yet unfussy and elegant kinda like an armani suit there were surprises disappointments romance loss death violence and through it all you just felt love from the author and narrator and also a kind of tenderness towards america with all her quirks i loved this book","946":"good read long and interesting slow in some parts though good bit of sadness but this family keeps on going","947":"great fictionalized account of one family's immigrant experience and it's impact on the next generations easy read","948":"this was a page turner but a bit predictable the writing kept me going and i loved the characters","949":" i thoroughly enjoyed following the lives of frederick and jette a german immigrant couple who move to america with little money and a child on the way they find themselves in beatrice missouri when their first child makes a sudden entrance into the world this is the end of their journey and the story follows a century in the lives of this couple of their offspring the characters are unique and the author weaves the history of america into the lives of the inhabitants of this small german community alex george is a masterful storyteller","950":"courageous beautiful and sad all at the same time","951":"very well written author has a wry sense of humour the story of four generations of a family who immigrated from germany to the u s in the early 1900s","952":"laugh out loud funny especially for any genealogists","953":"a wonderful story that spans countries and time at times funny a heartwarming story","954":"the story of family and what it means to be a good american while there were some things that just weren't necessary in the book overall it's by readable it is the story of a young couple who meet in germany come to america and settle in a small town in missouri and then the subsequent generations from there on","955":"an engaging easy read this story is well crafted with lovable and memorable characters","956":" this book was a great reminder of what it means to be a family and how sometimes we struggle and have strife and sorrow but still we come out somewhat battered but also better for the battering it relates how it must have felt to immigrate from one country to another at the start of the 20th century and how the spirit of america can should and does beat it the heart of all its people it was a very refreshing look at our country from one families perspective the characters were all wonderfully fleshed out in this book and even through misery we see them all coping as well as they could with war prohibition life death and love as this family grows so does our country which is a character in this novel as well i will be watching out for the next alex george novel i suggest you do too","957":"an interesting family saga through time ending took a turn that seemed a bit convoluted but still enjoyable","958":"ehhh this book was just okay it had some interesting moments there was an interesting twist in the end but overall i was pretty bored i am looking for a book that i just can't put down and this just wasn't it","959":"good story unexpected ending","960":"can't really put my finger on it but almost everything about this book after the first couple of chapters just irritated me","961":"a very good coming to america story that spans several generations these kinds of books can get boring toward the end but this one kept my interest i love how the restaurant changed to reflect the times i never saw the twist that was revealed at the end","962":"a simple tale simply told no depth complexity artistic merit or clever plots or characterisations","963":"a good american is the beautiful tale of frederick and jette meisenheimer their immigration from germany to the small town of beatrice missouri and the lives of their children grandchildren and great grandchildren alex george has such a wonderful ability to make music out of the english language that it isn't surprising at all that the novel revolved around music of all kinds the descriptions of jazz and barbershop were so perfectly composed that i could actually hear the music as i read the first scene in which he describes the very musical meeting of frederick and jette pulled me right in and i couldn't wait to find out the rest of the story \"in the end he had chosen to ambush her with an aria \"che gelida manina \" from puccini's opera la boheme the opening lines translate as \"your tiny hand is frozen\"--not especially appropriate given that jette's hands were not even by the most charitable standards tiny they were also rather clammy due to the unseasonably warm weather still frederick knew what he was doing when he had finished his song he stepped out from behind the hedge and thrust a concoction of lupins dahlias and pansies into jette's big sweaty hands by then caught squarely in the crosshairs of puccini's gorgeous melody she was helpless \"regular readers of my blog will know that i adore puccini i named my dog after him after all and opera how could i not love a book that starts like this and i did love it in fact i gave it five stars which i only reserve for books that change me and the meisenheimers did just that the story of frederick and jette's family is an opera unto itself it is as epic as wagner as funny as rossini and as tragic as verdi but most of all it possesses all of the gorgeous melody of puccini","964":" this was an excellent book i really enjoyed how the characters were well developed and complex but their motivations and thought processes are well described each character is clearly defined but slowly over the course of his her contribution to the story you feel as if you know the characters in real life while the story developments are surprising in that you can't necessarily predict them you also feel as if you knew that it was exactly what you would expect that character to do i think that this sort of writing requires quite a lot of attention to detail and subtly and obviously a lot of skill it reminded me a bit of a prayer for owen meanyin it's tone another thing that the author did exceptionally well was to present events from both character's opinions so that there is a lot of miscommunication more importantly there is quite a bit of wrong assumptions made from lack of understanding or the other person's failure to explain narrated first person in past tense we don't know who the narrator is until about 200 pages in and his her name for another 40 pages or so after that this actually doesn't seem to detract from the story at all as the character seems to have the knowledge about past events that an omnipresent third person narrator might have of course he she also misses the point or sees the past with a skewed view as is appropriate given his circumstances i thought that was another sign of good writing the story narration moves along fast enough to keep you interested but not so fast that you barely get to know each character absolutely an excellent read","965":" it's not often that you get hooked on a book on the first page you usually have to wade through a few chapters to find whatever connection will carry you along to the end but alex george hooked me with the first line of a good american always there was music and he didn't let go for the rest of the book i finished it in a matter of hours entranced by these beautiful and real characters he created a tremendous and yes epic tale of a german family who emigrate to america and put down roots in the small town of beatrice missouri a good american at once makes you feel like part of the family the narrator james meisenheimer describes several generations of events both in the family and in the world around them with the right mix of detachment and wonder there's a lot of love there too and before you know it you feel the same affection for generations of the meisenheimer clan and those closest to them and if you happen to hail from an immigrant family as i do it's impossible not to draw parallels to all the stories you heard growing up this is not always a happy go lucky type tale but what true american story ever is what i can promise is that it is never predictable and just as important to me despite using james a third generation meisenheimer to narrate from a distance it is written with beauty and verve this is going to be the novel that everyone is talking about next year make sure to pre order your copy now","966":"beautifully written the book cover led me to believe i would be reading a love story based in new orleans which is certainly not what happened it's more of a story about struggle and family at the heart and soul of this book and the family lies music and a restaurant i truly enjoyed seeing how this family unfolds over generations in the beginning it slowly meanders through time and i appreciated that more than the whirlwind of a wrap up that occurs in the last 50 pages nonetheless this excellent writing and unique story had me rushing back to this book every day until i finished it","967":"like many people i loved the first part of the book but then stopped caring it dragged on over too many generations but didn't take the time and depth to get into the later ones like they did the first i just stopped reading it after a while","968":"i stayed up way too late finishing this book always a good sign the story is epic following one generation to the next to the next it's blunt and funny and surprising","969":"a very fast read kind of predictable kind of contrived somewhat insignificant but i liked it nonetheless the characters are likable and i did care what became of them as they struggled to adjust to their new country and shed their attachment to their old the story will resonant with anyone with immigrants in their background and that would be most of us","970":" i received an advanced reader's copy of this book at ala midwinter i've been pondering my review of this book for awhile because i have mixed feelings about it the first 2 3 of the book i absolutely loved but it kind of fell apart for me at the end the story covers three generations of the meisenheimer family as told from point of view of james one of the members of family's third generation the story begins with the frederick and jette fleeing from germany in the early 1900's to a new life in america they wind up settling in a small town in missouri where he eventually takes possession of a local bar which becomes the basis of the family's livelihood music is also a very large part of the story touching each of the generations in different ways the first 2 3 of the book i found to be a wonderful portrayal of a family over a century's worth of time i can't really say what i didn't like about the last part of the book without giving away entire plot lines but pretty much everything that happens once james and his brothers enter high school i found to be rather ridiculous and the final reveal of the book seemed kind of trite and unnecessary even given its enormity thus i have a hard time saying whether one should read the book or not i would hate for people to miss out on the beauty of the beginning of the book but an unsatisfactory ending to a great book can leave a bad taste in one's mouth even worse than just reading a mediocre book it appears from other reviews that other people were not as bothered by the ending as much as i was so perhaps if the book strikes you as interesting you should pick it up","971":"a delightful family saga really we're all immigrants from somewhere right and we should all try and be a good american great debut author","972":"a family saga that begins in germany in 1903 as it follows the meisenheimer family the writing level was simple with little subtlety and the characters weren't dimensional","973":"i tried but i couldn't finish this book","974":"i am a fan of historical fiction and thoroughly enjoyed this tale of german immigrants coming to america pre world war i era it was at times funny joyous and somber but never boring","975":"a family saga that spans four generations from 1904 to the present i read this while on vacation it was a perfect beach book an engrossing page turner with a twist ending the author gives voice to the immigrant story with all of its humor sadness romance and family dynamics you will feel like the family has come to live with you while you are reading this book","976":" this multi generational story had such promise and begins in 1904 with a young couple that decides to leave germany sails to america and settles in a small town in missouri having great grandparents from germany i was intrigued while not spectacular it was enjoyable reading and it was interesting to watch history unfold around this family then the author came to the narrator's teen years during the 1950's in a word revolting not to mention completely unnecessary after that it seemed like it was written by a teenage boy for teenage boys so disappointing","977":"okay story for me the writing itself wasn't that great the foreshadowing at the end of a lot of the chapters was annoying","978":"a true 2 star rating it was okay easy to put down and easy to pick up","979":"interesting story lovely to read on the bus","980":"i don't know i usually love family epics but this came up a little stale for me the narrative begins as someone telling a story of their grandparents and consequently it felt difficult to get to really know them and to understand their choices the narrative gradually becomes first person but the character isn't the most interesting in my opinion great premise but just ok execution it was enjoyable but an immigrant story like tree grows in brooklyn is a lot more powerful","981":"this is one of those rare things a story with a good plot and good characters that is also well written essentially it is a family history that begins in 1904 and only ends at some point in the late 1990s it begins with the german immigrants frederick and jette and ends with their grandchildren the story is told from the view point of james one of the grandchildren","982":"fabulous i'm hazarding a guess that this may be the best book i'll have read for 2012 update it's not often that i finish a book and actually caress the cover but i found myself unconsciously doing that while wiping away a tear after turning the last page first of all the cover of the galley is gorgeous and i hope the finished product has the same artwork and colors second of all i did not want this story to end the characters the setting and the prose were all magical and the stories told through each of the original and sometimes eccentric characters were all moving and compelling james tells the story of his german immigrant grandparents who settle in a small town in missouri in the early 1900s and once i got used to the narration suddenly switching from what seemed like third person to first person the story flowed oh and the music i can't forget the arias and the barbershop quartet harmonies that are woven throughout the book it is all absolutely wonderful this is a very special novel and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to readers who have loved john steinbeck's east of eden howard fast's the immigrants or any generational novel with a sense of scope and history this is also a great book for discussion groups and i have to add that i hardly ever think about reading a book twice little house on the prairie series being an exception but i will be recommending to our library's book group and am 100% willing to read it again","983":"i love a good immigration novel and this one spanning four generations did not disappoint the generations are linked by good characters music four part harmony and shhhh secrets","984":"fast read good story written well although the last part of book seemed rushed and written like a detailed epilogue had different tone than rest of the book","985":" sweeping saga of german immigrants frederick u0026amp jette and their descendants in america a pleasant read but it didn't rock my world long book covering multiple generations from family members to beatrice townsfolk there were several dozen characters i cried when frederick died he was the only character i was really attached to he was the one who really wanted to be \"a good american\" personally jette annoyed me and rosa but the rest were interesting to observe there were plenty of twists and turns as time passes and life happens\" it did seem odd to me that all the meisenheimer men had great love affairs with their wives what are the chances of that happening in every generation also all the second children seemed to have jealousy issues and be resentful of their siblings again what are the chances of that happening in every generation in fact most of the sibling relationships seemed overly competitive and dysfunctional to the point of being cruel in some cases that wasn't my experience of family so it felt a bit unbelievable the last couple chapters disappointed me the author gives a rapid fire account of the lives of frederick u0026amp jette's great grandchildren but these people were mentioned so infrequently up to that point and there were so many of them it was hard for me to connect them to the main story characters at the end of the novel the author also makes statements about what \"america\" is but it felt very much like an outsider's view focusing on inauthenticity constant changes and race mixing and indeed the author is english not american or even german so that detracted from the work for me i was drawn to the book because my grandparents great grandparents all immigrated from germany it was interesting to imagine what it might have been like for them the narrator of the story is one of frederick's fictional grandsons which lends a comfortable feel to the work however i did have some issues with stories secrets the narrator relates like frederick stealing then returning the metal that he couldn't have possibly known this issue is compounded at the end when the narrator discovers a major secret about himself either the narrator is omnipotent or he isn't you can't have it both ways overall a pleasant read nothing from the book will haunt me or stick with me but it was a nice companion for the last couple days as i worked my way through the novel ps just a couple more observations did the good polish doctor that frederick u0026amp jette encounter who charges frederick to be \"a good american\" seem like a rip off of the good bishop in les miserables to anyone else did the inclusion of a high school teacher who sleeps with her male students and a later reference to oprah seem like a cheap attempt at modern american culture to anyone else","986":"i really loved this book in every way structure language story and surprises i bought it as a pleasant relief from a lot of heavy serious reading i have been doing but ended up reading late because it became and enthralling book it begins in a purely novel manner third person about a couple in germany in 1905 it changes gradually into what feels like pure autobiography four or five generations in a small missouri town where the original couple arrived by chance excellent picture of the changing culture as history unfolds around them","987":"4 1 2 stars just need more hints of rosa's relationship with stefan other than at one point she seemed to be softening towards him after having shot mr jim there was no hints especially being that she was a school teacher was james born during the summer other than that this was a great story lots of twists hinted at the end of many sections and balanced with seriousness and underlying humor","988":"oh i loved this book so much i can't even find anything wrong with it it's a historical novel my favorite genre so beautifully written such wonderful characters it was everything a fantastic novel should be funny sad surprising engaging i adored the characters the words were poetic at times i felt like i was a local resident of beatrice the small town that sets the stage for this family beginning in the early 1900's and ending in modern times i don't want to say much because it's not the type of book that anything should be given away every character goes through various life events though the book centers on the narrater who tells the story beginning with his grandparents immigrating to the us from germany the story spans through the family generations with its roots in beatrice and attached to a restaurant the restaurant goes through changes as does the family and the times and through everything they keep their initial promise to a helpful citizen upon arrival to be 'good americans' am not going to say more in fear that i will give away plot points but i loved it cherished the time i spent reading it and with the characters and didn't want it to end though i do think it ended at a good time without dragging out a near perfect book","989":"the first 3 4 were good but then it went sour for me","990":"started out promising then became increasingly annoying and boring i threw it across the room when i was done","991":"as a genealogist how could i resist this book i wish we could all write our family's histories like george does","992":"wonderful novel about a german family immigrating to american and establishing themselves as americans great read fell in love with all the characters","993":" i loved picking this book up as often as possible during the past week i loved the endearing imperfect characters in the story it reads like a memoir and i wonder if it might be based on the author's family in any case the multi generational story of coming to america was beautiful there are some surprises along the way i had a hard time keeping the third fourth generations straight in my mind because of the numbers the title was perfect it made me think about my own great grandparents who came to america in the early 1900's from the netherlands","994":"i enjoyed this book in spurts there were so many generations that sometimes i'd put it down for a few weeks between generational stories in a way it felt like lots of stories stitched together some more artfully than others some of the story lines i really cared about but some were a bit lackluster hard to say if this is a sad or hopeful story mostly i just feel it's about time marching on for better or worse","995":" a good american by alex george swept me through an entire century of triumph and tragedy with the wonderful meisenheimer family by turns laugh out loud funny and achingly sad the story of the residents of beatrice missouri and all their glorious messy secrets and dreams is a winner from the first page alex george has created that rare and beautiful thing a novel i finished and immediately wanted to start again the recurring themes in the novel are music and singing there are times throughout the novel when you can almost hear notes being played and voices raised in song a terrific achievement i think the plot moves along through the characters lives and individual viewpoints and there are a couple of unexpected twists in the plot that i didn't see coming definitely recommend this book and i would certainly read this author again perfect holiday season read","996":"loved the characters in this book found it to be well written the story follows a family from generation to generation some parts of their story drew me in more than others some parts of the story lacked the hopefulness characteristic of most of the book that's why i settled on three stars definitely worth reading if you enjoy books that span generations of a family","997":"it started out pretty well i enjoyed reading about the characters u0026amp how they came to america u0026amp started with basically nothing if i didn't know people actually did this i would probably have been more skeptical when the adolescent sex scenes started i got a bit bored u0026amp almost didn't finish it the ending i don't know seemed a bit overly dramatic","998":"i might have enjoyed this book more if it didn't cover so many generations of the family's history i found the narrator the grandson of the character the book begins with to be somewhat unlikeable which tainted the story for me it was a fairly interesting story with a good twist that caught me off guard but it didn't resonate even just two or three weeks later i can hardly remember it","999":" this is a wonderful story about a young couple who emigrates from germany to the us and finds their way to beatrice missouri the book traces the lives of multiple generations of the family as they become more americanized and experience events such as prohibition and jfk's assassination my only criticism is regarding the plot twist at the end which was completely unnecessary i wondered if the author really had that planned all along or if it was just something he decided to throw in in the end either way it's a shame he should have had more faith that his characters and their lives made a compelling story on their own without the twist","1000":"an interesting story with an unexpected ending however there were tangents that didn't tie in later to the story also characters that were just plain bizarre i was not fully engaged while reading the book","1001":"this was a good read a multi generational story of a family originally from germany who emigrate to america and settle in missouri i thought itwas a pretty typical fictional account of a the travails and triumphs of a family i kept waiting for something monumental to happen but it wasonly within the last 40 pages that a family secret finally emerged adding some needed intrigue to the story","1002":"i listened to this as an audio book which i believe added to the experience parts of the novel were laugh out loud funny but the novel resonated as a realistic depiction of the european immigrant experience in the early part of the 20th century having grown up in a city steeped in the history of german immigrants even the multisyllabic last names felt familiar i was sorry for the story to come to an end","1003":"this was truly a mesmerizing tale of america beginning with jette and frederick and continuing through their great grandchildren a good american tells of family this story is both beautiful and poignant political and vibrant george is a lovely writer who wraps the reader in his tale a good 4 25 stars","1004":"a good american was an engrossing multi generational tale that chronicled the life of a good american though it was not always chronicling the same person it followed a family from before its arrival on these shores to its evolution in the heartland the reader gets to live through the pain honor joy and duty that binds the building of a family the novel gives the reader a chance to ponder the times in life when we make choices for survival for tradition for honor for patriotism for love for family or for self it is a blessing to consider","1005":"this was a book randomly selected in a bookstore what a lovely surprise a story full of feeling and family pride the tale of german emigrants making america their home as many families from all over the world have done over the years it follows the family fortunes for one hundred years it is sometimes humourous and other times sad with a few tragedies thrown in it is a gripping tale right to the very end where the author reveals a final surprise","1006":"it was good it started with lots of promise in the first 100 pages and dwindled from there it reads like the novel it is for about 2 3 of the story then the years fly by and it becomes more of an extended family history than a novel with a plot i feel like i just read the author's real life story with no real ending because he is still living still it's a feel good attempt about the strength of a family and the ties that bind","1007":"a tragic yet funny novel best described by the narrator himself a carnival of missed connections","1008":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this long story spanning three generations lacked a theme and didn't hold my interest at first i thought it was going to be the story of his german immigrant grandfather and how he loved america and was a good american but then he dies early on but the grandmother becomes a war protester and there is a mention of being a good american and exercising her freedom to speech and i thought she might develop into an interesting character but then she is hardly mentioned again maybe we are goin this long story spanning three generations lacked a theme and didn't hold my interest at first i thought it was going to be the story of his german immigrant grandfather and how he loved america and was a good american but then he dies early on but the grandmother becomes a war protester and there is a mention of being a good american and exercising her freedom to speech and i thought she might develop into an interesting character but then she is hardly mentioned again maybe we are going to see different members of the family and being a good american might look different in different situations nope maybe this is a poorly written memoir about the author's own family not that either the author isn't american there is an plot twist that comes out of left field so there wasn't any build up and the character deals with the news in the hour drive home and goes back to his uneventful life shallow characters no theme boring more","1009":"i must have really liked this book i read it way ahead of time before my book club met and when i went to turn it in to the library i sat in the parking lot for an hour and reread the last part of the book the pride of being an american citizen born of immigrants resounded with me it seemed like there were so many good hard working people but the twists about the main character's mother brothers and family friend forgiveness and love were very engaging","1010":"this is the second reading of this wonderful book this time for book group i think i loved it even more jette and frederick meisenheimer arrived in missouri from germany and started their family the book is told through the eyes of the third generation son alex george created a list of characters which i found engaging i cared about all of them we follow them through the history of america ww i ww ii jfk so wonderfully written","1011":"immigrants from germany arrive in missouri lovely language dashes of humor character emphasis","1012":" an enchanting novel about a couple who emigrated from germany to small town southern usa in the early 20th century and their descendants what grips is not the story line there is no strong plot thread but the beautiful atmospheric style and the slightly humorous take on family relationships it is slightly let down by the final section which races through the recent history of the family it felt to me that the author was not sure how to end the novel but this did not detract significantly from my overall enjoyment","1013":"read my review on my blog http www 50ayear com 2012 06 22 15","1014":"german immigrant couple arriving in new orleans prior to ww1 their story along with each generation throughout the years up to current times nice quiet story which starts out fairly interesting but at some point begins to feel more like a genealogical diary of a normal family there is nothing wrong with that but it doesn't make for a very interesting novel unless some excitement happens along the way their is one twist little mystery that just all of a sudden happens and is explained and is over absolutely nothing leads up to it so no excitement hits all the historical happenings throughout the century told by the second son of the original immigrants after he is an old man and is a very gentle telling the first half was enjoyable but once the first generation boys became teenagers it lost some of it's appeal","1015":"fantastic read by a great storyteller","1016":" i chose this book for my book group and we are discussing it in a few days i was pretty misled by this book which obviously says more about me as a reader than it does about this story i anticipated a story taking place in new orleans i didn't expect a multi generational assessment of what it means to be a good american so in theory i like the concept it's interesting to contemplate what that phrase means to the varied people encountered in the narrative i couldn't help but feel that there was a ticking off of characters and a synopsizing that had less to do with sharing a story than going down a checklist and making sure that all previous mentioned individuals were accounted for and rosa forget about it never","1017":"this is a lovely tale of an immigrant family's progression through the years with an interesting twist at the end although the reviews on the back cover claim that it is laugh out loud funny i admit that i did not chuckle even once there are admittedly a few humorous moments but not enough to outweigh the deep sadness and death this author loves to kill off the characters almost every other chapter all in all enjoyable cannot wait to see what my book club friends have to say about it","1018":"i almost abandoned this book after about 150 pages but i am so glad i didn't the story suddenly turned a corner and became very engrossing i especially liked the author's quirky cliffhangers at the end of the chapters definitely an interesting history of a family from immigration to present time","1019":"beginning in 1904 a story of immigrants and their adjustment to living in missouri interesting but sometimes confusing the generations kind of melded together and hard to remember who was who","1020":"what a delightful and well written book i was immediately drawn in by the loveable characters and their stories a good american is part family saga and part history of the 20th century while some may have been bothered by the episodic structure of the novel for me that just added to the realism of it as a work of historical fiction grandparents beget parents who beget children and so on i was enchanted watching each new member of the family grow up and add his or her story to the family history and the title poses interesting questions for discussion what does it mean to be a good american do any of these characters succeed and this is exactly the kind of discussion we need to engage in right now as we face so much hatred and xenophobia a good american is a gentle reminder that our great country was built by immigrants but george never preaches and their conflicts and struggles are not so different from those of us born and raised in the u s this is the kind of book i wish i had written","1021":"a sprawling engaging story of a family's journey to america and to becoming american george raises questions about what it means to be part of a country and what it means to be part of a family recommended for book club discussion","1022":"interesting the way it is written but liked how the generational impact of families defines their futures","1023":"during our present period of immigration obsession this is probably a good time to get a fresh perspective on being an american americans often forget how mixed mashed and transmogrified their personal backgrounds really are and this novel provides an excellent view of that reality the story begins with a seemingly hapless young german couple falling in love at the beginning of the twentieth century and soon facing an unplanned pregnancy that changes their lives they decide that since they are about to become social pariah their only solution is to go to america and begin a new life but a serendipitous event results in their trans atlantic destination becoming new orleans rather than new york this single change in their sojourn takes the reader on a delightful excursion through three generations filled with humor pathos drama and wonderful revelations the family is what most would probably consider an average american family but therein lies the beauty this average family soon becomes richly textured and we quickly realize that unpredictability is what makes life so fascinating once you start you'll have a hard time putting it down","1024":"i really enjoyed this book we read it for book club and most all of us agreed that it was very good","1025":"i enjoyed the plot and characters and i wanted to keep reading but the prose made me a little nuts paragraphs consistently ended with the most trite summation sentences it seems love had unlocked his voice and things of the kind that made me consider chucking the book across the room but then i would soldier on and get attached to the next phase of the family's history unfolding only to be brought up short by another stupid ass trite sentence and finally they just added up to too much and i gave it up more than 2 3 through maybe someday i'll find the patience i lack for this kind of peppering with painful cliche but for now i reluctantly gave up the book","1026":"wow liked this more than i expected to it reminded me the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society both it's sweet straightforward good storytelling a good american tells the story of 3 generations of americans i had a hard time putting this one down every character was nicely developed and even at the end there was a nice little surprise waiting for me great read with something in it that should appeal to everyone","1027":"oh my gosh such a lovely book so lovely have i said how lovely it is it is the story of the meisenheimer family through the eyes of grandson james as he relates the story of his immigrant german family through nearly a century of american history being the child of immigrants myself i enjoy a good immigrant story when done well i especially enjoy when it spans several generations there is some humor lots of struggles lots of successes and lots of sadness and some plot twists one big one in particular the first half of the book started out like most family sagas and i really enjoyed it by the time i got around to the middle or so i was so sucked in and so invested in the family the characters were so real and relate able throughout the book i got so closes to them and lomax omg lomax how i loved him the writing style was wonderful it is not a fast paced book but it is an easy read besides i enjoyed it so much i adored the slower unfolding of this family's story i'm actually sad so sad that the story is over i felt like i just lost some close family and friends i can't sing enough praise about this book","1028":"a very simple story with nothing that exciting happening the whole book","1029":"along with the orchadist a wonderful and moving portrayal of the american character i particularly enjoyed the german american community since my mother's family immigrated to central missouri from germany in the early 20th century also","1030":" 4 11 12 got delayed reading by a faulty gallbladder still not reading due to pain medication and inability to concentrate come on 4 05 12 this is an excellent book the first i have been able to read and finish since my surgery yay i thoroughly enjoyed this one set almost entirely in the mid west of the united states namely missouri small town missouri very german the description of the town beatrice reminds me of another town in iowa given the name of paullina after the two paullin brothers who owned the land the town was built on this book along with a series of books by wendell berry reminds me of my daddy's hometown my grammy's birthplace in o'brien county iowa i idolize the life there the way of life i imagine my father had he not joined rotc at coe college in cedar rapids iowa would have done just as the numerous characters of the book left the town for awhile but would have returned to stay read on amazon com the snippet about the book i loved it and hope you will also i also hope the author goes on to write other books that are just as interesting highly recommend","1031":"i really thought this book was a great look into what it was like for an immigrant in the early 1900's to experience the 'american dream' very inspirational to just be a better american and be thankful for what we have here","1032":" i loved this book it was really good and it was well written i loved the story and george who is an immigrant himself does a great job of showing what it was like for frederick and jette as they moved to the u s from germany i loved that you see several generations over the course of the novel and how much things change over several generations but as much as things changed they also don't change very much i just got so invested in the characters and i couldn't wait to see what happened to them and there's a plot twist that came out of nowhere well not really out of nowhere because looking back there were clues i just didn't think anything of them i am so glad i read this book i laughed i almost cried and my heart was broken it gets a 5 out of 5","1033":"simply a good read i enjoyed it talks about the life of a family who at one point decided to leave their country to immigrate to the states with no specific plan in mind and how fate twists and turns to make the plans for them it is a good book to read simple smooth and enjoyable","1034":"what a great book the writing was wonderful i was laughing out loud at some points and tearing up at others this will certainly be one of the top books of 2012 for me","1035":"i chose this new release because the story takes place in my home state of missouri it did not disappoint it was a soulful story of four generations of a german immigrant family who settle in one of the many german communities just west of st louis now i have to investigate the writings of author p g wodehouse","1036":" fredrick's opera singing in a park in germany attracts jette and thus begins their musical love affair when jette's pregnancy is revealed she becomes disowned by her parents and the couple flees to america with dreams of a life as good americans the uplifting family saga has you laughing and crying in turn readers are immediately captivated by vivid characters and stark events of their boat crossing the atlantic this memorable multi generational tale told through the eyes of their grandson james unfolds the ups and downs of an immigrant family's life historical events from wwi prohibition and the great depression are entwined with family experiences and with the music of the times from opera to barbershop quartet and the many cuisines in america","1037":"i almost didn't read this book because of the descriptions of some of the quirky folks who peopled the town beatrice mo in which the novel is largely set but i'm glad i wasn't put off by the malevolent bicycle riding dwarf whose role is brief this novel is an old fashioned family saga with memorable characters and some moments of genuine humor and poignancy it didn't blow my socks off but i liked it a lot and will check out this debut author's next book","1038":"i found the first two thirds of a good american to be an engaging immigrants tale the last third perhaps due to the multitude of characters did not allow the same growth in character development an interesting engaging light read with an autobiographical feel","1039":"great story so easily moving i finished it in a single reading as my family traveled from va to sc the author has created a story so engaging with characters so absorbing that i literally did not set the book down for 6 hours at one point i was laughing so hard my family thought something was wrong with me i rated it a 4 but i may have to come back and give it a 5","1040":"slow start good read full of tragedy and humor by the end i was starting to truly appreciate the story and the humor","1041":"in the official book synopsis there is talk about a jazz musician and the role music plays in the life of fredrick and jetta combined with new orleans i got this vibe that this could be a book that needed a playlist though the music does play an important part in the book the vibe totally missed which was disappointing the story is narrated by the grandson james you can feel this very well in the build up the closer it gets to his own life the more details are given and the more emotional it gets the atmosphere in the story is great though a bit distant at times in the emotional corner it fits the story still there is a lot the lives of frerick and jetta with their story moving into the lives of their children and their coming of age story going on to the coming of age story of james and his contemporaries the developments are done well but it was fast and the moment i started to connect to something the story jumped to the next situation failing to really pull me in same problem was with the characters though you stay with the family throughout the whole book you do feel a connection as if you are looking at their picture album but the comments where often to short to really dive deep into one of the characters the end of the book does get interesting the feeling something more is going on in this family lingers for a long time and the detective in me picked it up early on but i kept wondering till the end if it was going to be revealed showing for the pace of the story and they way things where dealt with if you love detailed coming of age story this is not the book for you if you like a slow paced look into the life of immigrants for three generations this can be a great read","1042":"the best chapter in a book that i've read in a long time this is the chapter were the twin theodore is mistaken as jesus by the reverend not the only very funny part in the book i liked the story it kept me guessing surprises here and there an easy read but a good multi generational story with relatable characters","1043":"the book started out very interesting family life took many twists and turns but went on to long for me it is an interesting way to tell a story over the course of history and perhaps will inspire me to finally write my ow family story","1044":" thanks to goodreads and amy einhorn books for an early peek at this amazing book a good american is a sweeping epic following the meisenheimer family from its german beginning through a century of life in missouri it is full of memorable characters who leap off the page there is plenty of laughter and even some tears as james the third generation of the family spins this tale alex george has taken the immigrant story and given it new life in the richest of stories truly a wonderful and entertaining novel of not only what it means to be a good american but also a good family member","1045":"quite readable storytelling carries you along nicely but looking back not sure why i thought so the first half painted strong portraits of frederick u0026amp jette but the later generations didn't hold my interest and it didn't make sense how the narrator knew such personal stories of his grandparents","1046":"i really enjoyed this book the three star rating is because there were just too many characters to keep track of and people got married had kids and dropped dead within one chapter it was a wonderful story but it lacked focus","1047":"i loved this book the author's style and the story","1048":"three and a half stars","1049":"great quick engrossing read spanning three generations","1050":"i really enjoyed the first 2 3 but after that i was just waiting for them to wrap up the story and be done it seemed like they kind of lost focus","1051":"i had high hopes for this book since a few friends had recommended it rather highly i didn't hate it but it was a disappointment it started out well enough and seemed to have promise but it stalled and slowed down before i had finished a third of it there were so many characters who were introduced who could have been so much more interesting if only we had been given just a little more of their story it got to the point where i just didn't care what happened to them anymore and i wanted the book to just be over my final thoughts on it just meh","1052":"good story based on immigrants' trials hardships and rewards of coming to america there are emotional parts as families leave their loved ones for a better life and sometimes life on the other side of the world an be bitter it tells of triumph pride hard work and new love this book is worthwhile if a bit too long","1053":" the blurbs on the cover of the book led me to believe i would love it but i had a real hard time with the characters and their actions which just didn't ring true to me someone on the book front compared the author to john irving who is another author that i never connected with perhaps that is my problem i just don't like the style plus despite the book cover's comments by turns laugh out loud funny and achingly sad i did not experience either of those emotions it all seemed simply contrived sorry i hate to trash a book that others obviously enjoyed","1054":"a good american by alex george is an excellent read spanning 100 years and four generations of german immigrants who found their home in missouri the story is full of twists and turns and real life in middle america loved it","1055":"what makes a good american in 1905 jette and frederick flee germany after their clandestine relationship proves rather fruitful much to the dismay of jette's society mother they find themselves in the small missouri town of beatrice frederick loves america with such vigor it creates a strain on his marriage and his family a good american in the story of three generations in beatrice all in search of what it means to be american every member of the family has a unique experience and story all tied to the town and each other i found a good american awkwardly paced and it was hard to keep track of time line the story started in 1905 and ended 105 years later i would have liked to spend more time in each story and story lines that seemed very relevant ended up not really getting touched again as a sweeping general narrative though there were characters i cared about lots of people die it's a hundred years it happens i just wasn't blown away though i don't regret reading it i don't know how strongly i'll recommend it","1056":"one of my favorites of 2012","1057":"this book was not a challenging read nothing scary nothing earth shattering despite that i enjoyed it because it was a nice old fashioned comforting story","1058":"read for blogher book club february march 2013the meisenheimer story is told by james the second of four american born grandsons of immigrants frederick and jette whose plans to settle in st louis were permanently sidetracked when they stopped over in the small missouri town of beatrice surrounded by fellow germans they put down roots but they are tested by larger events as world war i alters american attitudes toward germans everywhere and prohibition shuts down the family business but because reinvention is an american hallmark the bar is reborn as a restaurant and over the decades its menu evolves from jette's native german specialities to her son joseph's all american burgers to a great grandson's mexican style offerings and while james associates his family's story with music taught to sing by their father joseph who learned to love music from his father frederick he and his three brothers sang together as a barbershop quartet but food is at least as big a part of it more http www 3rsblog com 2013 02 bloghe","1059":"i became so involved with the characters and their town of beatrice missouri that i didn't want the story to end now i miss them alex george told a story with everything we want from a novel mystery romance sex secrets sins sacrifice people with human frailties and many twists and turns in events and fortunes all part of our their family's history and america's history","1060":"our book club read this enchanting book lots to discuss about immigration lots of chuckles as well as some sad parts interesting characters some became quite dramatic toward the second half","1061":"very good book i especially appreciated the early chapters and the struggles of the immigrants what faith it takes to leave your country with only the clothes on your back and no money in hopes of a better future wow highly recommend","1062":"a great read and quick as i finished it in just two days of reading unfortunately some of it just seemed sad as if regardless of the character's determination they were bound to be complicated with some ill fortune i can't really say much more about it without spoiling some of the plot lines but there were very few happy moments still it was a very good book a great story about an immigrant family and successive generations and how they adapt to the changing conditions in their lives","1063":" i thoroughly enjoyed this look at the life of three generations of the meisenheimer family trials tribulations love hopes and dreams all interwoven with a love and talent for music that at times sustains them and at other times drives them apart while beautifully written i felt the story lacked impact and tangentially fell into a boy's coming of age story when portraying the modern generation of the book's narrator that said however the ending is touching and poignant and brought a tear to my eye","1064":"excellent writing paired with an interesting story","1065":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book a story about people without much of a plot just following the characters down through the generations but the story was so well told the characters were vivid and believable by the time i closed the book i felt like i was saying goodbye to old friends i can't help but wish that my family history could be viewed with as much detail and clarity as james's beautifully written and i will most certainly be adding wodehouse to my list of must reads","1066":" this book was overly long and i found it difficult to really get into it it had a paint by numbers feel to the great american novel the writing is at times almost painful there were lots of sentences like she was the crucible of all his hopes and passions i almost had to give up the last half is much better and the ending works quite well i can well imagine this book getting endorsement from oprah winfrey there is even product placement in the form of an oprah interview overall the book tries to be too grand and sweeping connecting too many ideas and themes","1067":"a simple tale of of emigration to the us and family life there in a predominantly german town i didn't expect the twist at the end though","1068":"i love stories that tell of a single family through its' generations and this one did not disappoint from the matriarch who had none of the feminine grace that was expected from ladies of her class due to her size i was hooked here was a story that was not the same old same old i loved every page","1069":" this is the story of all of us that have had family immigrate to another country frederick and jette leave their native germany in 1904 and head to america because her mother does not approve at all of their union they stop in beatrice missouri on their way to another town because jette is about to have their child they are warmly welcome there as it is a community of germany immigrants and they feel at home frederick's great desire is to be a really good american and lives his life that way the family story proceeds from that point chronicling their ups and downs into the 21st century it is a most delightful read and very well done","1070":"i really didn't care for the author's style at all he ended just about every chapter with a teaser for the action about to happen and it was always super cheesy the characters weren't believable everything was just too convenient all around it was just not enjoyable for me","1071":"loved this book a multi generational story that's an easy read with involving characters i could've grown up with","1072":" i need half stars in my rating system as i debated between 3 and 4 stars for this novel it was interesting in that it spanned 3 generations of an immigrant family from germany i thought that the beginning of the book was great that the ending was good but that the middle kind of lacked excitement it wasn't bad it just wasn't as interesting as the beginning where the characters were more unique troubled challenged and tried so many misunderstandings really affect the characters' lives and so much seems to happen by chance very realistic and enjoyable narrative style","1073":" i am a granddaughter of italian immigrants to the united states and find myself drawn to tales of the \"immigrant experience \" i was pleased to be a recipient of an advanced reader copy\" of a good american this multigenerational tale documents the lives and experiences of frederick and jette meisenheimer and their descendants as they travel from their home in hanover germany to the small town of beatrice mo in the early 1900's and create their home and family the narrator of the story is their grandson james beatrice was not their intended destination when they set out but through a series of events and circumstances becomes their home the common threads of the immigrant story are present but with a flavor that was unique to me they want a better life than what they left they have a spirit of perseverance that serves them well they want to be accepted and earn their place as \"good americans \" they experience some hardship and discrimination some tragedy and accomplishment what was different for me is that while the italian immigrants tended to make their way to a community of fellow immigrants from their place of origin and be immersed in an italian community that shared the experience the mesenheimers were virtually alone and it was their independent spirit that served them well in addition to the personal saga of the family this is a historical novel that takes us through the spirit of growth and settlement in missouri the world wars the time of prohibition throughout the events are tied together by music and the family's love of opera i found the story compelling and some of the characters were especially appealing to me the writing held my interest but the mesenheimer's story did not resonate with me as much as other novels with a similar theme","1074":"one of the best books i've read in a long time george is a fantastic storyteller and i loved the way he wove culture history family and music in so artfully","1075":"a good american is a fictional immigrant family saga beginning with frederick and jette who leave germany in 1904 and settle by chance in fictional beatrice missouri the story is narrated by grandson james a good american may appeal to readers interested in the immigrant experience of ordinary people in the heartland who face challenges with language and culture as they puzzle out how to live and be a good american i enjoyed alex george's book nevertheless for me the book loses potency as it tries to follow too many stories and family members perhaps i am unduly influenced by my recent reading experience of the excellent documentary fiction series by vilhelm moberg that follows karl oskar and kristina nilsson's emigration from sweden to minnesota in the mid 1800s the emigrants and their subsequent immigration experience unto the good land the settlers the last letter home the author wrote four books without shifting focus away from the primary characters that allowed a depth of exploration of the place and times that was not available in a good american","1076":"read this for blogher book club this week great story","1077":"i loved the first 2 3 of this book and then it just went down hill","1078":"a good solid generational novel covering three generations of a german immigrant family to missouri the first generation's story is very strong the second also good the third generations story falls a bit flat with me and the large family secret that is uncovered i find only mildly interesting but oevrall well written and a good read","1079":"i absolutely loved this book what a great read i couldn't put it down i highly recommend this to others","1080":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i know a lot of people love this novel and the first quarter of the story really drew me in but if you get to a point in the book where you find yourself thinking really a magical black guy a german cajun restaurant or this book is going to be like forrest gump isn't it then it's likely that this book isn't for you and you can move on","1081":"i honestly don't think i would have picked this novel up to read had it not been assigned by my book club i was quite impressed by the writer's talent and thoroughly enjoyed the story of this german american family as well as reading about the music of each generation this was a very good read","1082":"just when i grew to love these characters the voice changed and what was wonder became irritation it is disappointing i am sad to say","1083":"an epic tale of immigration and the american experience with quirky characters reminiscent of john irving and a compelling story i loved this book","1084":"good for people who enjoy character driven storytelling the plot is the people in the end although there are several twists and turns the events unfold in a natural uneven series through the eyes of a somewhat omniscient narrator interesting historical nuggets are sprinkled throughout making the scenes live and breathe great details that don't bog down

this book in under two days last time i read that swiftly was when i was a schoolgirl with time on my hands when's the sequel out","2":"glimpse into the world of polygamy and cults very disturbing","3":"polygamy and a dry oklahoma farm abandoned gas station nice setup but boring overall","4":"i wanted to like this book but it was very lacking there was no character development and toward the end the character's motives were non existent","5":" i got this book from netgalley com i wasn't sure about getting this book but it looked interesting enough to ask for a review copy what i got was something unexpected i thought i knew what i was getting myself into but i wrong this book is not for the faint of heart this is about a woman and her children escaping a cult and trying to survive out in the world it tells the story of sisters who have no clue how to cope or survive outside their compound and away from their sadistic leader father it's about a woman the first wife doing her best yet not enough to help her daughters the story goes back and forth from present day to memories being told it tells of abuse heartache and fear there were times where i had to stop reading and walk away because of the story being told this book draws you in from the first page and won't let you go til it is done i will warn you this book left me emotionally drained","6":"it was like a trainwreck i had to find out what happened but some of these characters should have just died it's a strange book i wouldn't recommend it","7":" i have always been fascinated by cults they make my head spin wondering how on earth someone could have total control of their followers when i read the blurb for this one i knew that it was a must read as the story begins we meet a mother and her two daughters frantically trying to escape from a cult in utah the only life they have ever known we get to follow along as amity sorrow and their mother work to build their new life amity is ready for this new life and everything that it has to offer but sorrow does not embrace it she wants to go back to the way things were this novel was dark and eye opening it gives a good look into a life that is often not talked about all in all riley has done a fubulous job on this one i look forward to reading more of her work in the future this book was given to me for free by netgalley in exchange for an honest review","8":"i wanted more riley did a great job of keeping you entranced and slowly divulging the secrets of the past i was sad when the book was over i felt invested and wanted to see how the characters would do at reinventing themselves in their new life amity is so naive to practically everything you wonder how long it will take for her to recover like i said i want more","9":"i thought this book was awful nothing happens it's really boring and really predictable the characters are two dimensional and there is no resolution to the paper thin plot","10":"amity u0026amp sorrow was a rare find for me i mean i would probably never walk into a bookstore and pick out a book about a woman who has escaped from a polygamist sect with her two daughters myself but that's what i love about book blogging i'm exposed to so many more books and genres than i would be otherwise amity u0026amp sorrow touched me more than i thought it ever would exploring themes of family love grief and guilt for full reviewhttp backstagebooklover blogspot co","11":" unlike some who really didn't like this book i really enjoyed it and found it hard to put down i really learned firsthand about religious cults and commune living while living in indiana i even dated a guy who had come from communal living and his ex and their two daughters still lived in the community this author did a fantastic job of portraying religious cults commune living though you have to remember it is fiction book and so is probably not entirely accurate some things i wanted to touch upon 1 there are many reasons why young women get involved in cults polygamy lifestyles commune living even though some of them know that it is wrong it does offer a sense security stability that some of them have probably never have known 2 commune living often starts as a good idea there are many reasons people are attracted to this type of lifestyle but over time it can evolve and change not necessarily for the good usually the leader becomes narcissistic abusive and controlling by that time the other members are brain washed and fear leaving for reference read about jim jones jonestown david koresh branch davidians amongst others 3 a couple of the comments said that the mother was not portrayed as a strong woman strength comes in many forms until you have been in a lifestyle like this you have no idea i don't know what makes some women willing to give up their freedom to be involved in a religious cult or polygamous relationship but we know that it happens we also know that not all women are born into this lifestyle but choose it willingly for whatever reason the fact that the mother in this book starts fighting back and leaves shows strength but you have to remember that she was a member of this type of lifestyle for a long time you can't just expect her to just leave not be afraid and to be normal right after leaving being abused controlled for as long as she was would take years of therapy for most women to learn to live in society again you also can't expect her to be the type of mother you think she should be 4 while i didn't particularly like sorrow i did understand how screwed up she was and how she became that way i think we readers need to be a little more compassionate towards her here was a girl who was born and raised in this lifestyle she knew no other life her father had an incestuous relationship with her and she became pregnant and miscarried he molded her to be who she was he raised her to think she was the oracle the holy one you cannot blame her for being so screwed up or being psychotic actually you cannot blame sorrow or amity for being as screwed up as they were being born and raised in a polygamy religious cult so i thought this was a fascinating read the way the book is written is a fast read the author made me think and feel and to me that makes a good book i could actually feel the fear and control these three females were feeling","12":"wow very strange book not sure it is worth a read but a different read for me","13":" this was an interesting and unusual story of a mother and her two daughters who escape their husband and father's polygamous compound they end up on a farm in oklahoma that belongs to bradley a man grieving the loss of his wife there is obviously some huge things amiss with this mother and her two daughters and as those things are revealed we see suffering and heartbreak this story was compelling and tragic the book dealt with some very difficult topics thanks to the publisher and netgalley for providing an arc in return for an honest review","14":"amity u0026amp sorrow by peggy riley seems to have mixed reviews even from my trusted blogger friends but i'm not mixed about my feelings in the least this book was amazing dark and full of desperation and sadness for sure amity u0026amp sorrow is a story about two sisters amity age 12 and sorrow older but unsure of her exact age who escape with their mother amaranth from a dangerous polygamous cult amaranth first wife of fifty wives decides it's time to escape when she realizes a few hard truths amity and sorrow have a difficult time adjusting to life in the \"real world\" outside of the cult and sorrow resists wholeheartedly for the full review visit love at first book","15":"the cover is beautiful and the story is lovely as well i throughly enjoyed this book","16":"a fast read strange but interesting","17":" i really enjoyed this book about a mother that leaves a commune with her two daughters in tow after a tragic event the family ends up on a farm after their mother falls asleep at the wheel and crashes her car while amity fits easily into her new life at the farm sorrow's previous cult life has taken over her soul she makes life miserable for both her mother and sister and is hell bent on finding her way back to the commune and to the father that has impregnated her with his child although this is a fiction book one can't help but think about the fact that this story is true for many not only were the character's names interesting but the story as well all of the character's were well developed this is also the story of what lead a mother to join this cult in the first i could not judge these characters who were both vulnerable and raw","18":"i couldn't put this book down but i think that's because i was hopefully racing towards a big ending it did not come i found the ending such an anti climax i did enjoy amity u0026amp sorrow even though i'm not a fan of flashbacks","19":"to be honest i found this book a tad boring and very preachy nothing really happens in it i kept waiting for a big moment but unfortunately it never came wouldn't recommend it","20":"i read the first half of this book but then skipped to the end enough said","21":"liked the story didn't like the writing style","22":"i was a goodreads first reads winner of amity u0026amp sorrow a novel the story is written well but i agree with another reviewer that the writing style took getting use to when the story was in the present i really enjoyed the story and i liked all the characters when the story went back for me maybe it was the religion aspect of it i was not that into you do need that for the telling of this story though this books description really caught my attention and i glad i got the chance to read it because it's not a subject i have come across in books yet i got a glimpse of what it might be like to live in a polygamous compound especially for the children","23":" reading this novel is a little like driving past an accident it's hard to avert your eyes full of all of the sensationalism that one would expect of a book filled with a polygamous and possibly incestuous cult with a messianic leader what lies beneath the surface is actually a tangled knot of psychological complexity when amaranth makes a risky escape with their two daughters amity and sorrow from her husband's cult to start a new life she cannot know that the madness lying dormant in one of her daughters will imperil all of their lives this is a disturbing and compelling read full review here http asthecrowefliesandreads blogsp","24":"meh right in the middle good but not what i was really expecting rcs","25":" this book is very religious i will warn people of that it's all because this woman named amaranth joined a religious man and changed her now they are running a cult that talks about the end of the world every single day i'm a religious person not nearly as religious or crazy as these people but i am a christian what really made this book amazing to me were the things that the daughters had to face the daughters of amaranth are sorrow and amity sorrow is the oracle i don't really know what this is but i guess she saw things because she was connected to god amity is just sorrow's little sister who watches everything it is because these little girls are so religious and grew up in the cult that they are so difficult to their mom they were told all of these rules that they had to follow but slowly amity started to thrive under the new circumstances you could see amity's character grow and you could also see amaranth grow sorrow is another story sorrow is a freaking lunatic i don't want to judge her because she was brought up believing all the crazy stuff she did believe in still that girl is crazy i kept thinking that a demon possessed her or something still it was interesting watching her character react to things the romance in this book wasn't what i expected i thought that bradley was going to save amaranth but no they had a romance that was confusing because amaranth was confused he didn't force her to do anything and then he didn't tell her what she could and couldn't do he didn't save her from her troubles or anything he was just there when she needed him that's what was kind of amazing about this romance plus it wasn't the main focus of this book the thing that really got me was the end i just couldn't believe it but i could understand why it happened i won't give any spoilers because i hate telling spoilers still that ending though what made me really think about this book is the fact that this stuff actually happens people actually join cults there are polygamous groups out there that think that this is okay even though almost everyone believes this is crazy these people join these groups it could be for love like amaranth did or for a home like some of the other people in the book still it was an amazing story you can also read this review on my blog http truestory1998 blogspot com 201","26":"i completely lost patience with this book despite the interesting premise and attention getting opening i couldn't make myself like any of the characters the man and boy were cutouts static with no distinguishing characteristics amaranth the mother struck me as the kind of person who would have known better than to get involved with a polygamous cult amity the younger sibling was so shockingly ignorant from her upbringing that i became amazed she'd ever learned to talk and sorrow was an unlikable bully and egotist i was giving up on this book already before an act of animal cruelty was perpetrated and at that point i lost interest in what would happen to any of them other than wanting the perpetrator to be run over by a tractor just not that interesting and populated by annoying at best characters","27":"well 2 5 probably because although the storyline was good i couldn't really relate to the characters any of them except possibly the farmer it took ages to read too kept picking up and putting down so it didn't really grip me did find it interesting though the portrayal of the relationships between the women was well drawn ending was unexpected but good","28":"scattering seeds tending seeds and reaping what we sow together with learning to question the rules are the key themes in amity u0026amp sorrow this fairly short novel by peggy riley is well written and would provide a lot for a book club to discuss i received an arc via netgalley and have posted a more detailed review of amity u0026amp sorrow at izzyreads com","29":"odd i'm not entirely convinced about the book u0026amp the end seemed a little rushed as though the author tired of it","30":"june 10 2013 amity and sorrow by peggy riley mother with two daughters flees waco type cult family chaos they find a farmer a lonely and ethical man with his delightful articulate bedridden father the children and their desperate mother are depicted living with the effects of a religious cult leader's abuses their gradual changes each one of them so distinct in experience and in the decisions they make are intensely beautifully portrayed it feels impossible to depict but somehow peggy riley manages it redemption suffering the articulation of a peculiarly american form of the isolationist religiosity poverty and hope the individuals of this novel stay with me deeply sweetly","31":"i generally love books about mormons so thought i would like this one from the description it was very slow going and i finally started to get into it around the middle of the story i liked the back and forth between past and present but found the writing to be too verbose","32":"interesting book well written and about a subject that isn't written about in novel form too often","33":"received free from netgalleys as arc working on full review update i would give this book another half star because i'm feeling generous the book is readable but it doesn't do much for me i felt like it needed a few more re writes and a demanding editor see full review at booksnobbery http booksnobbery wordpress com 201","34":" at the beginning of the book we see a mother and her two daughters leave their polygamous cult behind their car breaks down in oklahoma where they meet bradley a farmer whose wife had left him bradley introduces them to his father where both amity and sorrow keep him company we also see how life was for the mother and daughters at the compound that they left and how they were treated at first bradley doesn't like the fact that the mother had left her husband behind until he finds out what kind of lifestyle that they left in the book it is revealed that the oldest daughter was sexually molested by her father the ending is disappointing but the mother discovers what real family is","35":"like other reviewers the ending of this story greatly disappointed me while i did not expect a happy go lucky ending i expected more threads to be tied up than what occurred amity and amy were both interesting characters but sorrow annoyed the ever living hell out of me it also annoyed me to no end why everyone around her just let her do all the horrible things she continued to do i can't even talk about it right now without getting angry they were all i know she's doing bad things but oh well","36":" a woman and her two daughters are on the run over time we discover who and what they are on the run from a religious cult headed by a polygamous man the book explores the effects of taking a family out of the cult and who are placed in the real world with people who might not believe what they do a mother who is desperately trying to start a new life a daughter who believes she is carrying the son of god and her sister who is confused and perhaps too young to understand what is going on there is something new and unexpected on every page warning some aspects are quite graphic in their description of sexual acts and there are references to incest","37":"this is a story of two sisters and their mother after a fire they run away from their father who is the husband of 50 women they are in oklahoma when they have the car accident and they stay with a farmer amity is the peacemaker sorrow is big troble it reminds me of the branch davidians of waco and the dangers of cults","38":"very odd book i liked that it was not predictable","39":"this book had serious potential the author could and should have made it longer giving her readers more character background and definitely a better ending would've liked to know more about dust bradley and hope","40":" i didn't enjoy reading amity u0026amp sorrow-enjoy is bad word choice in this case it was really my morbid curiosity that made me want to read this book i am not a fan of religious fanaticism and cults understatement and i was curious to read about the polygamous cult in amity u0026amp sorrow i wanted to read about how it affected these two young girls needless to say amity u0026amp sorrow solidified my feelings what their father's cult did to them and amaranth to a lesser extent was just awful and the ending made me both hopeful and very sad i did however enjoy peggy riley's writing and the way she put the story together as many times as the story of amaranth sorrow and amity made me cringe at no point did i want to stop reading i was entirely sucked in from the opening lines two sisters sit side by side in the backseat of an old car amity and sorrow their hands are hot and close together a strip of white fabric loops between them tying them together wrist to wrist their mother amaranth drives them the car pushes forward endlessly forward but her eyes are always watching in the rearview mirror scanning the road behind them for cars unfortunately i think that will be the story of amaranth's life pushing endlessly forward in an attempt to move on but forever looking back over her shoulder always aware of-and to some degree afraid of-the past she's leaving behind peggy riley's writing is captivating and i'll be keeping my eyes open for more of her work in the future amity u0026amp sorrow is a relatively quick read it's hard to put down but because of its subject matter it's also very thought provoking this isn't a book i'll soon forget read my full review on between the covers","41":"as the first wife of 50 in a polygamous marriage amaramth takes her 2 daughters and runs when things become bad at the compound the story is based on then and on now and how they all change and what shaped them to become what they are it is not the average book and i enjoyed something a little different","42":" i couldn't stand this book for many reasons 1 i'm all about strong women and this does not contain one i was expecting the adventure of a group of a women smart enough to up and walk away from a cult and while the mother took her daughters away she is so brainwashed and dumb and was such an enabler all along turning a blind eye to the most ridiculous of crap fields are evil wtf that i could feel no pity for her 2 some should have just offed sorrow she's a menace to society and the most brainwashed of all she's psychotic no pity for her and her oracle garbage either 3 while i felt there was hope for amity as long as she continues to kiss her sister's behind she won't go anywhere there wasn't a single strong woman in this 4 i wanted to know why the mom was into this cult in the first place it wasn't adequately explained 5 the prose setting gas station pan handle of ok it all felt very 1950s i mean really no phone but this was supposed to be a modern day story it continuously threw me off this was a miss for me sorry","43":"i love a good cult which is to say i am repelled and fascinated by them there's a lot to admire about this novel but ultimately i felt riley didn't quite make the connection between the material the themes the reader and the central metaphor the cult at the heart of this novel feels strangely empty to me and i think it's because it didn't mean anything more than itself peggy riley is too good for the result to be simply sensational but it doesn't quite work as literary fiction either","44":" amaranth and her daughters sorrow and amity escape from their religous cult polygamist home and end up on a farm in oklahoma run by a lonely widower the daughters have trouble adjusting to the outside world and as their mother tries to start a new life i loved the premise of the book and the writing was good but there seemed to be too many holes in the story or places that it didn't go deep enough which made it hard for me to believe that the characters would do what they did without getting into specifics that would be spoilers in addition i never really cared for any of the characters none of them became real for me with the exception of the widower's dad he was an absoltely delightful character and every scene with him in it was hilarious and real if all the characters were that alive and well drawn this would have been a 5 star book as it is i enjoyed the book well enough but feel it could have been better with a few more drafts to deepen the story and flesh out all of the characters","45":"too sensational story had potential","46":" amity u0026amp sorrow is a book about a woman who escapes a polygamous cult with her two daughters on the night of a fire one daughter doesn't seem to really understand what is happening and the other daughter is set on going back i enjoy reading books fiction and nonfiction on this topic but i just did not like this one i kept waiting for some type of growth to take place within the characters but it never happened the only one who seemed to change a little was amity and the only characters who spoke with some sense were the old man and dust i think what upset me more than anything was that the mother didn't seem to want to step up and do anything to really help her daughters she just kept wallowing in self pity this book just never reached its potential it could've been so much better i received my copy from netgalley in exchange for an honest review","47":"this book sounded really intriguing so i was eager to read it however i just couldn't get into this book as i normally do the premise was great but the author didn't follow through i wanted to know more about the characters what was their lives like before they escaped what was their relationship with other members of the cult my questions were never answered overall i found the book very boring the pace was really slow when i put the book down there was no desire to rush to get back to it i never reached the point of really caring abut these characters great cover i just wish the inside was as good i received an arc from netgalley and wish i could give a more favorable review","48":"a raging inferno destroys the compound of a fundamentalist polygamous cult and directs the leader's first wife aramanth to flee with her two daughters amity and sorrow one is a reluctant passenger while the other watches \"for the end of the world \" in the backseat of the car their hands \"are hot and close together\" with \"a strip of white fabric\" looped \"between them tying them together wrist to wrist \" aramanth is \"taking them from their home and all they know and they have no idea how they will ever get her to turn around and take them back \"peggy riley's absorbing and gripping debut amity u0026amp sorrow may be fictional but the plot reads like something straight from the headlines riley mixes the personal with the political and the individual with the communal in her unflinching and thereby stunning portrayal of a family escaping a deranged cult leader and father and his dangerous religion \"all the world prepares for the end of time \" \"father\" preached to his flock of wives and children on december 31 1999 \"you can feel it like a sickness \" he cried and lamented that the world was \"coming apart at the seams \" though the world did not end on that date father was not upset but secure in the knowledge that the end was closing in riley ably and chillingly illuminates the appeal of a utopian society like the one father attempted and failed to create in riveting detail the author describes how wife after wife fifty in all came to the compound and married father some worried about terrorism others sought something larger than themselves a few wanted to start new lives none intrigued more though than riley's \"thirty ninth wife the daughter of waco \" who left the branch davidians after the waco firestorm only to seek solace in the arms of a new prophet these transfixing passages turn the cult's followers into real people with hopes dreams and everything to lose a deep sense of loss permeates amity u0026amp sorrow out of all riley's main characters it is sorrow who feels the most unmoored as she is desperate to return to the compound she enjoyed her position as the cult's oracle but now her status is lost to her forever her greatest wish to be her father's fifty first wife will never come true still sorrow holds fast to her father's teachings no matter how unrealistic they seem or how ignorant they make her appear in contrast to her sister and in accordance with her name amity does her best to promote harmony whether in the compound or on the run on the farm where the family enjoys a brief respite amity makes friends with dust a teenage farmhand and finds comfort in the pages of the grapes of wrath despite her efforts to fit it amity seeks a sign from god and believes her hands can heal a television \"turning snow into pictures \" by moving the rabbit ears aramanth does not miss what you might expect instead of longing for her husband aramanth yearns for the companionship of her sister wives women she grew to love she is increasingly drawn to bradley a farmer who is nothing like her husband the longer aramanth spends away from the compound the clearer things seem to her about father and about her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow is filled with vivid and intoxicating passages of prose especially when riley writes about spinning \"...women werespinning like hoops like wheels women spun in solo orbits lost in chanting lost in prayer then they spun together in a wide circle that swung around the room around the altar \" when they \"spun they could forget patrol cars forget that they were being watched and judged \" when the women spun \"they only thought of how the heavens turned above them and how god cupped them all in his wide white hand \" the bereavement amity feels is palpable and powerful to the reader when she begins menstruating and no one spins her as they did sorrow i was glued to riley's compelling tale the opening when two sisters are tied together at the wrist literally forces you to keep reading you feel tethered to the sisters yourself already even on the first page riley seizes your attention and never lets go in her riveting and timely debut amity u0026amp sorrow is hotter than brimstone and will leave you reeling","49":"a good plot and decent ish ending but you don't get to know the characters enough to really care about it all","50":"i want to know why amy stayed in the cult in the first place and what was the key for did i miss something the best character was the old man he was a hoot","51":"the title of this book are 2 sisters who with their mother flee from a cult amity is happy to follow her mother sorrow is not four days of driving see them in oklahoma where amaranth the mother crashes the car they are rescued by a down on his luck farmer who offers them a place somewhat temporary to stay amity loves this new world having never been away from the confines of the cult sorrow will do anything to go back amaranth is beginning to understand the life she has fled one of fifty wives to a man believing the end of the world is coming salvation what is going to happen to them now and what has happened to the other wives and children","52":"pretty intense read i was more intrigued to get to the ending as opposed to enjoying the content what i discovered the characters to have extreme emotional baggage that prevented them from having more natural humanistic characteristics","53":" amity and sorrowpeggy rileya debut novel and an impressive one at that i could not resist this book once it became available for review the subject matter has always been one that fascinated me i loved the story the pace is fast the world building genuine and extremely disturbing the writing style itself took me some time to get used to but by the end of the book it added to the plot and no longer distracted the disturbing life story interspersed with humor was a fascinating read waarkindle purchase linkhttp www amazon com gp product b009","54":"i wanted to like this book but found it simple it could have been so much better don't bother with this one","55":"i really don't know what to say about this book i'm not sure i enjoyed it at all but on a positive note the story did gather pace 34 pages from the end it's about a woman who runs from her husband who is a cult leader taking her two children with her and the effects of living in the cult on her children hmmmm","56":"i'm not certain how to rate this book or review it it somewhat reminds me of the orchardist but yet very different i do like a book that has more depth more grit and this one certainly has it polygamy a cult or mormon fundamentalism the oklahoma dust bowl and drought and just plain dirt and grit sometimes hard to read but i'm very glad i did","57":"didn't think it would end like it did but enjoyed it all the same","58":"for as long as i can remember i have always been fascinated by cults any kind of cult being a born and raised texan i think my fascination was fostered by the idea that there were so many different cults popping up in my backyard yearning for zion branch davidians and heaven's gate ok so heaven's gate wasn't located in texas but marshall applewhite was the chair of the music department where i went to college and was a texan i remember reading and watching programs about the children of god and charles manson much to my mother's chagrin which makes me wonder why it is that i haven't read very much cult related fiction i was very pleasantly surprised when i received an advance copy of peggy riley's debut amity u0026amp sorrow amity u0026amp sorrow is the story of a mother amaranth and her two daughters the eponymous characters the story starts off intensely with the three of them on the run from the compound of the fundamentalist cult that they were a part of a mysterious fire had been set and amaranth takes the opportunity to flee with her girls amaranth crashes the car in oklahoma having been driving for four days without sleep they are rescued by a local farmer named bradley who begrudgingly offers the sanctuary that they need amity and sorrow have been sheltered within the cult and learn about life outside of it while amity blooms under the new influence sorrow wants nothing but to return to the life she has known amaranth does a little learning about herself and the life that she has left behind but the resolution of what has happened to her recent past life calls her like a siren song this story is simply written with little description or embellishment i've never been a big fan of overly flowery writing you never really have a concrete idea about how old the girls are or what people look like at first not knowing really irritated me however with further reading i came to the conclusion that it makes sense as the cult the women belonged to discouraged vanity vivid descriptions of people and visual judgemnts had no place in these people's minds ms riley does touch upon how they are dressed and how people perceive them but you get few distinguishing descriptions of the characters this book is crazy disturbing and engrossing there are two stories that unfold amaranth's life within the cult and the development of the three women outside of the cult's influence what i think is interesting about this story is that while it does focus on life within a fundamentalist cult it also touches on the impact and repercussions of life after it was written in such a credible way that sometimes it made me wonder if the author had at some point in her life been involved in a cult simple things as plugging in a television let alone knowing what a tv is or checking out a book at the library are foreign ideas to the girls i would never have considered these things i found amaranth to be an extremely fascinating character throughout the entire book you get her life story in a series of flashbacks you read about her birth her role as the first wife of zachariah her relationships with the other wives amongst other things she's one of the most interesting and complex characters i have read in a long time i love the relationship that she develops with bradley he's not a romaticized hero which i really liked he lives simply and like a slob chain smokes drinks but he's a good ol' boy at heart the differences in amity and sorrow are amazing you have two girls at opposite ends of the spectrum amity is the younger and she is often overlooked she is in the shadow of sorrow the first born of the new generation of followers and the \"oracle\" while amity thrives in this new way of life looking at everything in curiosity and with a thirst for knowledge sorrow clings to the old way of life because she was the oracle she was greatly revered for her role and spoiled and longs to go home having these complete opposites within the story you get a pretty good scope of the recovery process there was one quote that struck me more than any other in the story \"her barbies had no wedding gowns -- not a one of the eight barbies who lived with the single ken in their plastic house on their cardboard beds in sin \" this was amaranth reflecting on her wedding day to zachariah holy crap does that not bring it close to home uhhhhh... i thought that the book had a great flow and i didn't feel for one minute that it was too slow if there was a problem with slowness it was all me i just couldn't read fast enough when it came down to it amity and sorrow really made me think and i'm pretty certain that i'll be thinking about it for a long time i found it to be an ultimately satisfying read i would highly recommend it to anyone that has an interest in cults but warning it may exacerbate your interest to a higher and creepy degree as i'm sure it has done for me i will definitely be keeping an eye out for ms riley's future works","59":"i devoured this book in one day if that tells you anything and i'm more than a little disturbed by this tale and that i became so engrossed in it amity and sorrow are the daughters of amaranth a woman who has finally flown the coop from her fundamentalist mormon compound where she was the first wife of a psychotic man who eventually collected 50 wives to live with them on their remote utah lands the book begins with the mother's flight and it is only in brief flashbacks that we learn about life on the compound and eventually her earlier years that led her to marry such a messed up human being in the meantime we follow amaranth and the girls as they find themselves stranded on a remote farm in oklahoma where the farmer begrudgingly allows them to stay the children are horrific to put it mildly having known nothing of the outside world their entire lives both amity and sorrow want only to return to their father and the only life they have ever known through a series of terrifying events we learn that one sister might stand a chance while the other is hopelessly psychotic ultimately this is a tale of redemption imperfect though it is absolutely riveting similar to watching a train wreck","60":" the writing is a little patchy and riley doesn't spell out in full what she meant to say for example the last line see how they twitch and they want since i read this very quickly i may have missed something i think it is worth to re read again one day i thought the story is intriguing and thought provoking i cringed at the religious fanatism and the wrong beliefs that was misconstrued as being the truth the spinning and the ultra strange ritual of prayer make no sense despite their strange and erratic behaviours ultimately the female characters in this novel are victims and i can't help but feel sad for them i read a similar mormon story in the 19th wife by david ebershoff in march 2009 and i still find the 19th wife more entertaining than amity and sorrow see full review at http bibliojunkie wordpress com 201","61":"thought provoking but not an easy read","62":"i didn't finish the book i found that i didn't look forward to reading anymore","63":" amity and sorrow are sisters who have grown up in a strange small community with one father and many mothers because the story is told from a very close point of view and the girls know little of the outside world the reader is responsible for providing real world context to the events of the story the characters' lives center around religion and self sufficiency the religion can be identified as a strange fundamental offshoot brand of mormonism invented by the husband father of the community however a dramatic event causes amity and sorrow's mother amaranth or amy to take them and flee for the first time the girls encounter the outside world and it is clear how little they know and how strange they appear to others the three of them crash land with a desperate farmer his old ailing father and their young farmhand and their two worlds combine in ways that are awkward tragic and touching","64":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a quick read and i liked it it kept me turning the pages but i'm not sure how much i liked it some readers might find it difficult to believe that the women of the cult could be so controlled so submissive but anyone who has experienced an abusive childhood or marriage would understand how fear and manipulation can do that and religious fanaticism can add another frightening layer particularly to children what i had trouble with was how amaranth didn't seem to be able to be st this was a quick read and i liked it it kept me turning the pages but i'm not sure how much i liked it some readers might find it difficult to believe that the women of the cult could be so controlled so submissive but anyone who has experienced an abusive childhood or marriage would understand how fear and manipulation can do that and religious fanaticism can add another frightening layer particularly to children what i had trouble with was how amaranth didn't seem to be able to be straight up with her two daughters after she left the cult why didn't she sit down and talk to them directly talk about what happened why didn't she just go to the police right away or seek out a women's organization to assist them or counsel her daughters especially after sorrow began to behave so weirdly unbelievably sorrow had been raped by her father her father was a pedophile and amity had witnessed it but amaranth seemed so wimpy even after she came to her senses and she escaped from the cult and i really had trouble figuring out why she would go back to the cult compound later to find sorrow with amity why would she take her daughter back there why wouldn't she just contact the police when sorrow ran away i really had trouble understanding a mother like amaranth what was wrong with her as for sorrow hmmm would she really want to stay with her father the man who raped her even when i considered the influence of the cult's religious fanaticism i really had trouble with that too the novel was interesting fairly well written and i really wanted to keep turning the pages to the end but when i thought about it later there was something a little off about it maybe even though it is a good read it just didn't seem completely believable more","65":" originally published on my blog my novel opinionquite honestly i was not looking forward to reading amity u0026amp sorrow since it was themed around the goings on of a polygamous cult and religion is featured heavily polygamy cults and religion are three topics that would generally sway me away from reading a book but after reading a number of blogs on amity u0026amp sorrow this past week i was intrigued and had to find out more for myself leaving any preconceptions firmly behind i started reading this book on sunday evening by monday i was hooked and by tuesday morning i had finished so what did i think i was shocked i mean i'm not that naive that i don't think this really happens but really how in this day and age do people like zachariah get away with this twenty wives and i say it in the loosest form since amaranth is his only legal wife and they all happily share him nurse each others children believe whatever nonsense he is spouting about the end of the world basically amaranth realizes what has been going on as does the reader when sorrow miscarries in a gas station restroom and escapes with her daughters amity and sorrow sorrow is well and truly under her father's spell and wants nothing but to go back home to him amity wants to keep sorrow happy and so the story unfolds over a number of months when amaranth crashes her car after four long days of driving and attempts to befriend bradley despite the unfriendly welcome amaranth and her girls have always had rules to follow on the compound don't enter a man's house don't speak unless spoken too dress a certain way etc and so the story follows them trying to learn and become comfortable with a new way of life the girls can't even read they are not educated in anything that would be useful in a world outside of the compound throughout the story are flashbacks to amaranth's time living with zachariah from when she meets him to being introduced to his polygamous way of life and her relationships with the other wives the ending i was stunned with the way the book ended i'm not sure if i was pleased or not i won't go into more detail but if you have read the book i would be interested to know how it made you feel i think peggy riley has written a superbly harrowing and captivating novel about a topic that despite being somewhat taboo leaves many people intrigued my eyes were opened i'm no longer going to dismiss a novel just because it mentions religious cults or polygamy i received a complimentary copy of this book for review","66":" a woman u0026amp her two daughters are driving the back roads fleeing from her husband their father she crashes in a small oklahoma town u0026amp have nowhere to go a farmer offers them shelter but they say they cannot enter his house they stay on his porch she is running from her husband a polygamist leader of a cult someone set the temple on fire u0026amp she escaped with her two daughters seems the father had his eye on one of the daughters this is after he has 50 wives the mother realizes this is not right nothing seems to be right how could they have let this go for so long this was an ok book too much weirdness with those crazy cults","67":" 4 stars is really more like a place holder i'll probably go back and adjust the stars i just don't know what to think about this book but i suspect i will think about it a lot amity and sorrow are very well drawn characters sorrow is the elder favored and gifted and amity is her caretaker very much like the lost conspiracy's set up amity is both resentful of her sister's entitlement and proud of the role she plays in supporting sorrow their behavior is as believable as it is often horrifying holy moly fundamentalist fathers are really bad for emotional well being the ending gives me pause and as i say i expect i'll be contemplating this for some time","68":"evocative and powerful often but boring at times","69":"very different very interesting definitely recommend but keep an open mind","70":"http www culturestreet com post ami","71":"this is not a book to read for pleasure but it is an interesting book nonetheless for the insight it gives into the sorts of brainwashing that vulnerable people are subjected to as cult members and the impact this can have on the decisions they make about their lives outside the cult i found the whole book disturbing but despite putting it aside often i couldn't help but go back to see if things would work out for amaranth and her daughters i made it to the end but there are still questions floating around and i feel vaguely unsatisfied not a book to read if you like a clear storyline and nicely tied up ends at the conclusion but if you are looking for something very different and are happy with a book that is not so much a story but a study of damaged people then this might be the book for you","72":" after many years amaranth has run from the polygamous commune she married into it is the only world she's known since her earlier life was one of no family and poverty which ended the day she married wandering preacher zachariah the polygamy came later as did zachariah's increasingly rabid pronunciations of the coming of the end of the world aided by amaranth's own oldest daughter sorrow who has become her father's assistant acting as a seer to his prophet now after a showdown with local police who were more worried than anything else that ended in their temple burning amaranth took the opportunity to flee taking one of their many cars the boot loaded with provisions she's been hiding away she drives for four days across the country with her two daughters amity and sorrow sitting in the backseat after sorrow's first attempt to escape when they stopped for fuel amaranth tied her daughters together at the wrist with a strap but driving without sleep takes its toll and in the middle of nowhere amaranth crashes into a stump flipping the car onto its roof there is help at hand of a sort they are by an old shop and petrol pump that belong to a farmer called bradley his wife has left him and he has only an adopted teenaged son nicknamed dust to help him on the farm in this corner of oklahoma the dusty panhandle to oklahoma's frying pan there's little money to be made off the farm which is being squeezed by the companies selling the seed and aside from letting the strange trio sleep on his porch bradley has little interest in helping them amaranth was initially certain that zacharia was following them hunting them livid with rage and determined to drag them back but as the days go by and he never appears she turns her attention to bradley and the run down house meanwhile her daughters aged fifteen and twelve are caught in a strange new world where the rules they have always lived by are being discarded and everything they once understood about the world is being threatened by a new reality amity younger and more flexible of mind tries to incorporate the new world into her previous understanding but sorrow remains fixed in her belief of her father's claims and will not be shaken she is determined to get home to him and in her skewed reality it matters not who is harmed along the way amity u0026amp sorrow is a fairly short novel and simple in its structure and its story yet for all that it focuses its energy on some big key themes and explores them deftly without falling too heavily into the tides of melodrama yet it becomes somewhat side tracked by these issues at the detriment of its characters the story could certainly have gone many ways and one of the reasons why i've given as detailed a summary as i have is because i felt a bit lost going into this i wasn't even sure of the time period at first or where it was going sometimes this is ideal preferred even but other times it helps to know something of the story first but as i said this is a story of themes rather than action a story of human nature rather than a story of a life's journey it takes on some key themes that are something of a preoccupation in america fervent zealous religion and a belief in televangalists and the end of the world and the sorry state of agriculture which ties into the end of the world frenzy the idea that everything's going to shit bradley the farmer lends his voice to this theme giving voice to the paradox of large scale farming and the problems that arise when the seed companies and the stock market and government policy dictate what he can and can't grow i got acres of rape out there and i don't know what i'm doin' we was always wheat here but the price drops and someone says they want rapeseed oil so you buy it and you plant it and then they call in a loan you plant soybean then sorghum and you keep settin' your share diggin' deep diggin' broad puttin' in things you never grew before 'cause they say someone'll buy 'em and everythin' you grow you sell and put back into seeds 'cause they won't let you save seeds anymore and then you have to spray and you have to buy their spray and then out of the blue folks want organic but your seeds and spray ain't green and if you don't spray you'll only harvest cheatgrass and shattercane and then they tell you to plant corn for ethanol when that's what all the rape was for when all of this was dust once and before that it was buffalo grass and they made it worse men like my pa settin' their shares too deep wantin' too much turning everythin' over 'til nothing would grow hell anything growin' here is a miracle the landscape of this part of oklahoma is a tangible vivid one as is the sense of isolation and poverty it's in the small details but also captured effortlessly in bradley himself who typifies the situation in the way he speaks the life he's lived his attempts to keep going and not give in though he knows full well that farming's a joke when the soil's bereft of nutrients and there's barely any rain he's trying to make a living off a new kind of desert and that makes a certain kind of man tied into this is of course the much larger theme around religion in america zacharia's polygamist cult consisted of fifty wives by the time amaranth leaves and while many of them are brought back by her husband at the end of his summer preaching travels others arrive of their own accord having met him and learned about the commune as a place they can escape their old lives to a place of basics and a simple life far removed from terrorist attacks drugs and all the other problems that come with living our hectic contemporary lifestyle this will resonate easily with riley's readers giving zacharia's cult believability and from there it's not such a huge step to understand how people can buy into his fervent spiels about god and the coming apocalypse especially as these women have all seen or are all thinking about the worst side of humanity where the cult becomes scary is when the madness takes over when the things zachariah says lose all semblance of reason and most especially with sorrow she's at that age where teens are caught up in their hormones carving out a place for themselves and trying to figure out their identities sorrow believes everything her father says and more she has created a god that no one outside her would recognise and she makes the rules up as she goes without even realising it all to satisfy whatever aim or desire she has she's like the ultimate spoilt child i got the impression that even if she'd been raised in a normal household she would have still had the potential to go her own way to look for something that would have given her the illusion of being special and superior what her father did to her and i'm not just talking about the brainwashing was absolutely horrible but you can't feel sympathy for her because in her twisted mindset she's made it into something else that puts her above others in any contest with sorrow she is bound to lose amity shrugs how will he bring us a car a truck what truck amity has a bad feeling about this sign a red truck a faded truck the man's truck you can't just take his truck god put it here for us god gave the truck to the farmer he won't just give it to us sorrow reels amity in by the end of the wrist strap god says the boy will take it for us just as he took the food god will make him what sorrow really needs is firm parenting right from the beginning but that never really happened and this is the result needless to say sorrow's mother amaranth is useless as a mother she has no role models to emulate and no education to help her think her way through things she knows she's ineffective but that knowledge alone can't fix things this is another theme that is touched upon in the book that sometimes weak parenting without barriers is just as bad if not worse than no parenting at all i hit her she calls to him i hit her she gestures with the stick i've taught her i've done it a dark row of spikes stands between them that what you people do she is willful she has to learn he nods my pa used to beat the crap out of me didn't teach me nothin' 'cept he was a bully big man hittin' a kid she squeezes the stick i don't know how else to reach her in contrast to sorrow who is really quite scary in her brainwashing amity is young enough to have more of an open mind and also her place in the cult wasn't anything like sorrow's she was a watcher observing much but mostly keeping quiet she also believes she can heal with her hands her naivete and ignorance is that of a child so that what becomes frightening in sorrow a wilful headstrong selfish teenager is mostly amusing or merely sad in amity she looks out for her sister looks over her even but has a task she is ill equipped to know what to do with her ignorance puts her in a dangerous position and her mistakes are the direct result of her lack of parenting and the cult's over zealous theology amaranth isn't a hateful figure for all of her mistakes and stupidity i felt sorry for her much of the time but also angry with her for how her daughters have turned out what was most telling were her thoughts regarding her place in the polygamous cult she is zacharia's first wife his only legally recognised wife but she has no special hold on him and doesn't seem to regard their lifestyle as a religious one and at the end of the day it's the women who are her family the women whom she lives all her days with who mean so much more to her than her own husband it's a poignant moment she had only ever wanted a family to love and belong to and she thought of the time when she had first arrived when she saw he women there women she didn't know and hadn't expected and thought she was better than them because he'd married her she thought with a start that she should have married them not her husband it was these women who stayed when her husband did not it was these women who cared for her and loved her in her failing her husband didn't even know that she had had eve and already she'd lost her her thumb picked at the oversized ring she wore hers alone and of course the novel spends a fair bit of energy on the state of religion in america and the appeal of televangelists through bradley's bed ridden curmudgeon father we get the voice of the tricks of the trade breaking down the so called spirituality of these preachers into a give and take commodity giving the people what they want to hear in exchange for money when amaranth takes sorrow and amity to the nearby town sorrow is drawn to a local preacher of this type who has styled his own young son into a prophet and they have a show down our work glorifies god sorrow bites back what works do you do what gifts have you he has the gift of tongues a woman in a wheelchair calls then speak prophet says sorrow you got nothing to prove son the man says but the little boy screws his face up throwing his head back and opening his mouth in a susurration of consonants a string of long and sensuous vowels a woman in a caftan falls to her knees hands up to fondle heaven sorrow flings her own head back then and roars her gift through clenched teeth where the boys words are silken hers come as stabs where his slip along a slick path hers are a switchback of barbs and hooks grunts and clicks listen to that the man calls will the grapes of our lord be gathered from thorns the woman in the caftan struggles to get back up grabbing hold of the wheelchair arms that's the devil's talk it is not sorrow protests you're making it up the boy says yours is a bunch of noise sorrow pokes the boy in the chest you're making yours up you are the boy's face goes red you're only a girl and you're too little to make jesus it is these scenes scenes i've quoted here that hit hardest that carry the most weight and make the most impact they aren't subtle but they are effective i like subtlety when tackling these kinds of issues but i must admit to being entertained by them nonetheless especially when as in the quote above i hear a little bit of monty python coming through there is much to like and admire in amity u0026amp sorrow though it's not a novel that i'd say you would enjoy it's ultimately too sad and tragic for that the issues it deals with are just too heavy of heart and i know for sure that i would have been able to immerse myself better in this story had i read a physical copy rather than an e book that's just the kind of reader i am but even had i read it in hard copy i still would have been left feeling rather disappointed the novel lacks oomph it lacks subtlety and it lacks the kind of characters even one that you can really connect with i felt that amaranth was meant to be that character but you never quite get below the surface with her the book is not just short it's a bit too short it wanted to take on so many big issues that it lost its heart for what is at the heart of this story really it's no one character no one issue or theme it's a broad overall picture that skims over its characters depths to paint their surface and not much else as interested as i am in the topics it touches upon and as interested as i was in the characters it introduced to me it never quite achieved heart and that was a real let down for me my thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book via netgalley","73":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here excellent vacation novel as long as you're like me and like twisted stuff it's not altogether that twisted with a typical polygamous cult escape with the male leader who eventually starts raping his own daughters this is no surprise the surprise comes from the character of the oldest daughter sorrow who is the most interesting character but also the least developed very entertaining","74":"this book was strange but good not really about polygamy as much as it was about cults and the dangers of raising children in them","75":" amity and sorrow tells the story of a family growing up in a cult in utah there is just one man zachariah the fifty women he takes as wives and the more than twenty children he fathers zachariah goes out in search of lost women promising them a safe haven they live off the grid so now one really knows what's going on out there the story is told from the perspective of amaranth she was his first wife saved by zachariah when she was just eighteen and already struggling to survive when zachariah starts accumulating wives she is too afraid of the real world to challenge him time passes zachariah's god complex blooms the ideal world amaranth had escaped to has morphed into a warped world with overly strict rules for the women but none for zachariah amaranth does escape with her two daughters amity and sorrow amity is 12 i'm not sure about sorrow's age she's older than amity but i'm not sure by how much the story follows their attempt to function out in the world this is hard for amaranth but more so for the girls who have been brainwashed to believe zachariah's way is the only way how they adjust is both fascinating and heart breaking the characters were well written i really cared not only about amaranth and her daughters but also about many of the others who are fully realized even as minor characters you'll be left thinking about their stories as well i loved the old man dust and hope a moving thought provoking story i wish i were in a book club to really talk this one out in choosing what shelves to put this on i struggled with worst mother ever but ultimately decided that amaranth was a victim along with her daughters and i just couldn't judge her too harshly","76":"i won a copy of amity u0026amp sorrow a novel by peggy riley in a giveaway for free on goodreads first reads i can't wait to receive my copy of this book yay thank you","77":" the idea was intriguing but it was the opening that captured me a woman driving desperate to escape her past with her two daughters who were much less certain about whether they should go whether they should leave the only home they had ever known amity u0026amp sorrow hbk dark inddafter four days they stopped because and only because amaranth crashed the car she had no money and no idea what to do a local farmer found them he noticed their strange dress their rather old fashioned manners but he didn't comment he didn't want to get involved but he did agree they can stay on his land just for a few days amaranth was fleeing a cult its temple was being destroyed by fire she was the first of the fifty wives of the prophet and mother of two daughters amity and sorrow sorrow has a special place at their temple she was the oracle the one heard and then spoke the word of god amity had no such status but she was good hearted and she had a gift for healing two stories unfold the story of how amaranth became the wife of the prophet and all that followed and the story of how she left and what followed the narrative which moves fluidly between the present and the past and though the story is harrowing it is told with sensitivity and understanding it offers much to think about mother and daughters were pulling in different directions amaranth wanted a new life but couldn't let go of her memories and her old concerns amity wanted to leave the past behind once and for all and all sorrow wanted to go back and stay in the place where she new she belonged amity and sorrow had to cope with a world different to everything they knew they had never spoken with anyone outside the extended family that grew around their father the prophet before they have never handled money never been to school never walked in the country there were so many things that their life had not prepared them for and yet they had such faith in the world that faith was a welcome counter balance to many disturbing truths that would emerged it worked because for all the strangeness of the situation the characters their dialogues and their actions rang completely true the story unfolded slowly growing in depth and complexity and it pulled me in completely i came to understand what had drawn amaranth in to the cult why she had stayed and in the end why she had to leave the style just a little formal a little odd suited the story perfectly and the balance between what was told and what needed to be worked out was exactly right the story asked some difficult questions and the final chapters offered a fitting conclusion but no easy answers but i don't have the words to explain and i don't want to explain if you're at all curious you really should find a copy of this book and consider them too because the words that do come into my mind are these a distinctive and thought provoking first novel","78":"the beautiful writing could not make up for the boring plot","79":"amaranth is on the run with her two teenage daughters amity and sorrow exhausted after driving for days without sleep she crashes the car leaving them stranded help comes in the begrudging form of a farmer bradley who lets them sleep on his porch despite their weird ways for she is running from a cult where she was the first wife among fifty and her daughters have never known anything other than the rule of the father the girls very much reflect their namesakes amity once she has got past the breaking of rules is eager to make friends and wants to help everyone her joyful discovery of the world beyond the confines of the cult lifts the novel from what could be a disturbing tale for sorrow is broken beyond repair older than amity her experience within the cult were different and she is thoroughly brainwashed when we meet her it is during a harrowing scene of a miscarriage in the gas station toilets and whilst it doesn't take long to piece two and two together the extent of her devotion to the man who quite frankly abused her amity is an endearing character and it's her faith in her sister that makes you want things to turn out well for sorrow otherwise her pyromania and unpleasant nature would paint her as evil but they are far more complex than that you can tell amity is torn between thinking for herself and protecting sorrow because everyone's always done what's best for sorrow there's a thing with a kitten which is just awful fair warning to animal lovers and really makes you doubt any hope redemption all the names appear relevant amaranth's significance may not be revealed until the end but hope was certainly a sign of hope within the cult you certainly got a sense that the women looked after each other and the sense of community was not necessarily a bad thing even if the end result turned disastrous although amaranth's guilt is littered through the pages as a mother how did she let this happen to her children when all she wanted was to be saved even the name of bradley's current crop rapeseed is an ominous reminder of what has passed the novel alternates between the present day and the family's time within the cult at first the timescales confused me a little but the past plot line runs in reverse chronological order so it is only at the end where you come to realise amaranth's motivation for joining him it is interesting to see how something escalates in reverse i loved the dynamics on the farm bradley's wife left him and he doesn't have much faith in women but slowly forms a quiet friendship with amaranth despite telling them he wants them gone his father is an unlikely participant in the family's wellbeing bed bound and curmudgeonly but sparking seeds of inspiration in them bradley's adopted son dust is charming and patient with the girls","80":"this one was just too twisted for me also there were only one or two characters that i actually liked skip it","81":"this novel was well written but sort of bleak hard to say i liked it as the subject was a bit disturbing but i did like the writing and i will probably be thinking about it for awhile","82":"very good i would read something from her again","83":" the premise of amity u0026amp sorrow held a lot of appeal to me but ultimately failed to capture my interest i ended up slogging through to the end just to be able to form an educated opinion about the novel there was something about these characters that could not evoke any emotion from me i anticipated that with such uncomfortable subject matter i would feel something anything for their struggles and dilemmas this didn't happen i kept finding myself wishing there was a greater glimpse into the individuals which was not portrayed through the third person narrative the pacing of the story felt simultaneously hurried and sluggish with either too much exposition or not enough all of this said i would be interested in reading the next work by peggy riley there were many places within the story that showed flashes of writing that could be captivating i received this book through netgalley com for review purposes","84":"amaranth the first wife of a fundamentalist cult leader escapes the compound with her two daughters the chapters alternate between flashbacks of her protected life within the cult what made her leave and how she and her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow adapt to life beyond onewhich they are unprepared for in so many ways the emotional scars are apparent as the three struggle through a disturbing and intriguing novel a good book club choice as it would foster alot of conversation","85":"review originally posted on my blog at westmetromommy blogspot com3 0 starsi will admit that the polygamous aspect of this book is what first drew me toward it i have sort of a voyeuristic train wreck fascination with it this book however is not your run of the mill polygamy novel for one thing the polygamist in this book are not flds although the man at the center of it was raised at cross creek instead it is more of an end of days cult in the center is one man his 50 wives and his children in the midst of gunshots and a fire the first wife amaranth flees with her 2 daughters amity the younger of her two daughters is a typical twelve ish aged girl her older sister sorrow is a different story she is the oracle and uses that power to her advantage without a thought of consequences there were many themes in this book but the one i picked up on the most was the bond between these two sisters the plot of this story was fascinating but i felt that the execution did not live up to expectations i'm not sure if it was riley's intent to have the reader feeling that they didn't have a foundation when reading this book but it wasn't a feeling that enhanced the experience of this book part of this may be because it just felt thin in places there needed to be more detail and background in several parts of this book i didn't feel that enough of either to really sink my teeth into this story while this was an interesting book and it showed great potential it just didn't live up to my expectations","86":"i picked this up after reading a review a few months' back many others have summarized the plot so i won't the story is intriguing but the plot isn't believable the farmer is too passive amaranth is too passive particularly given her history i can buy that she was brainwashed but not that she'd give her attention to a man at the expense of her daughters once she escaped her final choice outside the police station is incomprehensible for a mother with a shred of concern for her daughter the pov shifts within chapters particularly towards the end of the book were bothersome some parts were drawn out while others were underdeveloped or rushed the ending doesn't provide closure in this story we needed some","87":"thank you to netgalley for the copy of this novel i tried very hard to like this book but i just couldn't get into either the characters or the story the start was very promising a woman and her two children frantically escaping in a car it held me until the scene in the bathroom with sorrow i going to assume that i didn't care for this book because it dealt with cult like religious fanaticism and the oppression of women it just wasn't my cup of tea on any level","88":"amaranth and her daughters amity and sorrow escape from a polygamous cult and take refuge in oklahoma with a down on his luck farmer i found the writing style difficult and the story a little hard to follow","89":"i think it could've been a little bit shorter and more precise in the end overall i didn't quite feel like i was there in the settings and environments you can feel that it's her debut and that she has a long way to go but there is potential and the book is a tiny bit messed up which makes it bearable if you are interested in a book about a cult i say it's worth a read but i would rather read a non fictional book about the subject","90":" goodreads description a mother and her daughters drive for days without sleep until they crash their car in rural oklahoma the mother amaranth is desperate to get away from someone she's convinced will follow them wherever they go her husband the girls amity and sorrow can't imagine what the world holds outside their father's polygamous compound rescue comes in the unlikely form of bradley a farmer grieving the loss of his wife at first unwelcoming to these strange prayerful women bradley's abiding tolerance gets the best of him and they become a new kind of family an unforgettable story of belief and redemption amity u0026amp sorrow is about the influence of community and learning to stand on your own full review in progress","91":"i won a copy of this thanks to goodreads giveaways this book was intense took a little longer than i expected to get through it but it was very well done i liked the format in between chapters that were explaining what the girls were experiencing on the run you'd get a glimpse into life back where they were be it a flashback from amity or information about wives were chosen not only were amity sorrow and amaranth fleshed out extremely well but so were the secondary characters i'm not sure how i feel about the ending but overall this was a good read","92":"i didn't like this one nearly as much as i thought i would","93":"the only interesting thing about the book is that you feel absolutely nothing for any of the characters so that when bad things happen to them you really could care less i read the book because i bought the book time consuming","94":"two sisters sit side by side in the backseat of an old car amity and sorrow their hands are hot and close together a strip of white fabric loops between them tying them together wrist to wrist in the car there was only driving and darkness the watching of their mother the roads behind them and the sound of her sister sobbing as home stretched away from them mile after mile amaranth leaves home in desperation driving without ceasing to leave behind the polygamous cult in which she has conceived and raised her daughters neither amity nor sorrow has ever known the world outside the compound but amaranth has torn the girls from their home after reaching devastating clarity about its ills a car crash ends their flight and bradley a struggling farmer comes to their aid amity is much as her name implies open to meeting new people excited about this adventure and only intermittently worried about breaking the rules of her father and spiritual leader sorrow on the other hand is bereft her fierce love of her father and her place within the cult as the oracle has been ripped from her by a mother who seems not to understand her grief amaranth though isn't neglectful of her daughters but simply guilt ridden and horrified by the life she led within the compound one of 50 wives amaranth looks back on her life before zachariah the group's leader she recalls the moment she realizes that one two three wives will not be enough for him but she also remembers the love she felt for her sister wives women who became her strength and her solace wrapped up in her own thoughts and her own desire for safety which she suspects she may be able to find in bradley she isn't cognizant of the girls' confusion told from both amaranth and amity's perspective amity u0026amp sorrow is a strange book the time period is even difficult to pin down because of the rural locale and the ignorance of the girls sorrow is by far the least sympathetic character but that's partially because her story is never explored while that narrative choice makes sense in terms of her zeal for the compound perhaps making her narrative a bit off kilter it also restricted her characterization so that she appeared insane less a character than a symbol or victim she becomes instead the sacrificial lamb the deluded child woman unable to make her own decisions or see beyond the cult the book is disturbing in its implications however the distance created by the isolation of the characters and their disconnectedness from one another made for odd but enthralling reading","95":"enjoyed it but the ending is kind of abrupt","96":"weird couldn't get into it trying too hard to be literature and deep and symbolic for me","97":"the tale of two sisters and their mother fleeing from a polygamous cult all of them brainwashed by their father trigger warnings for abuse and incest there is some truly beautiful writing in this book but at times the sheer beauty of the writing seems to actually detract from the powerful story it feels as though too much of the story skims the surface never quite letting the reader into the horror of what happens and has happened to the girls and their mother too much is left unexplored unresolved leaving the whole book feeling unsatisfying for all of its beauty","98":"weird but really good","99":"yawn finished it not because i enjoyed it i just wanted to see what happened at the end","100":" it seems this would make a good book for a book club in reading the reviews most readers liked it very much or despised it it's interesting when a book manages to accomplish that i rated it 4 stars based on it's readability for me it was a captivating read on the other hand i wondered are there really people this disconnected from reality would it really be possible to raise bright children and amity u0026amp sorrow both seem curious and intelligent without letting them know anything about society at all one would think they had heard about the world at least a little from the wives who continued to join the family throughout their childhood would a mother do what amaranth did at the end of this book i don't know then again all the characters including bradley dust and the old man seem to be among the walking wounded with no one really available to help them in any way they find acceptable i'll read other books by peggy riley should she choose to write more","101":"i was waiting for this book to get interesting the whole time i read it and i wish i just gave up at the start to be honest the plot was very slow and never really got anywhere at all and then it was just over making me wonder what on earth i just read the characters were poorly developed and just plain unlikeable a pity the general idea could have interesting","102":"polygamy freaks me out it's not right it doesn't make sense that anyone would agree to do it and make a life of it whenever i see or read about a sister wife i want to shake slap and yell at her wake up you nut job however somehow i was able to get through this book without doing so mainly because the polygamy side of the story was not in your face the story was surrounded more by a wife and her daughters fleeing and finding a way to stay hidden and alive the chapters went back and forth through time starting with present day and moves into the past flipping back and forth it was definitely a good read i finished it in 2 days it was well written and the story of 3 women's struggle to do right by god while trying not to die or kill each other kept me interested i've read some reviews that complain of the story not having a strong female lead that is true but not all females are strong at least not all the time i felt sorry for them most of the time because they didn't feel they had the right to do a lot of regular things and that did attribute to their weakness however the mother did leave in the first place doesn't that show strength","103":"an interesting story of a polygamist cult coming apart wife one escapes with two daughters i the resting insight to the manipulation of vulnerable women by one man little care for how their lifestyle affected their children they don't know how to read or even where they live if you control the information you can control the masses well written","104":" amity u0026amp sorrow is a books one finds themselves sucked into just by the sheer strangeness of its setting a self declared prophet zechariah and his 50 yes 50 wives and their children live as one large family waiting and preparing for the ultimate rapture zechariah peaches is soon to come it isn't until events take a strange twist affecting the first wife amaranth's first daughter that amaranth begins to see zechariah for what he is and envision a different life for her daughters amaranth flees with her daughters and finds herself in oklahoma after crashing her car a farmer takes her in and a new kind of family is imagined at times i found the book engaging and at others i was disappointed by the plot sequence had i known how this book would end i don't think i would have taken the journey something about this story just makes me feel like the author is trying too hard","105":"an interesting read to say the least the brainwashed cult induced mindset of these girls was bizarre tended to be critical of their mother's behavior at times but had to remind myself that she was coming from a twisted way of thought as well all in all i wasn't particularly moved by their story i think the writing style might have had something to do with that but it was definitely a peculiar read that i felt compelled to see to the end","106":"i probably don't deserve to rate it or review it as i didn't finish but it was so weird and screwy it just wasn't what i wanted to spend time on finishing there was a sort of poetic way to her writing that was definitely interesting but two thumbs down here for what i did read just because it was so unclear and odd","107":"an intense rich and harrowing novel all the more remarkable for being a debut review to follow shortly on www forwinternights wordpress com","108":"this often left me puzzled trying to figure out what i thought of this book definitely thought provoking but not something i would recommend is my gut feeling","109":"this bk could of been so good the premise was interesting and a cult storyline always reels me in and yet so much was wrong and totally unbelievable felt no connection to any of the characters the amount of crap that bradley tolerated had me wondering if he was special or not the greatest part could of been gettin' me to understand or sympathize with the mom on why she joined and stayed with such a cult but we get a big fat failure with that as well all i can say is if this plot would of been put in the hands of a better writer it could of been greatness","110":"although this book was beautifully written it did not sit well with me i don't think it's fair that i'm giving it 3 stars simply because i didn't like the subject matter or enjoy the story but hey this is my review so it's perfectly acceptable","111":"i was very lucky to come across a paperback proof of amity and sorrow just a week or so after it had been published i had already seen a great review of it elsewhere and knew i wanted to read it it starts with a car journey a woman and her two not quite teenage daughters are in the car they have been driving for four days the mother amaranth has taken her daughters to flee - running away from the only life they have ever known that life was as part of a polygamous cult amaranth the first and only legal wife among fifty her husband the father of her daughters amity and sorrow was the leader of the cult the founder of their temple which just days earlier was engulfed in fire sorrow is the elder daughter her place within the cult unique she is an oracle and her sister amity has a gift for healing these girls are ignorant of the modern world never having seen tv or computers they can't read or write their father and the life they have always lived has deliberately kept the world at bay when amaranth stops it is only because she has crashed the car they are in oklahoma - surrounded by dusty rain starved fields \"four days and the seasons have changed around them the dirty ends of snow from home melting and running to make rivers mountains flattening to make plain land then fields four days amity had been tied to her sister to keep her from running until the car hit a tree and spun over a stump and amity took the strap off and sorrow flew out of the car and ran the sky is spinning orange when the man comes out from his fields dirt rides in on his overalls spills down from his turned up hems his every step scatters it like seeds \"hey\" he calls to amity and he raises his hand to wave \"the man who comes out of the fields is bradley - a struggling farmer with a small gas station having once been left by a wife - he has no interest in amaranth and her story though not really wanting to get involved he allows them to stay on his land the three take up residence on his porch amaranth nervous of venturing into the house living with bradley is dust a young mexican boy who bradley cares for as if he were his own son while upstairs is bradley's father whose bible is a first edition of the grapes of wrath you ever heard of a mr john steinbeck the devil says no sir dumb and ignorant to boot this ain't no bible this here book is the grapes of wrath you heard of that not exactly either you has or you hasn't god the father says that anyone worshiping the beast will receive a mark on her forehead and drink the wine of god's wrath and that must be pressed from his grapes of wrath sir well says the devil maybe you ain't entirely dumb just mostly you all are dumb for god ain't you amity nods she supposes they must be she could hardly hope to keep a thing like that from the devil amity tentatively gets to know dust and keeps sorrow's secrets sorrow is enraged at being taken from her home badly damaged her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic as she is determined to get back whatever it takes amaranth plunders bradley's store of food and seed making food to nourish her daughters and planting unknown seeds in the parched ground in hope slowly bradley and amaranth find a new level and over the course of the novel the story of how amaranth came to marry the man she shared with the wives who followed her and how and why she came to flee is revealed the story is often a dark disturbing one as the truths are revealed this is a story of fundamentalism faith and redemption peggy riley's writing suits this enormously memorable story perfectly a pared down and quirky style matching the strange other worldliness of the sisters with their caps long dresses and clogs most of the story is seen through the eyes of young amity - who has only known the life her mother has taken her away from yet she is ready to experience the new world she finds herself in unlike her sister however amity has a fierce and touching loyalty to her sister and is desperate to save her i adored the character of amity her wonder at the tv and her search for \"the house of the grapes of wrath\" the library i found hugely poignant i also loved the character of bradley's father who starts to teach amity to read there are themes in this novel which may not sit well with everyone but i found it an enthralling and unusual novel well written and powerfully told with deceptive simplicity amity and sorrow is a remarkable first novel and i look forward to reading more by her","112":" damn this is a good book hard to read in some ways because it's the story of two girls and their mother who fled the literally burning temple of their cult ran as far as the mother could take them and washed up somewhere in oklahoma because the story is told from the inside the education of the girls doesn't include reading the story of the history of the cult the polygamous family that it constituted unfolds from their perspective slowly hard to read because they believe so hard and that belief is fundamentally corrupted at its very heart and you know it reading from the outside anyway damn good book very good book","113":" this book tells the story of amaranth and her two daughters amity and sorrow who are escaping from life with a father who is the polygamist head of a cult their car crashes after a four day drive they don't know where they are and the girls have never been a part of the current world the story focuses on their survival amaranth's reintroduction to life in a non cult world and the very different ways amity and sorrow deal with their new reality the story fluctuates from past to present the voice changes from amaranth to amity it is fairly interesting dealing with life in a cult in a pretty superficial manner this was an entertaining quick read","114":"this entire book was meh it didn't catch my attention whatsoever and i feel like i just wasted the three hours i spent reading it i do not recommend it","115":"really mixed on this one it started well enough but then went painfully off track","116":"'thanks to goodreads and peggy riley for my copy of amity and sorrow i could not get into this book the writing style was difficult to understand and enjoy i could not recommend this book","117":"meh this book was okay i guess i just never connected with any of the characters and i kept wanting more to happen and the writing was really jarring i can see how some people would love it but it just didn't strike that chord with me","118":"this story is just to depressing","119":" amity and sorrow are two very strange girls who along with their mother crash their car into a lake on the property of a farmer rescued by this rough farmer and his friends the little family makes camp on the farmer's porch refusing to enter the house why the girls' father and cult leader taught that entering the house of a man is sinful why have they left the cult a scandal a unforeseen disaster rips the cult apart and the mother grabs her unwilling daughters and flees her husband and many sister wives tying her daughters' wrists together with a ribbon to keep them together this story rolls out in various whys and will theys narrated in a style reminiscent of tobacco road and the grapes of wrath not without a dry humor my favorite part of the book was the dialog between two child stars of different religious sects arguing over whose religion was real and whose was of the devil if you are interested in human behavior cults and a really good writing style check this book out","120":"the book starts slowly with some very self conscious writing as if the author were taking spare to a level where the narrative lost focus the first third of the book feels uncertain like this even imitative hemingway until it develops a voice a purpose and a storyline and then it's a tale worth pursuing as the reader decides oh yeah i do want to know what happened before how these people came to be and what will happen next the centerpiece character is sorrow it takes a while to figure out why sorrow is always the center of attention the instigator the person around whom the action evolves by the end of the book it becomes clear why some lives are just too damaged to salvage a good first novel about a compelling subject","121":" if she never tells him he will never really know them amaranth has taken her daughters and run run from a man with fifty wives a man who believes he is god a man who has done unspeakable things to their daughter when she stops she must decide where her future lies in the now strange world in which she finds herself the picture painted by two sisters bound together by a thin strip of white fabric is a powerful image and an appropriate opening to this novel written in an unusual writing style the strong emotions felt by these characters was very vividly portrayed the novel occasionally tended toward the sensationalist and at times felt overdone but even those scenes packed a sincere emotional punch while amity is excited by this world in which her path is not mapped out for her sorrow cannot accept a world in which she is not special or chosen by god for important work their conflict with each other with their mother and with the larger world is a striking one and the reader can feel the sadness and the anger these two girls feel as they try to find their place i found the ending disappointing but i'm not sure why was i hoping for a more solid resolution or simply a different end i'm not sure overall i'd say that the book was good but not great and i don't think i'd be giving it glowing recommendations to my friends","122":" whilst i enjoyed this debut novel by peggy riley and can see the similarities that have been made regarding it being like the witness meets the lovely bones i was left wanting more i rated it 7 10 so on here it gets a 3 star it's hard writing a review without giving out too many spoilers the author handles the subject matter well despite it being deep at times and i found the writing quite engaging once you'd got into the writing style it moves seamlessly between the present and the past revealing a little more about the past life of amity and sorrow and their mother amaranth as we meet amity sorrow and amaranth they have fled a very unusual life as members of a cult that was formed by their father amaranth's husband events have taken place that we learn about as the story evolves that have forced them to flee will the two sisters cope with life outside the cult as they haven't known anything else i liked the way the story developed and the relationships between the characters my only criticism was that i thought the story ended rather abruptly and had to read the last chapter or so again to see if i'd missed something i will look out for further books by this writer i would like to thank netgalley for sending me this to review","123":"i expected a little more from the mother in the story since she saw the disconnects in their lifestyle long before the fire bradley turns out to be a better man than aranmatha deserved to find when she crashed her car sorrow definitely needed counseling well they all 3 did but it didn't turn out that way","124":"i'm not sure what i thought of this book quite disturbing and sad to realise what situations a set of rules perceived by vulnerable followers to be a religion can create","125":"beautifully u0026amp sparsely written the details of amaranth's life story unfolds in tantalizingly small flashbacks filling in the horrific details that the reader has probably already begun to suspect with dread i don't really know what to make of this book or its resolution still processing","126":" a mother and two daughters escape from an isolated polygamous cult similar to the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints in this church one man has 50 wives with children from all the wives it is interesting to read about the first wife who led a sad but relatively normal life before she married didn't she see how insane the cult that she and her husband created was it is also interesting to read how they created all these bizarre rules to keep the wives and children completed secluded it is this first wife that runs away her elder daughter is adamant to return to the father the younger daughter enjoys this new world but is confused as she should be she has never seen a tv or radio or anything from the outside her church's compound when the younger sister narrates she is written as if she is an align from another planet think of the boy from the novel \"room \" riley has authored a very well written book that just didn't grab me","127":"a woman escapes from a polygamous cult where her husband whom she shares with 49 other women is a god like figure and young girls are kept uneducated the details of commune life and the mind control underway there are interesting albeit disturbing but the conclusion of the book was too far fetched for me to buy into it","128":"a mother and her two teenage daughters escapea cult and start over","129":" at a slow and deliberate pace this book unfolds as amaranth flees with her two daughters from a polygamous cult amity and sorrow are tied together with a white band to keep sorrow from running away when amaranth crashes her car due to extreme exhaustion they are rescued by bradley and his ward dust raised in a small town and sucked into the cult when she married amaranth was the first wife her daughter sorrow is the oracle who speaks the word of god to the followers pregnant by her father sorrow suffers a miscarriage after the accident bradley's wife has left him alone on their farm in rural oklahoma amity is stuck between her sister and her mother wanting to please both of them amaranth is driven by desperation to escape and sorrow only wants to return to the only life she has ever known avery disturbing look at a life few people can imagine lovely languid language with a feel of older times","130":"i really wanted to like this and did appreciate the way it was written and constructed but i struggled to identify or feel concern for any of the characters and felt quite adrift at times reading a story i did not really care about bit of a shame this one","131":"this was just a bit creepy for me mostly interesting story about a cult leader u0026amp his multiple wives children but felt both physically and emotionally dirty at times setting was drought dust bowl farm in maybe texas emotionally because of relationship between father u0026amp daughter not one of my favs","132":"amity u0026amp sorrow propels readers through the collision of a lonely farmer and a woman on the run from a failed communal experiment--her fearful and reluctant teenage daughters in tow riley deftly explores the bonds and boundaries of love faith and responsibility when passionate and well intentioned ideals stray far from their origins in this emotionally fraught debut","133":"i received this book through a goodreads giveaway at first i was not sure it was really my kind of book but after reading it i'm really glad i won the giveaway this story is about two sisters and their mother running away from their previous life in a very strange home each responds differently to their situation and the outside normal world the author peggy riley brings their odd world to life through going back and forth to the past and present as well as switching from the mother's to the daughter's points of view this method of writing could very well be confusing or could endanger the stability and movement of the plot but riley maneuvers through this with skillful creativity to create a full and potent world with round characters the pace is quick and interesting as she reveals bits and pieces of their life in the polygamous compound as the story progresses the faith of these women is fascinating yet disturbing i gave it three stars mainly because the ending was disappointing to me and i never found that i really liked any of the characters but overall i really enjoyed the story and the rich background very well written","134":"not my usual style of read but i liked this the writing was lyrical and the subject was fascinating","135":"the fire that sets this story in motion flames through \"amity and sorrow\" in every cleverly crafted scene it is a dark story about sisters who grew up in what might be considered by some a cult atmosphere in desperation their mother amaranth snatches them away terrified by escalating threats from outside and unsettling changes from within their flight is interrupted when in utter exhaustion she crashes her car into a tree miraculously none of the three are seriously injured and are rescued by a farmer who reluctantly and with bad grace befriends them the story travels back and forth from the uncertain present into a disturbing past amity and sorrow are bound together by more than the strap that links them and keeps sorrow from running back to the only home she has ever known despite threats that await her \"amity and sorrow\" follows amaranth whose trust has been betrayed by the man she believes loves only her and looks at the \"perfect\" world created by this man who through polygamy takes advantage of the broken and shattered lives of women with no place to go his two daughters are caught in the middle with no understanding of what life outside the community is like there is a touch of mysticism harsh lessons in how religion can corrupt and be corrupted and a wrenching coming of age story the strict and structured world as amity and sorrow knew it is nothing like the farm where their mother insists they take refuge there is more at work in the lives of these girls than their mother knows her only hope of saving them is to keep them away from the man who is their father their multiple layers of conservative clothing prim aprons and cap covered hair cannot protect them from what lies ahead this is a fascinating tale of a mother's love renewal and the power of the mind to create what it will amity and sorrow are at the mercy of a dangerous past they can relate to and a future they fear riley's scenes are gripping and visual and her character development is powerful author peggy riley is a writer and playwright who lives on the north kent coast \"amity and sorrow\" is her first novel","136":"read over 100 pages and didn't look forward to picking it up i think it could have been good telling more about the back story of their lives prior to escaping with more detail i was more interested in that than in reading about their present place i had to give it up","137":" amaranth has been driving for 4 days and 4 nights when she finally crashes the car she has been driving for 4 days and 4 nights with her two young daughters amity and sorrow on the back seat the two girls bound together by a strip of white cloth around each of their wrists amaranth has fled her husband and her family - the religious compound where they lived the first wife and the original wife however one wife wasn't enough for her preacher husband zachariah he took more and more wives until amaranth was one of fifty a hundred mouths to feed clothe and provide warmth and shelter for and her husband away preaching for months always returning always returning with another woman to take as another bride from far and wide they came seeking solace seeking redemption for the end which they all believe is coming amaranth has birthed and raised her two daughters in the compound it is all they have ever known when she rips them from it they are confused frightened the world outside is foreign to them they do not know how to behave their simple ways do not prepare them for the ways of others sorrow in particular is devastated to have left as her father's favourite as the oracle of the compound she believes that she will be the vessel for the new jesus but amaranth has finally found something that she can't ignore something that horrifies her so much that she has packed up her girls and fled when she crashes the car reclusive farmer bradley comes to their aid although at first he doesn't want them there and they don't want to be there it soon seems that they have little choice everything amaranth had carefully stockpiled for the car is gone and she has little money she helps out on bradley's farm tending the garden cooking him food she sees the possibility of safety even as she struggles to find a way in which to help amity and sorrow adjust to their new surroundings amity is fiercely devoted to her sister would do anything for her and all sorrow wants to do is get home i have to admit i'm fascinated by the polygamous culture i've read numerous books both fiction and non i've watched tv shows including that incredibly obnoxious reality tv series sister wives and documentaries i've often joked about wanting a sister wife - preferably one who cooked and cleaned but the reality is that these situations often seem idyllic the women will tell you that they're idyllic and that they love their sister wives which they may well do but the reality is generally that it is anything but amaranth is the first wife and she assumed she would be the only wife but as the voice of god spoke more and more to her husband it seemed that god intended for him to take many wives and amaranth despite loving some maybe even all of her sister wives still struggles with the fact that her husband always desires more 1 2 3 wives were not enough 20 wives were not enough even 30 wives were not enough but it is who she suspects that zachariah intends to make his 51st wife that causes her to run although we get glimpses of life on the compound in flashbacks the book is really about amaranth's strength in escaping even though she has known little else even though her girls have known nothing else she packs them up and she drives they don't know what tv is they believed they're banned from fields and the houses of other men they don't know how to relate to people in the street wearing shirts and shorts when they wear layer upon layer of clothing including cloth caps to cover their heads sorrow in particular is completely out of her comfort zone as her father's treasured daughter the respected oracle the vessel although i could sympathise particularly with amity i did have trouble expressing as much sympathy as i should for sorrow she was terribly abused and no one ever deserves the kind of brainwashing she went through to alter her thinking so terribly but she was a hard person to really feel for she's so unlikable so horrible to those around her her mother and amity who she hates for taking her away from what she knows and believes in i think that it's probably very real quite authentic for how a child could feel having been ripped from all they know but it made scenes with her very difficult to read i wanted to help her but not in the passive way that amaranth was i wanted to get her proper help but perhaps in being off the grid so long amaranth was too frightened to get back on she was terrified her husband would come after them would track them down and so they stayed on the farm until the situation reached dangerous boiling point i know that it probably took her all her courage to leave to get them away but you can't do that and then not do anything else they had no idea where they were why they were really there and what was going to happen next hiding them away and pretending that everything would be okay now because they were no longer on the compound wasn't going to work especially when sorrow was so desperate to get back there and become the only thing that she thought gave herself any validation as much as i wanted to like this book i just couldn't there were so many things that i felt should've been included it felt too short and the scenes between amaranth and bradley the farmer to abrupt the development could've been there if the author had taken it a little slower and let it come about gradually instead of rushing it","138":"we all battle what we believe to be true with people who disagree with us if you get a group in a room and show them a vase of flowers give them paints and canvas tell them to paint what they see every picture will be different this is a story of things as the characters see them i really enjoyed it chapter one had me wondering if i could even read it but keep reading and you will get sucked in","139":"finished this because of book club but i can't really think of anything positive to say about it other than the fact that it was relatively short the story was all over the place and that made it difficult to connect to any of the characters actually i found that i disliked almost all of them the premise of an escape from a polygamous cult seemed unique and interesting but the execution was incredibly dull at one point i was actually rooting for the rapture to come so the book would finally get good but spoiler alert it never did","140":"runaway from cult novel had issues with writing mother well developed girls not so much one of those few books that i would have liked to have been told with multiple narrators still it wasn't a bad read at least it was fast","141":" two sisters sit side by side in the backseat of an old car amity and sorrow two sisters tied together on a journey from all they know driving is their mother running from a life that is not first clear as the story continues i was drawn into a story of amaranth and her 2 daughters she is the 1st of 50 wives of a self proclaimed god who will bring the end of the world the story is riveting even with the bouncing back and forth between mom the sisters and pre history information i found myself fascinated like a moth to a flame i was flabbergasted at how naive amity was and how debase sorrow was their mother seems to have thrown off her previous life and morals as the story goes i found myself disgusted at what i was reading but still totally gripped by the story the ending left me horribly disgusted and i'm glad this is only a novel the sad thing is that this can be a true story and that leaves me sickened this is definitely not a story i would recommend to my christian conservative friends i felt like i had to wash my brain after reading it it has a few sex scenes a miscarriage by a teenager impregenated by her father who believes she's given birth to jesus christ sadistic actions by said teenager fire and deceit the shining star of this story is amity although in the end i am saddened by how easily she was brainwashed by her psychotic sister and father despite my personal moral issue with the contents this is an incredible written psychological novel peggy has portrayed the level of control that keeps women in these type of marriage relationships the naivety of the children is heartbreaking the lack of understanding that the one daughter was clearly mentally insane and in need of mental care was disheartening as was the lack of notifying the authorities of rape of a minor by her father it is truly riveting and if you can stomach all those things i'd recommend it","142":" amity u0026amp sorrow by peggy rileythank you to netgalley for my advance reading copy release date february 11 2014 i have to admit i didn't look closely enough at the cover of this book before i selected it the cover is a big draw for me so that would be highly unusual based on the title i figured this was a story about sisters and i like to read about sisters since i have two of my own family dynamics can be interesting i started to read and thought what did i get myself in to ' but then i couldn't stop reading amity and sorrow are sisters raised in a religious cult their father zachariah and leader of the cult has proclaimed himself god amaranth the children's mother leashed the girls together at the wrist packed them in a stolen car and started driving in order to escape they end up on bradley's failing farm somewhere in oklahoma when she crashes the vehicle into a tree a new world they have been sheltered from opens up in different ways for each of them i don't want to reveal any more of this story because i love to read a book that surprises me amity u0026amp sorrow revealed something unexpected on each turn of the page the author tells this emotional story by moving from the present to the past and back again the characters were full of emotion each having processed life in the cult in a different way riley expertly broke down the rules followed in the restricted cult by exposing the sisters to books television and a way of life they knew nothing about amity u0026amp sorrow pulled me in and never let go i was so invested in this story i didn't want it to end this is not the kind of storyline i would choose to read but the author brought it to life for me in a highly creative way brilliant","143":"interesting subject matter but not really my cup of tea","144":"absolutely hated it found nothing engaging in any of the main characters","145":"this book was a really interesting story there were places where the story was a bit convoluted but overall easy read with interesting characters and backgrounds","146":"wow i have got to go to the library without my reading glasses more often this was a great book with some amazingly complex characters i like it a lot and snarfed up the entire thing in an afternoon of reading i would read anything the author writes","147":" the devout and the devilish they take centre stage in this tale which characters fit that description would not be hard to surmise once completing this story amity and sorrow two sisters born into a family that consists of many mothers and one father this was a really engrossing tale the narrative has you really in the tale with the right words usage and just the right

these children trapped and unaware of knowledge being played against them in their naivete you will want to follow them to the end can she convince her daughters of the sin that their father represents or will she loose them to him out of their love for the chosen one there are some humorous moments in the story for example due the two girls finding themselves for the first time amongst civilization they know not of tv and books and in this story their is one scene where amity is advised on a book to read read her reaction to this in this excerpt you ever heard of a mr john steinbeck the devil says no sir dumb and ignorant to boot this ain't no bible this here book is the grapes of wrath you heard of that not exactly either you has or you hasn't god the father says that anyone worshiping the beast will receive a mark on her forehead and drink the wine of god's wrath and that must be pressed from his grapes of wrath sir well says the devil maybe you ain't entirely dumb just mostly you all are dumb for god ain't you amity nods she supposes they must be she could hardly hope to keep a thing like that from the devil there are times when this novel takes me back into remembering that great story wise blood by flannery o'connor this story was written with a great fluid prose style that fits the whole pace and events an excellent debut that made me feel part of the drama in the characters shoes one story and many memorable characters to remain in ones heart and mind for many a day when they reach the house the three females fear it not for the look of the place a gap toothed rough hewn clapboard two story painted white a long long time ago not for the four windows up and down dark and empty as sockets not for the porch that sags beneath it or the old scabby tree that grows to the side of it branches arching over to smother the roof they would fear any house when the man pulls open a screen door it groans on its hinges when he pushes in the front door so

voice loud and clear i have come for your grapes of wrath review also @ http more2read com review amity sorrow a novel by peggy riley","148":"at the beginning of the novel amity u0026amp sorrow find theirselves being taken away from everything they know they spent their whole lives on the compound with their multiple mothers brothers and sisters and father one night during a raid a fire consumes their compound and in the chaos amaranth takes her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow away and drives for four days with little to no rest or food and crashes into a tree in oklahoma the farmer who owns the land bradley gains three squatters who become lodgers who turns his world upside down as well as amaranth's amity's and sorrow's own lives the novel is told both in present how their past affects their present life and past flashes of the past tense how it led to their escape i had a hard time with the ending of the novel and amaranth view spoiler leaving sorrow there and not telling the police hide spoiler and that's why i gave this novel three stars this novel can be difficult to read at times there were several instances when i wanted to grab their faces especially sorrow's and shake sense into them they were truly sheltered ignorant and naive which made for a sad read i received this novel from goodreads firstreads","149":"i enjoyed this book until the end when the whole thing felt more and more scattered","150":" i liked the concept of this book a mother from a fundamentalist cult runs with her 2 daughters u0026amp they confront the differences between their previous held beliefs u0026amp the modern world overall i did like this book though i wish there had been more character development i wanted to know what would happen to them but i didn't know the characters well enough to care a lot it is a 1st novel so i'm sure this will be addressed in future books the story u0026amp the themes are there so i know the characters will grow deeper with time","151":"i was engrossed in this book completely the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i felt rushed towards the end of the book and got a little lost in the climax of the story no spoilers but yeah i hate a rushed wrap it up conclusion","152":" despite being a relatively short novel it took me a while to read it can it be the subject matter the style of writing or the fact that i was reading it on my kindle app most likely it was the combination of all three i was asked to review this book by netgalley as thrilling as it is to review a book it comes with a certain pressure at least in my mind i feel like a i have to finish a book b i have to like it and c i have to gather my thoughts to write a decent review it's not always easy i found that i couldn't identify with amaranth at all i couldn't bring myself to like her or to even care for her i felt a lot of anger towards her she chose her life on her own accord but her children didn't she and her husband the prophet fed them lies forced them to obey the most ridiculous rules and yet she gets annoyed when amity and sorrow can't just turn all those rules off when it's convinient for her the writing style was a little difficult to get accustomed to at first but eventually the words were flowing very easy","153":"an absorbing read i couldn't put it down","154":"a book i definitely recommend for a million reasons full review here http theselittlewords com 2012 12 0","155":"the writing style made me want to scream though others may enjoy it the subject matter made me want to vomit apparently fundamentalist polygamous cults are not for me big ol 'blech '","156":"wasn't what i expected took longer than usual for me to read","157":"two sisters sit side by side in the backseat of an old car amity and sorrow their hands are hot and close together a strip of white fabric loops between them tying them together wrist to wrist this was a beautifully written debut novel about the ties that bind it's a story of god sex and farming amaranth and her two daughters amity and sorrow flees from a religious sect where she was the first of 50 wives to zachariah a self proclaimed prophet they end up in rural oklahoma where they live on a farmer's porch through flashbacks we also find out how amaranth got involved in the sect and how things slowly started falling apart to the point where they find out that sorrow is pregnant although this is an easy read it is quite a complex book it focuses on so many different issues for me the individual issues were the ones that really affected me as a child it must be so difficult to condemn a way of living if this is the only life you've ever lived what about if you were an oracle very special and revered in your previous life and now people expect you to be happy with being a normal teenager and the thing is you can't even act like your normal because you're illiterate and know nothing at all about the world and worst of all your father the mouthpiece of god is suddenly seen as worse than evil there is so much more to say but i think the author says it best i highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys a story that stays with you long after you've closed the book not everyone wants to be saved netgalley copy","158":" i can see why people didn't like this novel not a lot happens in it really and the backstory is minimal and produces more loose ends than it ties up the power of this book comes from the tangled relationships and the harsh setting on the failing farm in oklahoma the characters are flawed and are held together only by their own personal demons except amity her innocence and naivety are for me wonderfully crafted by peggy riley amity is i would say the most likeable character and sustains the novel in what would otherwise be a lot of misery the lack of insight into the cult itself is both a little irritating and really well done perhaps it's not necessary for us to know the ins and outs of all involved but instead form our own ideas of the life they shared i would have liked to know more about hope and the father but that's a preference for me overall very interesting reading from an interesting author and i look forward to seeing what else riley produces","159":"couldn't put it down but i didn't like it i didn't understand it until i read the last chapter that explained more about cults then i was able to reflect back on the book and better understand how completely screwed up amaranth was by the cult","160":"props to ms riley for something completely different a woman on the run from a cult with her two teen we assume there's no much detail at first daughters ends up wrecking her car on a farm in oklahoma inhabited by a curmudgeon his curmudgeonly father and his foster son it's well written with a fairly straight forward narrative some flashbacks to set the stage but the story is strange suspenseful and you really have to set your disbelief aside for the duration it's weird i'd read another from this author","161":"this was a gut wrenching read it really pulled at your heart you feel for the children who grew up in the cult and what they became you feel a lot of anger at the adults pity and a little hope in the people of bradley and dust and even bradley's father it is well written and would be great for a book discussion","162":"an interesting read but one that left me feeling a bit cold i thought it was fascinating reading about how people get involved in these cult type activities and how her daughters both believed it was normal it was also interesting reading how difficult it was for them all to adjust to life outside their church however there were certain plot points that confused me firstly i found it fairly unbelievable that the farmer would take them in without contacting the police or finding out more when it was obvious something terrible had happened to them the main problem i had with this book was the ending leaving her daughter behind with her husband was something i did not understand at all and seemed cold heartless and totally out of sync with the rest of the plot i did enjoy it but the ending spoiled the book for me","163":"this is an extraordinary book a compelling and poignant story of three women attempting to escape the controlling presence of a cult leader it is beautifully written and i felt part of their struggle from the outset at times harrowing and a thought provoking read i would highly recommend it","164":"looks like inspirational fiction reads like horror this is an interesting look at the idea of cults and family it also focuses on the way that women in particular build their worlds around them social physical emotional etc there is far more going on in this book than should actually be contained within 308 pages it is most certainly ambitious i've noted some people complaining about the style of the author's prose and i simply don't agree i haven't read a full novel more quickly than i read through this one 2 hours it was interesting accessible and emotionally violent it is far darker than the cover can even hope to convey","165":" a lot of this novel is dialogue so it was a quick read i read it in a single day it was fascinating to read about a cult what draws people in why they stay why some members choose to leave the thought of incest however sickens me so while there are some redeeming parts to this novel i can't get past that taboo that is broken in this story blind faith as we learn from the character of sorrow can be a scary thing not sure what more i can say don't think i can recommend it very disturbing","166":" i was completely captivated by this story a complex emotional novel about a mother who flees with her daughters from a polygamous community i now totally understand how someone can believe so much that what they are doing is right belief is a powerful thing that can make ties unbreakable the novel starts with amaranth amity and sorrow running from their past but through flashbacks we see their lives from the start we learn how something with good intentions and love and faith became so horrible and twisted that amaranth risks everything to remove her daughters from the only way of life they know fast paced and emotionally charged i love that i could feel amitys confusion and longing for her sister amaranths struggle to decide which life she will lead and sorrows unwavering belief","167":"ughgood idea for a story that never seemed to materialize not my cup of tea","168":"i was drawn in from the very first chapter an interesting story that addresses beliefs and how people will let them change and teach them to others and consequences for actions i look forward to other works by this author","169":"i received this as one of my goodreads firstreads win this book was disturbing yet intriguing i wasn't quite sure if i would like this story or not but i did find myself wanting to find out what would happen to amaranth sorrow and amity this was a quick read for me and the story flowed rather well the characters were well developed and their struggle and plight reached me","170":"depressing and confusing wont make it until the end giving up at p93","171":"though i can appreciate the good writing style i found the subject matter to be weird somewhat disturbing and at times inappropriate to be fair i only read a quarter of it before skimming the remainder of it the writing was almost poetic and very descriptive just not a book i was enjoying i wanted to find out what happened therefore the skimming for the story line but felt like it was wasting my time to continue reading in detail","172":"i'm not going to spend a lot of time writing a review on this book because frankly it wasn't that good the writing wasn't bad but the story line was a complete disaster it was about a woman and her two daughters running from a cult but boy are they messed up it was very disturbing and i do not recommend it 2 5 stars","173":" i stumbled on this at the library and was intrigued it is a short quick read that lacks depth but does give you a look at a polygamous compound centered on one man with fifty fives and their assorted children it is chilling to think that this does happen in our country and that there are people so desperate for love or family or belonging that they will suspend logic and enter into a relationship like this what is even more chilling is that it is almost impossible to leave for a variety of reasons","174":"'she has had to run far and fast to pull herself loose from him to rip those stitches but still she can feel how bound she is 'amity and sorrow are sisters and we meet them as they are on the run with their mother amaranth from their home which is now on fire it was the only place the two of them have ever known they know nothing of the outside world their mother has driven for four days solid in a desperate bid to escape the life she has been living to take them away from her husband their father and the polygamous cult that they have grown up in when they come to a stop crashing the car at a gas station in the oklahoma countryside feeling scared and hungry they meet bradley a farmer who is sad and lonely with his own life no longer with him and although he is initially suspicious of the three women with their unusual clothing and though he is not overly welcoming at first he does offer them hope and a place to stay the sisters react in contrasting ways to this dramatic change in their lives whilst amity enjoys her newfound freedom and all the things she is discovering sorrow wants nothing other than to return home to her father interspersed amongst the main narrative recounting what happened to the three women having escaped are several chapters recalling events before they left the cult so we gradually learn how life was there amaranth the first of fifty wives and we begin to understand her motives as the past slowly unfolds to us and reveals its secrets this is a captivating story that drew me in i felt compelled to read on and discover what had lain behind amaranth's choice to be part of the cult and to find out how the sisters would react to this whole new world that they were suddenly exposed to the relatively short chapters of episodes in their lives encouraged me to keep reading on and not put the book down i was convinced by the contrast between the sisters it is only possible to try and imagine their lives in the cult for anyone who has never been part of such a thing yet i believed in both their reactions sorrow wanting to get back there missing all that she has known and believed in and been a key part of and yet also amity embracing the new aspects of life offered to her now so much that is unknown this felt to me like a highly original story with characters that i grew to understand and care about more deeply as i read on it's also a story that made me think and ponder the different lifestyles people lead and the difficult choices people make i liked the structure and pace of the story and i would very much recommend this fascinating debut novel to others","175":" a disturbing book about life in a polygamist cult but written with a great deal of thought i started out wanting to dislike the characters for not doing enough to get themselves out of a terrible situation but as the story unfolds i realized how their responses to everything in life were dictated by their full immersion in their environment just living in a cult would tend to make you a bit mentally disturbed what is your reality when someone else controls everything around you kind of reminds me of the book room i liked this book quite a bit it gets an 8 on my 10 scale","176":" i have mixed feelings about this book let me start with what i liked 1 peggy riley's writing is beautiful love her style spare yet stunning a hard balance to achieve really enjoyed the descriptions the sense of place 2 the story is very original and compelling it drew me in from the first page and i wanted to know what happened next 3 i liked bradley the farmer his father the old man and his interactions with amity and sorrow especially with amity i adored dust and amity i even understood where sorrow was coming from even though she is not a character one likes what i did not like amaranth the main character i loathed her could not forgive her her neglect of her children i could at a stretch understand why she neglected them in the beginning when she was still with her husband but later when she had left when she had all that time on her hands time she spent with the farmer when her daughters needed her that i couldn't get past i was angry with her and kept on reading hoping she would come through protect her daughters in the end the other thing i thought was not properly explained was why she was afraid of her husband i was ranting as i read to the point that my daughter asked me to stop reading the book then if i hated it so much but i needed to see it through so i suppose in all this book did arouse strong emotions made me think so if the author's intention was to incite an opinion from the reader she has succeeded","177":"this will be a popular mainstream book it has themes of god sex and farming a bit of a holy trinity in terms of light novels a generally enjoyable read but too light for me liking i felt that characters and scenes could have benefited with being worked up further and at times i found the writing style a bit twee for my tastes not a story i greatly bought into but an engaging read non the less i also interviewed the author for a blog tour and found her answers to the questions i asked made me like the book more there was something deeper in her speaking about the work than the work itself http booksellersnz wordpress com 20 i'm sure this book will be well received and will well widely","178":" amity u0026amp sorrow isn't a book i'd normally read so i wasn't quite sure what to expect the beginning certainly grabs you amaranth crashes the car after four days of driving with no rest sorrow her eldest daughter has locked herself into the public toilet and won't come out when they break down the door there is blood everywhere the book is divided into months may to july with occasional flashback chapters after it becomes clear that the car can't be fixed and amaranth has no means to travel further the farmer of the land they crashed on agrees to let them stay despite the opening amity u0026amp sorrow is a slow burner i really liked the writing and the way amity grew as a character but i never really connected to her mother or sorrow what happened to sorrow is awful but she's really hard to care about and the kitten moment was too awful amity u0026amp sorrow is an interesting book and shows the damage cults can do while i didn't get as emotionally involved as i would have liked i did find the story fascinating","179":"it was a good idea for a story but it never went anywhere it skipped around way too much and never really gave us enough of the background story didn't like it","180":" i kept reading hoping that i would finally understand what was happening there were too many things alluded to and then never explained the writing style was strange and the time frame really threw me off the mother and two daughters escape from the cult in modern times but they land on a farm without a phone and a tv that runs off of rabbit ears the whole polygamy setting is always really disturbing to me but this one was even more disturbing because it was only one man with fifty wives living at this place it just didn't make sense and the back story that was provided didn't help thanks netgalley for the advance read","181":"review coming","182":" another title i have put down i'm afraid to say nothing really against the book i must add which is finely written with an intriguig plot riley just wasn't holding my attention even though you are placed pretty squarely in the action from page one it still felt quite slow and meandering i also felt quite quickly like i knew where the book was taking me i may pick it up again and discover i was wrong but there are other things i want to start reading instead a book whose ending i'm happy to hear about rather than read to in all honesty copy received from tinder press","183":" this is probably one of the hardest reviews i have ever had to write in the past three years that i have blogging this book was one of those ones where the cover captured me as i had the cover in the middle and then i read the blurb and it sounded like it could be a good book with it being about a polygamy cult as i love to read things like that so here i am opening the book and learn that the mother amaranth and her two daughter sorrow and amity have escaped a cult and now her husband is after her we learn that she is wife #1 of fifty wives and that her daughter sorrow is called the oracle then the book gets well confusing as they stumble across a farm and meet a guy called bradley and his son dust and live on the farm and this is their story the thing about this book was the writing was addictive and you just wanted to keep reading it to try and find out what happens the only thing is you never do but you hold a candle to this book hoping that things will improve and you will find clarity but again it never comes it didn't for me but you might have better luck i'll be interested if anyone else has read this what their views of it are","184":" when the faith in her polygamist cult and its leader who also happens to be her husband turns to horror amaranth steals away with her heavily indoctrinated daughters and washes up on a farmhouse porch in oklahoma while i'd usually eat up a story about such a community for the puerile interest alone i found this story a bit of a slog perhaps due to the disheartening and frustrating nature of the escapees three women so indoctrinated and ignorantly embedded in their culture that there is little room for any empathetic character development and ugh enough emphasis on the many dirty and stained clothes and under layers in which the ladies are buried oh wait might it be symbolism ok i get it so mom can you please launder the secret underwear already and by the way you might also want to keep an eye on the daughter with the messianic complex who likes to play with matches as well","185":" i wanted to love this book the subject matter is interesting to me and the reviews were strong but the book just left me disappointed both doing too much and too little while the narrative spends great detail on some areas the relationships seemed to form without much reason or connection and all of the characters seem to trade their problems for new variations of the same with the possible exception of amity overall i felt that the author had an intellectual concept and strong language skills but the heart and soul of the characters never really resonated with me","186":"review to come","187":" i'd heard a lot of buzz about this book so was very excited when waterstones sent me a review copy - and i was not disappointed the opening pages plunge you straight in - a mother and her two daughters amity and sorrow fleeing from a devastating fire at the polygamous cult they call home crash their car on a farmer's isolated plot of land in remote oklahoma quite what they're escaping is unclear at first but is slowly and tantalisingly revealed through flashbacks the pace and tightness of plot confirming peggy riley as an assured and gifted storyteller reluctantly the lonely farmer gives them shelter and what follows is a gripping un put downable novel of faith desire hope secrets and ... farming despite both having the same upbringing amity and sorrow are very different amity the younger sister more curious and willing to accept her new life while sorrow seems desperate to return i found both of their characters believable and brilliantly written especially the tentative relationships that amity forges with the new people and experiences suddenly in her life most fascinating to me however was their mother amaranth - while the daughters were born into the cult and know no different i am endlessly intrigued about the women who choose to join such a life especially amaranth the first of fifty wives could she possibly have known what she was getting herself into again riley reveals this with masterful precision with small hints and suggestive turns of phrase the jacket describes it as 'the darkest novel about love and the good life you will ever read' while it is indeed dark there is also a lot of beauty and hope in it and riley's prose both bold and subtle is to be savoured","188":"the book was very confusing at the beginning the book was exiting in periods... i will recommend it to people who is interested in religion","189":" this is not a teen title like most i review there are some really disturbing scenes in this book so be warned the opening chapters gripped me straight away two girls and their mother fleeing a cult the point of view of the girls amity and sorrow who knew no other life and of their mother amaranth who did but had all but forgotten anything else it was interesting to see how she came to be there how her perceptions warped to accept things that she recognizes after the fact shouldn't have been acceptable there was an interesting dream like sense in much of this book almost like i couldn't always be sure what was remembered what was imagined the story really drew me in and i read it quickly i think i might like to read it again more slowly the writing is interesting sensual and descriptive really enjoyed reading it even though it was disturbing and upsetting in places occasionally the point of view jumps were disjointed and confusing to me but that seemed how it should be and might also be because i read too quickly i have some issues with the ending spoilers follow i found it hard to take that amaranth left her daughter sorrow behind with her father at the end and didn't go to the police the reason seemed to be because she learned from amity that sorrow had set the fire this girl is still a child in my view what she may have done given how she was raised lived and was abused well how could she abandon her to me sorrow was the one character you didn't get to know enough in this story and i felt the lack of this that is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars i'm interested to hear how others felt about this but overall it was still haunting and intriguing and has left me thinking ages after i read it the date i've give when i read it is approximate i've left reviewing for a while because i wanted to think about it some more if i find time to read it again i'll review again","190":"_________________ that is how the whole novel read flat it's too bad because the subject is fascinating","191":" it's one of those books where the cover art title and blurb catches your attention then you find yourself checking the book out of the library start reading it and 3 4 through still not feeling it i found this one hard to read because some scenes felt like they just jumped out of nowhere not sure whether that had something to do with my lack of interest or just how the book is also i was half expecting a twist or two somewhere in there but it just did not happen and it had a predictable ending however despite feeling that finishing this book was a chore i found riley's writing style very detailed like intricate tattoos every image was vividly clear that i could imagine what the fields in oklahoma were like the book is so descriptive i could smell taste and hear everything that was happening it's also got a very dark story line which i like and it reveals a lot on what living in a cult can do to young women all that sick and twisted shit disguised as holy rituals and defiling the innocence they claim to protect","192":"wow riveting story strong characters really pulled me in~ if i were in a book club this would be my suggestion for next month's read i chose it at the library due to its beautiful interesting cover photo as well as the recommendation of lori lansens author of the girls","193":"i really really did not like this book i have trouble with non linear stories to begin with but i felt like this narrative in particular never got any less disjointed and the pieces never truly fit together i also don't like ambiguous endings or books that leave me with plot related questions so that's more strikes against it i didn't particularly bond with any of the characters either it's pretty much a no for me across the board","194":" i have read several books dealing with polygamy and though i can't see myself living within that belief system i can usually find some sympathy for the characters and get comfortable in the story this book was not like that there were no redeeming characters in this story not one i couldn't even find sympathy for the incest victim which feels painful to say write although you could understand that girls growing up in this environment would be a little brainwashed these girls were insane i wanted to drown sorrow for being so mean and self centered while spouting her self righteous craziness everyone made comments regarding her selfishness and need for attention but when talking to her directly couldn't seem to help giving her what she wanted amaranth acknowledged that she participated in harming her girls yet other than running away with them she didn't seem to make any effort to help move them forward she snatched them from zachariah only when everything was being destroyed around her only to stop at the first stumbling block and be perfectly comfortable having them live on the porch of some random farm while she proceeded to shack up with the farmer who didn't seem to be irresistible as far as i could determine she didn't even seem to be aware of the temple sorrow was erecting in the gas station bathroom out of trash mud and waste ugghh even the supposedly worldly characters only said you're ignorant rather than let me help you","195":"and i loved the story it told i've never actually read a book about polygamy but i've heard all sorts of things about it the main character amaranth is wonderful as are her daughters i really disliked sorrow but i still thought she was a good character even though she does things that are terrible you have to remember i need to start leaving reviews i think especially on books that i think deserve them i really loved this one i loved the way it was written third person present  and i loved the story it told i've never actually read a book about polygamy but i've heard all sorts of things about it the main character amaranth is wonderful as are her daughters i really disliked sorrow but i still thought she was a good character even though she does things that are terrible you have to remember that she was basically brainwashed by her father her story is so sad when you really think about what has happened to her i also loved amity i loved seeing the world through her eyes since she grew up not knowing anything but the world her father created for her she loved her sister and her mother both and it was sad seeing her torn between them anyway it's an excellent book though i can see why some people might not like it it was interesting to see how amaranth reflected on her life living with the women i think of my favorite parts had to be when she realized she thought of the women she was married to as more of a family than her own husband i also loved the cover and it was one of the reasons i wanted to read it five stars","196":"a strange book but one i could not put down","197":"tragic and sad story you've got to be in the mood for this kind of book not uplifting","198":" review originally posted on my blog http stephinlondon com 2013 03 12 a i read a lot on the bus and in the bath... as a matter of fact that's where most of my reading gets done i fall asleep when i try to read in bed or on the couch so while commuting or relaxing in a tub of suds seems to do the trick for me let me tell you the amount of times i almost missed my stop or how often my bathwater went icy cold was pretty much a constant i loved amity u0026amp sorrow and it's easily one of my favourite books of the year so far there's loads that i liked about this novel from the setting and descriptions on down to the dialogue but one of the main things that fascinated me the most about amity u0026amp sorrow were the characters i found myself not liking amaranth at first but as she began to grow away from her past i got on board with her a bit more she reminded me a lot of my mother at first which was disheartening to say the least amity and dust were fantastic innocent characters you couldn't help but like and enjoy and there's sorrow a force to be reckoned with i had kind of clocked what was going on with sorrow from a few pages in the issues she was having sorry no spoilers but not to quite the extent i'd expected goodness that sounds so obtuse but i really don't want to ruin it because it's so good i wanted to feel sorry for sorrow for what she'd been through i wanted to empathise with her pain her loss but you know what i couldn't i detested her i hated her selfishness her willingness to damn everyone else to hell without a second thought there was just something about her that just kept me from feeling any sort of emotion towards her other than anger riley has created a strong character in sorrow one other thing i wanted to touch on was riley's creation of a whole world a religious cult which was so believable that it was scary i'm sure groups like this do exist living polygamous lives off the grid you hear about them all the time on the news riley has also meshed in some of the creepier elements of david koresh and warren jeffs in zachariah who i imagine to be a very charismatic individual... particularly if he managed to bring in 50 wives amity u0026amp sorrow was a wild ride through the mid west through drought stricken fields dusty towns and abandoned service stations it was like spinning spinning until you're so dizzy you feel like you might just float away and i don't like spoilers in reviews but whoah that ending... man oh man is it good","199":"i kept waiting for this book to become the magical or exciting or rich or spooky or intriguing story it wanted to be unfortunately that didn't pan out","200":"okay probably not my thing i could have done without the cult aspect as i was very happy with the relationship between the mother and her daughters some lovely moments inspired by steinbeck who does get an acknowledgement","201":"i stopped reading this book because it was too twisted for me i did not realize what it was about when i started reading but the more i read the worse it got definitely not for me","202":"aramanth saves her daughters amity and sorrow when the home of their polygamous family burns they all have trouble adjusting to life outside their compound","203":" amity and sorrow are sisters leaving home for the first time but this isn't your typical coming of age experience they're leaving their father's polygamous religious compound and they aren't leaving by choice in the chaos caused by a fire the girls' mother amaranth drags them into the car and starts driving as fast and as far as she can they don't stop until the car crashes and they're forced into a new life amaranth has finally realized that all the faith she had in her husband was misplaced as the first of his fifty wives she has put up with quite a bit over the years but now that her illusions have been swept away all she wants to do is protect her daughters sorrow's faith in her father however isn't shaken she believes it all that she is the oracle that the fire will come to end the world and that she will bring god to her and he will help her get home it's a madness that amaranth wants desperately to break through and amity is fascinated by the outside world but has trouble letting go of the only life she's ever known the three meet a farmer named bradley who reluctantly lets them stay with him and his aging father amaranth helps bradley in the kitchen the old man helps amity learn to read and a new family starts to take shape the question then becomes whether or not it can last whether amaranth and the girls can break free peggy riley snares the reader's attention with this debut novel and doesn't let it go her characters are sometimes straightforward and simple and sometimes terribly complex the journey riley takes them on is not one of distance but one of changing realities and the way those realities collide is different for everyone","204":" two sisters sit side by side in the backseat of an old car amity and sorrow their hands are hot and close together a strip of white fabric loops between them tying them together wrist to wrist and with those first lines i'm hooked the girls' mother amaranth is running away from her polygamist husband the father as in god the father can you say megalomaniac amaranth is wife #1 of fifty that's right fifty women with their infants and children living off the grid on a secluded compound my biggest surprise though came when it was soon clear that the sisters weren't six and eight which was the age i filled in for them these sisters with the evocative quaker like names were twelve and sixteen and that gave the novel a whole different spin amaranth barely stops along her escape route not at least until she wrecks the car near the down on their luck bradley farm in oklahoma forced to stay put for however long amaranth is at first an automaton the rules from her previous life still ringing in her ears fields are forbidden enter no man's house we watch as amaranth slowly discards those rules if only to survive twelve year old amity though skittish of life on the outside has an easier time throwing off the strictures of her old life but sorrow's scars run deeper than anyone suspects author peggy riley's portrayal of the shattered minds of these women is penetrating amaranth quite rightly exhibits some of the symptoms of stockholm syndrome the girls are totally uneducated and unschooled unable to read or write ignorant of television and libraries and computers amity doesn't even know from whence they came she has never seen a map doesn't know the meaning of utah or oklahoma their total naivete is jaw dropping aside from the preacher father riley offers him neither excuse nor absolution the men in the novel are treated with sympathy bradley also knows loss and heartache dust the half breed bradley adopted lives with the isolation of bigotry old man bradley is trapped by age and infirmity in his bedroom but then every character is trapped in amity and sorrow some literally for a time but then metaphorically and i'm reminded of the title of a collection of doris lessing's essays the prisons we choose to live inside the question then becomes who will escape","205":"undecided don't expect vast amounts of characterisation it's not that type of book and i admire the approach it fizzles out a little though","206":"i could not put this book down it was so good","207":" firstly i want to say that i think peggy riley made a memorable entrance with this debut her future work will be on my to read lists as soon as i hear of it now i'd like to clarify the blurb bradley the farmer who takes the mother and daughters in is not grieving the loss of his wife his wife did not die she ran off four years ago i think that's as resolved as it's going to get for him the story flip flops between past and present the flashbacks being important to help the reader understand better the actions of the mother and daughters in the present amaranth's backstory is probably very familiar to the cult leaders of the world weak easy prey she has daddy u0026amp abandonment issues that progress into self medication with alcohol and a quickie wedding with the older man savior when she's just nineteen she's pregnant with her first child eve who dies before birth when she marries zachariah he later tells her that was the reason he married her right after she meets the few women he already has at his compound that he will later marry romantic right while it's obvious that he has shared some of his religious views with her previous to the marriage he did not mention the other women he loves or his background as a felon and former resident of another polygamous cult compound i guess even with damaged broken people you have to ease them into your crazy lest you scare them off before your hooks are firmly in place zachariah goes on to marry fifty other women he has a total of twenty seven living children with his wives amaranth is his first and only legally documented wife the second wife was an old women who dies shortly after their marriage i won't spoil the disgusting truth behind that marriage but suffice it to say zachariah is deeply disturbed there are alot of interesting things that happen on the compound with the wives including a meth lab fire that sends two wives to the hospital and zachariah into detox when the remaining wives figure the situation out most interesting to me is the children they are born and raised in this tiny messed up community with no outsiders it's baffling to me that none of the wives have thought what will happen to these children when they are old enough to want husbands and wives for themselves being all at least half siblings doesn't mean alot in these polygamous places most of the time but these women don't fit that particular mold they know the children shouldn't be breeding they know it's wrong so really what do they expect them to do what zachariah does is kick the oldest boys out of the cult if you know anything about famous polygamous cults you might know these young men as lost boys the real reason behind his swift dismissal of the boys is tragic and wrong and disgusting after the boys are kicked out their mother hope leaves to be with them and goes to the police to tell them about zachariah and his abuse when the police start staking out the compound it puts everyone in a state of religious panic they believe the end of the world is coming soon the whole of their religious cult revolves around the end of the world coming zachariah and sorrow are the only ones that welcome the end sorrow is amy u0026amp zachariah's oldest living daughter she serves the purpose of oracle in their church she's highly disturbed she sets things on fire and kills kittens yes you read that correctly she also thinks that she can make a new jesus think about that her age is never defined for us they say she's a woman but their only definition of being a woman is puberty she logically has to be between 14 and 19 years old i'm guessing under 18 simply for the police reaction to her pregnancy she miscarries after the car accident that strands the girls at the gas station u0026amp farm of bradley amity is twelve years old she is largely ignored by everyone and fancies herself a healer it's never stated why she thinks she can heal with her hands but she obviously believes it she's the only one who easily breaks their old rules she's thankfully young enough to be salvageable mentally neither of the girls can read or write one more way for their father to keep the children ignorant and pliable they couldn't even read the bible everything was under his interpretations and in his control they are not allowed to talk to men or boys they can't step foot into a field at all which wasn't always a rule but put into effect when zachariah moved a meth lab onto his land and needed an excuse to keep the wives and children away bradley and dust and the old man live on the farm the girls literally crash into after running away from the fire at their temple and the police and zachariah bradley took dust in when his father left him after an accident with the machinery on his farm that kind of explains why he doesn't kick the girls off his land decidedly bradley and amaranth have an interesting relationship they grow closer and she is very sexually aggressive with him she treats him like he is her king and god she's been programmed to treat her husband like that so i think it just comes out of her naturally for any man who helps her she's manipulating him and she probably doesn't realize it the daughters are on their own essentially sorrow treats amity like shit on her shoes she berates her and abuses her physically and gets away with it amity doesn't seem to know it's even wrong amaranth says a few times that her daughters are all that matters keeping them safe she immediately and thoroughly contradicts herself by neglecting them and immersing herself in bradley i think it's important for amaranth's character to feel a true love with bradley and to learn to grow out of the expectations of her mad husband that said she's a horrible mother to these poor girls the ending was unsatisfying it's open ended and actually pretty fitting for this kind of story this book is just plain tragic every one of the characters is broken it is not hopeful there is no hope i think that isn't what the author was aiming for at the end but i never got a hopeful sense of the future for most of the people in the book my favorite relationship was amity and the old man she believes is the devil he's caustic and ill and yet teaches her how to read and is the only one who wants to spend time with her amity looks at him 'i've seen people die ''well i have too but i don't go 'round braggin' 'bout it ''i hope you don't die ' she tells him 'well ' he says 'well ' after amity heals the old man he takes an experimental breath 'i didn't feel nothin' ' he takes another 'did you heal me ' hee breathes in hard and waits to choke on it he breathes again 'well i'll be damned ' he says amity smiles 'i should hope not ' dust is a favorite character of mine he's a young man a teenager and he's the only one who knows and understands how disturbed sorrow is amity knows but she doesn't understand and amaranth is too messed up herself to recognize the best way to help sorrow in the end i have to say i enjoy the book it will definitely be in my thoughts for a long time if there is ever a follow up i will read it","208":"i'm not sure how i feel about this one a story about s mother and her two daughters escaping a polygamous cult it was gripping in that i had to keep reading to see what happened next but at the same time i felt like some of the events were just not realistic overall a strange book","209":" this was a book that i would have walked past in a bookstore without a second glance a quick glance at the cover or even the synopsis about farms and religion it wouldn't have whet my appetite at all so thank you goodreads thank you for having this book on one of the many lists i looked down it is incredible and grabbed me like no novel has in years easily slotted up into my top ten amity u0026amp sorrow is stunning when asked to narrow down just why i like it so much i would be hard pressed to tell you but i was barely able to put the book down i feel like the novel is a car crash waiting to happen and you watch it careen from extreme to the mundane without ever feeling like you've lost anything quiet losses and loud ones the small pleasures and the ones that are impossible to miss all are juxtaposed within peggy riley's work the book is enviously beautiful and i would highly recommend it","210":"more like 3 1 2netgalley invited me to read and review this book the cover caught my attention and the storyline intrigued me i have read a few books on the polygamist lifestyle and i have a lot of props for women who gather their kids and leave in this book amaranth is the first wife of fifty yes of fifty she takes her two daughters amity and sorrow and leave the compound where they have been living she drives for days which i found interesting in itself because she most likely would not have driven any where which is most likely why there is an accident amity and sorrow are bound together in the back of the car by cloth strips these two girls are bound not only physically they are bound emotionally and spiritually too they can't read know nothing of the outside world and are bound to the rules and guidelines from their father's cult this is a very intense read one that will leave you thinking long after you turn the last page a great debut by peggy riley","211":" amaranth and her two daughters amity u0026amp sorrow have driven for four days until they crash in oklahoma amaranth is desperate to run from her former life a polygamous cult where her daughters share one father with fifty mothers although amity is keen to look to the future sorrow wants nothing more than to go home rescue comes in the unlikely form of a lonely farmer bradley who reluctantly takes them in an intriguing story that delves into the relationships between very different individuals a story that dwells on religion without preaching it at the reader a story that is difficult in content at times but weaved together beautifully","212":"the interest of this story lies in exploring what makes women submit to a polygamous lifestyle and this was one with a vengeance one man and fifty wives however it was hard to feel any empathy for the women who have obviously been brain washed from documentaries i've seen about these polygamous groups the story rang true","213":"amity u0026amp sorrow opens on a dramatic scene as a mother amaranth and her two children teenage sorrow and twelve year old amity find themselves stranded in an isolated petrol station after four days of driving amaranth has crashed her car and has no option but to accept help from bradley the farmer who owns the surrounding land and dust the boy who works for him it soon becomes clear that the trio have fled from a cult like religious community where amaranth was the first of fifty 'wives' to the leader zachariah mystery surrounds their departure who started the fire that forced them to leave and what has suddenly made amaranth so determined to run as far away as possible after so many years meanwhile sorrow is equally determined to get back to her father while amity is both intensely curious about this new world and totally in thrall to her older sister i was really interested in the plot of this book and felt there were so many interesting avenues it could potentially explore who isn't fascinated by the mentality of cult leaders and members unfortunately amity u0026amp sorrow fell far short of my expectations i was surprised upon doing a bit of research to find that the author is a debut novelist who although born in the us is now settled in the uk the reason for this is that the book has such an old fashioned traditional feel about it despite the controversial and sometimes shocking subject matter the main focus is often on domestic details such as the companionship between the 'wives' the everyday difficulties of farming and the development of a tentative relationship between amaranth and bradley i wouldn't have been surprised to discover it had been penned by a seasoned writer who had written a number of novels about small town and rural american life i guess this is an achievement in itself maybe it's what riley was aiming for and if so then she deserves praise for recreating that particular type of storytelling so effectively however this kind of writing isn't of interest to me at all and i was constantly frustrated by the lack of insight the narrative method provided into the characters' motivations and feelings sorrow is in a number of ways the centre of every major event of the book the plot revolves around her actions however she isn't given her own voice instead there's a third person narrative which switches its focus between amaranth and amity and remains a frustratingly enigmatic character i found some of sorrow's behaviour extremely difficult to understand even after the revelations about her past and thought her relationship with zachariah should have been explored further i had the same difficulty understanding exactly why amaranth and so many other women had been drawn to this way of life or why she had chosen to stay for so long or why she didn't view spoiler go to the police at the end knowing what she was abandoning her daughter to hide spoiler while the themes of this book fascinated me i found the narrative and characters as dry and arid as the parched landscape surrounding bradley's farm i struggled to believe in so many things about the story from major plot points to small but interesting details such as why amaranth chose to keep wearing the cumbersome clothing she had been required to wear in her old life i think it was written for a very different audience than me or at least it reads that way this book has had a lot of positive reviews and i think a lot of readers would get much more out of it than i did but i can't really recommend it at all","214":"it was ok","215":"had to give it one star just to register it was a book club choice not mine i gave it my best shot and pretty much felt bummed through the effort it's summer want beach reads anyway when sorrow who i couldn't stand killed a kitten that's all i needed to be done i'm amazed at how many people liked it i look forward to hearing what others thought at book club maybe i missed a great ending but i can live with that","216":"good beginning good if confusing ending the middle bit was honestly a bit too long and a bit woolly very flowery writing and while i'm all for flowery writing if it gets to the point where i lose track of what's actually being written about it needs a bit more editing longer review to come","217":"a mother and her two daughters escape from a religious cult and end up in the dusty farmland of the oklahoma panhandle their rules their clothing and their beliefs from their previous life clash with the reality of the world they encounter but they never really sever their ties with the cult leader an interesting read","218":"didn't necessarily enjoy this novel even though i normally enjoy reading this type of genre it had a good story line but i don't feel it was executed very well","219":"good fast paced read about a mother and her daughters and their escape from a polygamist sect and the emotional baggage that comes along with it","220":"had high hopes for this one since sounded like such a great plot woman takes her daughrters and escapes from a husband that has 50 wives to sum this up so not impressed the style of writing was really different and hard to feel for these characters","221":" i received a copy of this book free through goodreads first reads what a terrific read this is the story of two sisters amity and sorrow and their mother the author has you from the beginning she takes you on a wonderful journey with her fascinating characters i loved the style of writing much of the story comes in flash backs the story is also rather dark at times and the end throws you for a loop it was enjoyable from start to finish and i hope to see more from this new author cover art beautiful image and it does it's job of making you wonder about the story inside","222":" i just read in the newspaper that this is the 20th anniversary of the siege and fire in waco tx it is likely that this event of 20 years ago was the seed of the story that ms riley tells in amity u0026amp sorrow a novel blessedly there is no real politics interjected into the story but rather she focuses on the influence of a dangerous and charismatic man and the effect he had on several of those who loved and trusted him the book begins as amaranth the one of 50 wives has fled from a devastating fire at the temple and home of her husband a polygamist messianic end of the world cult leader picture a combination of david koresh and warren jeffs she is fiercely protective of her two daughters amity and sorrow and has taken them with her believing that her husband was the one to have set the fire in an attempt to destroy them all her fear keeps her driving for 4 days straight until she finally wrecks her car after falling asleep one to many times fortunately they are all alright but their car is out of commission and their lack of money makes this the end of the line in their flight the effects of their husband father on amaranth amity and sorrow's lives from this point on creates a complex and original story that i found hard to get out of my head the cover of the book pictures the girls bound together at the wrists their mother has done this to try to keep the oldest and most disturbed of the girls from attempting to return to her father who she sees as god he continues to exert a powerful control over all of them even in his absence their freedom lies in discovering a way to live in this world that is so different from what the girls have ever known a simple but understanding farmer bradley allows them to take shelter with him he appears to be a lonely man his wife having left him and he is a sitting duck for the needy women ultimately he is pivotal in changing some of them and he and his elderly father offer the real salvation in the story much at their own expense i was mesmerized by the way the story both the current as well as the backdrop unfolded it is very disturbing but at the same time realistic it is through the perspective of the women that the author really brings the conflict and crisis of the story to the reader she does a wonderful job of showing the differences between the women and you can feel the tension and ultimate madness that eventually consumes one of them and brings the book to a close i am thankful to the publisher little brown and company and netgalley for the chance to read and review this book it is a powerful and original story i recommend it to readers who enjoy books that have psychological twists and get into the character's minds it is not an ordinary story and will stay with me for a long time","223":"this book just didn't do it for me the pacing was slow and the characters were strange and weren't fleshed out very well i spent half the book trying to figure out why they were behaving the way they were and finally just decided none of it made sense and i was better off if i quit trying to find reasons for their actions","224":"faith family love polygamy beautiful writing","225":" i won this book for free through the goodreads first reads program oh my this book y'all it is about a mother and her two daughters who escape a polygamous compound they crash there car after days of driving and they find peace and love in the form of a recently widowed farmer who reluctantly takes them in the girls do not know life outside of the compound one girl wants nothing more than to go back and the other wants to live life to the fullest the fear of there father coming for them is always in the back of there mind but they try to make the best of it this book was so great one of the best that i have ever read","226":"it's been a while since i read such an intense book not only does amity and sorrow have a very heavy subject matter riley's writing read like literary fiction i had to use the dictionary feature on my kindle several times and that's unusual for me amity and sorrow was a good book it is very intelligently and emotionally written i liked riley's writing style and thought it suited the story very well i loved the way riley wrote the emotions of her characters i loved amaranth's strength and enjoy reading about a strong female lead especially a mother what kept me from loving this book though was how sad it made me there were definitely no happily ever afters and while a traditional hea would have made amity and sorrow feel unrealistic i confess that i was still hoping for one this book made me melancholy in fact i would not recommend reading it unless you are in a good place emotionally i take things to heart and reading about amaranth amity and sorrow's life really made me sad that feeling of despair kept me from falling in love with the book i would still recommend amity and sorrow and in fact probably would have enjoyed it much more had i not been going through a tough time of illness at the time that i read it","227":"interesting a little different play on the poligomy thing where the #1 wife out of 50 escapes with her 2 daughters gets to oklahoma crashes the car and then has to depend on the help of a farmer for basic needs the really interesting part was the relationship of the daughters with their father and with each other","228":"this is a strange story dealing with a cult family of a husband and his 50 wives spoiler alert the 1st wife fled with her 2 daughters a and s when a fire was started in their temple she drove until she crashed the car there she found a farmer who helped her later they go back and find zechariah sorrow stayed with him this story involves religious cults incest family mental illness love","229":"lots of great imagery and themes in this novel an interesting look at a cult from the inside and how completely it destroyed lives after initial ideals developed into something more sinister i liked the way events unfolded in a kind of understated way almost like the author was sparing with her words","230":"i did not like this book although i read the whole thing the writing was not my style choppy and vague i can decide if it was a style or bad writing and the whole thing was odd i'm not sure of the point yet other than this works is full of crazy","231":"this story is haunting at the least and terribly disturbing especially how human brains are so susceptible to persuasion story is not surprising but still makes me want to scream","232":"although pretty bleak i loved that this plot was fresh and unpredictable interesting choice of destination for a family on the road for 4 days to another kind of family that was trapped the character development of mother and one sister was good although allusions to amity's power were left unexplored not an enjoyable read but interesting","233":" i haven't read many books about any cults or anything like that really but after reading the description for amity u0026amp sorrow the 4th or 5th time i got an email from netgalley they were having issues that day i decided that it sounded interesting and grabbed it while i was approved i'm kind of glad i did while some of the events were quite horrifying to read about it really was interesting and kept my attention quite well i'll admit i'm a bit of a nosy person and really like to see how other people live sometimes so it was interesting to have a look into this cult since that's what it was i'm not sure if i was ever supposed to feel empathy for sorrow or not but i just couldn't the girl was freaking evil her poor sister was always having to put up with things from her it was horrible like she cuts her and leaves her bleeding out in a bathroom what kind of sister does that i dunno even after finding out some gross and sad things about her i still couldn't like her at all in the end i'm glad she's where she is and that her sister and mother are free of her i felt bad for their mother too she had nowhere else to go and got pulled into this crazy situation i'm glad she ran when she did even if it was too late for sorrow overall it's a very interesting story that keeps you wondering what happens next and how everything is going to turn out i don't regret reading it at all and actually really enjoyed it it's very different from what i usually read","234":"did not like this at all it was like a movie that is totally over acted and tries too hard none of the characters were sympathetic and it was all just too much","235":"excellent book loved the characters and the story this is such an interesting topic shrouded in sceret the author did a great job of giving the read multiple points of view it is easy to see how things like this could happen and how it affects the children in our lifes i would recommend this book it was a good easy read i won this as a good reads first reads and loved it","236":"dark haunting poetic filled with symbolism not for the faint of heart","237":"a book of two halves i was going to give up in the first half but persevered and loved the last half","238":"this was a good book that kept my interest from the beginning it is the story of amaranth and her daughters sorrow and amity who are on the run after fleeing the polygamous compound they lived in amaranth was the first of 50 wife of the man who started the compound things fall apart at the compound and after a fire breaks out amaranth takes the girls and escapes they end up in oklahoma at the farm of bradley bradley lives there with his dad and a teenage boy dusty amaranth and amity adjust to living outside of the compound but sorrow is another matter it is an interesting story of how the three deal with living outside the compound the writing was a little uneven but overall it was a good read","239":" descriptiona mother and her daughters drive for days without sleep until they crash their car in rural oklahoma the mother amaranth is desperate to get away from someone she's convinced will follow them wherever they go her husband the girls amity and sorrow can't imagine what the world holds outside their father's polygamous compound rescue comes in the unlikely form of bradley a farmer grieving the loss of his wife at first unwelcoming to these strange prayerful women bradley's abiding tolerance gets the best of him and they become a new kind of family an unforgettable story of belief and redemption amity u0026amp sorrow is about the influence of community and learning to stand on your own ratingreviewi wasn't sure about reading this novel but am glad i persevered the description doesn't give a hint of the lost and desperate characters of amaranth amity and particularly sorrow yes you can imagine life would be very difficult escaping a cult but their lives and struggles were beyond that fleeing with her daughters amity a 12 year old and her sister sorrow a young teenager amaranth seeks to put as much distance as she can between her husband their father and leader of their cult zachariah she drives without rest for 4 days until finally she crashes the car the car is her lifeline as it is packed with food and clothes to help with their escape no car or its contents mean that zachariah can find them fortunately she crashes near a farm owned by bradley he is a sullen but good looking farmer trying to save his farm on a never ending yearly basis he is still affected by the desertion of his wife but has still retained a caring side revealed with that of his father and dust a young mexican lad he has taken under his wing the old fashioned dress sense of these three females is not the only thing to confuse bradley he cannot at first understand their struggles strange rules and behaviour until piece by piece of what darkness has been hinted on becomes slowly revealed peggy riley's style of writing was hard to follow at first but i quite quickly followed this and her ability to flit between the present and the past her descriptive skills for example of the farming land in oklahoma gave the impression of a really hard life and you could almost taste the dust as the novel picked up pace you began to get an insight into how the cult began and how it changed to a polygamous sect of how the love of the 50 women his wives whom most seemed to have come from a desperate troubled and lonely background and the cult children grew into a dangerous and ominous situation without giving away the story the increasing erratic behaviour of sorrow and the gentle loving but confused behaviour of amity unfold bringing the climax to the story in an unforeseen surprising twist which left the reader with unanswered questions i would be interested in reading riley's next book nazi fairy tales as i find amity and sorrow and the author's subjects intriguing i was given a copy of the book by netgalley thank you","240":"i received a copy of this book from net galley i've read several novels that deal with polygamy and always found them interesting so i was drawn to this novel about a mother and her two teenage daughters who are fleeing from their polygamous compound amarenth was one of fifty wives but decided to flee her husband when she finds proof that her husband is not as honorable and honest as she once thought yet her daughters amity and sorrow have never known a life outside of polygamy they cannot read they have never heard of a map and have never seen a working television no phone no electricity they cooked with propane and heated their house and outbuildings with wood from their forests they weren't on the grid the family ends up with farmer bradley after wreaking their car in oklahoma and struggle to adjust to life after the compound i had a hard time connecting with the characters of this book in part because this is written in a sort of dreamy language that alludes to its meaning rather than clarifying intent amaranth previously called amy fell into the life of polygamy as a desperate and lonely teenager who was tricked by her husband she seems to fall for the polygamous life by degrees and inches until the final straw forces her to confront the reality of what her life has become who was her husband who claimed to be god who was her child to believe him who was she to have sanctioned this when it all started so long ago back when their faith was made of charity and compassion a dream of creating a family for women who had no one how had love led them here most distasteful is sorrow who fights her mother every step of the way in her attempt to be reunited with her father sorrow believes herself to an oracle and a chosen one sorrow is unforgivable in her willingness to hurt anyone that stands in her way including her sister although sorrow deserves some leeway because she simply longs for the only life she has ever known her ruthlessness is unwarranted i wondered the whole book how amity but especially sorrow could ever have a normal life after the childhood they had experienced on the other hand this seems more possible for amity who is willing to break what were formerly rules in her old life and wishes to explore the new world she finds herself in all in all i found the characterization in this weak and the relationships stilted the use of flashbacks helped clarify details about why these women were fleeing but i found the narrative style too metaphorical at times she can grow on his land and be planted she can learn to root herself and hope to flower she can plant what was sacred and see what would grow finally i'm unsure of what sort of life amity will know now that she and her mother have found freedom in the form of a struggling farmer in the middle of rural oklahoma who is struggling to provide for himself and his father let alone taking on other people","241":"thanks to goodreads and the publisher for my first reads copy this was a bizarre read it juxtaposed beautiful imagery with heinous crimes and at times i found it unbelievable i'm sure crazy things go on in cults but i think portions of this novel were sensationalist","242":"just had a hard time making it through this book didn't keep my interest and couldn't care much about the characters it seemed disjointed and the story not compelling","243":"i didn't get it it was beautifully written and at times poetic but i kept waiting for the story to get somewhere","244":"interesting book about a woman who escapes from a polygamist cult with her two daughters","245":"a bit dark and certainly a bit crazy but ultimately a fascinating read i found the story very compelling and while i might have liked it more if the women were stronger i am not sure that fits the story lots of symbolism here","246":"this book is darker and more disturbing than expected but still a compelling read i found parts of the book implausible or at least a little too plot convenient still ms riley's story kept me reading until the end the two young girls were better portrayed than most of the adults in fact the girls are one good reason to keep reading i had no trouble picturing events locales or people but by the end i was very much ready for a positive uplifting less plot driven book for my next read","247":"{ i received this as an ebook from netgalley }trying to come up with a way to describe amity u0026amp sorrow i keep thinking bittersweet and it is it follows amity sorrow and their mother amaranth who have escaped from a polygamous cult and are now adjusting to life outside their compound details of their lives specifically amaranth's before they escaped are given in flashbacks tales from before which shed light on how a religious group which was started with such hope and love turned into something dark and depraved amity and sorrow are near polar opposites sorrow wreaks havoc and destruction while amity appeases her and heals what she can i enjoyed the story but i felt the ending was a bit abrupt view spoiler while i appreciated the symbolism of amaranth being sown on the farm i felt the daughters' stories could have used a bit more resolution although i guess in the case of sorrow where else could her story have gone where else could she have ended up the whole book was leading her to exactly where she did end up and dust all but disappears from the novel with hardly any resolution at all hide spoiler still it was an interesting story and i wouldn't hesitate to try another novel by this author","248":" i requested this book because the cover and description grabbed me i loved the premise of the book but the execution of said premise didn't go very well in my opinion amaranth and her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow are on the run from their cult leader preacher god complex husband father when they crash their car they are eventually taken in by a farmer who has already taken in a young boy named dirt and is trying to take care of his invalid father amity u0026amp sorrow are some very disturbed girls and will need a lifetime of counseling i did not like anyone in this book they were all flawed some way more than others i like books with flawed characters but these were beyond the norm i know i should give more of a reason but if you decide to read it i don't want to spoil anything for you but know that there are some very tough issues in this book that i felt were not handled well at all i came close to dnfing this book but wanted to see what happened but was very disappointed the ending of this made me sick to my stomach and made me mad that i kept reading this book just didn't do it for me i see others really enjoyed it but this is not one i will be recommending to anyone 2 starsi received this book from netgalley u0026amp the publisher for a fair and honest review","249":"thought provoking","250":"sort of an odd one but kept my attention","251":"this was an interesting read as cult stories always are one husband fifty wives a bunch of kids and incest made me really glad that at least some of the wives in these crazy groups escape hard to believe these kind of religious cults exist it is also hard to believe that the wives are ok with all this sharing of one husband one has to wonder about diseases as well finally it is hard to feel sorry for anyone involved in these situations except for the children those i feel sorry for this one had a good enough ending","252":" what a curious book this was i've read novels on all sorts of subjects but i dare say that this is the first one i've read about a polygamous cult amaranth was the first of fifty wives to zachariah a man who imagines himself a prophet their congregation has lived a life of relative simplicity cut off from the world on a mountain compound where they raise their children in ignorance praying and preaching the impending armageddon then a series of cataclysmic events kept somewhat enigmatic for the reader spurs amaranth to grab her two teenage daughters amity and sorrow and run she drives for four days before crashing somewhere in rural oklahoma with no money and an intense fear that zachariah will chase her amaranth seeks help from bradley a struggling farmer sorrow has been led to believe that she is an oracle the one who can speak to god and transmit his message to the congregation armed with this belief and the fact that she has never known anything but this strange way of life sorrow proves that she will stop at nothing to defy her mother and go back to the congregation amity the younger of the two daughters is trapped in the middle obligated to obey both her mother and her oracle sister it's certainly a unique story one that offers up ample opportunity to explore interesting questions and themes unfortunately i found that i just couldn't lose myself in it the biggest problem is the third person narration that shifts between amaranth's point of view and amity's as a result sorrow isn't examined as much as a character despite the fact that she's arguably the most important as the oracle she played a special role in the congregation and many of the events that drove amaranth to run centered on sorrow sorrow's determination to return to the congregation is one of the primary sources of conflict in the story and yet her point of view is largely neglected as it stands sorrow is examined mostly from amity's perspective which is one of confusion fear and naivete it felt like a wasted opportunity to fully explore the dichotomy between the oracle and her mother's goals the narration also takes for granted that we already know why amaranth is running from her husband what the climactic fiery event at the compound was all about and the rules of the compound that remain difficult to break even in oklahoma surely this is done to build tension to tease the story out for the reader however for me all it did was cause confusion and frustration not fully understanding these rules meant that i didn't understand why the characters behave the ways they did i couldn't really get into their heads and follow their train of thought i had a problem understanding bradley's actions as well when he first discovers amaranth and her daughters he insists that he doesn't want them around but essentially shrugs when they stay sorrow's lashing out behaviors cause many problems for bradley and yet nothing will spur him to take action against these unwanted visitors in the end i only read half this book i think there was a lot of potential and i'm sure many other will find it gripping i just found it rather limp","253":" very fast read with a lot of emotions boiling throughout this is a book that i could honestly see being turned into a movie and still able to follow the feeling and the imagery as in the book and imagery there is from swirling skirts to the dry red dust of fields this author has nailed the ability to take you to her place her world in a whirlwind of sensory emotions the plot seems simplistic yet as a reader you want to continue to read and that's when layer upon layer of regret sadness rage and resolution are added mind you i never mentioned redemption because the people in this book never feel they receive it overall a very interesting book glad to have had the opportunity to have read it and if you are looking for a weekend reader that's a bit different this is it","254":"mormons pretty good story but missing something i can't quite put my finger on it i enjoyed the twisted nature","255":"this was my book in a day for the summer reading challenge i was sucked straight into the story and was with the women as they ran from the cult they had been a part of a very unusual set up and the voices of the three women were clear and very different as they all fought with whether or not to return to the safety of the world they knew","256":"good read even though it deals with harrowing subjects it reads really easy","257":"i have to agree with re majority no real climax in the end pretty darn predictable and not all that exciting amazing how badly one person can control and brainwash so many i'm guessing this sort of lifestyle has existed sad truly sad and very sick","258":"a disturbing look at the inside of a polygamist cult life and trying i break free from the ties that bind you down","259":" 3 5 5 stars advanced copy given for review purposes amity and sorrow a debut novel by peggy riley starts off abruptly with a mother amaranth fleeing from a polygamous compound after it caught on fire with her two teenage daughters amity and sorrow they drive continuously for four days until amaranth crashes the car on a farm in rural oklahoma and are thus stranded in the summer heat with no place to go and nowhere to turn the girls having never left the compound before are experiencing the outside world for the first time and their mother is returning to it for the first time in several years it isn't long before the farmer bradley notices the strangely dressed and eccentric family and reluctantly takes them in the rest of this gripping story is told from several perspectives often switching from mother amaranth and daughter amity and sometimes the author even gives us interesting insight to brooding bradley and passionate sorrow much of the plot revolves around the small family learning to cope after being stranded on a stranger's land and how both daughters who had never been taught anything that didn't pertain to religion the bible or housekeeping experience the bizarre new world they've found themselves in the climax of the story occurs when disaster strikes the farm and amaranth is forced to make a very difficult decision for those she loves for fear of giving away too much i won't discuss much further on the story itself other than to say that it will keep you guessing until the very last chapter and that the mysterious origins concerning the compound and the fire are something you'll least expect i applaud peggy riley for writing such a difficult and unapologetically honest novel in fact there are many points in the novel that are quite frankly disturbing to the casual reader i oftentimes found myself needing to set the book aside for a moment as the content itself became too difficult to digest at once polygamy sexual abuse and radical religion are all considered to be taboo in many modern day cultures and riley touches upon every one of these aspects - and even others - with aplomb and truth her writing itself is poetically simplistic and her depictions of the compound and the oklahoma panhandle as well as the thoughts of each character lead me to believe that she will have a great future in fiction i believe that this will be the first of many books to come much of this book i believe revolves around love and what it means to be a family there are others themes and symbolism in this book which means that it would serve as a fantastic group read and is even deserving of a second read but what fascinated me so much was amaranth's revelation about family by joining into polygamous relationship she had been searching for belonging and love but throughout the story she discovers that she never really received any of that from her husband or her forty nine sister wives instead she finds an unlikely family in bradley his father and their farm hand dust and in a more difficult lesson learns that not all love is meant to be sometimes you just have to let someone you love go while i did not completely agree with amaranth's decision at the end of the book i understood - at least in part - why she left sorrow sometimes though we hate to admit it those we love are beyond our help and never really wanted us to begin with it is a painful lesson but one i respect it is also interesting to read the story from younger sister amity's perspective she's a growing girl of twelve suddenly thrown from a life she knew and was comfortable with to an entirely knew one the struggles she works through are frighteningly realistic and at many points in the book i felt sorry for the young girl much of the book from amity's perspective is a coming of age story a narrative of how she finds her place in the world after having been kept from if for so long and even at the end of the book the reader is left wondering if she has come to any real resolution concerning her origins and where she intends to go overall a very interesting read","260":"i kept hoping for better news an upward turn something positive and completed the book feeling bitter and sad","261":" every time a religious cult is featured on the news i wonder how anyone could have willingly joined it and put faith in its beliefs amity and sorrow does a good job at presenting how something that seemingly starts out good can become so twisted and how hope love and a desire to belong can become ties almost too powerful to break although the novel begins with amity sorrow and amaranth's escape from the religious cult various chapters flash back to their experiences living in a polygamous community these flashbacks themselves work backward so each successive one dates back to an earlier time this structure helps to demonstrate the warning signs that amaranth ignored or tried to brush away because she so desperately wanted to be loved and wanted a place to call home these flashbacks are juxtaposed with the mother and daughter's attempts to heal after their escape amity sorrow and amaranth each have their own ways of coping with what happened to them though they seem incapable of working through their troubles together they each seek a separate solace their ways of coping are telling and show just how warped their worldviews have become this is not an easy book to read and many sections are downright disturbing but it provides an interesting perspective on what life might be like inside a religious cult and what might drive someone both toward and away from that life","262":"wasn't sure how to rate this book it was a topic very foreign to me would make an interesting movie","263":" cults members of cults a mother and her two daughters a farmer in oklahoma and his somewhat adopted son rust and an old man these are the characters that make up this debut novel i found the writing addictive this novel taught me more than any other book about the reasons people join cults and the effect that being the member of a polygamous cult has on its people amity who is twelve is the main narrator and we see the world through her eyes when her mother takes her and her sister escaping from the cult and a fire that has a devastating impact the girls are lost having been raised in the cult the older sister sorrow wants only to go back to what she has known i can't quite figure out if sorrow is just really messed up from this cult or is she is a psychopath or both but she was one very messed up character we see through amity's eyes as she eats her first doritto sees a television for the first time and meets a boy who is not her brother there is a perfect balance in this novel between looking back and experiencing now i found it a very powerful book one where questions are inferred in the beginning and the reader is slowly lead to the answer charity and love are sharply contrasted against greed and selfishness the ending is a revelation and one that ends with a sense of hope","264":"'amity and sorrow' follows the story of amaranth and her two daughters amity and sorrow fleeing from a fire started at their home amaranth takes her daughters to escape from their father and the religious cult group he has created after a car crash the three of them set up camp on a farmer's land as they've no where else to go a touching relationship between amaranth and bradley the farmer begins to develop amity starts to discover that the world does not work in the way in which she and sorrow were led to believe and flashbacks uncover some uncomfortable truths about their past lives it feels at times to be a disjointed story in terms of plot however the recurring themes of love the corruption of power the constraints and devastation blind devotion can cause boundaries real and imagined and regrowth and hope are both dramatic and moving the way these themes are threaded throughout the narrative make a compelling story and the language is breathtakingly beautiful recommended","265":"interesting","266":"an excellent read stumbled across this book in the library and was hooked from the first page a mother and her 2 daughters escape from religious cult the girls have no skills to live outside the cult and all three are vulnerable a fascinating well written story","267":" had been saving this one to read on the beach and was sorely disappointed while the premise and cover had originally caught my interest the lack of development and depth made the novel honesty not a very interesting read the reader was left needing to infer too much and not in a good way i was left with so many questions that it was incredibly frustrating again not the questions i normally like to muse over after finishing a good read overall sad to say it but this one would be a book i recommend to skip","268":"great but disturbing story that takes the reader into the minds of cults you root for the mother even though you know she knew what was going on you are happy that amity has found what she needs and will go to be a happy person in the outside world you also feel bad that sorrow won't see things for what they are","269":"had potential but was very slow did not really care about any of the characters nor did it matter that the story wasn't wrapped up","270":"i just did not like this book i read some reviews and i thought that this sounded like a good story but as i got into the story i found that it went nowhere i feel like it was just a rambling story that never really said anything i felt no depth of characters and i felt that there were too many questions in this book that was never answered","271":"this books didn't have a satisfying ending for me there was no there there not what i was expecting","272":"in the same way that george dawes green brought the paranoid schizophrenic mind of romulus ledbetter to the written page in the caveman's valentine peggy riley has opened the world of a religious cult and the experience of polygamy in amity u0026amp sorrow a tremendous literary achievement from a first time novelist","273":"the writing was really beautiful but i couldn't find anyone to believe in and so many to blame for sorrow","274":"i read this at the recommendation of my niece but was not overall too impressed i've done other reading both fiction and non about escaping from fundamentalist polygamist sects and this book doesn't contribute much it took about three quarters of the way in to even figure out what time period the story was set in i could not feel sympathetic toward any of the characters well maybe the aged father who's kept locked in his room and the story just seemed to limp along before ending on an unrealistic and unsatisfying note","275":"it took me awhile to really start enjoying this book told from two different points of view the mother amaranth and her daughter amity the writing felt sparse and bare but upon reflection this seemed to be a reflection of the people who inhabit this story","276":"the premises of the story was really interesting but the delivery fell flat the writing felt disjointed and most of the time pointless i wish more time would've been spent on their before life instead of the after","277":"amazing though the subject matter could lend itself to ridicule riley never goes there people make decisions embrace what feels right and then we ride the waves sparse writing with very few wasted words eloquent and haunting i would read this again","278":"couldn't put this book down and finished it in less than two days the subject matter is seriously disturbing and i wasn't particularly happy about the way it ended because it was a little too creepy for me but the narrative just pulled me in the subject matter reminds me of room and the book of fred but i do feel that this story is darker i would have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that i felt there were a few loose ends that the author didn't resolve well enough still would recommend it as a good albeit disturbing read","279":"kept me interested and reading but it is a troubling book","280":"could not get into gave up after 1 2 way through","281":"it was ok at best and never got any better","282":"disclaimer i received a free review copy of this book at ala midwinter 2013 all quotes are based on an uncorrected textthe major drawback to this title is the ploddingly slow pace and riley's tendency to cloak everything in euphemisms so that it is difficult to determine with any certainty what is going on in this way readers are kept as ignorant as the two sisters struggling to piece together an unfamiliar world read more","283":" i received this book free to review from netgalley amyranth has taken her two teenage daughters and left the home where they had been living with her husband who thinks he is god and is preparing them for the ever imminent apocalypse and his other 49 wives and children she crashes her car and she and her daughters wind up at an old gas station where they stay with the man who owns it her younger daughter amity enjoys learning about the outside world the older daughter sorrow however wants to go home the story tells about their past and their struggles to go on in life outside of the cult","284":"great book could not put it down","285":" read my full review http bit ly 13id9utmy opinion although i had liked the general story of this book i couldn't get past the writing style of this author although i do feel it was intentional to fit the storyline i really couldn't get used to it there was just something off to it that i can't at this immediate time put my finger on now i have to admit that i have goodreads friends who loved the writing style which was present in this book on a side note although i was approved for this title by little brown and company i found that i enjoyed the print version better i started it on my ereader but finished it with a library copy i must admit that i didn't have as hard of a time with the writing style in the print version as i did in the ereader version","286":"bit of a mixed bag almost too clever for itself if you liked the 19th wife you will find this interesting although i'm not too sure enjoy would be a word you could use still i am glad i read it and completed it","287":"the writing was pretty strong albeit a bit redundant at times i felt like the drama of what was actually happening did not come across well in the tone at times it seemed like the author just skipped parts of the story the book was simplistic","288":"very emotionally story","289":"why did i read this to the end i must be a masochist or some kind of helpless optimist hoped the book would somehow redeem itself it did not cliche after boring cliche and boring characterization including the predictable religious fundamaniacs 'nuff said","290":"this book started off interesting then half way into it it got too weird don't spend the money","291":"not a bad read but a bit of a disappointing end","292":"i did not like this book i wondered what would happen and thought it couldn't get worse but it really did","293":"it was just dumb","294":" amaranth flees a cult she has belonged to for years taking her two daughters amity and sorrow with her left to burn in a fire started by the father himself are forty nine other wives and their children amaranth is constantly worried that her husband will come after her and the girls even as she settles into a life she never would have expected for herself amity is content to start a new life with her mother but sorrow is determined to go back to the cult's temple even if there is nothing left there there is a constant struggle between the women doing what they can to save themselves versus what they were raised to think is right and wrong from the cult the story is told interspersed with chapters of backstory letting the reader see how the cult functioned before it was ruined this book reads like a classic required in an english class and i mean that in the best way possible it is accessible interesting and darkly gothic while being easy and entertaining to read","295":"interesting book in terms plot very well written would love to read anything else she wrote","296":"i liked the book the subject matter was a difficult one and there are some really disturbing scenes but it was written well once you get used to the way the author writes it it jumps from flashbacks to their life in the cult to present day on the run from the prophet the characters are well fleshed out and the interaction is good overall a very good book","297":" how peggy riley can write such a compelling and insightful book without having been involved in a cult herself i do not know she has obviously carried out extensive research the insight she gives into how the cult develops and the people slowly change as a result is remarkable it makes everything so plausible and you can understand how sensible people can get drawn in amaranth a mother of two becomes aware that what is happening in the cult is wrong but she had a 'normal' background and upbringing by introducing two daughters who have been born into and then treated individually and differently within in the cult riley can show how people can react in a different way when removed from an environment that they have been brought up in how will removing amity and sorrow from the 'family' affect them it is the only thing they have known the story involves rape polygamy arson and incest but it is remarkably well written tasteful and not over gory or descriptive you think you know how the story is going to pan out but there are a few surprises this book may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely an eye opener and a very good informational read","298":"an unusual story about a mum u0026amp her daughters that escape from a cult kept me reading probably would give it 3 1 2 stars","299":"this is a story about standing on your own and starting over it also shows us the influence that community has on us","300":"all i can do is agree with those who thought the premise was pathetic","301":"yucky a family living with a polygamist 50 wives he impregnates a daughter the story is about amaranth wife #1 trying to escape with her daughters there were some good parts to the story but the situation was too much creepy","302":"it took me some time to get into this book and as others have said it's not always easy to read but it is a beautifully drawn portrait of how and why some get drawn into cults and how difficult it can be to escape both literally and spiritually as the blurb says it's about sex or love farming and god lyrical expansive in reach and thought and in the end compelling","303":"i kept reading this book because i am interested in fringe religious groups especially plural marriage arrangements that said the plot was slow and i didn't like some of the main characters read at it when i had nothing else to do","304":" thought i would enjoy this book a story of a mother and two daughters escaping from a polygamous cult i did read the whole book but a number of things bothered me 1 the overly stylized writing was probably intended to make the story more allegorical but it started to annoy over time 2 the book is set in current time but many of the details seem to be from the 1950's no telephone rabbit ear television sets 3 the only characters i liked at all were the farmer his father and his adopted son who were lesser characters 4 the details on the cult itself didn't make a lot of sense to me even with knowing that cult leaders are often crazy for example the father husband was gone for many months each year but none of the wives tried to teach their children to learn their abcs count or any type of useful skill 5 i don't mind sex scenes in books but these scenes were just written in an odd way that just seemed icky","305":" there comes a book that simply makes you think amity u0026amp sorrow is definitely the type of book that makes me think about religion family mothers sisters and home peggy riley has managed to make a beautiful novel from some pretty difficult subjects such as incest polygamy cults and abuse riley manages to make this novel not one of sadness or lasciviousness yet still tell the truth in a very insightful truthful way amaranth and her daughters amity and sorrow are found by a farmer named bradley after having crashed their car on his property amaranth's been driving for four days straight to put as much distance between herself and her husband zacariah of whom she is afraid will find her bradley is a little taken aback by the woman and her girls dress and the fact that they are bined together by fabric bradley is unable to conceal his concern or his crabby nature bradley offers them refuge at his home until they can evaluate what to do and where to go early in this novel riley subjects the readers to one of the major issues that concerns this novel sorrow's miscarraige in a gas station bathroom although riley makes it evident that there is something amiss with this family and that perhaps they have been abused maybe sexually physically and mentally riley slowly pulls down the layers that are these people we meet on their way to finding a new life the characters in this novel are especially well drawn and have such depth and richness bradley the widow was my favorite character i loved his honesty in telling amaranth to get her self together and she's the reason her children are the way they are amaranth's character explores the depth's a mother will go to in order to protect her children and family amity is only one ready to move forward but she's still evidently naive sorrow is just what she is named for she longs to be back at the temple with her father who she believes is the only true preacherman i don't blame her for the way she is but i found her to be very defective and inexorable she reminds me of a lot of people in my family that are super christians in regards to her belief in her faith the book switches between the past and the present seemlessly i'm happy that riley included the past and how amaranth came to be a part of a religious cult that is always the first thing on anyone's mind the next is how why did you leave amaranth's story is similar to nonfiction accounts of how she became an accomodating first of 50 wives amity u0026amp sorrow is a culmination of a lot of ideas that can be discussed and researched for ever i've tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible so i conclude by saying that i did like this book a lot with its clever plot and poetic lines the ending was perfect although a little dreadful but i don't see how it could have ended any better lover's of women's literature will need to read this book","306":"the premise of this book seemed promising a mother and her two daughters flee a polygamous cult and try to find a new life after crashing their car in oklahoma but it just made no sense i felt like i had jumped in too far into the plot characters were just falling in love too quickly and other characters just paraded in and out i only kept reading to see what happened to them which turned out to be strange and also too movie perfect","307":"this was a really interesting book the story is well developed over the course of the novel and keeps your attention","308":"i was approved to read a galley copy of this novel from netgalley amity u0026amp sorrow may be a fairly slim volume but it touches on a lot of heavy issues such as polygamy freedom of religion cult like extremity for lack of a better word and letting go of the past it's not an easy read as there are a lot of implications about the lives they had led prior to their escape the author's writing is lyrical in the way it describes the thoughts and experiences that the characters are going through the characters were also interesting and the way that they adjust to their new situation i was however frustrated at times with the novel mainly with sorrow's characterisation on the one hand i could not blame her for acting the way that she did given the way that she was raised but on the other hand it was hard to sympathise with her especially as she didn't have a pov of her own in the novel amity u0026amp sorrow is a fascinating novel looking at the psychological effects of breaking out of a cult and re adjusting to the world outside i actually rated this novel as a 3 5 out of 5 and recommend this novel to readers who like reading contemporary fiction and those who are curious about the following subject matter that this novel touches upon my complete review of the novel was originally posted at eclectictales com http www eclectictales com blog 201","309":"i really enjoyed the idea of this novel and while it was very well written it was missing something for me the characters are compelling though and it was a pretty quick read","310":" how annoying loved the first bit then tidied up for a home wedding sadly i can'd find where i've stored it i'll have to download the ebook just before christmas i have finally finished this epic read there was so much to reflect about family and faith the ending was sad i should have expected that the whole pologomy thing was shocking even though i knew a bit about waco the man who thought he was god was an abuser his twisting of the word a disgrace grandad had the heathiest faith of all at this time when we are considering jesus as our saviour i'm moved by this tale and i'm glad that i know the true healer the writing is informed and sensitive the symbolism creative the writng gave me an insight into some painful history the strength of women was championed that's always good","311":"amity and sorrow had good potential but fell short for me the basic story line is about a mother and her two girls who are fleeing from a polygamous cult the plot was strong but the characters seemed overall lacking and weak the beginning and ending were strong but seemed to lose momentum in the middle","312":"it was only ok i read it for my book club but wouldn't recommend it to others","313":"my main reaction at this point is just feeling thankful to have finished amity u0026amp sorrow started out with an interesting premise and unusual imagery but didn't really go anywhere by the midpoint the story felt flat and lacking in energy and i had to convince myself to finish","314":"the current cultural spotlight on polygamous cults has peaked my interest in the subject and it was for this reason that i decided to accept the invitation of little brown and company to read an arc of amity u0026amp sorrow a novel peggy riley's debut novel and review it i started the book with trepidation as several of my friends thought that it was just okay at first i thought i would agree but the more i got into the story the more that i realized that this book was going to be one that spoke to me on a certain level the success of cults in our culture is a subject that has fascinated me for quite a while for this reason i am drawn to books where the cult phenomena takes center stage i admit my purpose in reading these stories is to try to shed some light on why cults are so successful amaranth is the first wife of zachariah the patriarch of a polygamous cult the central story in this book revolves around what happens to her when she decides to flee the cult and take her two daughters amity u0026amp sorrow with her the three of them end up in oklahoma stuck on a farm in the middle of nowhere with the man who owns the farm his father and his adopted son the compelling story of what transpires between the girls their mother and the inhabitants of the farm and how it transforms the lives of everyone involved is only half of the story though the other half of the story is about their life in the cult which is told through the memories of the three characters that escaped the cult it is this part of the story where the author attempts to answer the basic question about the psychology of a cult that is my prime fascination these two sides of amity u0026amp sorrow's story and the way that the author was able to successfully entwine them was what drew me into this book i also liked the way that the author used the characters of amaranth sorrow amity bradley his father and dust to represent the various layers of the story through the individual stories of these characters we see the contrast between the world of the true believer the world of the non believer and the world of those still trying to make up their minds when discussing this book with friend the most common negative comment that i came across was the author's unconventional writing style i do admit the writing style was different and for the first few chapters i found it a bit distracting after i got into the story though it ceased being something to overcome and became an integral part of the story as a whole in fact as the story continued i felt that the author's writing style like the behavior of some of the main characters became less strange and more normal for want of a better word all in all i found this book its characters and what it had to say about the psychology of a cult interesting it showed me various sides of a question that fascinates me and took me on a journey that i was glad to take i thank little brown and company for the opportunity to read and review it","315":"rating 2 5 5 rounded up to 3 stars for goodreads i picked up this book because i found the subject matter - a mother running away from a fundamentalist cult with her daughters - new and interesting the first couple of chapters were intriguing and left me wanting to read further to learn more about amaranth and her daughters amity and sorrow and their experiences in the cult unfortunately my interest in the book started to dwindle after those initial chapters the book is beautifully written author peggy riley has a way with words and was able to paint a day and desolate world in a beautiful way i enjoyed how her descriptions were enough to set the scene but also allowed the reader to fill in with their imagination and own interpretations that being said the narrative is very choppy it keeps jumping between the present and various moments in the past it also jumps between amaranth's narration and amity's at times i was left feeling confused as to whether these events were happening in the present or in the past certain events were left hanging because of these time jumps which led to even more confusion for me this was the weakest point of the book for me and made it less enjoyable than i expected it would be i also felt very disconnected from the characters especially sorrow the disjointed nature of the narrative resulted in none of the characters being fully developed i enjoyed reading how amaranth ended up marrying and helping to found the cult but i was left wanting to understand her more amity's character was underdeveloped as well i enjoyed her voice and found that it was interesting to see her struggle with wanting to keep peace between her mother and sorrow yet also struggle with jealousy toward her sister the weakest character for me was sorrow i thought she was fascinating on the surface she was the only one of the three whose faith in the cult's beliefs never really wavered but she also remained a very superficial character her over the top actions ended up turning her into the cliched characterization of a \"girl in a cult\" for me still the relationship and dynamic between the mother and daughters as well as with the new people who enter their lives was interesting riley created fascinating characters and story for these people i just wish she'd delved further into it amity u0026amp sorrow while being a relatively short read in terms of page numbers is by no means an easy read the subject matter is intense and at times very disturbing readers with triggers for abuse please be careful while reading this book as abuse is a common theme throughout thank you netgalley and little brown u0026amp company for the chance to read and review this book","316":"certainly not the usual type of book i read it did give me a good insight u0026amp a bit more of an understanding into cult living i found the book a bit slow really","317":"a very different book but quite the story","318":" amity u0026amp sorrow opens with a mother amaranth running away with her daughters amity and sorrow when her car crashes in rural oklahoma amaranth is taken in by bradley a farmer who is reeling from the departure of his wife the illness of his father and the problems of farming in hard times as the story unfolds we learn that amaranth and her daughters are running from a polygamous cult when the cult was raided because of allegations of child abuse amaranth grabbed her daughters and ran as far and as fast as she could but no matter how far she has come she never stops looking over her shoulder convinced that she can never run far enough or fast enough to escape the husband she has left behind but her children know nothing of the outside world they can't read or write have never watched tv or seen a computer all they know is father and all of their mothers and the temple where sorrow was oracle first of all the children and perhaps more than daughter to her father amity can learn to adapt to a new life but sorrow will not accept a place where she is just one of many prophets who speak in tongues and tell of the coming rapture where she isn't oracle where she is not first among many daughters and wives and she will do whatever it takes to get back to father amity u0026amp sorrow is an interesting tale of love gone bad in so many ways between wives and husbands children and parents and between love of god and carnal desire and greed it is a tale of broken people leading broken lives but seeking love and redemption all the same and although they are usually looking for salvation in all the wrong places it is the very act of seeking that gives the story a sense of hope i know nothing of polygamous cults so i cannot speak to the accuracy of the way this one is depicted but it makes for a fascinating portrait of so many wives spinning around the altar their long skirts flaring out around them celebrating each return of their husband and each new wife he brings with them although set in modern times it felt much older perhaps because of the isolation both of the cult and of the farm but also because of the references to grapes of wrath steinbeck's wonderful novel of oklahoma farmers during the great depression the story also switches time as it slowly allows us to see how amaranth's story and that of her children unfolded and how so much love and hope had become so tainted and why she was trying so hard to put things right even though it is clear that not everything or everybody can be fixed i won't say i enjoyed this novel it was disturbing in a whole lot of ways especially in the characters of sorrow and father but it certainly kept my attention it is a relatively short tale but not an easy one but then whoever said things had to be easy to be good","319":" review found on the life u0026amp times blog i have always had a bit of an interest in cults but this is the very first time i have read a book pertaining to them i am glad that i gave this one a try it was different than my normal reads but in a good way the story interchanged from the past to the present to show what lead amity and sorrows' mom amaranth to join the polygamous cult they were in and what promoted her years later to finally make the big decision to pick up and leave amity and sorrow's previous life on the farm restricted their ability to do a lot because of this it's pretty understandable that they would struggle with trying to fit into the new modern world they have been thrown into amity is loyal to a fault when it comes to her sister even though it's a struggle she seemed more willing to try and forge a new life for herself sorrow is supposed to be the special and chosen one from her community forced to leave everything behind she still did not want to give her past life up she wanted to go back to her old life and the way things were because that was all she knew my only big issue was that i felt like amaranth should have done something sooner than she had originally i thought she waited too late amity u0026amp sorrow is a slow and steady paced novel that was easy to read through but it is not a light story by any means it has some dark sad and definitely heart tugging moments the writing style was for lack of a better word...different but it did not stop me from enjoying the story and less i wasn't terribly happy with the ending though but amity u0026amp sorrow turned out to be a nice change of pace for me i liked it i received this book on behalf of little brown and company in exchange for nothing but my honest opinion thank you","320":"interesting book about cults and their ability to hold others while others can escape","321":" mother and 2 daughters flee their fundamentalist compound father is an spring summer itinerant preacher who has 50 wives they live on a compound without the bare necessities amity and sorrow know nothing about the outside world they have never left the compound and don't know how to read or write amy the mother and daughters leave driving to anywhere and land in ok after their car crashes i almost stopped reading it but read through it was good not great but would make a good book club book lots of interesting things to discuss","322":" two young girls and their mother are running away from a controlling leader of a religious cult and are involved in a car accident on the property of a farmer as they recover both physically and emotionally the mother begins to fall with the farmer one of her daughters is accepting of the situation but the other daughter wants to return to her former life the author made references to stories of cults that took place recently i felt she had done her research although i find it hard to relate to the lifestyle that the women had left behind i sympathized with the younger daughter the book will make you think about the choices that people make and how they have to come to terms with these choices an interesting read this would be good for book clubs","323":"though the topics are somewhat disturbing the use of language in some of the descriptions is just beautiful","324":"fascinating riveting amazing storytelling exquisite character development this is tale of desperation and of devotion an education a ferocious read","325":"review forthcoming","326":" this was a quick compelling read that though ostensibly about a polygamous cult is more about the relationships between women as sisters daughters mothers and friends set on an arid farm in oklahoma the language is vivid the plot moves swiftly and the chaaracters reveal themselves in slow progressive layers my only two admittedly nitpicky complaints with the book were the somewhat two dimensional characterization of sorrow which was a shame as she had potential to be much more complex and sympathetic and the author's heavy leaning on what is quite frankly an outdated and stereotypical representation of oklahoma as an arid land of dust i appreciate the blatant homage to 'the grapes of wrath' but the dust bowl migrations happened in the 1930s and really aren't that indicative of or relevant to modern day oklahoma all in all this was an enjoyable and almost cinematic read and i wouldn't be surprised if it was optioned for a film as it would definitely lend itself to the screen","327":"far fetched and annoying","328":"amity u0026amp sorrow is a very disturbing book the story left me enraged and frustrated and i dispised nearly all the characters nevertheless it was an intriguing read very different and even ugly but totally engrossing when people are brainwashed and don't know any better the consequences can be harrowing read it and find out","329":"this story spun out from its beginning like a shell from its center normally i haven't the patience for slow fiction but this was slow fiction that had enough hooks to draw me and the plot forward the interstitial chapters are not only a great idea to keep the reader curious but a possibly unintentional homage to the grapes of wrath which plays a significant role in amity's share of the book i hoped i would like it i'm glad i was right","330":" i was very unsure about this book and found it quite hard to get through i had a few moments when i thought to myself why am i wasting my time with this rubbish and nearly gave up but i so hate not finishing books i managed to finish it in the end the story is about an end of the world cult featuring one man zachariah who has set himself up as a messiah type figure and his fifty wives the wives are a disparate bunch old and young but they all have one thing in common desperation they're all either ex alcoholics or drug addicts or marginalised people who are just lonely and need something that in itself provides a comment on the society we live in the main character amaranth flees the cult when someone possibly zachariah or maybe one of her daughters sorrow has decided that the end of the world has come and sets fire to the chapel house with everyone in it taking her children amity and sorrow she takes refuge in the dustbowl of oklahoma and sets about repairing the mess that brainwashing has made of her children what the story really clearly shows is the fallacy of some religious beliefs the children have been told not to walk in the fields which amaranth is just a rule that's been made up to prevent the detection of drug manufacture which is going on in their property in fact the whole religion which was supposed to be about love and family has just been made up by one selfish man with a criminal record the story holds this fact up plainly and is admitted by amaranth but at the same time there is a serious question over the nature of religious faith the brainwashed girls still believe in their god i e their father it's a dark desperately disturbing tale","331":" amity u0026amp sorrow teen sisters who know no other life than the sheltered polygamous sect in which they were raised with 50 mothers u0026amp dozens of siblings are suddenly bewildered by the outside world but that's where they find themselves now that their mother has grabbed them u0026amp made a run for it to escape her domineering u0026amp radical husband who is devout to his self brand of religion mother u0026amp daughters are attempting to adjust u0026amp an oklahoma farmer is the first to open a path to independence but throughout the ordeal the girls have opposing aims u0026amp that tension is the heart of the story when i read scenes holding my breath with heart racing i realized i was torn too should i feel sorry for or cower from sorrow will there be redemption or is the damage done beyond repair and can i get by with just three hours sleep since i can't put this","332":"weird disturbing hard to follow didn't kind it at all","333":"the ending was just like the author got tired of writing","334":" amity and sorrow are sisters whose mom amaranth has driven far away from the only home they've ever known trying to get away from that life they'd been living in a polygamist cult where their father had 50 wives of whom amaranth was the first amaranth has now realized that she needs to get them away from that life but she believes her husband will stop at nothing to find her and is desperate to stay hidden the three women end up staying with a farmer named bradley who's kind of quiet and keeps to himself and slowly learning about the world while there amity is shyly exploring what the new life has to offer but sorrow is depressed and psychotic about wanting to return home and will stop at nothing to make this happen the book's pacing is very slow the writing is almost dreamlike but not in a way that i enjoyed so little happened yet so many words were spent lingering over details and trite interactions that i often lost track of what if anything was going on there were also scenes were names weren't immediately used and he and she were used as if the reader should understand who was being referred to on multiple occasions i had to flip back pages to figure out what i was reading about because of this slowness and inherent lack of urgency to the story despite amaranth's constant refrain that her husband would find her i had a really difficult time getting through chapters it felt like no matter how much i read nothing happened nothing changed i also never believed there was any real danger because there didn't seem to be real tension even if a plot is thin and there's not much action in a book i can overlook it if the characters are amazing enough that i care about them unfortunately none of the characters in this book felt well developed there were some flashbacks in which i saw amaranth's life before leaving her husband but i never got a good understand of why she thought it was a good place to be to start especially since that wasn't how she was raised i also had a hard time relating to amity or sorrow amity was slightly inquisitive which was nice but other than that trait her character didn't seem to have much depth sorrow on the other hand was extremely unlikable to the point where i could barely read about her without wanting to scream it wasn't just that she was sheltered and didn't understand how the world worked after all amity had grown up the same way it was that sorrow had zero redeeming qualities she was just a psychopath and i couldn't understand why anyone around her put up with her let alone cared i read a little over halfway through this book not particularly enjoying it but figuring i may as well finish then i came to a scene in which i realized that i couldn't take any more of this sorrow became such an awful evil person that i couldn't handle reading any more about her and i definitely could not sympathize i flipped to the end curious where the book was going and whether anything would ever actually happen after skimming the end i'm glad i didn't finish it i would have been unbelievably frustrated if i'd spent any more time on this book just to get to the end i have no idea what the point of this book was and there are way better books out there about dysfunctional families and polygamy definitely not recommended i received a free advanced copy of this book through the first reads program","335":"i was surprised by how much i liked this book it's very literary and the story centers around a woman who pulls her two daughters out of an isolationist religious sect and flees this is not the kind of book i normally feel myself drawn to it dealt with a lot of hairy issues the writing is incredible it's beautiful and carefully handles all sorts of things i didn't expect it to if you don't mind some heavy stuff in your reading this is a powerful beuatiful book about family and the ways faith impacts our lives","336":"i won this book as a firstread the only thing i can really say about this book is wow the story line is definitely original and sets itself apart from other books i can't imagine what it would have been like to be amity or sorrow and see the 'normal' world for the first time after having been raised in their cult compound i felt so sorry for them for being raised that way and kept hoping for them to adjust to life outside the compound the story kept me hooked through the end","337":"didn't couldn't wouldn't i didn't like the voice the pacing or the plot line","338":" once in a while there's a book that comes your way and it just falls into your lap amity u0026amp sorrow is a book that came my way by accident i received notification that i was pre approved for a few titles from little brown and company and decided to check them out i devoured peggy riley's book and it's a powerful debut amaranth and her daughters are on the run and by the fourth day exhausted due to lack of sleep amaranth crashes into a tree she finds a gas station and pleads for help but the farmer bradley in charge of the station tells her he can't he insists she needs to call her husband for help but she refuses taking shelter under his porch amaranth and her daughters find refuge while bradley begins to open up and live life slowly secrets are unearthed and it's a tragic story to read amity u0026amp sorrow is told in a series of flashbacks alongside the present and readers get a full account of the life amaranth and her daughters experienced in a fundamentalist cult it's a life we can only imagine and it's a heartbreaking experience amaranth is the first wife of fifty and she realizes early on that her husband isn't exactly who he says he is she questions his actions but at the same time is grateful that he saved her at the time she went along with his rules and regulations but on the night the temple was set on fire realizing he wanted them dead she suddenly has the courage to save her daughters the writing is powerful with rich descriptions for example amity experiences the taste of doritos for the first time a \"dance of salt and chemicals\" on the tongue when amaranth realizes she's not the first woman in her husband's life \"her barbies had no wedding gowns -- not a one of the eight barbies who lived with the single ken in their plastic house on their cardboard beds in sin \" i reread that sentence a few times and wow what a powerful way to describe the moment of the life she's now living riley's research is extensive and thorough there's a scene where amaranth goes to the temple and there's clothes strewn about and she thinks for a moment that the rapture really happened only to realize that the clothes are what people left behind that scene really hit home as to what zachariah must have preached we don't get a lot of character development outside the three protagonists bradley and dust are floating the background and i would have loved to know more about dust's personal background regarding his family it would have been nice to find out more about bradley's relationship with his own wife and perhaps the details as to why she left despite the lack of their backgrounds i came to realize that this is about amaranth and her daughters it's their story about how they came to be and fled while bradley wants her to do the right thing that is contact police amaranth can't because she's still bound to whatever hold zachariah has on her she takes full responsibility for the way her children turn out especially with regards to sorrow there's one scene towards the end that is powerful and moving no mother wants to leave a child behind but she realizes she's done all that she can and she can't save anyone who doesn't want to be saved if i can take a moment i'd like to discuss amity and sorrow sorrow is the eldest daughter out of all the children zachariah has there's much emphasis put on her as the oracle and the one that can foretell the future amity is told to just watch and her power lies with her hands and healing people it's natural that amity wants to hold onto dust because she's the first to come in contact with him and he's the first to befriend her as well as bradley's father when sorrow begins to garner attention from dust and the old man amity is jealous but she'd devoted to sorrow it's easy to see how amaranth placed sorrow in amity's hands i won't say what sorrow does but my heart broke for amity and even in the end amity is devoted to her i don't know if this because the way she was raised or if it's just sisterly affection and devotion there are few unanswered questions one primarily is how dust was able to take sorrow back to idaho since it's made clear early on that both girls do not know where they are from i also think back to the scene in the library where dust looks up information when amity asks for his assistance and therefore i can sort of understand how he may have come up with a location there's also the question regarding garments at one point riley writes how bradley has to tear amaranth's shift because they are sewn in and yet zachariah has no problem lifting her skirts for sex i debated with the rating and in the end decided on a solid five because of the rich writing and emotional aspect i was emotionally drained and even as i write this review i have tears because your heart aches for amity and what she went through and even more so for sorrow because she's a lost cause you'll think of every person you know that is lost and succumbs to a cult leader wishing you could give them what they are looking for and trying to protect them peggy riley's amity u0026amp sorrow is powerful and at the end you'll see the world a little different if you're not a religious person this book isn't filled with a lot of religious undertones and therefore you'll have no problem reading long if you're a sensitive person i do have to warn you there's a disconcerting scene involving sorrow and i won't say exactly what it is because it would be a major spoiler but do keep in mind that there are heavy issues involved review originally posted at literary etc","339":"this review can be found on my blog the mis adventures of a twenty something year old girl so when i read the blurb about this book it definitely interested me i find these kind of cults interesting amity u0026amp sorrow a novel by peggy riley is such a good read when it comes to religious cults and just a great read in general amaranth is on the run from her polygamous cult leader husband she's also brought her two children amity and sorrow with her when she crashes her car in oklahoma she doesn't plan on staying however after spending time with bradley she wants to stay sorrow her eldest child wants to go back to her father amity just wants to make her sister happy sorrow will do anything she can to get back to the compound and her father will amaranth stay with bradley or will she miss the compound's ways the title is pretty straight forward amity and sorrow are the names of the children in this book i kind of like the title although i think it's not very original the cover is simplistic i was a bit confused though when i started reading the book because the two girls look like adults judging by what their bodies look like amity is supposed to be 12 years old and although sorrow's age is never revealed she is referred to as a child i think the cover would've suited this book better had it looked like a pre teen and a teenage girl holding hands the setting and world building were done beautifully everything was written the way i'd think a polygamous cult would be and the how the people in it would act riley's portrayal of a woman who escaped from a religious cut is fantastic i can not fault the pacing in this book not once was i bored when reading amity u0026amp sorrow a novel every chapter ending left me wanting more every page came alive in my mind for me the characters were very well developed and well written i enjoyed reading about amity i loved her innocence and the way she was protective of her sister i couldn't stand sorrow not because she wasn't written well but because i just found her to be so much of a spoiled brat amaranth was a great character and i thought she was a great mother to her children like the pacing the dialogue is fantastic the children who were raised in the religious cult speak the way i'd imagine them too the dialogue between the characters is very interesting there's no real swear words although there are sexual references amity u0026amp sorrow a novel by peggy riley is a fantastic read that will leave its readers thinking about it long after they've finished the ending it is a touching story about love survival and the human spirit i'd recommend this book to everyone aged 16 due to sexual references and adult themes i received this book for free from the goodreads firstreads program","340":"this was interesting verrrrry interesting getting glimpses of this particular cult's lifestyle was nice pieces here and there interspersed between this present day fish out of water story at times it felt like this story could've been set in depression era and then it was suddenly modern again but i liked that the characters were very interesting though sometimes i couldn't get a handle on them amaranth was up and down back and forth but i didn't totally get her darkness that she had amity was most real to me the most human of them stuck in that place between childhood and not jealous and unsure and trying so hard to hold on to sorrow even when sorrow hurt her and sorrow that child was something else she legitimately seemed like a psychopath most of the time and i suppose the ending was fitting though it didn't altogether satisfy me the loose ends were tied up but it still didn't quite feel complete maybe because they didn't really change that much overall though it was a very enjoyable enthralling read","341":"i received this book as part of goodreads first reads what an amazing story i loved how the author based on the q u0026amp a in the back pulled information from two other books that i had previously read because i felt i was able to understand the dynamics of the story in greater detail i don't know if this story should be considered a tragedy but there are definitely tragic moments i look forward to reading more from this author","342":"http maryward booktrib com reviews","343":"i will make it short and sweet a stupid book about a bunch of stupid women","344":"a strange compelling tale which gripped me by the cover and the names of the characters i couldn't put it down but found it unclear towards the end i don't fault that as not all is tidy in life it is certainly believable cult behavior i would read more from this author i think it's her first novel","345":" with memories of nothing but the polygamous compound they were raised on sisters amity and sorrow long for home when their mother amaranth packs them up and drives for days to escape amaranth reaches the dry plains of oklahoma before her heavy eyes betray her and she crashes the family car destroying her chances of completely getting away thankfully she wrecks near land owned by bradley a lonely farmer willing to help but unaware of the swirling family dynamics he is about to take on though it starts immediately after the car crash with little background information to settle in on the novel soon gains its footing as amaranth begins to reveal pieces of her former life as the first of fifty wives she raised her daughters under the strict religious code dictated by her husband however amaranth can only overlook the moral gray area the group survives in for so long before deciding to save her daughters from her husband's next move \"children were curious even her children how would they know where their own bodies stopped and someone else's began if everything was shared here in this world there were women on display spread eagled over paper women who looked like whores but weren't while her family her children were dressed like saints like nuns or pilgrims but were not and never had been once the family takes shelter on bradley's oklahoma farm conflict brews between sorrow who is determined to return to life with her father and easily adapting amity riley's writing begins to shine in dark but beautifully penned passages though much of the novel is not easy to read amity u0026amp sorrow digs to the depths of human connection in an eerily compelling way read more at www rivercityreading com","346":"had potential but in the end i thought meh","347":"for some reason was expecting great things from this but in the end it was only so so can't really articulate what it was that i found off putting definitely a slow mover although i did like the end","348":"interesting subject a woman trying to leave her past and save her daughters from a restrictive religious sect cult while the subject was intriguing and characters had depth the book did not flow for me i felt as if we were getting the story in a disjointed way taking away from the storyline","349":"whelp there is something that can't be undone time that can't be gotten back this is a middling book at best but i hung because it was an easy bedtime read and sometimes a middling a book has a shining moment or two this would be a middling book that went right down the toilet there isn't much there then there is less then what's left isn't anything a person would want oof it's bad a lot of people have commented on not liking any of the characters i'm not one who needs to like someone in a narrative though i do prefer having someone to root for even a minor character so if you are thinking hey i don't care if they are likable i care if they are interesting you still don't want to read this book they aren't interesting jeez it's bad","350":" although amity u0026amp sorrow is a fairly short novel at just 284 pages in the advance paperback edition it is an intense and at times very difficult story to read the subject matter is quite harrowing and a subject that is rarely touched upon in fiction and the writing is quite unique and distinct it takes a little while to get used to the style amaranth and her two daughters amity and sorrow are fleeing their home they have driven across country for four days and the only reason that they have stopped is because amaranth has crashed the car stranded in the middle of nowhere not knowing where they are or where to go they are discovered by brad a farmer who seems unconcerned by their plight doesn't comment on their strange dress and allows them to camp out on his land amaranth cannot let go of her memories and despite the fact that she knows that she had to flee her thoughts return time and time again to her husband the father of her girls amaranth is his first wife the first of his 50 wives and she was instrumental in establishing the cult that they have left behind amity and sorrow have no idea what it is like to speak with ordinary people to allow anyone to see their hair to walk through a field they have no conception of what is acceptable behaviour in the real world all they have known is life as part of a huge family with rules with terror with abuse amity relishes this new world but sorrow wants nothing more than to return to her father and their old life a lot of this story is told in 'flash back' form when amaranth remembers their life and how they were treated the reader has quite a lot of reading between the lines to do as events emerge slowly and are often hinted at rather than explained fully reading amity and sorrow reminded me of watching films by director m night shyamalan especially the film the village there is a darkness about the writing and about the story that can be quite creepy at times amity and sorrow is an intriguing story with an ending that is unexpected and quite shocking and leaves the reader with lots of questions peggy riley is an accomplished author with an unusual and quite quirky writing style that although fairly difficult to engage with at the beginning becomes enchanting by the end","351":"this book was really strange i didn't really follow it all that well even though it was as slow as they come i just didnt' feel like much was happening the kids were crazy and there was just some bizarre things in there that i wonder if they were just in there for the sake of being a bit bizarre there are better books on polygamy out there and also much better books on cults and the like i would give this one a miss","352":"twitteresque reviews are for books where i don't feel like writing a full review but i want to give you a flavour of how i felt during the book all in 140 characters or less dnf promising plot about escape from a cult but didn't deliver slow paced and too wordy i felt no connection with the characters abandoned with relief after 33%thanks to netgalley and little brown and company for giving me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest unbiased review","353":" it is written in a way that i found quite annoying at first stunted almost lacking in vocabulary and description then it becomes clear that we are listening to the voice of amity for the majority of the book that writing became irrelevant after the first few pages it is hard to explain but despite the odd flow of language the story just drew me in it was like a spider weaving an unorthodox web and enticing me to just read a little bit more i am not exactly sure if i will be able to pinpoint why but i really enjoyed this book amity her sister sorrow and their mother have escaped the clutches of the man they call husband father and god this is a story about the control of one man his congregation of fifty wives and his subsequent children this book looks polygamy straight in the face and questions the validity of its existence in our day and age it also takes a hard look at the fine line between religion and cult how mere people elevate themselves to a higher sphere and equate themselves to god then as that 'god' they use their power to control manipulate harm and abuse those that want to believe in the higher power that walks upon earth sorrow is a prime example and result of that abuse and i as reader often forgot to separate the madness from the clarity in her actions a product of the abuse the madness or perhaps a combination of everything we see amity struggle with the abandonment of the rules and whilst part of her wants to ease her sisters pain the other part acknowledges how dangerous sorrow has become their complete ignorance of anything educational or basic social skills is just another example of how these type of cults breed their own disciples they know nothing else i thoroughly enjoyed this very distinctive and memorable book i received a free copy of this book via netgalley","354":"amity and sorrow are sisters who live with their mother and father and fifty other wives of their father and multiple other children in a polygamy homestead after four days of driving non stop the mother amaranth crashes the car the girls end up on a farm and the man there takes them in bradley the farmer is unsure of these women and their ways and wishes them to leave but something is pulling the two together this book was oddly written and left a lot to the readers imagination lots of the story did not add up and there seemed to be pieces missing from the story line at times i got confused often throughout this book even though i did not finish it as i could not get into the book at all the writing seemed to miss some of the story as through the writer did not know where the book should be going at times the flash backs seemed to lack even though they were meant to give information about the girls past something was still missing i would like to thank netgalley com and the author peggy riley for my advanced e book copy of this book","355":"this book had the potential to be amazing i really enjoyed the author's style of writing what i had problems with was the underdeveloped storyline a character would go from quaking in her clogs confused about her life to making strong sexual advances to a stranger it just didn't work for me the characters seemed to have split personalities not the author's intent i also believe this book should have been edited down about 50 60 pages the ending dragged on forever not sorry that i read it just wish it would have been a stronger book","356":" i don't know about not judging a book by its cover but i certainly wish i hadn't been so influenced by this particular book cover which was the thing followed by several positive blog reviews that initially attracted me a novel about what happens when a mother amaranth one of no less than 50 wives and her two daughters amity 12 and sorrow 14 escape a polygamous cult i was hoping for a good possibly insightful read into a lifestyle that fascinates me instead of which i got this dull read which was anything but with a story line that jumped from the present day which saw the women living on a rural farm to the past which told of their lives as one of a multitude of women siblings living on what can only be described as a compound thank goodness the chapter headings differentiated between the two making a confusing read slightly less so combined with the fact that as the story progresses sorrow's story becomes one of less depth and one of what i felt was mere sensationalism and the author's awful tendency to pose a conundrum how did amaranth come to be caught up in the cult just who did set fire to the 'temple' only to defer the 'answer' until it is a distant memory that i had long since lost any real interest in or her even worse habit of beginning to explore an issue without ever running with it i ultimately found amity and sorrow a frustrating read with little to recommend it copyright tracy terry @ pen and paper","357":"this was a slow read for me thought it would be more of an intriguing read but something about the writing style really bored me in the end i was drawn into the story of a mother and her two daughters fleeing a polygamist cult","358":"this is one of those books you have hanging around the house for awhile before you pick it up and you're off i have my quibbles with the story but i did finish it the cult that amaranth and her daughters are part of is so extreme that it is hard to imagine anyone buying such nonsense or being brave enough to run from it enjoyable to read but hard to believe","359":"sad and compelling sad main character got so lost in trying to do what she thought was right","360":" i usually enjoy books about cults polygamy so when i saw this book making the rounds on book blogs i got excited to read it plus it has a pretty cool cover when i saw it in the library a few weeks ago i gave a little happy dance and grabbed it up i liked the beginning of the book a lot but after awhile i was a little creeped out by sorrow that girl should not be allowed to roam free without some serious psychological help i did however like the other characters especially bradley i wanted to like amaranth more and feel sympathy pity for her but after awhile i was like\" lady your daughter is nuts keep her away from other people \" the writing was very good the prose quite lyrical i did enjoy this book only a little less than i had thought i would rating3 out of 5","361":"couldn't make myself finish it it's so filthy though the whole coming from a cult thing was very interesting didn't need the graphic sex scenes","362":"3 5 stars but i'll bump it up to 4 for sheer originality a mother escapes from a polygamous cult with her two daughters enticing concept yes initially i was so very intrigued what were they running from why was she so upset about the fire what's sorrow's problem i quite liked peggy's writing style and liked the switch between before at the temple and now at the farm enjoying how it was slowly revealing the whole picture but after about three quarters of the way through it seemed to have answered all of my questions and still it went on it was by now that i was less intrigued and more reading to finish did the final pages leave more unanswered questions i think so maybe an original concept with partly achieved potential","363":"an excellent book club choice this was an interesting read because the author managed to evoke a kind of sureal atmosphere not in the way of fantasy but effectively depicting the strangeness of a world not previously experienced amity and sorrow are teenage sisters who have been raised in a religious commune and know nothing of the world outside they cannot read and have lived all their lives in a polygamous cult with strict rules when a suspicious fire drives their mother to escape from the commune with her two daughters the sisters find themselves in an alien world after four days of driving amaranth their mother crashes the car into a tree and they are all stranded in an isolated farm with a brusque farmer and his elderly dad the book follows their reactions to their new surroundings each of them behaves differently but they all feel a strong pull to the 'family' that they have left flashbacks provide the reader with an insight into life in the cult where one husband has taken fifty wives the children run wild with many mothers there are various rituals such as winding their chests with cloth and spinning which supposedly brings the women closer to each other but there are darker goings on behind the surface a fascinating read with a really weird feel as the girls and their mother adjust not quite five stars though because i found it a bit confusing at times this is a book that would make an excellent book group read as there are some parts that are left in the air and i'd really like to know what others thought","364":"it's a modern plot with a nice twist amity and sorrow are the daughters born to amaranth the stereotypical wife hiding from the evil abusive husband on her trail but this is not a sterotypical novel the husband has 50 wives and a god complex that has infected sorrow the older daughter get away car upended against a tree in the panhandle of oklahoma amaranth finds acceptance and love with a dry land farmer but the girls born and raised in the religious commune controlled by their father find adjusting to modern life daunting sorrow has a horrible secret slowly revealed which spins them all toward the doom from which amaranth tried to rescue them poetic poignant delicately rendered the prose draws the reader in and endears each character but the sense of tension never lessens and the ending feels inevitable and right readers who enjoyed rilla askew's mercy seat will see similarities as will those who have read the bad seed by william marsh but amity and sorrow is an original and a stand out in the genre","365":"i usually find polygamy novels intriguing and hard to put down but this one was the exception it was an effort to finish it","366":"i hope she's working on a second novel","367":" this is a book that addresses a topic i am always interested in but rarely get to read about as it doesn't seem to be a popular subject life in a cult it follows amaranth a mother and her two barely teenage daughters amity and sorrow in the aftermath of their escape from a mormon inspired closed community somewhere in the us amaranth is the first and only legal wife of the cult's founder and played a role in developing its traditions and practices although more by lack of protest than deliberate design most of the time her daughters have never seen the outside world which lends their points of view an other worldly quality as they see what to us is the everyday through new eyes - marvelling for example at how much uncessary stuff there is to buy in the average shopping street the family escape by car but are involved in a conflagration with a tree which renders them unable to continue driving and instead they pitch up on a farm owned by the gruff introspective initially indifferent but ultimately good hearted bradley who is kept company by his elderly father and a young employee unofficial foster son dust flashbacks are used to inform the reader about what life in the cult was like - stories are told of the fifty wives and their many children how they came to join the \"family\" and how everyday life was managed there","368":" this book intrigued me from the start it begins with amaranth driving a car at breakneck speed with her two daughters amity and sorrow they are escaping the compound were amaranth was wife number one out of fifty other wives the plot was tense and often disturbing but the writing was well done and i was really eager to find out more on what had happened at the compound to cause amaranth to finally escape with her two daughters amity and sorrow have know no other life and are both bewildered and confused about their new situation sorrow longs for home and her father and amity is caught between confronting a new life and about being loyal to her sister i was hoping for more of a conclusion to the story but i really don't think it could have gone any other way intense unsettling story about the religious beliefs and isolation of children from any other way of life and its affects on amaranth's daughters i received a complimentary copy from netgalley","369":" this is a tough one it's an uncomfortable read with polygamy u0026amp incest at its hear it begins with a mother amarynth amy fleeing with her two daughters amity u0026amp sorrow from a very strict isolated religious sect in utah headed by a prophet with 50 wives amy was the first when their car crashes they are stranded at an impoverished isolated oklahoma farm where they are very slowly introduced to the ways of the world the story alternates between their life on this farm the majority of the story and shorter flashbacks told mostly in reverse order of their life under the prophet in utah i kept thinking of other books that do what parts of this book do but do them better brady udall's the polygamist on polygamy and the bonds of family or the latter parts of room on learning about the world after being thoroughly isolated still despite my discomfort i found myself compelled to keep reading to see how these characters would come through their trials","370":" what would it be like to grow up within a cult where children are not taught to read because only the father reads the bible where there are 50 mothers and many many brothers and sisters where junk food and unchaste clothes are not permitted where there is no contact with the outside world no tv no newspapers no school no conversation with anyone this would all seem normal familiar and right while the rest of the world would seem dangerous overwhelming and wrong when amaranth realizes that the utopia that she hoped to create with her husband has gone disastrously wrong she flees with her daughters amity and sorrow and abruptly plunges them into a world they do not have the resources to understand or navigate amaranth is a surprising sympathetic character the author uses flashbacks to help the reader understand why amaranth was vulnerable to her husband's charisma why she stayed as long as she did and why she allowed her daughters to be raised in ignorance amity and sorrow both long to go home despite the deprivations the reader understands that they endured there but with time amity begins to wonder about the new world in which she finds herself sorrow however cannot let go of the past and the life she dreamed of having there riley's writing is gorgeous and the story intriguing although not altogether uplifting riley reminds us that choices have consequences both good and bad for us and for our children and that it is heartbreakingly hard work to move forward even after making the decision to do so","371":" i'll be haunted by this story for quite some time the narration sets a tone of fear and despair immediately the reader is thrown into the desperate frantic situation of a mother on the run with her two daughters the characters have been brainwashed and this fact is exhibited in their thoughts and actions making them very creepy and disturbing even so amity's humanity and sorrow's anger show through as does the level of their mother's desperation and ultimately her hope but the horror never truly leaves giving the reader an unsettling experience booklist gave it a starred review and while this is outside my usual genre i'd have to agree","372":"bottom line i was disappointed there was a lot of potential and some great characters but nothing seemed to come together particularly at the end i was disappointed with the lack of resolution do books always need completely tidy endings no way however amity u0026amp sorrow felt so much like a mystery being unraveled a fire building that i needed more at the end","373":"this book was very interesting and well written i was just thoroughly disturbed by it","374":" i read this book because i've always been interested in cults amity and sorrow are sisters whose mother takes them away from the cult lead by their father my problem with the book is that it's impossible to feel sympathy for any of the characters in the book the sisters have been so conditioned by their upbringing i wanted to shake them view spoiler also sorrow kills a kitten which makes her the devil in my opinion hide spoiler their mother is full of excuses and those who try to help the three of them don't actually do anything all in all i was a bit disappointed the good thing though is that i do think amity and sorrow gives an honest depiction of life in a cult the isolation from the rest of the world and the way that affects a person's mental health","375":"it was a tough decision between three and four stars for this one a beautifully written book but such a tough subject some will love this book but i think it's for a limited audience","376":"this was a really quick read for me and i definitely have a lot of opinions on what happened i would recommend it","377":"time taken to read 2 days publisher tinder presspages 326blurb from goodreadsin the wake of a suspicious fire amaranth gathers her children and flees from the fundamentalist cult in which her children were born and raised now she is on the run with only her barely aged teenage daughters amity and sorrow neither of whom have seen the outside world to help her after four days of driving amaranth crashes the car leaving the family stranded at a gas station hungry and terrified rescue comes in the unlikely form of a downtrodden farmer a man who offers sanctuary when the women need it most however while amity blossoms in this new world free from her father's tyranny sorrow will do anything to get back home although amaranth herself is beginning to understand the nature of the man she has left she needs the answer to one question what happened to the other wives and children my reviewamaranth amy is the mother of amity u0026amp sorrow all of whom have just ran from their home a fundamentalist cult shared with 50 other wives in a polygamy relationship one religious leader and other children under the eye of the police a fire breaks out and amy sees this as her chance they come upon a farmer and take refuge there the daughters want to go back to their father amy is unsure of how to behave and just wants to keep them safe but fears her husband zachariah is hot on their tails amity u0026amp sorrow is very much about fleeing from a cult that has brainwashed them and trying to reintegrate with the world the farmer tolerates their presence and doesn't kick them off his property and the story goes between the present and how they cope to snippets from the past that leads to present day to be honest this is a marmite type book some have loved it and some have hated it i am a bit of a fence sitter to be honest i liked some parts of the reintegration to society and how they each cope or fail to away from the family the characters didn't offer much depth at all snippets are revealed about what they have endured however there are so many questions left unanswered sorrow is clearly the most affected by the cult religious preaching and events that happened to her however she cuts a hard figure to connect to on any level the book covers topics of religion molestation relationships and polygamy however none go into any kind of depth which will suit some readers and irritate others the jumps from past to present aren't clearly defined and sometimes i had to check in case i had missed something as at times it seemed irrelevant i feel maybe had the book been longer and more time given to segments it really could have been a powerful read as it was i was left with questions and a lack of understanding of why the characters did and behaved as they did still worth checking out i would try this author again sometime in the future but for me this one is a 3 5","378":"i won an advanced readers copy of this book and was excited to read it because i am fascinated by the polygamist lifestyle the beginning started out interesting however i quickly lost interest and had a hard time finishing the book the characters were very underdeveloped and not like able at all the storyline that followed the escape was incredibly unrealistic i really don't like giving poor reviews but i cannot recommend this book","379":"i selected this book because of the beautiful cover the story is of a woman and her daughters who escape a polygamous cult i gained more understanding of why women join and stay in these situations i enjoyed the first half of this book better than the second half","380":"it might have been more riveting told in first person pov the flashbacks are where the meat is","381":"ugh incest pedophilia animal killing arson meth labs rampant psychosis and no one not a single character does anything to correct any of the bad","382":"i had to stop reading this about a third of the way through because it was terrible the writing was awful and strained this author just tried so hard to make everything sound divine and it all came out garbled and confusing there was no effort to connect time and place in different scenes so i was sometimes confused about the chronology and this is coming from a reader who really likes a book that skillfully distorts time the subject matter while harsh and troubling could have made for a good book the premise was on track but the execution completely flawed would not recommend","383":"i might have liked this more if i hadn't spent time studying religious cults and homegrown faith in america but as it was it all felt so expected one of the wives literally came from waco the brainwashing exhibited by the characters was extensive to the point of caricature amaranth's passive relationship with the first man she comes into contact with post cult read like a woman fleeing one controlling situation into another one not to mention how convenient to the point of being contrived the idea of them crashing at a random farm and then building a home there despite the fact that it was ostensibly set in the modern world it felt more like an attempt to recreate the farms of the 50s of poverty and no technology i don't know i feel like it just missed what it could have been","384":" admittedly perhaps my separation with amity u0026amp sorrow is affecting my judgement i read a few books in between reading this one even an entire series i truly loved the religious aspects and depth of it and how it affects the lives of the characters it made me think about how deep religion affects me my family and the world it breeds another class of people people devoted to causes to fit what they believe their needs to be as is clearly portrayed in amity u0026amp sorrow also parenting and seeing our children develop into their own people i feel riley beautifully took me through that adventure through the eyes of the mother and daughter giving me yet another perspective and perhaps deeper insight and wisdom into my own children that may come","385":"one of the most engrossing books i have read i got it at the library in the morning sat down and read straight through with a brief intermission for cooking dinner for the fam and literally could not put it down the plot and the delivery of the story line carries you along while you l leave your own world to enter the world of the characters in this story","386":"depressing bur interesting and different","387":" this book might actually be closer to a 3 5 for me but i'll give it the benefit of the doubt the story hinges on sisters amity and sorrow with their mother amaranth they have been living in a polygamous compound and run away when a waco type event occurs they drive for 4 days until crashing their car and ending up in oklahoma at a farm belonging to a man named bradley amaranth is dealing with the effects of the manipulation and brainwashing she's endured for years and years as the first wife of the cult leader while amity and sorrow struggle to reconcile what it means to be in the real world amity is the younger sister who finds the outside world to be interesting but is desperate to keep her sister sorrow out of harms way sorrow is the most troubled character as we find out that she has been repeatedly raped by her father and told that she will be the bearer of the holy lamb she is psychotic destructive and delusional the storyline is interesting and different the characters are conflicted and difficult to like but it made for a great book discussion the amount of abuse of women in our culture came into a lot of the discussion one interesting thing that came up is that bradley grows rapeseed on his farm which in real life has been researched in the past as a crop that could used to absorb some of the radionuclides from the chernobyl disaster there was an interesting discussion about whether or not that was meant to be a symbol within the book about how the women are absorbed and potentially saved by becoming part of his home a good choice for book groups for sure","388":"i was really looking forward to reading this book it sounded so interesting unfortunately the book doesn't follow through it just doesn't blend and the character sketches are too out there it did not delve beyond the surface and that was disappointing","389":"i want to rate this as four for the amazing language the way desolation is suggested throughout and part of me wants to rate it as a two for the frustration and the fact i had to force myself to finish it a solid snippet of a book but not really to my taste","390":" caroline for www bigbooklittlebook comcopy provided by publisher in exchange for an honest reviewthis has been one of the hardest reviews to write i've started deleted and started again i ignored re scheduled and stared at a blank computer screen but enough is enough i will attempt to express the complicated feeling i have for amity and sorrow i have to confess that had i not been offered this book to review if i had simply seen amity and sorrow in a book shop i probably wouldn't have picked it up for me reading is escapism an indulgence and a pleasure i am all about the \"happily ever after\" i admit that i avoid books that are likely to be too heavy books that depict abuse or books that are likely to make me feel too uncomfortable god sex and farming to say that i was reading outside of my comfort zone would be an understatement although i found the subject matter explored within amity and sorrow uncomfortable and harrowing this book was so much more i never felt as though riley sensationalized her subject matter three women escaping from a polygamist religious cult to make a quick buck but much like the characters it introduces this is a modest book understated but no less heart wrenching amity and sorrow is told from the women's 3rd person perspective as they find themselves attempting to acclimatize to their new alien like surroundings and make sense of their place within the world without the strict rules of their home or the guidance of their \"father god\" the present day narrative is seamlessly interspersed with flashbacks which take us in a reverse chronological journey through the events that led to the decision to escape and beyond to the circumstances in which amaranth first became involved with her husband and cult leader each flashback adds another layer to the quiet horror of the women's story i found the ending distressing and unsettling nevertheless it was completely right for the story riley has too much respect for her characters and their journey to belittle their traumas and their achievements or to tie up the book with a pretty bow and a fantasy happy ever after instead she offers the reader a glimmer of hope and new beginnings but ultimately leaves the reader with more questions than answers i read the book with a love hate attitude towards most of the characters like family no matter how much you fight or how much they frustrate you there are underlying threads of love and affection which keep you rooting for them and in this case kept me turning the page while i applaud amaranth for her strength of character for removing her daughters from a harmful situation and i could even begin understand how she got herself entangled within the polygamous cult i had the most issues with her decisions made following their escape at times i felt like reaching into the pages of the book and shaking her and saying 'look at your daughters see how they are still hurting look at the dangers that surround them still ' in retrospect i can see that she was in survival mode doing the best she could in a undoubtedly difficult situation while still broken and healing herself but then i guess that that is the difference between a good book and a great one that very fact that over a month after finishing i am remembering and analyzing and questioning and still wishing for that happily ever after verdict there is no doubt that amity and sorrow is beautifully and sensitively written the imagery memorable easily transporting you into the dust and heat and hardship of rural oklahoma the pacing is perfect and the narrative borders are poetic while it is unlikely that i will ever re read amity and sorrow i have no doubts that i will be buying peggy riley's next novel","391":"i loved the idea of the story but it was so choppy at times that sometimes i didn't know what character the author was referring to","392":"it is very rare i mark a book with one star meaning i did not like it it is even rarer that i bother to finish a book i did not like however i really wanted to see how the book ended and how the characters and their conflicts were resolved i am not sure i understood the story nor do i really want to continue to ponder it suffice to say that religion can really cause damage as well as good it can be a strong belief system that heals the soul or it can be a scrounge on humanity this book showed the scrounge of humanity","393":" in this book we follow a mother and her two daughters for a few months after they have left the religious commune where the girls have lived all their life they are on the run for their father their mother's husband who has a total of fifty wives and many children living with him amity and sorrow only know life in the commune and are totally ignorant about the world outside they believe their father is god and are not at all happy that their mother took them away bit by bit the reader finds out the full story about the commune and the reason the mother left bradley the farmer who is not happy to find them on their doorstep slowly defrosts into a supportive person i really enjoyed reading this the story is told in a kind of simple sparse narrative that tells the reader enough to follow the story but also makes curious as to the full story not only do you want to know what exactly happened in the commune but also what will happen to the three of them next will the husband find them will they stay at the farm even though bradley doesn't want them will the girls flee back home without their mother a well set out story that reminded me a little of the first book of calamity leek paula lichtarowicz because of the naivity of the girls and of dirt david vann because of the rural setting and the painful family relationships","394":"the plot was interesting but the actual execution of it was confusing too much was left unexplained i still don't know why amaranth joined the cult in the first place although i'm fairly sure one part of the book was supposed to be an explanation i did like the character of amity though an okay book but not one i would necessarily recommend","395":"i found the storyline very interesting but the style of writing was very different i cant describe the style and not sure if i enjoyed it it made the story harder to follow i did like the ending and find the story on cults interesting but sad","396":"i think the writer was probably realistic in her portrayal of two sisters who are taken by a cult by their mother who had also been in the cult both sisters struggle much more than the mom largely because they have never known anything different and they really believe what they've been told shows how hard it would be to change thinking and beliefs","397":" she didn't know that preparing for the end of the world would make it that much more likely to come amaranth is the first of the fifty wives of the prophet and mother of two daughters amity and sorrow sorrow is the eldest and holds a special place at their temple she is the oracle the one who transmits the word of god to the congregation amity is the younger sister less zealous and sweeter tempered with a gift for healing the children don't go to school don't know their address don't know how to read don't know anything not decreed by the prophet this ignorance is encouraged as a way of keeping the group off the radar of outside society who might object and attempt to intervene especially when it comes to the children but the prophet's behavior is increasingly erratic and a police officer does come knocking at the door the ensuing confrontation spins out of control and amaranth fearing for their lives takes a car and flees with her children it takes all amaranth's courage to leave and she is haunted by the feeling that the prophet is in pursuit she is unused to the outside world not to mention driving and soon crashes in the area of oklahoma known as no man's land there they are offered refuge by bradley a struggling farmer and dust his ward amaranth struggles to rebuild a life for her family this is a hard task complicated even more by sorrow's fury at being forced to leave the only home she's ever known she is determined to return to what she knows is her rightful place as a religious leader and is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this no matter the consequences the resulting struggle between amaranth and sorrow is primal and riveting amity is caught in the middle which turns out to be a dangerous place this is not an easy story but i found its depiction of life within a cult gripping and memorable peggy riley's writing is lean and evocative the narrative switches back and forth between the present day and flashbacks of how amaranth came to join the prophet and what finally made her leave the wonder of amity at the outside world is beautifully conveyed the portrait of the world of amaranth and the prophet gives the reader a taste of a world with few familiar moorings a memorable story of faith and redemption","398":" elements of this book were good but overall it just felt flat following amaranth and her two daughters amity and sorrow as they escape from their polygamist husband and abusive father this could and should be a riveting and fascinating read instead it's a bit all over the place in attempting to allow the mother and daughters a new beginning riley dips back into their past both as part of their husband father's new religious movement and at times beyond and it is that beyond which really interested me and yet amaranth's previous life is only touched upon briefly there is a segment in the final 50 pages or so which describes how she came to marry zachariah and for me this would have been the starting point i would have liked to explore this much more a good read but by no means a great one","399":"first novel by the author fascinating tale of two daughters and their mother escaping a cult god sex and farming","400":"amity u0026amp sorrow propels readers through the collision of a lonely farmer and a woman on the run from a failed communal experiment--her fearful and reluctant teenage daughters in tow riley deftly explores the bonds and boundaries of love faith and responsibility when passionate and well intentioned ideals stray far from their origins in this emotionally fraught debut","401":"i had no idea what to expect with amity and sorrow but i'm so glad i picked it up sure the plot is compelling who wouldn't want to read about a mother and her two daughters escaped from a crazy religious cult but there's so much more to this book the writing is excellent the sister dynamics are superb and the ending will haunt you for days this is much more than sensationalism","402":" i read this novel several weeks ago and it hasn't quite let go of me so i thought i'd write a brief review i've been searching for the right word to describe peggy riley's novel amity u0026amp sorrow not difficult or problematic but an uncomfortable read this is a story of the aftermath of polygamy and the affects of extreme beliefs through flashbacks the reader is led to understand amaranth's choices even while still not agreeing with them we learn what led up to her fleeing with her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow and what events shaped their behavior as well what this story doesn't ever become is easy and comfortable i could go on about the use of grapes of wrath and the unremitting dust - the feeling that if anything moves too fast then all would be obscured - but i won't this is not a novel with a sweet or happy all wrapped up ending what happens at the end of the book is a mix in my memory of resolution and conjecture it is an ending that left me conflicted hopeful unsettled this story gripped me even though it was quite slowly paced and i didn't feel any connection to it whatsoever it will be interesting to see what the author does with a second novel","403":"i will never understand what some people do in the name of religion","404":" amity and sorrow is quite the unusual novel by peggy riley it opens on the scene of a mother amaranth driving her two daughters amity and sorrow down an oklahoma country road it quickly becomes evident that they are on the run from someone or something because the daughters are literally bound to one another via their arms in the backseat and because the language is evocative of the south i first assumed this was a story about an escape from slavery which it is i suppose but not in the traditional african slave trade context amity and sorrow are the daughters of a polygamous cult leader and his first wife among many many wives they've escaped from the cult's homesteading compound in utah following a police raid as the story slowly unravels we learn more about the destructive power of the cult and their father's leadership the family is in shambles emotionally and financially and their cultural identity and experiences are very different than those of the people they encounter in the world outside of the compound the novel is dark and yet hopeful as we root for the transformation and healing of the young girls and their mother as we follow the novel to its conclusion one of the daughters amity has been less twisted and less damaged by her time in the cult while sorrow has been scarred deeply in so many ways it's not clear she's entirely redeemable while i enjoyed the plot and pacing of riley's novel the dialogue at times seemed forced and artificial as i mentioned previously there is at times an 'old southern world' feel to the dialogue that doesn't fit the modern era the story is supposed to take place in and the scenes surrounding first interactions with a computer and with other modern technology seem really quite contrived and plastic still the novel can stand on its other merits overall 3 stars","405":" amaranth and her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow have fled their family and their life in a polygamist religious compound with nowhere to go and amaranth's only thought being to get them as far away as possible but when the car crashes in rural oklahoma and she is forced to rely on a farmer for help one of many things that challenges the strict rules they've all been taught to follow she is also forced to confront the past the present and the future for both herself and her daughters a gripping tale of the aftermath of being indoctrinated into what i can only describe as a cult amity u0026amp sorrow contains some difficult content but is one of those books that really hits you emotionally the layers of amaranth amity and sorrow's experiences that are slowly revealed over the course of the book through narrative and flashbacks are complex and provide the reader with a dark and vivid picture of their lives before the book begins overall i enjoyed the book though i know it's not one everyone is likely to enjoy it's gritty and certainly isn't a shiny happy tale and i know some people don't like books like that but i'd still encourage people to give it a chance content warnings view spoiler mentions of child abuse sexual abuse and incest religious fundamentalism hide spoiler egalley provided by the publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review","406":" i've never really thought about what it takes to escape a cult or what the impact of growing up in a cult might be this book is about family and love and the perversion of family love amity and sorrow are daughters in a polygamous cult amity seems to be just ignorant but sorrow is crazy and dangerous their mother amaranth runs away the day her husband who is also married to 49 other women decides to set their temple on fire to save them all from the police or is he trying to make it seem as if his prophesies have come true either way the three end up on a hard scrabble farm in oklahoma where amaranth finds herself attracted to a farmer amity finds herself attracted to a farm hand and sorrow tries to get back home to the cult where she was revered the book is intense it is well written and gripping i think it would make a great book for book clubs of the risk taking type","407":"starts slowly but once it gets into its stride it is a gripping story about a woman escaping from a polygamous cult with her daughters quite disturbing","408":" review also published on my blog studentspyglassplot characters readability overall after an intriguing twitter campaign about god sex and farming amity and sorrow went straight onto my tbr list amity and sorrow opens with a car crash amaranth has run away from her old life at her husband's polygamist compound taking her two daughters amity and sorrow with her after days of terrified driving and no sleep amaranth falls asleep at the wheel crashing the car and forcing the three of them to find refuge with a local widower named bradley the story is told from two different timelines the first is the current day beginning with the car crash the second is amaranth's relationship with zachariah the formation of the compound and the events leading up to the moment they run away the characters are really interesting though not necessarily likeable amity the youngest is torn between what she's always been taught and a whole world she's never seen before sorrow hates the outside world and just wants to go home used to being someone special the oracle of the church sorrow can't and doesn't want to find her place in this outside world sorrow is a difficult character and it's easy to hate her she doesn't understand why her mother insisted on making them run and why no one seems to want to follow the rules they've always known sorrow does some truly awful things and she is completely and utterly devoted to her father and the cult amaranth was a really interesting character and i absolutely loved learning about her relationship with her husband and how the cult was formed she has left her husband her sister wives' and her entire life behind to flee with the girls and i was desperate to know why amaranth has so many emotions from her initial concern about sharing her husband with sister wives to her growing loyalty for those same women she feels guilt for what her daughters went through as part of the cult terror of being caught and a strange confused mix of feelings towards the outside world and bradley their host although i didn't always like the decisions she made i did love trying to piece together why and how she ended up fleeing a polygamous cult to end up on a remote farm in oklahoma amity the youngest daughter is the character you root for most suddenly away from the influence of her father and the cult amity begins to question some of the rules they've always lived by and to explore her new found freedom at the same time she's always looking out for sorrow who despite being the oldest has always been looked after in the same way as sorrow is devoted to the cult amity is devoted to her sister even when sorrow might not deserve it amity desperately wants sorrow to be happy - but she doesn't necessarily agree with what sorrow wants amity is by far the easiest character to care about and although you admire her love for her sister you will wish she would let sorrow go so she can live her own life free from the cult bradley is an interesting enough character but his elderly father managed to steal the show and he is one of the best minor characters i've read in a long time funny and frank bradley's father provides some much needed humour as well as words of wisdom and i couldn't help but like him the plot kept me hooked and the two timelines helped with that - i wanted to know both why the women fled and how their story would end the setting felt a little odd sort of torn between modern day and an older time period for example the farm has no phone for me personally i would have preferred if the story clearly picked one time period or the other - if it's necessary that the farm doesn't have a phone etc i would have preferred the whole story was set in a time frame where that didn't feel out of place overall i really enjoyed amity and sorrow and i think it would make a fantastic book club pick - although it's not a light or easy read and some of the scenes are downright disturbing it is however thought provoking and dramatic and the story would make for some excellent conversation and debate peggy riley has written an amazing novel filled with twists and complex characters it's lyrically written and so although the subject matter is dark the book itself manages to be beautiful","409":"just finished this and i could not put it down it was different than anything i've read before i've recommended this to several friends of mine i learned a lot about cults in it so well written","410":"i won this as a goodreads arc i debated between giving it two and three stars but chose two because even though it referenced specific events to let you know know it was now it felt like it took place a couple decades ago also there were parts were i wanted it to move along a bit more i've read a couple books on polygamy but i'm not sure that's what this was it was one man who i did not see the charisma in and a harem of troubled wives how different is that from a cult the sad part of the story is the complete ignorance in which they raise their children without the total brainwashing would sorrow still have had the problems she did at least there was some hope for amity","411":" amity u0026amp sorrow is a story about a mother amaranth and her two daughters amity and sorrow amaranth and her two daughters flee from her husband who is the leader of a polygamist cult she drives until she crashes their car and is stranded at a farm amity and sorrow have never left the compound where they were born so they don't understand the outside world while amaranth and amity learn to adjust to their new environment sorrow only thinks about returning home amity u0026amp sorrow is beautifully written and intense this was a great debut novel and i look forward to reading more from this author i received a copy of this book for free through goodreads first reads","412":"i enjoyed this book i wouldn't read it again but definitely a good read","413":" this book was hard to follow because it jumped all around in the lives of amaranth and amity however it was very readable and i wanted to see what happened so i just kept reading it was definitely a look at how cults can develop and warp people's minds into thinking things that are not all right are okay to the members in the group i wanted to take sorrow and shake her throughout most of the story i didn't like her at all however she did have my pity because she had been so horribly brainwashed","414":" i don't really have anything nice to say about this book it wasn't bad it was just kind of pointless everything felt underdeveloped and like the story was being told with a calmness from a distance that it should not have been the fear and wonder and confusion were all too tempered for it to mean anything the relationships were superficial it gets a giant meh the one thing that really bothered me though sorrow is older and i've never heard pairs of children referred to as younger first especially when the older is the driver of most things plot wise sorrow and amity might not have the same ring but it's what made more sense in my head minor for sure but the thing that annoyed me on top of a story i didn't really know why i was reading","415":" i thought this was yet another 'cult novel' and was so pleased to find more between the pages the three females mother and her two daughters are fleshed out over the course of this short novel there are a few aspects that cannot be taken seriously but overall i enjoyed this story the daughters are very believable flung from the safety of the polygamous cult into the real world is handled with skill riley has created amity as a true innocent i loved her amarantha the mother and sorrow her older daughter are well written but have a few unanswered questions the adventure these three find themselves in once on the outside is spelled out neatly flashbacks are used to tell much of the back story as are passages told by each female names are a key aspect to the story as is the oklahoma setting enjoy the adventure because these two girls take you on a good one","416":"could not even get through 3 chapters sorry","417":"very intense u0026amp a page turner","418":"i didn't get far in reading this book it was just hard for me to get into so i returned it to the library","419":"this was a wonderful book i felt torn between amity and their mother the whole time","420":"this story was so off from what i usually read there were so many examples of blind faith selfishness and ignorance the characters actually made me mad i understand that the children who grew up in a cult environment were raised a certain way but i had a hard time sympathizing with the adults who were making bad decisions too much of this book disturbed me to actually enjoy it","421":"read this in less than 2 days i recommend reading this book","422":"the storyline was good but there were quite a few things open ended not resolved and unexplained this made it a bit frustrating large portions of the book are written in the present tense a style that is annoying to read however the actual plot was very good but i would like to see the story taken and rewritten in a way that more consistent all in all a great story but very average writing","423":"gripping story read it fast because i couldn't wait to see what happened next well done","424":"amity and sorrow by peggy riley is the story of a mother who takes her two daughters and drives away from a cult compound the mother is sure the father is going to come after them the one daughter embraces the new life even though she knows nothing about the outside world however the other daughter wants to go back to the life she has always known in the compound i enjoyed this book it went fast and for this author's first book i think she did really well gerard's review","425":"if you're in the mood for a light beach read this is not the book for you neither will a reader find much light hearted cheerfulness within these pages amityu0026amp sorrow is a book about 2 young teenage girls and their mother fleeing from a polygamous community it is a rather ambitious novel and the writing style does take some getting used to in the early stages of reading the book i was torn between putting the book down and continuing onward i am happy to say that i chose the latter and began to see some light at the end of the tunnel although the book's title refers to the two young daughters it was their mother amaranth who compelled me to continue reading her narrative allowed the readers to get to the back story of how everything began at times the book is hard to read but well worth the finish","426":"this story centers around a woman and her two daughters as they flee a polygamous cult it is about faith home hope and growing up it is probably not suitable for kids although older more astute teens might do okay","427":"overall i did enjoy this book and it kept me coming back to find out the ending i think the author could have done a lot more with the story though it was rather bland i would have loved to learn more about their life as polygamists","428":"very good read troubling subject but very interesting","429":"this is a terrible book with an interesting premise and a great cover i was bored and i didn't buy anything that was happening there was nothing original about the story and no interesting characters and no character development the children did not act in believable ways for their ages the plot did not hold together the end was unsatisfying i don't know why this book is getting buzz it must be that cover","430":"scary how brainwashed girls born into this kind of life are it kept my interest throughout the book but it wasn't one that i couldnt put down","431":" an odd story an odd assortment of characters i held on until the end but wow what an odd ride not a typical fdls storyline as a woman grabs her two teenage girls and runs from her husbands own made up church and his other 50 wives and children the oldest daughter being an 'oracle' who sits on the alter during sermons and sees things in the blue bowl she did this since she was a young child i gathered when each wife married the one guy aka dad aka father aka god somhow half of my review was erased so i am not writing all that again this story needed much more character development internally and with the other characters in flashbacks muddled thruout the book by different characters we get the idea of what their life was like prior to crashing into the life of a lonely farmer","432":"good but so disturbing learned a lot about cults and polygamy","433":" we are introduced to amaranth and her two daughters amity u0026amp sorrow when they flee from their polygamist cult only to crash their car in the middle of nowhere the background of these three then slowly unfolds showing disturbing u0026amp creepy details about the rules and abuse of cult life while the storyline was captivating the way it was written made me feel completely disconnected with all of the characters there was just something off about it that i cannot immediately put my finger on only the last 1 3rd of the book provided really enjoyable reading such as amity's first visit to a modern town and library her first experience of television and the development of her relationship with the old man upstairs amaranth's character also showed more depth and towards the end i started feeling a connection with her sorrow on the other hand never emerges from being a one dimensional religious fanatic and i found her highly unlikable i understand that her upbringing and belief that she is the oracle contributed to this delusional state but based on what was revealed about her father later on clearly the mental instability was inherited so would i recommend this i just dont know i never felt invested enough in the story except for the last 40 or so pages","434":"please see my full review at http booksandteaandtghtsfromme tumb","435":"i'm so surprised by the this book was too slow comments as well as by the i didn't like this book because there were no strong women ones too i thought the pacing was just fine and not all books just like life have strong characters some are so beaten down by their situations that they are weak and doing the best they can while residing in a completely foreign world amaranth felt so real to me and her years of pain was palatable and she didn't always know what to do about it aside from trying to save her daughters","436":" i was lucky enough to win a copy of this book from the author as a first read thank you so much for the book this book is about a mother that is taking her two daughters from a polygamous compound the only home that the girls have known there has been a fire that night and the mother takes the girls and races away with in the car knowing that her husband will follow her they drive for 4 days until the mother wrecks the car in oklahoma a man comes the there rescues by the name of bradley he helps the mother amaranth get sorrow out of the bathroom that she has locked herself into there is blood everywhere the man is afraid for them wanting to know if they are ok the woman tell him they are fine as the story goes along amaranth and amity mother and daughter begin to to heal and forge a new life however sorrow wants to go back to her old life she herself is full of sorrow the story goes back into time when sorrow was born and when the first wife was married and how the compound formed this book is very good and very well written in order to see what happens to amaranth amity u0026amp sorrow you must read the book i rate this book a 5 star it has some very adult material in it but older teens would beable to read this book","437":"i really wanted to like this book more but i was left with a lot of questions after the abrupt ending i wanted more insight into sorrow's personality more information about what led all these women to follow zachariah and what drove him none of these questions were answered by the book so although the writing style was interesting the book was ultimately unsatisfying","438":" this book was interesting and i am still trying to put all the pieces together i was interested in reading it because i have a number of other polygamist novels and they always intrigue me i can honestly say that i got a polygamist perspective but there were soooooooo many holes in the story that just didn't make sense ultimately the book fell short of its goal here are some of the problems i found i saw no way in which bradley was mourning the loss of his wife he was just angry amaranth is so caught up in her own world that she never stops to consider that her daughters need help this was actually appalling to me her daughter was molested by her own father and she just lets it go not only that she returns to the place of the crime and then she leaves her daughter there what kind of fool they land on a farm in the midwest with no telephones no internet an old black and white tv with rabbit ears and no contact with the outside world they aren't in burma or any other third world country it makes you imagine it is the 1950s it just doesn't add up the gets small glimpses into amaranth's life before she joined this man but none of it really adds up there were stupid rules like no going in the fields with no real explanation of why the most disturbing aspect of this story yes i am going to discuss it again is the fact that this mother has no regard for these children she tried to save she doesn't have any idea what is going on with sorrow and how much pain she is in but even worse is that her daughter amity is suffering psychotic episodes and harming others but the mother seems oblivious to it she has no concern for anything but getting food and then she sleeps with bradley which further complicates the issues after she goes back to the scene of the crime she leaves her daughter and doesn't even go to the police what kid of idiot would do this in the end though i found the story intriguing i found it ultimately disturbing","439":" amity u0026amp sorrow are two sibling sisters who lived a sheltered life they do not know life outside of their father's polygamous lifestyle and family they have one father who thinks he is god and several mothers this all changes when one frightful night their biological mother pulls them out and escape into the night they crash in oklahoma and salvation comes in an unlikely farmer named bradley who needs rescuing himself this novel by peggy riley was an unique read the writing style was poetic and i could feel as if a prophet was telling this story though i glean several elements from the story line one that kept coming back to me is the cautionary tale that one does not have to live in a polygamous lifestyle to be brought up in a cult like mind many dysfunctional families children as they grow into adults have liken their experiences of growing up as being 'brainwashed' and almost like 'cult like' thinking even outside that one may fall into a cult even they are in a mainstream religion one in particular that comes in my mind amongst my fellow catholics is one of medjugorje and other false visionaries they cannot see beyond it and forsake sane doctrine for these types of visionaries false prophets and teachings another thought that came to my mind is a word of warning of raising children too narrow minded too sheltered and believing ignorance is a blessing i shall caution this novel is not for everyone the writing style is off beat yet perfect for this type of storytelling i thoroughly enjoy it","440":"a really good read enjoyed it","441":"loved this book","442":"i normally love reading books on this subject however i felt like this one touched on so many topics briefly","443":" peggy riley has gifted us with a superb debut novel i read it in two greedy gulps it would have been one if i had timed my entrance better amaranth has fled with her daughters amity and sorrow as the novel opens we find the girls sitting in the back seat of a car bound at the wrists as their mother drives them further and further away from home the cloth binding their bodies together is far from the only tie that binds them raised in a cult the girls are bound by the constraints of their reality they can't read they must unquestioningly obey unfathomable rules and they know nothing of the strange and inconceivable world through which they are being dragged their bodies too are bound constrained by layers of fabric wrapped and sewn into their millefeuille habits heads bowed and covered hair braided everything shut down tangled and enmeshed the three are flung outside two unwilling one desperate but undeniably connected they have little money no support little comprehension of the world as it exists outside their compound and nowhere to go amaranth is desperate to flee the girls to return home this is not a novel for the faint hearted how peggy riley crafted this novel without having personally escaped from a polygamous cult speaks volumes for her ability to create and populate a world with realism and depth some of the concepts raised in this piece are confronting and ugly yet others compellingly beautiful power sacrifice perception and truth all vie for ascendency but so does hope this is one of the best novels i have read in a very long time thank you netgally and the publisher little brown and cmpany for the opportunity to obtain an arc of this thought provoking unsettling and ultimately satisfying book this one will remain with me for a long while","444":"it's hard to rate this book i can't really say that i enjoyed reading about a woman running from her polygamist cult but i do feel like i understand abused women a little better now and how a woman could end up joining a cult in the first place all the worst things happen and amaranth and her daughters live on i like how amaranth could acknowledge the sisterly love and spirituality she felt in the cult while at the same time despising the pointless and harmful rules her husband made","445":"yes i am was a big love fan on hbo but really this novel is so much more so well written and crafted the sisters truly pulled at my heart their mother however","446":"weird book i thought about stopping several times along the way but was morbidly curious if it could get better it didn't","447":" this book ebbs and flows in the interesting department the names of the main characters alone are rather amazing amaranth amity sorrow dust bradley not a joe or jane anywhere to be seen the premise a mother amaranth and her two daughters amity u0026amp sorrow escaping from a polygamist cult situation crash their car in oklahoma and end up staying there a spell is intriguing if you believe religious cults with crazy old men having 50 wives and a gazillion children are curious than you'll enjoy the read we learn the details of why and what they are escaping throughout the book and that is the strong point of the read it's all very plausible how it all happened and it's amazing that the mother finally woke up and found the nerve to leave are they all psychologically fucked up you bet they crash in oklahoma and get taken in or rather just don't leave a farmer's place bradley and the boy he took in dust there's a lot of loose end type people about just taking up with others and i almost forget that we're in modern times until they venture into town their day to day lives feel old timey curiously even though everything is here for an amazing book alluring story complex characters goal oriented plot it somehow is only kinda good i can't quite put my finger on why that is i do know that the wedding ceremony for each new bride of the cult leader is one of the most disturbing things i could ever of imagined for a marital bed yikes let's just hope this purely fiction","448":"the debut novel by author and playwright peggy riley amity u0026amp sorrow is a dark but beautifully written book combining menace melancholy into a tense haunting story that's already had numerous rave reviews but before proceeding further it's worth noting that amity u0026amp sorrow could be potentially triggering for abuse survivors so please continue with caution with both the book and this review excerpt from full review at for books' sake","449":"an interesting read","450":" amity u0026amp sorrow began strongly and dramatically with a mother escaping from her polygamous cult family with her two daughters amity and sorrow neither daughter has ever been away from the compound before where they were being raised by their mother and fifty sister wives as the novel progresses we get a better picture about how their mother ended up raising her daughters in such unusual circumstances though it's never made clear enough to create sympathy for their mother as the tension between sorrow and her mother mounts the novel meanders and it peters out towards the end","451":" in an ultra libertarian society how do you define right and wrong it's a problem that has been addressed frequently in american fiction when amaranth and her two teenage daughters flee a fundamentalist cult they reverse the journey of steinbeck's joads in the grapes of wrath and find themselves in the oklahoma dustbowl throwing themselves on the mercy of a hardscrabble farming family when having driven non stop for days she crashes her car on their land the scene is set for the kind of claustrophobic drama that tennessee williams does so well and there is a feeling of inevitablility as the narrative unfolds over the next few months interspersed with flashbacks to the escalating horror that amaranth has escaped - physically at least the worst damage however is at first invisible amaranth and her daughters are as deeply damaged as you'd expect and not since emma donoghue's room has a novelist presented us with characters less equipped to deal with the modern world never mind the internet these girls can't even read it's not that difficult to figure out the real reason why amaranth has finally broken free of her polygamous cult leader husband in fact it's horribly clear from the first few pages when the older girl miscarries a baby in a gas station restroom you may feel as i did that we're in entirely predictable territory here and there's little point in reading on but riley is a skilful writer with a particularly acute grasp of dialogue and character and the main theme of her tale is an original and troubling one why are women so often complicit in the abuse of themselves and their children and so reluctant to report it to the authorities can it be because the favour of even the vilest abuser can confer a warped status on his victims riley's answer is clearly yes and sometimes there's nothing you can do about it that's not a conclusion that everyone would accept and this novel will make excellent material for reading group discussions these characters aren't likeable but by the end of the story you'll understand the reasons for that and understand even if you can't condone the choices they have made riley has taken some of the archetypes of classic american fiction and given a contemporary twist to the well worn theme of a dream gone bad and in doing so she's shown that sometimes the hardest thing to get right about escaping sexual abuse is knowing the moment before it will be too late to run","452":" this is a beautifully written unsettling novel the tactile prose gets under the skin and rings true to its core peggy riley's memorable characters are cinematic their faces and voices loom through the pages the sisters the amity and sorrow of the title behave as all sisters do with outrageous disturbing and costly exceptions their mother and the male characters are strong and fill the story with a sense of direction even while everything spins out of control the author ruthlessly cuts through stereotypes that are often represented in books about cults charismatic evangelicals and the struggle of those harmed by them in their attempts to escape to freedom a book to read and remember by an accomplished writer","453":" a mother escapes a polygamous cult compound with her daughters a teen and pre teen who know nothing of the world around them after a car accident she seeks help from a farmer and his stepson in a dusty oklahoma town who have their own difficulties i loved the concept of this story the opening as other reviewers have noted really sucks you in peggy riley sets the scene with both her descriptive prose and characterization the characters of amaranth and her daughters sorrow and amity are fascinating personally i loved amity the younger of the sisters and her curiosity of the world she never knew existed she can't read or spell her own name has never seen television or a computer and worries more about the end of the world than going to school sorrow her older sister is an oracle but she isn't as willing to explore a new life she is desperate to return to the only world she knows despite the pain her father has caused amaranth is our conduit into the cult world she is the first of 50 wives of a self proclaimed prophet the situation she left is reminiscent of waco and the branch davidians although without the weapons cache through amaranth we learn the history of how she came to be the first wife and all that followed fascinating stuff but a little thin i felt like she was still holding back with us even as she was revealing her past overall i really enjoyed the book and i did tear through it very quickly but i felt some element was missing something that might have pushed it into the 5 star category","454":"patricia riley has amaranth and her two daughters teenage sorrow and 12 year old amity fleeing her husband until their car crashes into a chickasaw plum tree in rural oklahoma as riley's novel unfolds the reader learns that these characters dressed in long skirts and pinafores with clogs were part of a fundamentalist sect that recalls the violence of waco amaranth was the first of zachariah's 50 wives and riley answers various mysteries as the story unspools how amaranth met zachariah and generously shared him with the other wives zachariah a former member of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints collected abandoned women hippies spinsters reformed junkies and winos embitttered divorcees and single moms the identity of the father of the child sorrow miscarries in a service station restroom one of the few pleasures of the novel is experiencing with the illiterate amity the less damaged and timid of the sisters her first encounters with modern society such as television computers lingerie and cheetos riley has written a grim novel that raises disturbing questions about the power of charismatic leaders and the complacency of their followers","455":"this book reminded me a little of room as the characters know nothing of the real world i'm fascinated and appalled by polygamy and this telling of it was compelling to me","456":"i wasn't sure at first whether i was enjoying this or not but the further i read the more it drew me in it's a story about a mother and two daughters who escape from the husbands cult which is a spin off from the mormons religion only he has taken it a step too far it tells of how they lived by rules and whether they feel they can break them or not quite upsetting in parts but also realistic i had to read to the end which i didn't expect a good read and well written","457":"a short but solid read hard to discuss without spoiling the story","458":"the book had so much potential and fell flat especially disturbing was the incest u0026amp the mother's acceptance of it","459":"if we could do half stars i would say 2 5 on this one it was a fast read interesting in parts but it was a very choppy narrative and i felt like the characters never really fully developed i could see great potential and the premise was interesting","460":" so i went into this book thinking it would be fantastic i believe i set it up to be better than it ever could be but i am not a fan of lyrical prose wordy for the sense of wordiness i kept reading because i really kept reading because i thought something was going to happen it never did i was very disappointed now it didn't take long to read so i didn't waste a lot of time but there was so much more than could have been done with the storyline that alone was my hype but alas i was left to read word upon word taking me nowhere and left me wanting so much more","461":"beautiful and terrible reminiscent of karen russell's swamplandia i couldn't put the book down riley's writing is as beautiful as it is gripping even the ugly of which there is plenty is painted with symbolism and pathos the characters are superbly drawn and the settings exquisitely reflect the emotions of each scene however this book is not for the squeamish a father rapes his child if i had it to do over again i don't know if i'd read amity u0026amp sorrow life is dark enough without reading dark fiction though billed as a redemption story i felt the ending though it rang true was too ambiguous to earn the label still the book is stunning","462":"normally i am drawn into books about the polygamist lifestyle as i find it very interesting for some reason this book just didn't satisfy that curiosity the plot was interesting but the author failed in the delivery as there are many different areas she could have explored this would have been a much better book if more time was spent on the past lives of these women rather than their boring escape the book's pacing was very slow but then again why hurry when it's going no where the writing style was very disjointed at times i had to flip back several pages to see if i missed something or who was being referred to the characters were very underdeveloped and unlikeable needless to say i felt no connection with any of them i forced myself to finish this book hoping that something would happen or the ending would rectify the rest of the book haha wishful thinking i wish now that i would have thrown it into the dnf pile instead of wasting my time overall this book was very disappointing i had high hopes for it when i requested to review it i wouldn't recommend this book as you would only be wasting your time and possibly money received this book from netgalley for my free and honest review","463":"riley paints a chilling portrait of a community warped by its members' own desperate yearning for belonging and home amity and sorrow share a bond that is endlessly fascinating even as it disturbs the readers' modern sense of freedom and morality","464":" i was really intrigued by amity u0026amp sorrow but it turned out to be an okay read i like the whole concept of the novel 2 girls who grew up in a cult and unable to imagine a life outside of that and seeing them try to make sense of a world different than the one they grew up in definitely intriguing but it was also hard to get into this world i liked the traditional ness of everything but they world they left had just enough similarities to the one they found made it less interesting because there wasn't enough of a contrast one thing i was trying to figure out was the timeline it felt like it was happening in present time but something about the rural setting made it seem like it was happening in times past the narration didn't work for me it seemed like it alternated between amity and amaranth we see sorrow through their eyes although there were times when it felt like we just saw sorrow it always took a couple pages to adjust to whoever was narrating because there wasn't anything to indicate that there were several narrators in terms of chapter headings i did like the flashbacks of amaranth's past and i wish we saw more of her life in the cult and what drew her to it they all had intriguing stories especially sorrow and amity sorrow because of her role as oracle and amity because things seem to be all about sorrow as interesting as the characters seemed to be nothing really stood out to me and while interesting they weren't as interesting as they could have been also while it's a fairly straightforward story something about amity u0026amp sorrow seems jumbled and confusing i did want a little bit more about their lives before leaving because as it is it was hard to care about their life after when i didn't know much about their life before being able to see how different their lives really were before and after would have made the novel a little more interesting for me final thoughts i don't have much to say about amity u0026amp sorrow i liked the concept and found that there's a lot of potential for the characters for me it was hard to connect with the characters and i wanted them to be a little more developed amity u0026amp sorrow just wasn't the book for me amity u0026amp sorrow gets 2 stars amity u0026amp sorrow is an e arc from netgalley com which has not influenced my review in any way","465":"an aching story about a woman lost amy or amaranth finds love in a religious sect as wife number one of fifty as life in eden changes with the realization that her first born daughter is carrying a child sired by her husband she flees with her daughters amity u0026amp sorrow on the dusty prairie of oklahoma where she crashes her car new beginnings sprout amity u0026amp sorrow are aptly named tethered together by more than a strap a cain u0026amp able like tale where each will ultimately find their own answers in the lord","466":"this novel gets a lot of mixed reviews however i absolutely loved it parental misfortune twisted christianity and a situation no parent wants to see for their children these are the things that modivate our main character to take the drastic step she does and force her children to leave all they know behind sometimes even the things done in the best intentions can get out of control hurting people that don't even realize that they are being victimized","467":" disclaimer i received a free copy of this book from the publisher on netgalley in return for an honest review authorpeggy riley is a writer and playwright living on the north kent coast reviewreading the synopsis for this book made me very curious how someone would write out a story like this i must say the story is written very very well and i enjoyed it a lot every time i hear about cult groups like this i wonder how people get to do things like this looking from the outside everybody says they must be insane and how can they accept living like that in this story amaranth the mother is the first wife she has been with zachariah from the start and she believed in what their original plan was taking care of woman who where in need of a family i really admired the way this part of the story was worked out making her choices believable and acceptable what i really admired too was the behavior and reactions of both amity and sorrow they never lost their part their ignorance their trust in their old life and the rules it was so real for them you could feel their fear and questions popping from the pages i liked amity a lot she really had to struggle between the life she knew and her new experience i did not really like sorrow i feel her behavior made it difficult to connect to her this book is very raw and some parts described are very shocking but it did make the story stronger and real it is not a light sunny afternoon read","468":"this book caught my attention in the beginning and held my interest throughout the entire novel however there were several reasons why i thought this book was 'just okay' 1 while the storyline was captivating the way it was written was very confusing often the scene would switch between two different times within the same paragraph or even the same sentence without any indication of the change i spent a lot of time rereading trying to figure out what was going on this also meant that i had to read very slowly and carefully which is not what i want to do when i am reading for enjoyment 2 i agree with many other comments that say the book had a 50s feel while i know that it was supposed to be set in the present time and they reference events that occurred after the 1950s the fact that the two main settings of the book were completely isolated makes it hard to believe that the book took place in more recent years especially when they describe the technology 3 i hated sorrow's character she is a stuck up selfish brat who will do literally anything to get what she wants also she killed a kitten 4 parts if the book were rather graphic definitely not appropriate for younger readers overall i liked the story it was interesting to see how different life is for some people but it is safe to say that i will not be reading this book again","469":"quite an atypical read for me the content was quite unusual u0026amp unique a great read to get you out of a genre rut i have to say i am rather impressed by the originality of the plot twists u0026amp turns the story in itself is quite outlandish but the author takes special care to reference actual true events that indeed coincide with such an unbelievable lifestyle","470":" this book just wouldn't let me go although the story itself was slow in some parts for some reason i kept returning to it i think the reason i wanted to know what happened so badly was because of amity i felt very sympathetic for her and wanted to reach through the pages and help her i wanted to choke the life out of sorrow and scream at amity for idolizing her so much the author did a good job of making me feel what the characters felt i certainly had strong feelings and reactions to each character i didn't find the lifestyle they were living that surprising have you ever seen one of those polygamy specials on dateline it reminded me a lot of that without all the hiding of dirty secrets does it amaze me that this story really could happen in real life of course i believe many of us have blinders on to what is going on right next door to us i hated the ending of the story i just didn't understand why in the world amaranth would do what she did and seriously the way it all went down not at all realistic i guess i was mostly disappointed because most of the story was raw and gripping and the ending was like a bad b movie send off be forewarned that there are a few graphic sex scenes if you find them disturbing you might want to skip over those areas or just avoid the book altogether","471":"i received a digital copy of this novel from netgalley on behalf of little brown once again i am stepping outside my usual genres and i have to say i'm glad i did i was invited to read this book and with a little hesitation based off the summary it makes it sound a bit like a shirtless sexy widower farmer heroically rescues this woman and her children but it's not at all like that i started the book and then couldn't put it down read full review here","472":"i loved this book very different to the normal type of books i read i would definitely recommend this book","473":" amity and sorrow are running away well their mom is running away and they're bring dragged along amity doesn't really care but all sorrow wants to do is go back and what sorrow wants sorrow gets or so it has been her whole life but when their car is smashed in okalhama things change that is as much of a summary i can give it's not a pretty book the subject matter is actually quite ugly i think i despised almost all the characters except perhaps amity and dust but still i finished this book in record time this book was written in present tense except for the flashbacks i'm really not a present tense kind of person but the book was really captivating and drew me in after a while i didn't really notice anything and just let myself be dragged along by the story plus the language really is beautiful such a contrast to the characters and story which made me want to read on and on the premise of the story is intriguing and as the book progresses the backstory is gradually revealed like the blurb says they're running from a polygamous compound but it also looks at the nature of love and control this is a book for looking back and even the ending is not complete not all the characters make it out of the past it's not the type of book i normally read i gravitate towards sunny books but i'm glad i read it disclaimer i got a free galley from netgalley in exchange for a free and honest review inside the mind of a bibliophile","474":"when i got this in a giveaway i thought it would be fun to branch away from young adult stuff for a while i don't know why i chose this one but it just stuck out so i signed up this was definitely interesting to read however it's not going to be able to make it to my favorites section","475":" i heard peggy riley talk about this book at the edinburgh book festival a couple of years ago and was intrigued by the waco type cult the story is about the two eponymous sisters of the title as they run with their mother amaranth from their polygamous father the story weaves between the girls who have only known life within the rather strange cult and their mother who led them their and eventually tries to save them amity is on the cusp of puberty as she is ripped from the life she knows while sorrow continues to live as the lamb of god even after she is removed very interesting and well written","476":"what is it about cults in this case one that had its beginnings in polygamy these poor girls and their mother in the end she tried to make it right but the damage","477":" i read about amity u0026amp sorry in the new york times book review this spring and my curiosity was piqued i've always had a fascination with cults and the review was largely favorable ms riley's prose is beautiful sparse and evocative the story is compelling though ultimately it feels a bit light on plot the story starts with amaranth driving her two young daughters the eponymous amity and sorrow away from the polygamous compound where they were born and raised the car crashes in the middle of nowhere oklahoma panhandle and there they stay a terse farmer lets them live on his land and the story flashes back to the compound every few chapters perhaps it's because i read the whole of that new york times review but none of the revelations are particularly surprising sorrow wishes only to be back with her father and lover while amity adjusts more readily to their new life learning slowly to read spending time with the farmer's elderly father and young farmhand watching television and eating junk food sorrow thinks she is an oracle an becomes more and more embittered and violent i finished the book the same day episode 14 of the fifth season of breaking bad aired two family on family hand slashings what are the odds ultimately the story and style reminded me quite a bit of the wonderful movie martha marcy may marlene it's a bit unfortunate because it's quite likely that ms riley was writing the book before that movie premiered but in ways it did seem derivative or at least very very familiar i didn't want to put this book down but in the end it wasn't for it's plot or style but simply to race through it waiting for something more to happen in the end it was all spinning and interminable fires and dust and too heavy metaphors piled on like the skirts worn by the fifty wives","478":"a compelling story beautifully and evocatively written","479":"she didn't know that preparing for the end of the world would make it that much more likely to come amity u0026amp sorrow is the most recent book to keep me up all night despite my cynical predisposition did i really want to read a novel about 'god sex and farming something stopped me from putting it down every time i tried i found myself twisting to pluck it from the shelf again and resume its journey because it is a journey this debut novel from us playwright peggy riley journeys across rural middle america and dusts you off on a small rapeseed farm in oklahoma it quests through a young girl's coming of age and a sister's development as an individual it plots the love of a mother for her children and her husband and herself it is an odyssey of human emotion a voyage through a family's life for more http thescribblebug blogspot co uk","480":"this heartfelt novel explores faith in the fanatical faith in the ones we love and ultimately the redemptive faith in ourselves my heart ached for the characters and i know that while the journeys of some had me cheering that of others will haunt me for weeks to come","481":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the story was okay i was curious about why amaranth sorrow and amity had left their home and all the way through i did want to know more and more about their story and i did i couldn't believe how zachariah had taken advantage of all those women how he'd ruined them and their children's lives through the polygamy and the cult he had imposed on all of them it was seriously messed up and i feel so sorry for the women and children having led such sheltered lives amaranth always said that the the story was okay i was curious about why amaranth sorrow and amity had left their home and all the way through i did want to know more and more about their story and i did i couldn't believe how zachariah had taken advantage of all those women how he'd ruined them and their children's lives through the polygamy and the cult he had imposed on all of them it was seriously messed up and i feel so sorry for the women and children having led such sheltered lives amaranth always said that there was love between everyone but my goodness the conditions in which it was in was so wrong the writing seemed a little disjointed at times but generally it was okay i liked the friendship between amity and the old man it was nice how they became friends because nobody seemed to be paying much attention to them it really bothered me how amaranth didn't explain anything to her children though i know she was running away from the past and that it would have been hard trying to tell her kids that everything they had known all their life was a lie but i thought it was so silly to just throw them into the real world and not explain why they had left and how their father hadn't been treating them right when amity wanted to give herself to dust it made me so sad because she didn't know any better it was what she had seen and learnt and her mother had neglected in telling her that everything she had seen and learnt was not right i just don't get how anyone can be willing to run away from such a life and not explain anything to her children who are ignorant through no fault of their own and old enough to be told i don't know if i'm being too harsh on her character because she's a victim herself and she's going through the same difficulties but it just really bothered me and i was so disappointed with the ending i did not like the fact that sorrow had been left behind with her father sorrow was so far gone and even though she chose to stay with him she can't be blamed because she was in the mindset that she was the holy one she could bring on the end of the world and she was the oracle and man oh man she was so far gone and so lost what mother would leave their child who was so misguided even if amaranth felt she couldn't help her it didn't mean to say that she should leave her how on earth would things get better unless she tried to get professional help for sorrow and amity this just didn't seem right more","482":"horrible book i gave up halfway through i thought this would be an intriguing book about cult escapees but instead amaranth is startlingly bad at making decisions and everything she does makes no sense and sorrow is a sociopath the only interesting character is amity but she wasn't enough to pull me through","483":"awesome book full review herehttp 0651frombrighton blogspot co u","484":"some parts of this novel felt like a high school english reading assignment the main character's names are amity and sorrow really but i flew through it because the premise is so intriguing polygamy cults is crazy yo and the characters so unpredictable an interesting ending 3 5 rounded up","485":"not quite the ending i expected it gave insight into how some women get under the thrall of a so called prophet as well as the damage they do to the children particularly girls who grow up on a polygamous compound","486":"i was really disappointed in this book it is a story about a mother and her two children who flee a cult

city of women is just fine for what it is a star crossed love story taking place in wwii germany unfortunately the story lacks many valuable details that would anchor the tale in this time period your satisfaction with the story will probably vary according to your expectations rereading the books description now i see the fault lies in me i will say that narrator suzanne bertish is excellent her german accent light and pleasant her intonation catching the rhythms of german speech perfectly i bought city of women out of curiosity about the experience of german wives and mothers caring for their families during wwii though brought up in a second generation german immigrant family the war was never discussed nor was there any sort of permission to ask questions no one told me not to i just got the message loud and clear that wwii was off limits and yet i've always wondered what did the average german know about the government's activities what did they do with what they did know did parents send their children off to safer homes in the countryside as did their london counterparts how did the disappearance of a huge chunks of the population german men into the army and jewish everyone to other countries or concentration camps affect life and morale there has been much written about wartime britain but very little about domestic life in wartime berlin unfortunately other than a cursory mention of ration books and a few trips to a bomb shelter this novel could take place in almost any historical period where circumstances pick one or more war family disapproval ethnic hatred class difference amps up the drama between two lovers cheating on their spouses it begins fairly promisingly and with an air of mystery why is protagonist sigrid shroeder married to a german soldier fighting on the eastern front so restless and lonely one would expect her to be anxious about her husband's welfare afraid for her friends and neighbors after nightly bombing raids we quickly learn much of her alienated sad behavior is actually sigrid mooning about for her vanished married jewish lover see in case you miss the metaphor her german soldier husband is not only distant physically but also emotionally you guys sigrid is what my daughters would call a 'guy's girl' not a 'girl's girl ' she's so beautiful and never really connects with the city of women left to tend the home fires during the war most readers will quickly recognize this novel's supporting cast of characters impossibly mean mother in law suspicious landlady foolishly brave sidekick you can fill in the rest there are some acts of heroism and personal risk in the story however in previous reading like the excellent bonhoeffer biography i devoured earlier this year i've learned that most actual acts of heroism during this time period seemed to be fueled by moral courage or a philosophical mandate that left the hero no alternative but to confront evil head on sigrid's motives are largely unexplored therefore unconvincing is she helping jews out of guilt for sleeping with a married jewish man is she trying to get out of the house more it's all sort of vague plus from what we learn of her lover there isn't much to inspire such slavish romantic obsession although she does describe a certain part of his anatomy as noble which could be just as easily novel since i'm assuming her previous lovers were uncircumcised enough sorry i will end by saying that my experience echoed the much more concise review of city of women written by katherine of ontario for a compelling look at life under german occupation i recommend anne frank remembered by miep gies ms gies was an employee of jewish business owner otto frank who hid the franks and many others in occupied holland for over 2 years she fed them by going to several different shops a day never carrying more than one shopping bag at a time to avoid suspicion i doubt she had a jewish lover but i found reading about her life so deeply inspiring i didn't miss it at all","2":"i really enjoyed another free book from goodreads we can only guess how people lived and survived through the atrocities of war it was a great read from beginning to end good job david r gillham","3":"interesting book that raises a variety of moral issues big and small at times it seemed to drag a bit but was worth sticking with the main character sigrid is complex and the story of her journey is intriguing","4":"this book begins with a wonderful premise of describing a city of women in wartime it becomes part spy novel part history lesson and loses its way","5":"this will be a great movie","6":"this is an extraordinary book one of the best books i've read in a long time i marvel at the author's skill so so good","7":"i love love love this book this is my favorite genre so i have read a lot and this is one of my favorites along with the book thief highly recommend it is intense in a good way it is a page turner while you are reading it and you want to read every word when i am not reading it i am both constantly thinking about it and trying to find pockets of time to pick it up","8":"i struggled with this book until the second half of it i did not like the characters or their behavior the second half of the book was almost like a different book entirely it held much more wwii u0026amp german history shared the struggles of betrayal of party members jewish families soldiers who were wounded physically u0026amp emotionally some of the book was harsh sometimes touching i could even relate to the protagonist's own struggles in the last third of the book 3 stars","9":" december 16th 2k13 finished and i didn't just mark it 'read' i added another star making it 5 out of 5 december 12th 2k13 re reading not for any particular discussion just had it on my disk and had forgotten it how could i have forgotten it what a story these characters you can find something to love and hate about them all i'm halfway through now i liked the way the story honed in on the lives of people at home not so much at war and the way it spoke from the pov's of germans and german jews it didn't depict all the germans as being bad people and it didn't depict the jews as being good good good with no bad it left me with the impression that god will forgive anything if you've been pushed far enough","10":"great read a good piece of historical fiction with lots of suspense and plot turns highly recommend this book","11":"found this on my recommended list u0026amp enjoyed very much a perspective on ww2 and life as it might have been for those living there well done","12":"i had a hard time believing this was a debut novel it's fabulous every time i put it down which was hard to do i read it in a day i felt like i was being teleported from the very richly detailed vivid grim world created by gilliam i cared deeply about the characters and reveled in their complexity i've been to berlin and other cities in germany and every time i go there the holocaust is on my mind the huge questions linger and nag how could such a thing happen is there any hope of redemption for those who even peripherally took part i don't think there are simple answers to these questions and great minds have pondered them for over sixty years the majesty of this book this fiction is that it addresses them fearlessly and compassionately and actually leaves the reader with a kernel of hope for all of us read it","13":" i had trouble deciding between 2 and 3 stars on this one i liked the story and i liked how it ended but the book was so dark and brooding i had a hard time liking any of the characters there was a good plot and the story was so engrossing i couldn't put the book down i've read many books from this time period both fiction and non fiction but there was absolutely no joy or happiness in this book there was far too much vulgarity in this book for my tastes i did like the end though and that she made a choice to continue doing what she was doing at risk to her own life this book would make a good book club discussion but i have a hard time recommending it to my book club","14":"i normally love wwii historical fiction and the fact that this book centered around the german women left behind was intriguing to me the sex scenes distracted from what could have been a great book sarajevo book club choice","15":"1943 berlin told from the perspective of an ordinary woman who became extraordinary in consequence of what she saw around her not everyone turned a blind eye and took the easier path but unfortunately not enough to change their society the writing is strong and takes hold of you you become enmeshed in the tragedy and frau shroeder's interactions the subject matter is harsh so to say i enjoyed the book is not apt but i am very glad i have read this book and wholly recommend one of the best books i've read in quite a while","16":"very good book very suspenseful though at times very tough to get through because of course the subject matter is very bleak the characters are very well drawn and you get a sense of how the war brought out the best and the very worst in people","17":"excellent book i'm currently interested in european and wwii pre and post period author does a good job","18":" as a long standing fan of alan furst i was drawn to this book that he considered remarkable city of women is indeed a remarkable well written story of life in berlin during world war 11 told from the perspective of a young woman who is challenged daily to be true to her highest moral values mr gillham draws us into this poisoned culture of anti semitism paranoia betrayal and constant danger with skill and purpose he exposes the raw human drives and needs that are exposed and fed during wartime","19":"a gripping and emotional page turner i raced through it and thoroughly enjoyed it","20":"a chance meeting with a stranger changes sigrid schroder's life for ever once an ordinary wife of a german officer life in berlin in 1943 presents moral and physical challenges that ultimately open sigrid's eyes to the real world around her and force her to choose between right and wrong and life and death after reading the book we are left with the question what would you do if wonderful historical fiction depicting an era that no one should ever forget or allow to occur again","21":"this book bit in from the first page and didn't let go until the last i finished in 24 hours just couldn't put it down","22":"i have to admit i wasn't thrilled with this book although i liked the premise i had difficulty liking the characters the one character i did like at the beginning disappointed me in the end it was interesting to read a story with a german woman's point of view since all the other books i've read were from the jewish pov however since the reason the main character does what she does is not altruistic i was turned off","23":"i couldn't put this book down","24":" city of women is a dark novel set in berlin during ww ii the main character sigrid schroeder is flawed and is married to a soldier fighting the war for the germans she lives with her mother in law who is a totally unlikeable woman sigrid becomes involved helping jews escape from the gestapo with her neighbor ericha the whole setting is bleak food is scarce the city is being bombed at night everyone is afraid of being turned in to the gestapo it is a slow moving story with lots of twists and turns many flawed characters living in the same building as sigrid i think what i liked best about the book is thinking about it now that i have finished reading it to me this is the major characteristic of an excellent book the end of the book was highly suspenseful and many of the characters were revealed differently than i had originally thought just like in real life you don't always know what a person is like just by seeing a few actions i would highly recommend this book it was one you can't put down until you have finished it i received an advanced reader's copy from the publisher","25":"very interesting story set in ww2 berlin about several women and what happens while underhitler's rule lot's of interesting what would i do scenerioes","26":"absolutely fantastic you absolutely must treat yourself to the audio book a delicious delight for your listening pleasure full review on its way thanks to audiobook jukebox and penguin audio for the privilege and pleasure","27":"i loved this book the characters were exciting just as you think you understand everyone's part another twist comes up i couldn't put it down until i finished it","28":"i was so excited and intrigued by this book sigrid's story was fascinating twists and turns on every page i thought that she was a truly strong female character even with all her flaws she embodied what all great lead women do courage and empathy but also sadness and doubt i was enthralled following sigrid as she tried maneuvering wartime berlin and all it's cast of characters and i loved that as a reader we didn't know the truth about anyone we found out as she did friends were enemies enemies were friends who could she trust could she even trust herself to do the right things i loved every minute of this novel i wish it never ended","29":"didn't really care for any of the characters always interesting to read about wwii from the germans perspective","30":"belin in 1943 was largely a city of women gillham presents a very ordinary this is life as they were living it view of the women who were left behind by war and the men that peopled their world and neighborhood the wounded the broken the gestapo the investigators who watched people always watching people meanwhile while the women boiled their mostly not rotten potatoes and ever present cabbage and worked long hours they also held close and shielded their secrets and the precious few hunted they are hiding until photos can be taken false documents can be found and train seats booked to transport them safely across borders and onto ships to sweden and the point the point is what would you do what would i do would i have the strength and courage to ignore the danger and help those who were guiltless and so in need i doubt it bless those who did","31":"i rarely give a book 5 stars but this book deserves 5 plus gripping wonderfully written and an incredible portrayal of courage in the midst of horror","32":"this was an amazingly well written story with terrific history and totally made me think what would i do it took me a bit but i fell in love with this story","33":"is it high literature no but it's a total page turner i find myself thinking about the characters during the day and was excited to read about them in the evenings so 5 it is","34":"this was another book that made me want to keep reading and i felt the fear of getting caught coming through to me the characters seems so real to me and i wanted to find out what was happening to them a rather surprising ending and worth reading to find it out","35":"couldn't finish this book you would think given the setting something might happen to inspire me to read the whole thing but it didn't","36":"it took me a while to read this not because i didn't enjoy it or it wasn't interesting but it's a pretty heavy book both physically and emotionally i feel pretty drained having finished it though that's not really surprising when it comes to books about the holocaust i appreciate that in the end i am left with some hope for the characters","37":"a little slow getting started but eventually became a page turner for me sigrid wasn't my favorite character ever but i found myself so intrigued with her relationships i wanted her to end up with wolfram i wanted her to be with egon i wanted her to be with kaspar i thought the book wrapped up nicely and overall i definitely enjoyed the book","38":" this is the kind of book that i'd call a slow burn whereby the heat isn't felt until after the story is finished i read this book from the safety of my bed cocooned under the warmth and comfort of my blankets trying to imagine what it must have been like to live in berlin during world war ii would i do like sigrid and risk my life to ferry jews out of germany to be caught would have dire consequences torture degradation and certain death everyone around me would be guilty by implication simply for associating with me who could i trust am i being followed and observed the characters in the book are complex and not necessarily likeable people they are ordinary people who live in unordinary times and are forced to make choices nobody should be faced with they live under constant fear and observation women are expected to be mothers to bring new soldiers or failing the birth of a son new mothers into germany to increase the purity of the aryan nation the ending felt rushed and consequently a bit confusing i think gilham should have taken his time and fleshed it out a bit more","39":"this was a wonderfully moving story a what would you do thought provoking page turner set in 1943 berlin","40":"an unbelievable wonderful account of life in berlin in wwii highly recommend this book i think all of us can relate to sigrid's character and i hope all of us would have done what she eventually learned and wanted to do","41":" a difficult book to rate as it is hard to story with complex characters which is usually a good thing for me ww2 berlin just might strip the romance off any novel or character when looking at what is a good german or a good person in bad germany or what war and living under the nazi party and fear of misstep will do to people it's suspenseful sensual dark sad and fascinating i am much more accustomed to the pov of london blitz or us involvement later into the war the central character sigrid is both slightly disassociated from her life and somehow vividly engaged two affairs one from the heart and a bit brutal the other a sort of sexual intellectual fascination while her husband a wan character that seems like a brother is on the eastern front add an inadvertent involvement with hiding jews that because a compulsive response to latent moral awareness of her world it's complex look at berlin 1943 i think the diversity of supporting characters in this microcosm fraught with missteps while trying to hold the party line is perhaps a noir accurate view of the time i hesitate to say enjoyed i was definitely absorbed","42":"i can read any genre of any book written about the human emotions and decisions surrounding the horror of wwii and finish the book enriched this doesn't disappoint","43":"i liked this book about woman who finds herself helping the underground railroad of jews during wwii it had a good amount of suspense and plot twists","44":"i was drawn to this book for the historical side of it but i ended up really liking the characters as well i have given my book to my sister to read as she loves war stories she will be adding a review soon i won a copy of this book on goodreads","45":"a layered engrossing story got a bit convoluted at the end but the setting is worn torn berlin in ww2","46":"part of me wants to give this book 5 stars for david gillham tackling an almost taboo subject the pov of war from the nazis and their women that took a lot of guts i'll give him that much the other part of me wants to give him only 3 stars for choosing to portray three of the female characters as morally bankrupt overly sexed women this is certainly not to slut shame but come on we're talking about a different era here yes i know how loosey goosey germany was in the 1930s in some ways it was a bit similar to postmodern feminism with its sexual goings on but still it wasn't the same back then and i believe that the characters should have been developed to reflect that time period properly rather than turning it into sex and the city nazi germany ericha was a perfect recreation of a college aged girl in the 21st century with her jaded view of men and sex not a young female who did what she had to do because she felt she had no choice this was in the book so it was a little strange and not to beat a dead horse here but the reaction of a husband to one of the women is a bit outlandish most men especially those who have just faced extreme violence don't act blase about their wife's infidelity in order for a man to not care about his wife emasculating him and turning him into a cuckold one of two things must be occurring either the man is a very weak beta or even gamma male or he has zero respect for his wife to the point where he's past the pain and heartbreak she caused and he's on his way out the door neither one of these are the case with this husband thus the implausibility comes into play but enough about that i only mentioned this stuff in such detail because the element of loose sexuality is so prominent in this book and there's no way to circumvent it it will hit you in the face like a ton of bricks and will make no excuses for it another thing i think is important to mention is how well the author wrote about ptsd and the ways that it affects all soldiers regardless of the soil they're fighting for and dying over or which trenches they're holed up in there aren't the words to express these things properly because they don't exist despite our attempts to defy this oh yeah and before i forget i just wanted to say that the author's use of visualization was magnificent i mean that and the understated way he wrote about the darkest unspoken side of war and how they alter the core of a soldier's being is remarkable all in all it would have been a perfect novel had he chosen to tow the line between the realities of what women face during wartime and the use of their sexuality as a means to get through it","47":"i liked the mystery of this book and it had some very great aspects to it but i really struggled with the main character it was hard for me to like her based on many of the choices she made and the way she treated her mother in law this book also took me an unusually long time to read overall i did like the book and it was well written but i was just very put off by sigrid's moral character regarding fidelity and relationships","48":"amazing story told in intricate detail it was always clear to me that sigrid's perspective was really that of the male author though","49":"as one reviewer noted this is more of a choice for fans of historical fiction on the light side some of the dilemmas and character development felt a bit contrived and if you've read much about this period the author's explanations will seem pat the fifty shades of grey meets world war ii holocaust love scenes weren't even that good i finished it because it had a mild thriller quality to it and you wanted to know what happens to the characters if you are interested in u boat life check out the nazi officer's wife for a gripping account of what happened after the russians invaded berlin read a women in berlin eight weeks in the conquered city","50":" this book was a let down i'm not really sure what it was even about a love affair i found my interest and sympathy empathy towards the characters lacking and at times nonexistent maybe it was the kindle version but the story jumped around quite a bit and there were no breaks or notes in the font paragraphs to notify this sometimes i didn't know if i was in the main character's sigrid mind thoughts or following her on her daily routine i couldn't keep things straight which made it harder to pay attention although i found myself racing through the last third of the novel it was not because i was dying to see how things would end instead i just wanted to see it end not a fan there are much better historical fiction world war ii books out there","51":"a truly amazing read could not put it down and definitely a book that asks the question what would you do","52":"couldn't finish it the characters never came to life and the sex got tiresome","53":"this was a fascinating book from the perspective of the german woman and her struggle to protect her life during hitler's war on jews while trying to help those in worse situations though fiction it gives insight into the other side of life trying to just survive amid this war first book in a long time i could hardly put down","54":"opens your eyes to what another segment of the population was going through and the scarifies they made","55":"berlin in 1943 what would you do honestly live in fear and then die horribly most likely stark and unrelenting and grieving i need to read something light now","56":"yet another angle of the wwii horrors and the plight of the persecution of jews by the nazis i had never heard of the catchers before only of jews in the camps who turned on their own in order to survive which was always the ultimate goal for anyone during that time survival it was interesting to watch how sigrid slowly changed and ended up helping the jews and gave up on the people who turned against her her mother in law renate and had to trust certain people who would help her and of course fierce ericha who sigrid developed such protectiveness for and who in the end also just wanted to survive and made choices to protect someone herself a lot of character studies that depicted what happens to people during a horrific war l","57":"this was interesting u0026amp good it just didn't gel with me","58":"the publisher's blurb calls this a page turner and i guess it is but it isn't exactly a fun read it is dark and depressing as the war years must have been as i think back over it i realize it is the development of the characters that is going to stick with me may i say haunt me","59":"i fell in love with the cover and title of this book from the first time i saw it shown as an upcoming release i wasn't able to get an arc so i had to wait patiently for the release date and then for the library to catalog the book it was worth the wait it was a great story and i won't be suprised if this is made into a movie","60":"it is 1943 and germany is embroiled in fighting on 2 fronts in wwii berlin has become a city of women sigrid schroder's husband is fighting on the eastern front and sigrid appears to be the perfect soldier's wife she lives with her insufferable mother in law surrounded by nazi supporters sigrid's chance encounter with a courageous young woman brings her face to face with her own values and past and the immoralities of war very suspenseful and interesting","61":" sigrid is a german stenographer she living her life day to day in a loveless marriage with a hateful live in mother in law the gestapo is in control food rations are low sigrid begins having an affair with a jewish man she then begins to put her life at risk after befriending a neighbor after her husband is sent to the russian front she begins helping jewish people i don't think sigrid was insatiable even though she seems to have a lot of sex i think she was trying to feel the sex with soldier in her building with one leg seemed a bit much not because of his injury because it didn't seem necessary her friendship with his sisters odd the fact that at times sigrid wished her lovers wife and children were dead or gone was also a bit much she wasn't written as cut throat and heartless but those are cut throat and heartless thoughts maybe that's why some men shouldn't write from a woman's perspective i would have like to have a little more insight into her marriage with kaspar before her miscarriage maybe when they first met whatever was between her an egon didn't seem like love at least not on his part i've read other books where people in very dangerous situations weren't as careful or inconspicuous as they should have been there were times when sigrid's behavior was questionable given what she was doing the book is complete with a villain frau mundt traitors etc i have mixed feelings about this book but i would recommend","62":"there have been many stories of german people who helped and did what they could to protect people from nazi violence this story does a good job of showing how one woman who chose to be blind to those things that did not concern her becomes involved lots of irony about being a good german or a criminal","63":"this was an unusual reading experience i pretty much disliked hated or despised every character in this book but yet it was very suspenseful and i had to find out what happened to everyone it took place in berlin during wwii so needless to say it was a very dark story","64":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a good read but it did take me a while to really understand what was going on i was a bit confused the entire way through on how the affair started between sigrid and egon they didn't know each other but then they sat together in the cinema and it all just started instantly was the way that gillham depicted the german women true that they were all sleeping around i haven't really heard this side of ww2 before","65":"this book was hard to put down the sexual parts were more explicit than i felt they should be but it was a critical part of story war would certainly cause us to act in ways we wouldn't dream of what would i do when faced with the situations that the main characters of this story faced it takes place in germany during wwii","66":"taking place during wwii this book has many layers and complicated imperfect characters which i loved the main character has faults but you can't help but forgive her those faults given some of the decisions she makes i was sad to reach the end","67":" i didn't enjoy this book the setting hitler's berlin and subject matter the extraordinary efforts of ordinary germans to help jews evade capture and extermination are too emotionally difficult but the well drawn believable characters and the wrenching decisions and dangers they faced kept me reading the plot was credibly and satisfyingly unpredictable i found myself as the characters had to not trusting anybody or anything the whole thing was just raw the need the fear the privation and yes the sex and descriptions of everyday life under nazi rule terror suspicion and betrayal and during wartime rationing bombings separation from family and the overall cheapness of human life were vivid and affecting if you're at all interested in this era or like historical fiction in general this superlative example of the genre is well worth reading","68":"sad frightening plot revolves around the array of roles german women were forced to play during the holocaust powerful story","69":"this was a very quick and enjoyable read there were some parts that i don't think added to the story line in the way the author had hoped but they didn't detract from the story enough to fuss too much about","70":"i read this book in a weekend during a trip to the cottage it was ok that's it nothing special i found the characters flat the atrocities of the war were glossed over and the ending the climax was bland and confusing the author basically describes his main character sigrid as cold and distant and she is it's hard to work up any empathy for her or understand her motives when the reader isn't really allowed into her mind as a reader you follow sigrid through her daily routines and you question her decisions because you have no clear idea of what she's feeling it's like watching a character move through fog you sort of get glimpses every now and then but that's it listen i'm all for women's lib and i understand needs and so on but three of the main characters in gillham's book are out catting around with multiple men while their husbands are off at war i wonder how accurate that really was don't get me wrong this was an interesting read but if you want to know more about the atrocities of war in berlin or what the jews went through there are tons of books that cover the material in a more cohesive and engaging format enjoy this one for what it is a cottage read that requires little thought and doesn't dip more than a pinky toe into the serious subject matter being used as a setting for the story","71":" first off i liked this book and i ended up liking sigrid for her courage and her honesty i liked the very german historical aspect of this book with the german phrases and the slang from the homefront however i have some problems with this book too 1 i find it odd that sigrid has the same caustic conversations with nearly everyone she encounters from lovers to friends to her mother in law i get that the time era evoked anxiety but the lack of different kinds of personalities leaves me frustrated the only two people in the novel who are not razor tongued and sarcastic are the pregnant neighbor and anna weiss and neither of them are major players in the novel i'm not looking for everyone to be cheerful but better character variety is needed 2 i'm not entirely bothered that sigrid is so easy to bed by egon and wolfram but i don't exactly understand her motives the relationship with egon has at least a little background story but with wolfram he simply says to her in the hall that he wants to have sex with her so just like that she does the novel spends a great deal of time showing sigrid's integrity in all other areas of her life yet she jumps into bed when a stranger says she'll like what's in his pants i don't know if the author needed a reason to connect the two characters because wolfram will become an important player but it seems gillham should be developing their relationship so at least when the sex does happen that it's more plausible","72":"this book finished with a bang but it took nearly the first half to get there a common feature of literary fiction in the end i enjoyed it the writing was spot on the characters were complicated and well developed the setting well integrated if it hadn't got off to such a slow start i'd give it another star","73":"prob 4 1 2 the fast paced book about wwii berlin kept me page turning i wanted to see what happened to these vividly drawn characters a moving story thanks to my friend s for passing it on","74":"i really liked this book the main character sigrid is pulled into something almost unwillingly but ends up doing what she knows in her heart is right the author asks what would any of us do if we were presented with a hard decision to make sigrid has to make a decision on the spot i wonder what i would have done berlin in 1943 is a dark place not only are they being bombed nightly by the british and rounding up jews by the thousands but neighbor is pitted against neighbor and family member againgst family member it was in interesting look at the life of berliners during that time","75":" city of women was a kindle daily deal so i had no real expectations going into it it turned out to be a wonderful book the story takes place in 1943 and the city of women is berlin it is the city of women because the men are all off fighting in the war the main character is sigrid shroder her husband kaspar is off fighting and like the other women of berlin she is just trying to get by sigrid is a complicate character and the struggles that she faces everyday really made me stop and think about how would i have responded if i had been in her shoes there were good germans and there were bad germans as a matter of fact your definition of a good or a bad german would depend on a lot of things the book made me wonder what would i have been i would like to think that i would have found the atrocities unbearable and i would have tried to help like sigrid and like sigrid i would have probably been a little of both...good and bad the story is haunting and the writing is lovely she is not displeased when she looks in the mirror she simply seldom bothers to the years of war have redefined her in very restricted terms she is a number on a pay book on a booklet of rationing coupons a face on an identity card she is frau schroder a kriegsfrauu the wife of a frontline soldier her name is merely something to which she answers only the newspaper claimed his interest as she adjusted her scarf and settled herself in the seat trying to build her walls to of the empty space","76":"germany during the second world war suffering of the average civilian person resistance been there read that okay but \"the city of women\" is a bit more than just that it brilliantly combines romance with resistance fighting rebellion with having to comply with the rules the protagonist develops so much in all aspects and in the end is a real hero and very brave the focus on the everyday women left in the city of berlin and constantly threatend by bombs and the party is rather special unlike the children in all the light we cannot see and the book thief the adult protagonist here is able to do a lot more and have more impact which also added more suspense and real danger i liked the insight into her emotion like the conflict between wanting to rescue jews and the jealousy she feels towards the wife of her lover who is one of the jews she is trying to rescue quite well written the only thing i have to complain about is the use of german yes me again with my languages i know there were many many german words that were not translated explained or put into context which would confuse a non german reader on the other hand some german terms were translated literally into english which is no good either but other than that great novel","77":" http adult owltellyouaboutit com posts city of women there's something very eye catching about the cover of city of women and i have to admit it's the reason i first considered it when i received a copy in the mail from penguin audio and read the synopsis i was convinced i would love it i have a small obsession for anything set during world war ii even though it was a sad horrific time in history i've always found it interesting i was correct in my assumption that i would enjoy this though i have to say it took me to places i didn't really want to go even though i occasionally felt that i had to get away from it for a while finishing it felt incredibly rewarding sigrid schroeder is an incredibly complicated character there were times when i loved her times when i pitied her and times when i hated her in a story about how far people will go to survive she makes a big impression i ended up respecting her a lot because even though her intentions in the beginning were anything but noble she has a really good grasp on what she could live with and what she couldn't there are several more characters that i would consider important but i don't want to spend this entire review talking about characters partly because sigrid is the most important one and the only one that has a real development i will say that i think david gillham does some amazing character writing and i loved the raw complexity that every person in this story had people aren't always what they seem and that really shows when they're forced into life or death situations as for suzanne bertish i never had a doubt in my mind that she was sigrid schroeder bertish seamlessly switches voices for characters her low voice lends itself very well to the male characters i could almost pick everyone out just by the voices she used there is a distinct sound to sigrid's voice to egon's voice to erika's voice i thought she was superb from start to finish i did notice some mispronounced german which could be a difference of dialect i don't know enough about germany to make a call on that i just know she pronounces it differently than i learned it but i think her good pacing syntax and emotion really outshine any flaws there might be one thing that struck me early on was the detail the street names the german terms and slang it all brings berlin alive in my head a less researched book would only contain passing references to the setting but wwii berlin is there present and looming that can be a difficult thing to find in a book sometimes details are important and i was thrilled that gillham paid such good attention to that something else that won me over later in the book was the twists gillham spent all this time laying everything out on the table and then with swiftly turned everything i believed on its head it was brilliant and it actually turned things around for me there was a moment about 3 4 of the way through when things were so hopeless that i was asking myself why on earth i was listening to something so sad i was trying to wrestle through everything i'd listened to to find the point but it wasn't given to me until the end and when the last sentence was spoken i knew i had just finished a really great book city of women is a melancholy book full of death and betrayal but if you're willing to brave the emotional ride it's worth a read it's definitely worth a listen suzanne bertish does a terrific job with the narration i highly recommend this book especially to anyone interested in wwii era fiction disclaimer i received this audiobook from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","78":"i did not want this book to end beautifully written with characters that came to life loved it","79":"interesting perspective on wwii told from the women left behind in berlin","80":"city of women brings us to wwii berlin while the men are at war the women left behind struggle between conflicts of humanity and survival between ties of love and loyalty gripping storytelling thank you shelf awareness for sending me a review copy","81":"awesome story will read work from this author again","82":"this books starts out slow and is obviously rather depressing at points but it really picks up at the halfway point the author really examines the idea of accidental heros","83":"interesting and thought provoking book about berlin in 1943","84":" a friend loaned this novel to us - we had never heard of gillham before the story unfolds in berlin in 1943 during the point of wwii when the nazis are starting to lose on all fronts with virtually all the males gone to war berlin is now mostly a \"city of women\" typified by one sigrid schroder the central character who lives with her hateful mother in law has a job at a patent office but spends most of her free time at a movie theater hubby is indeed off to war but sigrid seems rather handy to cheat with a couple of men especially a jewish man she met in the balcony of the theater when a young girl suddenly seeks her help to fool the authorities at the theater sigrid increasingly gets involved with clandestine activities to hide jews and other \"undesirables\" from the nazis to make matters worse apparently some other jews serve as \"catchers\" to rat out their own people in return for extra food or other \"perks \" and so we watch sigrid increasingly try to mollify her contempt for the nazi practices by engaging in all manner of forbidden antics to be direct while the writing skills on display were fine this story was just too depressing to please us the horrors of the holocaust are well known and while this tale shed light on the mores of some of the innocent germans who wanted nothing to do with the real nazis the duplicity and ugliness central to the novel while no doubt realistic did little to entertain as a return on our reading time investment at this point we're just not that fond of books highlighting man's inhumanity to fellow man - of that we're old enough to be plenty well aware","85":"so it took me an entire day to figure out what i wanted to say about city of women also to figure out what i was feeling after having read it i feel sad sad for the way the characters lived sad for the situation they were in definitely sad for the way it ended this book was intense from the very beginning intense it was intense and passionate and sexy and gripping and i was captivated i found myself in berlin with sigrid and ericha as they dared what no other could even imagine sigrid and egon wow i never wanted their story to end from the start you knew they were in deep lust for each other but as the story continued you knew sigrid was falling for him though it didn't appear that egon reciprocated the exact same feelings as the story continued i think they finally found love in one another even though it was a tumultuous dangerous passionate adulterous love they still loved even perhaps for the first time before reading this book i read quite a few reviews i always like to read the bad reviews to determine what i might be getting into all i can say is i don't know which city of women they read but the one i read was pretty fantastic","86":"riveting rcs~","87":"just setting a book in wartime berlin automatically classifies it as a thriller gillham has expanded this by creating sigrid a sympathetic heroine who has a sort of coming of age as the realities of her situation unfold a few years back i read a woman in berlin by anonymous which was a memoir by a woman who actually experienced a life similar to that of sigrid what women had to do in order to survive the constant bombings and increasing shortages is nothing short of remarkable my reading of hans fallada has somewhat spoiled me for the fictionalized accounts but this one had so much drama and tension it held my interest","88":"i received this book as a goodreads giveaway winner i loved this book i was in berlin in july and have recently read a few fiction books during wwii they have been from different perspectives and this one is about the women who are left behind in berlin during the war the main character is sigrid whose husband is off to war and she is stuck home with a mean mother in law who is a member of the party and a mundane job she befriends ericha who is supposed to help a woman in sigrid's building take care of her children but ericha helps smuggle jews and other people out of berlin sigrid gets sucked into helping and also has a love affair with egon who is a jew the characters are very rich and developed i worried about what would happen with every turn would the gestapo find them can they get the jews out of berlin we know jews were being helped and hidden in different safe houses who knows if berlin had a lot of sex happening during the war i think it could have happened because they needed to escape the war the berliners were also being misled to what was happening with the war what a beautiful book and i could see it as a movie i thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to share it with friends and family i would recommended and have already recommended it to several people","89":"very good historical novel","90":"a friend recommended this book before my trip to berlin while there were interesting aspects to it the premise lost me i just couldn't buy into anyone much less a good german woman meeting a jewish man in a movie theater balcony going for coffee and then having sex with him in the balcony on their next meeting the affair gives rise to her work on behalf of the german resistance maybe this type of relationship was a common occurrence during the war but it felt more like titillation than truth","91":"4 5 starsthis book is a great window into the lives of the people of the city of berlin during ww2 what it must have felt like to witness the atrocities of that time and feel complicit i felt for sigrid and constantly wondered what i would do if i were to find myself in her position i was drawn into this book and i highly recommend it","92":"set in berlin during wwii we follow a woman wife of a soldier she doesn't love daughter in law to a bitter old woman sometimes lover of several men drift through the distruction and dispair around her she's not always sure of what she wants to do but she knows life has to have more than the war is giving her","93":" i'm a big historical fiction fan and find wwi i fascinating however so much of the fiction takes place in france or england rarely have i seen a book from the german perspective especially one that highlights the difficulty of living in berlin difficulty you ignored or went to prison in this remarkable tale characters evolve as they and they reader are forced to decide what's right and wrong moral mettle and physical poise are stretched to the limits in the city of a women in a struggle to find and define a good german intense and incredible","94":"i really enjoyed the characters in the story and the setting i kept thinking about how much worse things would become once the war ended","95":"this was my favorite book read so far in 2013 captivating the author wrote about ordinary people during extraordinary times set in berlin in 1943 we come to know many different women whose lives are intertwined my experience was that the book had a slow start at about page 50 or so it became a page turner don't miss it","96":"a good story with some unresolved and confusing issues would make a good movie","97":"interesting because of the history 1943 berlin the characters are crude to an extreme and therefore hard to understand with empathy until near the end and they are very real and evolved up till then it was a hard slog","98":"gillham convincingly evokes the dreary crumbling world of world war ii berlin in this novel it's suspenseful with intense passionate characters inhabiting a world of mistrust and deceit where morality has become relative and brutality is commonplace the characters are not necessarily likable but they are realistically drawn products of their environment and as such are extremely compelling as the plot gains momentum especially in the second half of the book it's a real page turner too a moving engrossing read","99":"gillham did an excellent job of balancing plot movement while ratcheting up the tension past the point of no return the book sparked excellent discussion at book club--i completely agree about the gillham's male wish fulfillment fantasy as relating to the female characters but his depictions of 1943 berlin were incredibly vivid perhaps an odd word choice given that 1943 berlin was grey drab and colorless in every imaginable way","100":"city of women is about berlin during wwii the subject manner sounded interesting but i only made it to page 75 before deciding the book was not for me and i was not going to devote time to it","101":"sigrid befriends erika in berlin in 1943 they become part of a group that hides jews from the gestapo sigrid must deal with her soldier husband her mother in law and the passionate jewish man with whom she has an affair erika is a complicated character who doesn't let anyone close powerful writing","102":"while i was not initially ready for another world war ii book this was definitely a different perspective sigrid schroeder is a german wife living in berlin and while she at first looks the other way ignoring nazi atrocities she becomes part of a network to help jews","103":"wow this was a terrific read mesmerizing from first to last page","104":"incredible story about the choices everyday people are forced to make in terrible situations really enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns that this book took","105":"an amazing book berlin during the second world war has been written to death probably because it's a dramatic time and place but gillham manages to do something fresh and fascinating not so much with the story but with the characters gillham manages to avoid the trap that so many authors fall into when they're working in this context ie the temptation to paint all germans as nazis and all jewish people as saints gillham never looses sight of his characters' humanity including their faults the result is an absolutely engaging gut wrenching read","106":"the book's overall premise was better than the book itself strange indeed since historical fiction is my favorite genre and berlin during wwii boils over with material yet i just never found myself truly connected to the characters and ultimately i labored to finish the book very odd since city of women has been well reviewed except by me","107":"i enjoyed this book easy read that kept my interest not so sure of some of the plot twists but in the end it was an enjoyable suspense","108":"i read this book for a book club i would never have picked it myself as i find the topic of berlin during wwii very difficult this is only the second book i have read where i felt sorry for germans the book thief being the other the thrust of this book is what would you have done moral compasses are thrown off bombs fall frequently food is scarce the radio propaganda is lies yet people go to work and the cinema sigurd the heroine is the wife of a soldier serving on the russian front but the time jumps back and forth she has an affair with a jewish man and is thrust into the roll of hiding jews i found this book almost too acary to read at once and read it over several days reading other books in between i was afraid for her and her accomplices and itr made for nerve wracking reading i would have been one of those jews and it was so hard to imagine","109":"great fiction but true to life story told through the viewpoint of one woman about how she and other women who were left in war torn berlin in 1943 coped and survived some not especially during the night time bombings by the allies","110":"a good old fashioned spy story","111":"started off rather slow then picked up momentum towards the end","112":"i am not really one for chick lit type books and even though this one takes place during wwii in berlin it is really a chick book in my estimation what kept my interest was the main character's struggle with her own feelings of right and wrong and her floundering alone in a society that really wasn't for her there were some events which seemed fairly implausible to me and the story tied itself up pretty well but on the whole i enjoyed the book for what it was it certainly gave me a new view of the war from the side of the women who stayed at home while their husbands and children went off to fight","113":"i am still not sure who was what in this book it is a story of hiding jews in berlin in 1943 no one was what they seemed to be i liked the book but could tell it was written by a man","114":" it is 1943 the height of the second world war berlin becomes a city of women sigrid schroder is the model german soldier's wife going to work every day and caring for her mother in law and ignoring the immoralities of the regime behind this facade is a different sigrid a woman who dreams of her former jewish lover now lost in the war sigrid is not the only one with secret she soon finds herself caught between what is right and what is wrong and what falls somewhere in the shadows between the two a very good book that has intrigue suspense and leaves you guessing about decisions made or lost definitely worth the read","115":"not the best of books on this era but it did compliment my other reading i much prefer a train in winter about women in the french resistance","116":"i'm always a little skeptical of books about women that are written by men although the nightmarish quality of the description of life in wwii berlin kept me turning pages and incorporating the story in my dreams","117":" this is a chance to step into one of humanity's darkest places berlin in 1943 while the government's propaganda insists the war is nearly won illegal wireless transmissions from britain broadcast a different story that news is of the massive defeat in stalingrad and rapidly advancing russian armies for the german woman living in berlin left behind by husbands brothers fathers and sons fighting on the front lines each day is an exercise in improvising survival who do you trust when family members turn each other in when neighbors are reporting neighbors when one decision can mean life or death in this page turner of a novel gillham shows how people who believe they are making simple daily decisions wind up defining society's fabric of morality especially during times of war the questions the author raises are profound when witnessing injustice should one look away or speak out when an unknown girl begs for help do you provide it or protect yourself and your family is one life worth more than another and against a backdrop of counterfeit documents increasing shortages and overt genocide how far will or should one person go to save just one life especially if it's your own as someone who is deeply interested in this historical period and has read many novels about nazi germany this one made me feel i now understand what it was like to live in berlin during the war it is stunningly realistic with violence that permeates all aspects of life even sex but a must read for anyone who wants a glimpse into the horror of living during a war","118":"http www goodbookfairy com 2012 09","119":"now it's your turn to answer my question he says sliding his arms around her will you help me he asks again there is only one answer to this of course yes for a month for a day for an hour if it costs her everything if it strips her skin down to the bone her answer is as it always has been yes sigrid could be a model for the perfect german hausfrau she works she takes care of her mother in law she is married to a german man who is fighting for the good of the mother country but sigrid has a secret she lives for the passionate love she has found for a man who is not her husband this man egon is a jew and in 1943 in berlin this is a dangerous liaison indeed soon sigrid finds herself helping a young woman who pleads for assistance in a movie theater and before she knows it sigrid is caught up in a terrifyingly risky business of helping to hide jews and get them transported to safety how long can she keep it up before she is caught this book was like a dream i loved it so much it made my heart race it was so packed with adrenaline and subterfuge and of course star crossed lovers which you guys know i just love i really enjoyed the pace of this book it moved fast but not too fast so where i couldn't keep up it had just the perfect amount of varying elements to keep me fully entertained the entire time i was reading it plus i absolutely loved the idea of germans within berlin assisting jews right under the noses of the nazi's it was brilliant you hear so many horrible and terrible things that went on during that time period that it's nice to remember that there were just as many brave and honorable people who fought against the heavy black tide of hitler a wonderful book not to be missed i came up here because you said i must make a choice and against my better judgment i have made one","120":"i didn't finish but don't remember why","121":"good page turner enjoyed it very much","122":"this book takes place in berlin germany during wwii one part of the german army is fighting a losing battle fighting winter and the russian army the gestapo is hunting down jews the good german citizens are struggling to live on in the city of berlin despite trying conditions i read that the book \"explores what happens to ordinary people thrust into extraordinary times and how the choices they make can either destroy them or save them or both\" that quote captured my interest now that i have read the book - i can only say that it appears that the author believes that when these ordinary people were thrust into extraordinary times they had sex i am not talking about making love - just wham bam thank you ma'am type sex aside from that distraction the plot of the book kept me in suspense trying to figure out what the heck the true motives and feelings of the various characters in the book were i was surprised by many aspects of how the people left in berlin during this period of wwii lived the shortage of food the brutal treatment of jews the frightening control of the gestapo were pretty much as i expected but other elements of what life was like were not what i expected i did not know that it was common for there to be such much cat and mouse action between \"good germans\" and jewish sympathizers i had never realized how common it was for some jews to survive by posing as \"good germans\" while working for the gestapo by identifying out other jews somehow hiding in berlin much of the suspense in the novel is built trying to figure out who is a good person and who is a traitor spy etc another surprise to me - probably because i had never taken the time to try to visualize what life was like for the citizens of berlin while the war raged around them - was that the movie theatres were still open the main female character in the book spends a good deal of time in a theatre - not because she is a movie buff but because she used that place to meet up with other characters i do not really know why that made such an impression on me but it did the author's stated intent was to try to prompt readers to ask themselves what would i do before reading the book i am not sure how i would have responded to that self reflection now after reading it i still would like to think i would be as brave as corrie ten boom - but i am afraid that my survival instinct would override my courage that does not make me proud","123":" it's berlin 1943 and all the men are at war leaving a city of women behind gillham's novel is so very cinematic gillham moved from screenwriting into fiction the story is filled with an array of interesting characters fraught with moral complexities it leaves one asking if you had lived through this terrible time in history what sort of human being would you have been i feel this book went under the radar here in canada and deserved more acclaim i would love to see this novel turned into a film i am looking forward to gillham's next novel","124":"it started a bit slow but by the end i couldn't put it down i agree with others who wonder about the author's ability to capture female characters they all seemed like caricatures it did make me think though","125":"living in berlin during wwii with her party member mother in law sigrid schroder works as a stenographer while her husband serves on the russian front lines david gillham has written a remarkable debut novel that encompasses the brutality betrayal and terror of the women who are left to survive as civilians sigrid becomes obsessed with her jewish lover and slowly evolves into a woman who fights to save the victims of the horrors being perpetrated by the nazis gillham has captured the fear of those left to survive by whatever means in war torn berlin","126":"berlin in the late stages of ww2 fascinating look at the berliners just trying to survive and the growing hatred by decent hardworking people against the jews except for a few courageous folks who risked all they have to do the right thing begs the question what would i have done how about you","127":"good story combining wwii history a love story and a bit of intrigue","128":"great read great insight of what happened and how people behaved in bunkers during air raids etc been there","129":"a good take on your traditional holocaust story told from the perspective of the german women left alone in berlin during wwii good characters and a little suspensful overall i give it 4 5 stars and would recommend it","130":" set in nazi occupied berlin in ww ii his is a strong 4 stars for me it really pulled me in and pulled me along careful descriptions not over written give a clear snapshot of time place and people's motivations and personalities interesting contrasts between full honesty and keeping secrets the end seemed a bit rushed some of the minor characters blurred together but maybe i just read too fast because there is some good suspense there are some thorny moral issues to grapple with the sex scenes were not gratuitous but frank the desperation of war was ever present shown but not just told to us which was masterful somewhat off putting choice of a non jewish heroine in this particular story like wasp reluctantly saves the world but relevant what is the obligation of a bystander today in syria","131":"i read the review of this in the costco magazine and was interested i was a difficult book to read in terms of the sad and dark lives the people led who were in berlin as the men were in russia fighting during wwii they were always under the watch of the gestapo living in fear of their neighbors who may be spying air raids and lack of food warmth and other necessities sigrid schroeder's husband was gone and she lived with her sarcasic critical mother in law whom she didn't let bully her she loved the movies and there met a jewish married man with whom she has an affair at that same venue she runs into a neighbor's house girl and gets involved in smuggling jews out of the country some of whom she believes are her lover's wife and children it accelerates in interest and tension as she gets more involved with this along with an injured soldier living in the next apartment who just returned from combat then her husband returns wounded he returns to the front as he explains that gives him a purpose she tries to explain that her life was so complacent and boring until she found a reason to live and die by helping others she is always very honest with everyone unless it endangers a life the writer is very descriptive succint and paints a bleak picture of what their lives were like during that time and in berlin","132":"the story takes place in berlin in 1943 most of the men of the city have gone to fight the war the women left behind are struggling to survive with rationing of food and suspicion all around them the main character sigrid shares an apartment with her mother in law whom she despises sigrid's husband is fighting on the eastern front the story is suspenseful and compelling as sigrid gets involved in helping people hide and escape the gestapo the book takes about two pages to get into it the writing is excellent i would consider reading it again","133":"these strong women use their sexuality and guile sometimes at cross purposes but ultimately for noble reasons a very compelling story that would have been equally good without all the gratuitous sex","134":"we have read a lot of wwii books in my book club so i wasn't sure i would willingly read this on my own but i really liked it a totally different point of view and life experience than i've previously read strong female characters with diverse outlooks on life i liked how characters were pushed to their depths when responding to people in crisis or their own life in crisis","135":" berlin 1943 wwii a different slant on the period from the german woman's point of view i read it straight thru pg 165 referennce to the nuramburg law the crystal night all jewish stores distroyed the early years of world war ii in berlin germany initially i had some resistance to what seemed first to be an acceptance of the german perspective rational consideration forced me to open my mind read forward anne frank kept coming to mind the twist of fate in the book kept me reading the war years changed so many lives quite believable i did keep in mind this book was written by a man","136":" i really enjoyed this book i really love reading book about wwii when reading a book i try my best to put myself in the story but in this case it was impossible i can't even imagine anyone going through what sigrid u0026amp the other women went through at times i found sigrid weak but at other times i found her strong i believe with finding herself she also found strength one that was very dangerous but rewarding i enjoyed the story the plot u0026amp the characters there were few shocking moments which is always a nice surprise i wasn't able to put the book down because i always wanted to know what happened next i was sitting at the edge of my seat needing to read more u0026amp see what sigrid did next what happened to the other characters ahhhh such good book","137":"an intoxicating read i read it in 3 sittings i would have read it straight through and not come up for air if i had had the chance gillham has reconstructed 1943 in berlin in painstaking detail twists and turns in the story coupled with the rhythm of the writing made it hard to put down i could say lots more but i don't want to ruin the experience for the next reader","138":" so you've read enough wwii books have you try not to think that way when considering city of women a unique wwii novel told from the point of view of sigrid a berliner who gets wrapped up in clandestine activities far beyond what she ever imagined gillham flat out states in the closing author's note that he wanted to craft a novel that challenges readers to think what would i have done and he succeeds without beating the reader of the head with that sentiment the bleak dreary berlin setting sets a tone of repression and fear throughout the book guillham paints a well rounded portrait of the rote german life as wwii continues ceaselessly the reader observes sigrid's transition from passive bystander to activist despite the pressures of the gestapo there's tragedy and guilt but in the end it's a celebration of redemption and life no matter how small a pool of people those actions impact","139":"i won a free copy of this book on goodreads this was a good book i liked the characters and the story line but i did find it to be a little hard to believe at times overall it was still worth the read","140":" i was very surprised by this book it's a story all about choices and why we do the things we do at first i had trouble getting into it and i felt the protagonist sigrid was unlikeable as the story progressed and i grew to know her the choices she made and her way of facing things became admirable if you watch the tv show grimm and started out liking all the supporting cast but not the grimm character himself but by this season you've recognized how nuanced he is and like him for it then you will relish the growth sigrid makes in her journey i also disliked most of the other characters as we meet them in the story and that changed as the book went as well though one character i did like sigrid's friend renate astounded me i could not have guessed about her i chalk all these developments up to the slow and careful unfolding of the story the author used very deliberate phrases to convey a lot of nuance at once about actions and emotions this even though he spent a great deal of time describing places locations and features extensively in my opinion he had to write it this way because sigrid never sits around and examines her motives or the larger meta ramifications of things she does she is observant to a fault but she files this information away to be called back at need and without reflection as a result we the readers are left to do all the reflection ourselves the movement is so slow that i spent a great deal of the book not knowing what would happen when the book reaches climax i knew what needed to occur but i had no idea how it would be managed since this is a novel set in wartime germany i asked myself if it was a holocaust story or a resistance story or what other kind of story this is and even now that i know what the central conflict is it would be very hard to say it is only this or that rather i think it is a resistance story with a little r the catholic kind we all face when struggling with our inner selves and moral dilemmas the only complaint i have is how quickly everything wrapped up the author kind of in the way tolkien did in the hobbit had built up a slow and long growth of the story i got to a point where i knew so many intimate details about the inner workings of so many characters that i was shocked when i realized things were being wrapped up granted he maintains the integrity of the story and their characters but it just happens fast sigrid still acts like sigrid should and her choices still reflect the growth and development she makes in the story but i guess i would have like to savor the way i had the rest of the book as i think about it though i can't see what could have been added to make it seem more complete and for me that is what made this book great because i think the best books allow readers to create their own meaning when we look at the meta stuff going on around sigrid and when we look at the dilemmas she and other characters face we have to decide how to resist or submit for ourselves the author has left the morality to us","141":"this was a well done book taking place during wwii berlin a young wife trying to simply survive with everyone else with wartime shortages faces somemoral decisions she'd rather not deal with should she risk her own life helping others or keep her head down lynnette","142":"captured the time the desperation and fear and the people of 1943 berlin add this one to your list","143":" i loved this book i am admittedly addicted to novels of wwii and that genre this book was refreshing in that it focused exclusively on the sacrifices women made particularly those that weren't in lockstep with hitler and his maniacal leadership sigrid the protaganist was by no means a woman without flaws but it was those flaws that made her character so respected by me kudos to david gillham for not tying the ending up with a neat bow but rather letting the reader come to their own conclusions about what happens to sigrid erika kaspar anna and her children karen and her nazi brother","144":" i like the idea of a city of women a city berlin in this case in which the men are at war and the women sew back together the broken pieces of lives the main character however is deplorable i felt no emphathy or humanlike qualities from her character which caused an enormous disconnect between the story and me i felt she was vulgar narcissistic and quite possibly a sociopath due to her lack of feelings or empathy although that may also be due to inadequate handling of the character's depth","145":" i enjoy books that mix fiction with real places events and people city of women is about a young woman in berlin during wwii berlin being fairly empty of men since most men were at the front dead or wounded it is impossible for us to imagine what it was like during the reign of the nazis being unable to trust your neighbor or friends to do without the things that were taken for granted before the war like groceries or stockings and to wonder about the whereabouts of those who disappeared into the army or civilians who just vanished the nazis were not the only evil people in germany during wwii much of the general populace aided and abetted quite willingly while most of the others just looked away those who risked everything to help the persecuted were real heroes extraordinary human beings this is a good read about a fictional woman who gets by during those horrible times no matter how many books i read about nazi germany though i still cannot get my mind around such evil and cruelty","146":"loved this book from a historic perspective and as a character study so many intriguing people and above all an intriguing question what would you do","147":" city of wmen is a fairly diverting novel about the women left behind in berlin at the end of world war ii the infamous rape of berlin doesn't factor here the book mostly takes place at the height of not the end of the war still there are signs even in fortressed berlin that things are perhaps not going the way the newsreels are saying the line between strategic retreat and loss is a thin one after all the main character sigrid is the wife of a german soldier left behind with thousands of other good german women trapped at home with her bitter mother in law sigrid's not eagerly anticipating the return of her husband their marriage has long been cool and before his departure she was actively having an affair with a jewish man who was living under the radar in berlin wen her lover egon resurfaces sigrid begins to question how a jewish man could live in relative freedom in the heartland of the nazis and the answers about egon's way of life are ugly to say the least this novel will add the term jew catcher to your vocabulary and then there's the strange girl who has moved in downstairs the one with the secret life helping jews escape the city who draws sigrid in to her mission they're not helped by the fervent nazi wife who moves in upstairs nor by the return of sigrid's husband from the front as if the bombs falling every night weren't danger enough what i liked about city of women was that it felt like a story you could tell about any war not just world war ii let us hope the horror of the nazis is never repeated but there are some issues and choices that sigrid faces that i could easily see myself or any woman facing in a similar situation do you do what you're supposed to or what you think is right do you turning your neighbor become a martyr or just try to survive and what about the person you're supposed to welcome home with open arms but who is now a stranger there's a lot to grapple with and i found this book did a good job at handling each issue in an honest and deft way","148":"what a hard time to live one person's idea of right was not another person's idea of right some survived but some survived and made the world a little better so did what made living worthwhile the writing style was hard to get into as it was cold and brittle perhaps to set the tone of time and place but these were still humans with feelings and emotions hurts jealousies needs people face some of this every day in some places it makes one wonder if i were there would i choose this way or that to survive or to live","149":" what i liked the point of view of women left in berlin in 1943 all the aryan men were gone off to fight a war they wouldn't win the men who were left were too young to fight making them boys or too old occasionally one would come across a man of interesting age but he was usually carrying falsified papers that kept him out of war or prison camps or was gestapo or some other police so in a country of women where the double chromosome is only valued for giving birth to and raising aryan children preferably male children what do the childless women do this is the story of what some of them do what i didn't like the characters none of them were terribly endearing what they said what they did their motivations were all disturbing it's difficult to judge their actions or inaction being berlin during wwii and i think it was still heroic to save the underdog even when the punishment was torture then death i just didn't quite understand the main conflict it was more of the story of one woman whose husband has gone off to war and she occupies her time by working at an office then committing adultery in dark theaters or wherever it can be done outside of her mother in law's eyes then she is pulled into an underground network which i thought would surely bring some interest to the story she thinks she may be harboring her lover's wife and children but even that conflict doesn't completely bring satisfaction i did like the fact that the story is not one more book to shock the reader of the atrocities of wwii and what they did to jews and political prisoners there is some shocking detail of gestapo and concentration camps but it is more of a foreign film with subtitles the protagonist quietly goes about her business without guilt or shame growing a conscience when it seems to suit her mood it's an interesting book for the simple fact of the point of view the writing is superb the characters are unlikeable though the story is not terribly engaging i have no real complaints nor raves it's a meh book","150":"overall this book was a disappointment the plot storyline sounded fascinating and i was excited to start it the writing was ok but character development was extremely flat and lacking it felt like a chore to finish it and by the end of the book i couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them i really enjoy wwii fiction but this is definitely not one of the better books of the genre","151":" this was written from the view of an aryan woman during ww ii who was pulled into something she didn't expect didn't necessarily want but then couldn't stop doing i knew without looking that it was written by a man i'm not going to say women back then and perhaps in their situation didn't hope into bed with every man they saw but i doubt all of them did the book was well written and i did find it compelling but i didn't like any of the characters it was a pretty good book that i think could have been a great one but it wasn't","152":"an absolutely fast paced and enjoyable book i seldom enjoy historical characters but gillham manages to make his people work within the framework of the time period of the wwii chaos i learned a lot about an era that i am glad i did not experience firsthand","153":"totally believable","154":"interesting to read about the time period and to see a little bit of what life was like during the war personally could have done with less of the graphic scenes","155":"the first half of this book was very slow for me i had a hard time getting into it the second half seemed better for me this book was just 'ok '","156":" city of women is best described in two words tense and intense as residents of berlin during wwii deal with the hardships of war they are confronted daily with military actions which for those like sigrid schroder pose a moral dilemma the constant doubts and suspicions of family neighbors and coworkers impart a palpable tension that is unrelenting over the course of the novel it took me a little longer than usual to become fully invested in this novel however once involved city of women haunted me night and day until i finished and then for days afterward the experience while not exactly enjoyable gives plenty of food for thought a note on the audio production city of women is one of the best executed narrations i have come across in ten years of listening to audiobooks i can't imagine another narrator doing a better job with this than suzanne bertish her voice and tone are pitch perfect you can literally feel the tension anger and fear the audio version of this novel enhances and heightens the overall experience very highly recommended read or listen listen most definitely my rating 4 stars","157":"a good read and some interesting characters trying to survive in difficult times when hiding and trying to get jews to safety a world of brave and memorable women one in particular sigrid who struggles when her injured husband returns from the front line having taken a lover she becomes deeply involved in helping one particular family to escape and finds everyone isn't necessarily always who they seem to be","158":"a wonderful well written book gives a unique perspective to novels about living in berlin during world war ii written with compassion understanding and objectivity makes no excuses just gives a glimpse into the lives of women who lived in the city","159":"suspenseful and engaging read i did have trouble believing sigrid's attraction to egon otherwise very well written","160":" i read this in one sitting on a 10 hour plane ride for which it was well suited the writing is nice but nothing too complex for a jet lag addled brain i did manage to catch lots of typos though and the plot is immersive and gripping i would not have guessed either of the major twists regarding characters who are not what they seem i did wish for more of kaspar the aloof husband and i also questioned whether an operation with such bold tactics in protecting people from the nazis could have survived the war","161":"meh i liked the writing style but i just couldn't buy a lot of the motivations of the characters the sigrid who gets involved with the underground war resistance and the sigrid who starts a sexual affair with someone she barely knows in a movie theater just don't jibe together in the end since the story hinges on her love for this guy it's not very satisfying that's not the kind of love i believe in","162":" this was a 3 read for me i started out really liking this book but then in the middle it just went off course a little for me but the end had a couple of twists that were interesting one of the things that intrigued me about the book and i thought was well done in the beginning was portraying berlin in the midst of the war 1943 this was the times that after germany's initial wins it was starting to take some serious hits especially on the russian front so all able bodied men were in the army and so this was mostly a city of women so this was a city where all news activities were controlled by the nazis and there were very strict rules on movement telling on neighbors etc - so there was an issue on who to trust on just a casual friend basis","163":"sorry i have read a lot of wwii books that were so much better this one had too much sex and not enough story also i didn't care for the writing style i gave up about 2 3 of the way through which is very unusual for me i have a big stack of unread books and i felt like i was wasting my time on this one","164":"the reader was better","165":" another book about wwii well written yes i was absorbed by the characters but i think what i loved most was the different viewpoint women in berlin what did they know their men were at war fighting for their country what else was there to know such an interesting viewpoint to consider the ending i guess was to be expected too many questions lingering but then how else could it have ended without feeling like a hallmark special so i'll accept the ending i suppose i cared deeply for these characters i could cast it as a movie in my head and for that i give it a 4 star and a recommend to my fellow bookworms","166":"i recommend this to everyone very well written book characters well formed and plot thoughtfully placed and managed throughout i would read this a thousand times it may top my original favorite books by a land slide","167":"a holocaust story with a view from the women very suspenseful and interesting","168":" 3 5 stars city of women is the pick this month for the stephen king recommends group not a book i would have picked off the shelves of the library myself but one i am glad i read i actually enjoyed city of women more than i anticipated even though i found all of the characters quite unlikeable including the main one sigrid but the writing style kept me pretty much glued to the pages the novel is set in berlin in 1943 a time of unbelievable tragedy and injustice and sigrid with her husband away fighting for the fuhrer and the fatherland finds herself having to face the realities of the situation the jewish people find themselves in view spoiler i thought sigrid seemed to be pulled into the resistance a little too easily for someone in her situation similarly there were a lot of 'convenient' allies who seemed to always be in the right place at the right time hide spoiler the fear and the fanaticism of the german people who needed to show their loyalty to 'the party' was depicted very well it must have been incredibly stressful to find yourself surrounded by people who would do anything to prove their loyalty if you weren't quite as convinced of their politics as they were the 'love' story aspect of the book was not convincing for me there seemed to be no clear reason why sigrid would fall for egon so hard he certainly didn't appear to have any redeeming qualities to him view spoiler the ending with the situation at the train station also pushed the unbelievable button as well again things went just too conveniently hide spoiler but saying all of the above i still have to say i really enjoyed city of women even with all my gripes","169":"i had a tough time getting through this one the story itself was compelling but the characters and situation so dark that it made me hesitant to pick it up to continue reading","170":" i enjoyed this book i always like reading about wwii there are so many different topics to explore this book explored how most of the european cities were populated mainly by women because a lot of the men were at war or kia mia it was interesting to see how the relationships between the women were affected by this population shift the book also looked at how people act in war time and the choices one makes and are these choices sometimes questionable justifiable because it is war time it also made you wonder what you would do in similar circumstances i like how you couldn't peg the main character as good or bad she was a dynamic character who often surprised the reader the first part of the book was a little slower paced but the action picked up a lot at the end this book would be a great discussion book","171":"i found the book a bit slow at times slugging through it but ultimately after finishing the book i did like the story and i think the last several chapters brought everything to a good appropriate conclusion the book does do a decent job providing an opening into berlin life during wwii for the average person i e the sheer boredom the informing on one's neighbors and family german propaganda that they were winning the war and a desire to believe the false info etc","172":"reminded me of the blind assassin in a lot of ways it's not as astounding as assassin but the clandestine affairs and the twisty turny bits were reminiscent a very fun read about people getting hauled off to camps","173":"surprised the author had such a good feel for writing women characters story of nazi germany and the impact on ordinary germans how do you navigate in a world where morality is topsy turvy and not something out there practiced by nameless people but your own neighbors co workers relatives friends everyone had choices to make only the lead character's mother in law was able to seal herself off from making tough decisions by isolating herself to her apartment and maintaining the role she had before the rise of hitler but even then that was a choice","174":"although hard to put down this book is also probably going to be hard to remember sigrid a married woman living with her mother in law while her husband kaspar is on the front line falls in love with a jewish man in berlin during wwii her story is largely one of personal awakening and we see her find her own voice and conviction as she gets involved with ericha and her cargo at auntie's house","175":"it was a wonderful story i wish the memories sigrid had more defined transitions yet still captivating","176":"rescuing jews in war torn berlin lots of suspense","177":" it took me a while to get into this book and to care for sigrid the main character when the book opens she is working at the patent office and living with her mother in law while her husband is at the russian front when she begins an affair with a man she meets in a movie theater the plot begins to move ahead soon she becomes involved with a young girl who is helping hide and move jews out of berlin and that is where the story really takes off and i was hooked a good read for anyone who likes historical fiction city of women is also a suspenseful thriller","178":"i loved this book the language was rich and the story was compelling with equal elements of romance and mystery i found that i was questioning myself throughout the book asking what would i do if i was in the same position and perhaps that's the whole point do we turn a blind eye to everything around us or do we try to find the truth","179":"i think that to fully understand this book one must have a basic knowledge of german culture and the german phrases used so liberally throughout the book just the term gnaedige frau is used with so many different subtexts i suspect that the author must have had some first hand accounting of berlin or germany during this period to be able to do this i have read reviews that state that there is too much sex in the book however i found it to be a not much different than describing the ration cards endless potato meals fake cigarettes bombings etc just part of life during an unthinkable period","180":" i absolutely loved this book and discovered it on accident at my company book sale in december i snagged it and then started to notice it around bookstores i feel like i've read so many books that i know plots before they happen but this book completely blew me away with it's complex characters and multiple layers it's a complicated story that really grips you and keeps you thinking i kept asking myself \"what would i do if i were in this situation \" we meet sigrid a woman married to a nazi fighting on the eastern front who is trying to navigate berlin in 1943 during wwii sigrid is a hard woman to like at the beginning but she kind of grows on you unlike other female characters in the novel she's seduced by two very different men at different times and let me just say that the sex is hot and totally believable which is pretty interesting considering the author is a man and becomes entangled with her neighbor who is hiding and moving jews to safety seriously this book is fascinating and so interesting there are so many twists and turns and adventure that you really can't see what is coming i loved it and i hope you give it a try jen's rating","181":"only read a couple of chapters while i thought it was well written the subject matter was too depressing for me at this moment will go back to it at a later date","182":"the first book i have read of what women in a war torn city one with out men survive finding strength and weakness and struggles for survival","183":" i can see that i did not give this book the kind of rating everyone else did i thought i would really like it because i love to read anything set during world war ii this one sounded particularly interesting because it was about the home front in berlin i don't think i have ever read a book from that viewpoint before the central character was a middle class berlin housewife whose husband was at the eastern front she like all berliners was trying to get by as best she could with the shortages and reduced rations she like all berliners had to survive the bombings of berlin by the royal air force she like all berliners had to tow the line with the decrees and idealogy of the third reich but underneath all this she lived a secret life a life that put her and everyone close to her in danger this would have been a good story to tell but i soon became disgusted with the book because every relationship that she had with anyone had to do with sex she had a jewish lover and their interactions were not loving at all she had an affair with the brother of her neighbor the only thing she talked about with her friend at her work was about sex and the affairs that each of them were having she even imagined that the people she was helping to hide and get out of the country were the wife and children of the jewish man she was involved with she constantly wondered if she should let them by caught so that her lover could be all hers it seemed like the author wanted to convey that all berlin women were having affairs while their husbands were off at war he also brought out the idea that the command headquarters supplied all the troops with prostitutes to relieve the stress of fighting i really got tired of reading about it the fact that the book ended with the housewife fully involved in her secret world getting falsified documents for the family and helping them escape did not sweeten the book for me","184":"a great effort to explore the moral complexities of berliners in the winter of 1943 as the war edges towards loss and jews are rounded up and deported the characters are complicated contradictory and often unlikable but gillham draws the net closer and ratchets up the tension as each player must make decisions in various cloak and dagger games involving life and death","185":"such an important part of history overlooked","186":"in the beginning i didn't think i would care for this book i knew the story line was about the second world war in 1943 in berlin but in the first quarter of the book the writing is dry and emotionless i almost stopped read but i'm glad i didn't because i think that you need to read that beginning and feel the black and white emptiness of the main characters life sigrid and surroundings to know why she does what she does within the story was this book the best i've ever read no but it was good and worth reading i would recommend this book to someone who wants to read about this time period who doesn't mind that the story flip flops from the present to the past who is intrigued by suspense and reading about people who are put in situations where they have to choose what's right and what's wrong","187":"the book's title indicates what berlin was like during wwii women waiting for their soldiers to return home women enduring the air raids women keeping an eye out for traitors and those not following the german edicts at that time and women going to work sigrid lived with her mother in law and hated every moment she worked in the day and kept people on their toes at all times but always made friends her favorite place to meet people for clandestine reasons or even legitimate reasons was in the movie theater you will follow sigrid through her daily routines as well as her covert actions of smuggling and other secret activities you will also be fearing what her decisions would be in different situations situations involving fellow citizens situations where she would be meeting a lover or situations where she was helping hide jewish people i liked sigrid and could see why she despised living with her mother in law she was a very strong woman and knew who she could trust and who was actually trying to trick her to see if she was being loyal to hitler her decisions were the basis of the book and what made the book quite gripping the book was beautifully written with wonderful detail and great descriptions of what life was like in berlin at that time in history the german names were a bit difficult to keep track of and it took a few pages to get into the storyline but you could figure out what was going on and will become completely absorbed in the book because of the author's magnificent writing this is a compelling novel that will have you putting yourself into the story and also one that will be making you nervous for the characters as they endured the life they lived and definitely will be making you fear the outcomes of their unethical or illegal deeds you will become immersed in the story and the characters simply because of the eloquent writing style of the author and its riveting content even though it takes a few pages to get involved with the characters and the story it is a book you won't want to miss the cover itself is enough to draw you in the genuine feel of the era is magnificently relayed to the reader and takes you along page by page into berlin and into the lives and terrors of berlin's citizens 5 5 i received this book free of charge from the publisher at the bea in new york city in june of 2012 in exchange for an honest review","188":"exellent world war ii story i loved it","189":"interesting perspective about life for women in berlin during the war and choices disturbing","190":"fascinating story of berlin in the middle of ww ii the heroic efforts to save jews the german's fight to stay alive painful to read","191":"very slow moving depressing book about life of a german woman at the beginning of the war i just couldn't finish it","192":"what would you do if you were asked to break all the rules and risk your life to save others i'd like to say that i could this book made me reflect upon this question and made me think about what life was like in germany during wwii this was emotionally a tough read but the plot was fast and well executed i would recommend it if you are in a philosophical mood","193":"mesmerizing tells not a pleasant tale a life of ordinary woman in berlin during ii world war but it is so well read it makes you feel as you were there and makes you imagine you had to do their choices","194":"i truly enjoyed this book characters setting and story i don't have anything negative to say but that's probably because i had no expectations at all i found myself picturing the story as it unfolded which i rarely do who knows maybe they'll make this into a movie wait it doesn't have any vampires or supernatural components so i doubt it","195":"berlin during wwii from the viewpoint of the women that stayed behind captivating descriptions of the city and good characterization just enough intrigue to pique my interest a good historical fiction read despite one flaw the frequent sexual escapades of the women made me somewhat doubtful that the author was describing the true feminine nature that existed during wartime","196":"this book was on one of those countless best of lists that you see at the end of every year i think it was by npr books and the review sounded like this would be an interesting read not a bad novel but certainly doesn't deserve to be on any kind of best of list it's a mildly entertaining thriller about a married german woman who has an affair with a married jewish man and then later on gets involved with a group that is hiding jews in berlin not a very original idea while i didn't expect the novel to do a philosophical treatise in the manner of eichmann in jerusalem on the question of individual guilt and responsibility at the time of a state sponsored genocide this novel just bypassed any such serious considerations it's just a shallow narrating of events without peering into the minds of its characters that's the difference between real literature and mindless storytelling the writing is not good and sometimes downright weird bad similes abound exempli gratia the girl's mouth is clamped shut as tightly as a virgin's knees","197":"i was certainly interested in the story but the title is misleading the book really was about one woman sigrid and the choices that she makes and the people men and women germans and jews with whom she interacts i thought that there would be much more about the other characters in the book the final pages were thrilling i am not sorry i read it just a bit disappointed","198":"i give this book three stars only because i never quite connected with the story at the same time the story is good and i loved this thought by the author at the end of the book it's about ordinary people making hard decisions in extraordinary times it's about small decisions leading to bigger decisions and it asks at what point does one arrive at a moral commitment i think sometimes i don't have to be captivated by a book to be moved by the story","199":"took a while for me to get into the story but very good story in the end","200":"excellent i could not put it down i asked myself what would i do if i had been put in sigrid's position i think i would have done the same thing protect those in hiding and never give up","201":"this is a masterpiece the war torn berlin gillham has recreated is realistic and he has succeeded in portraying the realities with which his characters have to deal with a reality in which one needs to make morsl choices where betrayals lurk at every corner","202":"city of women by david r gillhami started this book with great hope for a fascinating read kirkus and the new york times promised a tale of love and intrigue by the 100th page i was bored and didn't like any of the characters sigrid seemed especially shallow the plot hadn't appeared yet and i quit reading sorry","203":"this is dark story filled with desperate characters living in misery hunger and despair in germany during wwii the story depicts the real life complications between right and wrong during this time and brilliantly portrays the confused emotions of it's characters this book although very dismal is completely addicting","204":"i think there are many warnings here as churchill said those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it we must be vigilant in guarding our freedoms beware of the creeping loss of liberty bit by bit and you'll never feel it until it's too late beware of leaders who say one thing and do another don't make the naive mistake of thinking it can't happen here the german's did think it could happen to them either","205":"great character development and historical references to berlin architecture during wwii until last 3 4 of book then it seems as if author sped through to tie up loose ends very disappointing ending in terms of finding meaning and resolution for characters","206":" a wonderful 4 star readevery time i read about hitler's war i am amazed by the people and the choices they make and i wonder what would i have done how would i have handled my life in war......the story starts out a little slow and this is not a fun or light read this is gut wrenching and thought provoking u0026amp it took me a while to get into it but once i did i needed to know more sigrid is a good german girl world war 2 is coming to an end her husband as with most of the men in berlin are dead or off fighting and she is left alone in a city of women she is living with her nasty mother in law and the only thing to do to escape the hell of war is go to the theatre it is there that she is reluctantly drawn in to helping the jews and eventually falling in love with one of them this is a book about questions and choices how and why we make them and the consequences that can follow us for a lifetime p s i love the cover art of this book","207":"i could not put this book down loved the history the way the characters are developed throughout the book makes you fall in love with them i could see every event that was happening one of the best books i've read lately definitely a must","208":"really good read intriguing and always surprises you","209":"a bit grim but intriguing this story would probably make a good movie there is a good deal of suspense as you worry about the characters what their real motivation is and what their fate may be","210":"i'm not going to bother giving a description of the plot beyond saying that it's set in berlin during wwii many people seemed to really like this book so i'm struggling to figure out why it missed the mark for me i found it very easy to put down even during portions of the book that i later realized were meant to be a big moment of suspense what was missing for me for one thing the characters never really came to life for me also i think i prefer a story that is written in 1st person i didn't like that i never really got inside the main character's head and it felt obvious that it was a male author writing about women lastly perhaps i just don't like reading fictional stories when there are so many amazing true stories in this setting so having said all of that i also can understand that other readers who enjoy historical fiction may appreciate this book this review is not meant as a critique of the writing just a description of my lack of enthusiasm while reading it","211":"the writing felt a bit flat and the characters didn't feel very real especially their conversations hard to keep reading on","212":"well written in terms of a sense of time and place very atmospheric and vivid setting but the characters particularly sigrid are poorly written and ring false sigrid reminded me of a robot and i didn't get her love for egon never felt any of the characters were well developed i agree with one of the other reviewers the movie sex scene felt very out of place","213":"3 1 2 stars this is a fine debut that is entertaining and touching but unfortunately outstays its welcome a bit the first and third act aren't the problem here it's the long middle that makes the novel feel too long and somewhat misshapen the characters and plotting are compelling and this is a good novel that borders on really good my problem with it is that it was just too long we spend so much time with the characters that they get a teensy bit grating after awhile if you're a fan of historical fiction in particular of wwii it's still definitely worth a read but just keep the length in mind","214":"very well written enjoyed the characters the author said his goal was to show what ordinary people could do in extraordinary situations would recommend time period wwii holocaust again","215":"see my review at reading world","216":"i discovered city of women through stephen king 's \"the best books i read this year\" list for entertainment weekly's best u0026amp worst 2013 issue i started the book expecting a lot from it i wasn't disappointed david r gillham creates a world of fear desperation and double crossing in his imagining of 1943 nazi era germany the protagonist of his novel is sigrid an aryan woman who is pulled into the world of saving jews being hunted by the gestapo i would call her an irritating character but then again i wouldn't call any of the characters in the book likable they are complex making their own decisions some horrific due to the circumstances they've found themselves in however at the same time that is their appeal because the decisions they make in the novel are decisions which any of us might have made if living during that time i give the novel a 4 out of 5 for its stunning descriptions and its engaging narrative but i could've done without the overly explicit sex scenes which seemed gratuitous i am not a prude by any means but they just seemed to detract from the novel rather than add to it","217":" overall this was a disappointment largely because both the made to be turned into a movie plot combined with a cast of one dimensional totally unbelievable characters whose behavior was implausible to begin with made it difficult to take this novel seriously which is too bad because the setting and historical time frame berlin 1943 led me to expect much more to be fair the author did a good job setting the stage - germany was losing the war but unwilling to admit it and ordinary citizens were living in a state of constant fear not only because of the bombing raids that were desecrating their lovely city but also because of the crippling terror of being turned in to the gestapo by neighbors and even family members if suspected of being critical of the war effort in this kind of environment most people simply looked the other way when confronted with evidence of the unspeakable atrocities being suffered by jews to speak out was to risk arrest and a worse fate awaited those who were caught attempting to help jews escape being sent to death camps in cattle cars having read many books about this period from the allies' perspective i had hoped this novel would provide a realistic glimpse into what life was like on the german home front instead the author used the setting as the backdrop for a plot that depended on too many implausible premises and kept veering off in directions that simply didn't make sense the characters were just as unbelievable as the plot and it was difficult to find anything very likable about any of them they all had an edge to them - and some of them like mother shroder the protagonist's mother in law were so over the top bad that they quickly became a caricatures rather than multi dimensional characters oddly enough for a novel that was set in a city where there weren't a lot of men around at the time much of the action involved the sexual exploits of the central female characters and their male lovers in fact the entire novel revolved around the truly incongruous sexual relationship that began when a jewish man sat down next to a respectable german housewife at the movies and asked her if she knew what to do with the bulge in his pants i can't help but wonder if this novel revealed more about the male author's sexual fantasies than what life was like in berlin in 1943","218":"this was ok i loved the fact that everyone was deceiving and betraying everyone else the sense of tension that must have pervaded berlin was palpable however just because of the above point got rather confused and the characters weren't somehow totally believable","219":"originally i was extremely disappointed in the first 200 pages or so of this book i love wwii inspired novels and for such a difficult time in history i felt like the story line was falling short by the end of the book i appreciated what i thought was lacking the drabness of the book matched the character as her former self and by the end she was everything i'd hoped she would be","220":" this is a different look at wwii it is set in berlin in 1943 when it was becoming obvious that germany was losing the war against the allies in a last ditch effort for supremacy it seemed hitler ordered an all out sweep to clear all jews out of berlin and surrounding areas women were important in the carrying out of this directive however some women were also not in favour of this action and set about thwarting the success the reader becomes familiar with the shadowy underground of berlin and some of the unsavoury characters who were left behind when war broke out it is a book unlike any other i have read about wwii i cannot say it was enjoyable because at times it horrified me but i can say that it was a very good read","221":" the setting was enthralling the love story wasn't entirely off putting but for a good housewife to jump so quickly between companions i felt it would have been more true for her character if one ended before the next began beware the love story is not a distraction as one reviewer noted it makes up 60% of the book basically i feel like this book would do better as a movie or a tv series i would have rated this a 4 but the last 1 4 of the book changed pace and the strong memorable female characters became strangers which made the story a little less believable but wrapped up the plot with a happy ending","222":"i normally don't trust books when all of the quotes are from other authors and this one didn't disappoint lost interest about 1 3 of the way through i felt as if i'd heard this story before but better told too many books to read to waste time on something that isn't my thing","223":"this was a fabulous book set in berlin during world war ii that tells of the courage of two women who hide jews to avoid the concentration camps although both women have their own human frailties they exhibit extreme bravery in their choice to help i am fascinated by this period of history and couldn't help but think about anne frank as she was hidden in an attic by a german","224":" if i had not read the berlin station series starting with zoo station and all the way to the 6th novel finale david downing this book would have probably been a 4 star for me but knowing the horrendous complexity of just obtaining the basics of life and of shelter in these years in berlin and also the levels of loyalties and eyes you needed to have at times being blind at others well it made this tale highly unlikely and there are parts of it well i just could not suspend my disbelief re the emotional connections as they were portrayed here it held some aspects of observance and a few times of character judgment that were also absolutely revisionist and would never have been able to be so conceived at that time and in that place","225":"the slow transformation of an ordinary german hausfrau in wwii berlin into a woman who keeps one step ahead of the gestapo in her quest to do the right thing along the lines of there is no such thing as a small decision what starts with the simple question are you alright ends with a total transformation of self city and world","226":" full of passion and suspense easily one of my favorites of the year 1943 berlin all able bodied men are fighting the allied forces and what is left is a city of women it is their duty to the war effort to carry on with their work their lives and their ignorance of what is happening around them hausfrau sigrid schroder lives with her mother in law while her husband fights on the front not quite the good german woman like her neighbors are sigrid gets caught up in an affair with a man of many secrets and befriends a young fraulein despite the warnings of others nothing is what it seems on the surface not in berlin during wwii not when the government rewards people for spying on their neighbors not when listening to the bbc is punishable by law and not when someone will turn on their closest friends just to save themselves the choices in 1943 berlin are between life and death everyone has a secret to hide it becomes easy to lose oneself in the web of lies and deceit sigrid is pulled into the underground world of berlin black market goods smuggling jews and love affairs she is not sure who to believe and who she herself has become this time in history is brutal which usually makes for a highly dramatic story and david r gillham does not disappoint as he takes readers deep into berlin during the height of world war ii full of passion and suspense city of women kept me glued to the pages the story is intricate and flips around a bit in its weaving timeline so i found that i had to pay close attention but the rewards were abundant when i first held this book in my hands at bea and read the synopsis my heart beat a little faster then i had the pleasure of meeting author david gillham at a penguin event and knew just from talking to him that city of women was going to be something special i admit that i have a special place in my heart for wwii fiction books like sarah's key the book thief and unbroken lie prominently on my favorites shelf i am happy to say they have a new neighbor up there","227":"powerful story it's hard to put things into perspective when events were so long ago but this book really opened my eyes to how it really truly may have been for german civilians during wwii","228":"a good book that would make an amazing movie","229":"what i loved and hated the most about this book was the pure call to action that it instilled in me i loved how this book made me a think about truly the struggles of being a civilian in germany in wwii may have been like b how civilians across the globe are choosing to blind eye current conflicts that now more than ever impact all of us indirectly and directly in our small world it makes me want to take better action in supporting social justice work within our community country and internationally i love when books have this magic along with good characters on a more story line front i either wanted more or less focus on the romance its too middle of the road","230":" i have read some many books on germany in wwii and this one will stick with me more than any others it was dark but probably was much closer to the true emotions of various ages of women sigrid's mother in law who hates her and is a good party members the story starts in the back row of the theatre and has many twists and turns and sub plots i couldn't put it down the emotion was always present with the pictures of sigrid schroder with her husband at the front and her lover a jew so many women in different roles and so many men with stories unbelievable the moral issues and the trueness are amazing i listened to this story and the story read by suzanne bertish is so perfect it would make a excellent book discussion for women i could hardly believe that a men wrote of the womans would make an excellent movie","231":"not the first book i have read with a similar story set in germany in the war and people getting involved to hide jews difficult and horrible times in germany sigrid is married to a german soldier fighting on the front and lives with his miserable mean mother in law lots of twists and turns in this book and sigrid ends up having two loves and then her husband is wounded and comes home","232":"loved it right from the beginning i was hooked","233":"interesting historical novel","234":"a good book hard to keep track of some of the characters but a interesting oak nonetheless and really brought to life whatif was like to live in nazi germany during the war","235":"so often you hear questions of black or white or grey areas well this book brings those concepts to a whole different level i started out listening to the audiobook and finished with the printed book strange as this may sound i preferred listening to it because the narrator with her german accents really brought it to life for me in a way that was lost when i switched to print regardless in the end it was an amazing and moving book it's nearly impossible to say it was a 'good' book because of the horrific topic and storylines it was a painful read but overall really it was superb very well developed completely fleshed out characters the premise and plots of the book multi layered and intriguing albeit terrifying plenty of twists and turns in the plot and characters and an ending that was simultaneously satisfying and yet left me wanting more it was a deeply thought provoking novel i believe both by intention of the author and the mere fact of the subject matter 1943 berlin all the men are gone to war leaving the women children elderly to fend for themselves in desperate times scarce food and supplies nightly air raids and bombings relentless arrests and worse of jews and others deemed to be anti german amidst such desperation everyone is suspect and no one trusts anyone not even one's own family friends neighbors co workers even those you think you know completely you may not know or trust at all the book asks you to think in such dire circumstances what would you do not only is there no black or white to that question there is an infinite spectrum of grey too where we would fall in that spectrum one can only pray we never have to find out","236":"well written historical fiction too vulgar in some places to give it a full five stars","237":"i really loved this book it was a little hard to get into but once i was into it i was really hooked it was about the women who lived in berlin during wwii and how they worked to save the jews from the nazis and then again there were turncoats who actually were catchers who pretended to be helping them but were really working for the nazis and just saving their own skin","238":"i enjoyed this novel i liked the main character sigrid and was interested to see what she would do next","239":" this book really took me by surprise it was very powerful and suspenseful i thought it might be more of a typical story about the typical wartime struggles of people just centered more on how the german population fared it was that but also so much more it was full of suspense betrayal and anguish it showed how awful it was how even the mose typical families were ripped apart and how awful it was to not be able to trust friends or neighbors workmates and even family members in addition to soldiers and police there were gestapo party members and opportunists waiting to turn anybody in who could benefit them their were even catchers jews themselves who turned in other jews no one could trust anyone a stray glance or careless comment could lead to your disappearance i kept seeing this story as a film like a hitchcock suspense thriller it was really good reading and grabbed my attention quickly and held on to it right to the riveting end hard stuff","240":"this is one of the more thought provoking books that i have read lately it is set in berlin in 1943 obviously the war is not going well for the germans but most germans are dismissive of that the hunt for jews is ever present and most good germans at least look the other way even if they are not anti semitic berliners are living leaner living with routine trips to the cellars to escape bomb raids living with the ever present fear of the gestapo in the midst of this is sigrid who has for many years turned and not faced the real truth of what is happening in nazi germany she is suddenly confronted with a choice to either directly help or to continue to look the other way she makes a decision to help and continues to make that decision finding herself deeper and deeper into the covert world of protecting those who for whatever reason have gone underground is it a moral choice as in other aspects of her life she does not always choose the moral high ground even in this world of trying to save the hunted there is constant betrayal it is tough as you have to develop a tough skin and eyes in the back of your head this is an edge of the seat read and one that forces you to consider what would you do given that situation i had often thought how and why the german people allowed the atrocities of wwii to happen but then how much could one woman do to help sigrid gives us an answer this was a really good read","241":"this is an extremely good book about sigrid a german woman married to a german soldier she starts out only centered on herself and her jewish lover things evolve and she finds out what is really happening to the jews in berlin she ends up becoming involved in a movement to get jews to safety and that's when she finds out just how bad it is for them and just how far the german government will go to not only get rid of jews but to get rid of anyone helping them it's a dark book about a dark time but it's important to know that not all germans were complacent or ignorant about what was really going on in their country and some did try to do what they kid sometimes paying with their own lives although this is a fictional account it is based on actual events","242":"slow to start exciting parts overall interesting a different perspective","243":"there were things that i didn't understand and maybe i missed something during the reading but overall the book was fantastic it was well written it had just the right amount of gore to make your stomach queasy without going overboard and was completely believable highly recommended and i will most certainly be looking out for more of this author's work","244":"berlin during the height of the war most men are at the front the city has become a woman's city the main character is a dutiful wife whose husband is with the german army she also has a lover most women do at this time but her lover is a jew she also meets a woman who gets her involved in things she would never have thought she could or would do she starts helping jews escape u0026amp hide from the nazi's well written you just never know what you would do faced with situations","245":"i'm torn between giving this book 2 or 3 stars it started out so painfully slow but got better after page 100 it's an interesting look into berlin during wwii but overall i would say the book is perfectly average","246":" i was torn about my feelings with this book on one hand i really enjoyed the time period and the ideas behind this story a woman in early 1940's berlin she is confronted by some serious moral questions and concerns and how can she handle them this really makes you think about how you would deal with the horror that is going on around you do you acknowledge the lines of jewish people being marched out of the city do you avert your eyes to the gestapo taking your neighbors friends co workers family and never returning at one point do you say this isn't right sigrid faces these questions on the other hand i felt like it was just missing a little something like it was on the cusp of being a fantastic novel but just didn't make it i felt like i didn't really understand sigrid or many of the characters she was facing these moral questions but why was she making the decisions that she made perhaps she didn't know but we didn't really get that inner dialogue or a sense of who she was overall i would recommend this book for the time period and thought provoking questions it asks","247":"set in berlin during world war ii an intense story that involves hiding jews of course","248":" i loved all the complexities of this story you can't put the book down there were moments when it became heavy and difficult so many betrayals the worst for me was that of egon so painful finding out about his secret simply astonished me ericha was another shocking moment of truth but when the world goes crazy when the rules and laws of germany become so criminal towards innocent people it seems that all the citizens have also gone mad hitlers' criminal u0026amp mad hunt for innocent jews led all german citizens to lurid dirty actions of betrayal","249":"excellent historical fiction that had me wondering what i would do if i lived in germany during world war ii i read this for my book club","250":"i know i shouldn't write a review on a book until i finish reading it but i just wanted to say while i am half way through the book that i absolutely love this book it is historical fiction and right up my alley i don't want to give it a full review until i finish it though","251":"pros thought provoking and a bit of a mystery around how all the characters relate to each other and what they all stand for realistic description of what it would have likely been like living in berlin during that timeframe cons i didn't really identify well with sigrid or any of the characters they were all a bit cold and unrelatable","252":"wow what a story i really liked this book just enough twists to keep it interesting","253":"8 99 another good read at 50p that would have disappointed at PS8 99","254":"i liked this book it was written from a different perspective of others of read in this time period","255":" set in world war ii this powerful story focuses on sigrid schroder and the other women living in the city while all available men except for ss officers and criminials are fighting on the frontlines the book begins with a slow and steady simmer introducing complex characters with rich histories the setting is pitch perfect in its believability gillham has done a magnificent job in taking the reader back to berlin in 1943 this is a tough time for people with a conscience sigrid is the good german wife surrounded by other good germans but circumstances put her in the position where she can not follow the party line and ignore what is happening to the jewish population but what can she do who can she trust the tension builds as sigrid walks the streets of berlin worrying about who's watching her the next air raid ultimately who to trust betrayal is common place a beautifully written thought provoking novel while reading this book the reader is asking the question what would i do if confronting evil meant a horrible death for myself and everyone i love a must read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction with big ideas and tough questions","256":" city of women was a disappointment that's putting it lightly yet i read so many good reviews of this book saw it on so many best of the month lists that i have to wonder what kind of books do all those book bloggers on the internet like to read i would think that someone so devoted to books that they are willing to spend their days reading writing reviews and maintaining a book blog would be a person who knows good writing and a well written book a book blogger's taste and mine might differ about subject matter but not about good writing but city of women is poorly written it was a pain to read the dialog and many of the situations are just plain corny the story is loaded with convenient coincidences the woman who goes out of her way to help hide jews in world war ii berlin is at the same time a tramp who can't get enough sex but pretends to be shocked about others' sexual experiences she is a caricature as are all the characters none reacts as someone really would the author said he wanted to put ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances but that's not what this book is these people are not ordinary they're unrealistic and ridiculous i won this book through librarything com i requested it because i believed the reviews","257":"this book builds as the story moves along as sigrid changes and becomes more bold so does the excitement i enjoyed watching sigrid change from someone bored with their life to someone who is thrown into something bigger than she is this book also makes one think about the choices we make what would we do in this situation be idle and a rule follower or stand up for what is morally right","258":"loved it just when i thought i could not read another book about the wwii era this one comes along and gives me yet another unique perspective david gillham brings war torn berlin to life and reveals the extraordinary mettle of women tested to their limits and beyond powerful and piercingly real you won't soon forget these characters","259":"i was extremely disappointed by this book i didn't enjoy the pace storytelling or the story itself a nazi's wife finds herself helping to save jews during wwii she has lovers befriends lesbians and is has questionable morals spoiler how someone could hide their lover and secretly hide his family without telling him i don't understand that is so selfish i was disgusted by her decision to never come clean","260":"set during the world war ii in berlin city of women tells the story of some extraordinary people doing extraordinary things while confronting themselves with some of the darkest days history has ever seen it is captivating exciting extremely well researched and with a very casablanca feel to it as stephen king praised it i loved the writing style the suspense and the plot twists which were multi layered and highly believable and as a plus it reminded me why i always had preferred sex written by men not by women","261":"good book but didn't really grab my interest till half into it but certainly a good twist at the end emotional and thoughtfully provocative never read about the holocaust from this perspective worth a read","262":"excellent story of berlin during wwii and a group of underground germans trying to protect and save jews passionate and grippingly suspenseful","263":"i was quite disappointed in this book i did not like the characters although that is not necessary for me to like a book and also never felt like i really knew the characters i also did not care for his style of writing the subject was interesting and different the story of a german woman living in berlin during the wwii but the book just did not grab me","264":"i find it a bit difficult to read a book written in the voice of a woman by a male author i found some of the time shifts confusing","265":"i give this book three stars for well crafted prose that painted a haunting picture of wartime berlin however as a story i found it somewhat unsatisfying the plot centers on sigrid's gradual engagement with a group of resistance workers hiding jews in the city her reasons for taking on this risk are never fully explained and her actions often seem in conflict with her character the mechanics of the resistance effort are glossed over refugees appear from nowhere and vanish just as quickly when papers or ration coupons or a hiding place are needed they are magically found and we never learn how all this works meanwhile sigrid is having a clandestine affair with a jewish man who is living in hiding this for me was the weakest aspect of the book egon is a thoroughly unlikable character their public sexual encounters defy belief and sigrid's infatuation with him made it almost impossible for me to respect her at one point she wishes his wife and child might have died in a concentration camp so that she can have egon to herself how does the author expect readers to sympathize with her after that most of the secondary characters were one dimensional the husband is distant the mother in law unremittingly critical i wish the author would have made some effort to humanize these characters or at least provide some explanation for their behavior as it was no one in the story seemed entirely real as a snapshot of a dark moment in history city of women was an interesting read as an attempt to portray real people struggling with moral dilemmas however it didn't work for me","266":" as a fan of historical fiction particularly that set during world war two i was intrigued by this story told from the perspective of 'the other side' that being the german side the entire book is littered with german phrases i suspect because there is no direct translation and this was an aspect i struggled with from the beginning if you have a depth of knowledge concerning this time in history and or know the german language it is probably a lot easier to digest i liked the main character although sometimes struggled to understand her comprehension of what was going on around her her city was falling to pieces people are starving and her husband whom she does not hold great affection for is fighting the tommies somewhere while she is left to her own combat battling her difficult mother in law who makes it clear she is not good enough for her darling brave solider son our pragmatist sigrid is embarking on a clandestine love affair with a married jew when she is caught up in the world of hiding people who have been earmarked as a drain on society homosexuals jews black and disabled people to name but a few sigrid has a responsibility to keep up the pretence of being a good german wife loyal to her husband working in a city where only a few men remain seeking rations and living off whatever her mother in law concocts sigrid's husbands return from war injured but alive and subsequent revelations of the warfront only seek to push her further into her lovers arms overall i give this book 3 5 i felt it could have been better from certain perspectives challenging stereotypes and the common germans experiences of war yes many were seemingly brainwashed but more than what is realised helped the allies throughout the conflict sometimes felt like i was reading a foreign book purely because of the german phrases dotted on each page recommended for people who enjoy modern history particularly that of berlin in world war two","267":"i've read a lot of books about wwii but this one with a female berliner as the protagonist strikes a chord it's definitely worth the read","268":"in 1943 berlin trust is a casualty of goebbels total war in this atmosphere a young housewife finds herself in the middle of a situation that causes her to question her values gillham asks the question what would you do","269":"first half was incredibly slow second half was ok if you are looking for a world war ii novel i would recommend the nightingale","270":"sigrid schroder is a married german woman whose husband is away fighting in wwii sigrid lives in berlin with her mother in law with whom she has a strained relationship egon sigrid's secret lover is a jewish man who is hiding as her love for egon grows sigrid begins to view her world from different eyes she soon discovers secrets of several different neighbors and is thrust into a world she never knew existed will sigrid maintain her duty as a german soldier's working wife or will she risk everything to help egon and other jews this historical novel is a nail biting twists at the turn of each page cannot put down book exceptionally realistic and true to the times david gillham has created a masterpiece giving us a look into the life of an average woman living in berlin during wwii i've read many non fiction books and memoirs from the wwii era and have a lot of knowledge on the subject this is the first fiction book from the time period i've had the pleasure of reading and it left me wanting similar books","271":"set in berlin during world war ii this turned out to be a novel that i had an almost love hate relationship with i was fascinated by the glimpse into the world of women who fought their own resistance movement to what they saw happening around them but i just could not like the characters any of them some were doing heroic things but i just couldn't connect maybe the whole tone started wrong with the sex in the movie balcony that seemed so desperate but that was probably the point life was pretty desperate then and there sigrid the main character seems to hold herself marginally involved in the whole underground movement to hide and move the jews but miraculously at the end possesses the ability to run an operation singlehandedly i had a bit of an issue getting involved in the suspense at that point because i kept asking how i'm glad i read the book and was definitely heartened to know there were people in berlin risking their lives to resist even when many in the world kept eyes conveniently shut the question with these kinds of books always boils down to wondering what i would have done","272":"the book is not aptly named as there are plenty of men in this book and the main character sigrid seems to be sleeping with most of them that's not to say that she's not a likeable or compelling character she is in the beginning of the novel sigrid is blankly going through life in wwii berlin work the shops home to her nasty mother in law while her husband is away at the eastern front i think it's a lack of excitement that spurs her involvement with her lovers and her subsequent foray into resistance work helping to hide jews and get them out of berlin obviously the threat of being caught drives the novel but no spoilers here read it yourself","273":"disturbing raw thought provoking sometimes i loved it sometimes i just didn't but worth hanging on through the end","274":"i listened to the audio book which was read with a german accent it was intense almost painful to hear but extremely compelling","275":"in 1943 germany with most men engaged in war the city of berlin has become a city void of men with only women and children and the elderly living within its boundaries in david r gillham 19s novel the city of women he takes us into the heart of germany and through the eyes of an unforgettable character named sigrid he introduces us to the moral and daily challenges faced by women struggling to maintain a semblance of normality during the darkest days of world war ii this he accomplishes with immense insight and depth with her husband kaspar away fighting somewhere a young stenographer named sigrid remains at home to care for her mean spirited difficult to please mother in law with food clothing and other necessities of life in short supply she meets a jewish man named egon who peddles goods in the black market and enters into a passionate affair with him as the american and british begin bombing the city more and more sigrid is forced into bomb shelters as life becomes more difficult and never knowing who can be trusted sigrid is inadvertently drawn to a young teenager named ericha and soon finds herself delivering items and supplies to house where jews are being hidden as the book progresses sigrid 19s life becomes riddled with danger this dark novel is impossible to put down readers can experience the emotions of the times the bomb sirens the sound of low flying aircraft about to let loose their deadly charges the hunger and hardship and most of all the fear sigrid 19s actions leave the reader questioning her moral choices yet keenly aware of how the harsh times affected her ability to make decisions and forced her to act in ways contrary to her spirit mesmeric characters a desperate setting and a plot that keeps moving toward a riveting conclusion makes this book a must read this one is sure to be a bestseller","276":" i've read many of the reviews and no one else seems to have the issues that i have1 i just cannot imagine it was that easy to hide people jews in 1943 berlin people were coming in and out of auntie's house all the time i don't think it would have been possible to move people around that often 2 often sigrid was able to ask person a about person b and person a would be very forthcoming with information and details even though everything was supposed to be done in secrecy and how did they know sigrid was trustworthy i cannot believe people would put others so easily at risk when the consequences would have been so dire 3 how long were her lunch breaks one day she waited quite a bit for ana to get off the bus then walked to the zoo with her spent time with her and still got back to work without being late another day she went to the cemetery during lunch even though it was way out of the way 4 how did she have enough money to go to the movies multiple times a week 5 there were fake id papers constantly issued it was almost like they were being given away i have more but i don't want to rant i started out really liking this book but was ultimately disappointed","277":"the audio is fantastic","278":"i received this book through the penguin first reads program and hoped it would be better than the last book which was so dry i quit it not even 1 3 of the way in this book was indeed better and in fact i almost gave it five stars but decided instead for a 4 9 layers this book had layers i find myself thinking of the peeling back of one layer to reveal the next as the story progresses characters were layered the plot was complex i thoroughly enjoyed the book and found my emotions flake away in layers up to the very intense and heart wrenching end this is a book to look for on the best seller list and i am glad i read it","279":"my first thought was oh another wwii book but was so glad i read this the dilemmas choices each character faces in this book keep you riveted and take away your ability to judge knowing that no one could know the choices they would make unless they had to make them themselves","280":" berlin in 1943 was a city of secrets and lies and since most german men were dead or in the military it was also a city of women on the surface sigrid schroder is the perfect wife she's married to a german soldier who is serving on the eastern front she has a good \"office\" job and takes care of her surly mother in law sigrid has another side as well a darker dangerous side she has a jewish lover and makes other jewish contacts finding herself drawn into the perilous task of assisting jews in this war ravaged nest of nazis yes there are a million books fiction and nonfiction about wwii germany this does take a fresh approach and i give it credit for that it's well written and suspenseful i also think it could have been edited a bit better and i would have toned down the sex a little sigrid is quite the frisky frau i also love the cover art if you like this period in european history i definitely recommend it","281":"hang in there with character german names well worth it","282":"another dimension of how life could have been during ww2","283":"wow these are some lusty ballsie german women a good read","284":"during the second world war the city of berlin was essentially a city of women this novel tells the story of a women drawn into helping jewish residents escape","285":"sigrid was an interesting character and i liked watching her evolution toward a greater feeling of responsibility toward her fellow human beings the book did a good job of posing questions about accountability courage and morality i can imagine a book club having robust discussions about prejudice evil war marriage promiscuity pornography and truth","286":"interesting book showing wwii from a different perspective that of the women left behind recommended by rj julia booksellers as an equal to the invisible bridge not sure i agree but i did enjoy the book","287":"1943 berlin beautifully told story of war torn berlin and the german women who fought their own war here's a side of the war i've never seen before and characters i won't soon forget","288":"i give this book five stars because it trully was a complete story i thought it was well written and i didn't feel that anything was left out or left undone i liked it a lot","289":"simply heartbreaking","290":" the time period is the second world war and the setting is berlin which is essentially a city of women while the men are away fighting on the front sigrid is the main character and on the surface appears to be a model german wife she is married to a frontline german soldier works as a stenographer in an office dutifully cares for her gruff mother in law and periodically seeks out a few hours of solitude by going to the cinema it is here in the cinema while the lights are down sheltered by the drone of the newsreel that sigrid becomes involved in an illicit affair it is also here where she is introduced to and enters a world of secrets and becomes illegally involved in the perilous task of smuggling jewish citizens out of germany i raced through this novel stealing minutes here and there in order to devour as many pages as possible i loved the well developed characters that were incredibly believable with all their inner struggles and imperfections and throughout his debut novel the author doesn't downplay the evil lurking in the streets and permeating berlin rather he boldly exposes the stark horror and atrocities of war city of women is a compelling read about taking off the blinders and refusing to get spooled in by the lies offered through propaganda morals become murky as right and wrong bleed into each other then there is the question of who can one trust and finally after reading the last page and closing the cover the bigger question remains as to what you or i would do if placed in this or a similar situation fully worthy of 4 stars","291":"this is another holocaust story but it reads like a mystery as the reader becomes complicit in sigrid's life changing actions too many citizens in hitler's germany looked the other way as the gestapo tortured and killed too many embraced the state enforced morality and accounts whether it was out of fear and self preservation belief systems or patriotism as i was reading city of women my underlying question was what would i do if i were in their shoes","292":" the year is 1943 and in berlin it is a city of women the men are at war started by a crazy man and fueled with hatred they are ordinary women in extraordinary circumstances and what they do is amazing the author has you questioning yourself what would i do if it were me watching people marching away to their death only because they were jewish what would i do if i walked into someone's home and they were hiding jews at what point does one arrive at a moral commitment these are the questions that i asked myself while reading this book a 5 star book for me not only is an entertaining and well written read but it is a book that keeps me thinking long after the last page has been read david gillham has provided a book that accomplishes all of those things","293":"good read and an interesting look into what life might have been like in berlin during the war the oppression the rationing working and how people coped when everything was uncertain i found myself losing interest mid book because it was moving too slowly but really enjoyed the page turning conclusion to the story","294":"to say that i enjoyed this book would not be true at the same time i could not stop reading it the gripping story of the women left behind in germany during ww ii demonstrated how life goes on in the most awful circumstances the author did a wonderful job of developing the characters and relationships i could understand the many different positions and decisions made by women of different generations and how desperate circumstances can change everything about who you think you are it was an awful time to live in germany and the book depicted that perfectly i was very sad for the characters i would highly recommend the book would have given it five stars except i found some passages confusing and had to retread some to get the meaning it was worth the effort","295":"i loved this book it is extremely well written and allows the reader to put herself in the shoes of all characters wondering what would i have done tender and touching but also stark and real at times difficult to read due to the content and the fact that our inner 'kind person' will try to run and hide at the knowledge that there is an inner 'mean person' in all of us a definite 'must' for all book shelves","296":"a great read there are so many interesting and unexpected twists in this book one of those hard to put down it's the second book i've read this summer about the tragic effects of war on the women who are left at home and the courage that is found deep in the soul","297":"what would you do if you lived in germany during the third reich what would you risk to fight the horrors of the nazis this gripping book sucks you in to explore those questions the main character is no saint but she steps up and helps the weak and fights in her own small way well worth reading","298":"wonderful story about a german woman in ww2 berlin who gets caught up in resistance activities","299":"i enjoyed reading this book it was a little slow in the middle but kept my interest throughout i became very involved with the characters and the storyline gave fresh insight to me of a much written about topic it never loses the tragedy","300":"very good book that asks the question what would you do","301":" i received an advanced readers' edition of this and decided to give it a try the title refers to the fact that during the second world war most of the men were away fighting so berlin had an overabundance of women children and elderly men the main character sigrid works at the patent office and is living with her disagreeable mother in law while her husband is away fighting the war in russia she becomes involved with the young woman who is the nanny babysitter au pair for the woman living across the hall and as a result becomes involved in hiding jews from the gestapo and nazi officers who randomly search homes and businesses the experience changes her life and at one point she suspects that she is helping to hide the wife and children of her lover i kept reading this book because i wanted to see how it would end the book i know how the war ended but though i didn't really like it i also didn't really not like it it was written pretty well in my opinion but there were parts that seemed to go on forever with no real additional impact in my opinion the characters were ok but i felt no real investment in sigrid she changed in the course of the story and i think she started to understand herself and her place in the world better but she just didn't really appeal to me i can't say that the second this is published you should run out buy a copy and read it but as i said it is for the most part a good enough read","302":" do you feel that he whispered yes then you know what it is for page 10 i think this has the makings to be a really good book lol sigrid she replies clearing her throat of obstructions swallowing the perfect terror of serendipity swelling in her throat page 138 they shouldn't know he shrugs say your prayers my little kinder he mocks god is listening but what your mama won't tell you is that he is also laughing page 181 we'll see he replies a lot could happen between now and then the world could shift on its axis sigrid mountains could spring from the seas pigs could fly a woman could change her mind he says and exits the seat beside her page 358","303":"i didn't like sigrid her character felt too inconsistent from chapter to chapter to allow it i often find that is the case with the main character whom the author is trying to understand also but the other characters are well drawn if not entirely believable egon is charming he's such a jerk i didn't feel it about him but chose to believe it bc so many characters believed it the setting is amazing and the pain and fear and even excitement of the era is rich and 3d","304":"another wwii book set in berlin it makes sense with all the men enlisted that women would be behind the scenes doing what they could to save innocent jews once they figured out what was going on sigrid the main character is the wife of a german soldier who is living with blinders on until she meets a jew and falls in love with him she opens her eyes to the plight of the jews and meets a brave woman involved in an underground system attempting to save jews caught in the city she becomes extremely brave and shows such intelligence and courage so many worked so hard to keep secrets to stay safe it is another look at what hell it was to be caught in germany on either side","305":" this book really made me turn pages quickly i was transported back into berlin germany at the height of wwii i really enjoyed the plot the twists and the overall story line beware if you read that there is a lot of sex and some language what i appreciated so much from this book was that it took a german woman who could easily have turned her back on what was happening to the jews all around her but instead she summoned her courage and wits to aid and assist them as much as she could lots of plot twists and excitement in this book i loved getting lost in these pages","306":"good story","307":"sigrid schroder is an ordinary german wife of a german soldier living with her overbearing mother in law and working as a stenographer in war torn berlin during wwii she joins the other women who hide from the tommies who drop bombs almost nightly sigrid does not join the women and the few germans left in the city who hide from the reality that jews are being rounded up and being sent away instead she makes extraordinary choices to work with a type of german resistance group in the shadows","308":" this was a richly textured complex suspense book the characters are nearly all rich complex and often surprising and the entire thing moves along with a very nicely developed sense of pacing wartime berlin is portrayed in a rich way with a wealth of details that are successful in pulling you into this often horrible world most of all i enjoyed the evolution of the main character her coming into her own even in what we tend to refer to as our peacetime existence we often go through many unexpected major transitions becoming different people than we expected to become so much moreso for this character in that challenging time and place i won't add a spoiler but i found the ending highly satisfying and even inspiring it shares the richness and i think also the complexity of the best work of alan furst though as with furst a reader might want to do what i do sometimes and jot down a few notes on names and events as they read since there are so many characters nearly all of whom have many facets that it's easy to get lost in the house of mirrors","309":"excellent book regarding women in berlin during wwii and the life or death decisions they made","310":"about an ordinary woman living in berlin during world war ii whose life is changed a story about selfishness betrayal the price of war and the hard choices people were forced to make to survive great suspenseful climax","311":"great plot but feels kind of unfinished although that's common in real life which this book tried to present","312":" there is no black or white in war but the variations of gray are infinite with the protection of history and hindsight we can sit at our remove and imagine how our moral compass would guide us through treacherous situations but fiction - well crafted fiction - can offer three dimensional dilemma and nuance that our egos would deny david gillham's city of women is just such a work and it is an excellent berlin in 1943 is a city of shadows nearly all able bodied men are fighting across various fronts left behind are hungry cowed suspicious citizens and their nazi keepers the old and infirm wounded soldiers and black marketeers but mostly berlin is kept afloat by the wives mothers sisters and daughters of soldiers and officers it is a city of women one of these women is the lovely and enigmatic sigrid schroder a stenographer and wife of a combat officer sigrid's war is reduced to the daily grind of her job and the grim existence she shares with her wretched mother in law scrapping together enough to eat making do with threadbare clothes huddling in a bomb shelter not attracting the attention of her apartment building's informers or nazis patrolling the streets would seem to leave sigrid with no time or energy for moral quandaries but there are empty moments split open by boredom loneliness and desperation how sigrid fills them drives the plot of this atypical wartime thriller gillham juggles many elements his skill at maintaining a complicated narrative with many characters while remaining true to history is tremendous he adds new elements to our understanding of german citizens' attitudes and behaviors during the war while crafting the hold your breath suspense of a literary thriller his portrait of berlin is pitch perfect - the hopelessness and the viciousness of a city living in fear are claustrophobic and terrifying gillham's characters are intriguing sympathetic and nuanced the moments of tenderness and betrayal leave the reader uncertain of whom to trust demonstrating the inconsistencies and unpredictability of human behavior that are true even in the best of circumstances in the worst of times who among us wouldn't do what we needed in order to survive who among us would risk everything to ensure the survival of others what holds this back from a 5 star read is the overheated atmosphere david gillham's berlin might be drab and crumbling but beneath the patched coats and bomb rubble is a city pulsing with sex i'm torn here because it also raises an important question of how women survive even now when their political and physical power is so often compromised sex becomes a refuge and a weapon still the movie theatre trysts and living room carpet couplings become tedious and make you wonder how sigrid would have been portrayed by a woman writer in addition this is one of the most poorly proofread books i have encountered in recent memory that isn't the author's fault but it jars the reader from her world and sends her dashing for her red pen a compelling novel that i highly recommend to wwii history enthusiasts and literary thriller fans alike","313":"compelling story with strong character development causes the reader to ponder what would you do if you were in sigrid's place","314":"starts off pretty good but then i started skimming it about 1 4 of the way through way too long it was also that point when i realized the author was jumbling together a mash of scenes that really had no point weren't connected and i couldn't see where he was going could have been a 100 pages shorter one of my biggest pet peeves when an author adds length for no purpose also i thought the author relied too heavily on a women like men who treat them badly trope mentally and physically which may be because he is a man and believes this garbage from what pop culture feeds him i couldn't believe sigrid at the end her lover was also a horrible person i kept being reminded of the book thief or those who save us and how those books accomplished similar themes but were actually good","315":"surprisingly engaging for something i was expecting to be a sarah's key knockoff somehow","316":"this book was an amazing character study that makes you think about what you would do when faced with impossible choices","317":"this is a great novel at first i thought oh just another holocaust book but i was very wrong yes this novel is a holocaust book but it takes place in berlin and the main character is a german non jewish female who slowly gets involved in hiding jews and others persecuted by the nazi regime i couldn't put this book down","318":"once the story gained momentum the twists turns and tension was exhilarating at times while at first i thought the main character was dry and unrealistic she developed an edge that was more than satisfying a few things kept me from giving this book another star a few rather unrealistic character developments over a vet shorts time period and way too many italicized words most pages had at least one word of dialogue italicized and some had 3 or more very distracting to the point where i would scan the page for italicized words before i began reading that aside though i'd recommend this book","319":"3 5 stars beautiful storytelling gripping suspense and a distractingly romantic plot said author kathleen grissom on the cover the city is berlin 1943 and the woman we care about is sigrid whose husband is fighting on the eastern front sigrid is seduced by two very different men the sex in this book is hot hot hot but the real seduction involves her reluctant participation in a scheme to ferry jews to safety said author stephen king in entertainment weekly magazine the book i wanted to read was based on those two authors' blurbs i didn't get that book i'm not sure what they read before writing those blurbs i thought this was going to be a suspenseful historical romance not one kathleen grissom you found this to be a romantic plot there was no romance the three men our main character was involved with all felt very little for our heroine they used her and treated her like garbage that's not my definition of romance stephen king you thought two men seduced her and there was hot sex my definition of seduced is when someone goes to great effort to convince a person to go to bed with them woos them so to speak not what happens in this book we have a husband that doesn't give a damn about her oh well he's off at war there's a jewish lover who puts her hand on his penis at their first meeting and then the first moment he gets her alone he just drops his pants to show her his penis then there's another soldier who simply tells her he'd like to see her naked and have sex with her if she ever thinks that's a cool way to spend some time totally paraphrasing she goes for it with all these men they all treat her horribly the sex isn't hot and it shows this was written by a man because no woman would think any of these guys was seducing her or loved her in any way only a woman with no self esteem would actually sleep with a stranger who does no kind of romancing and isn't even kind to them as a build up to a physical relationship anyway that's not really what this book is about this book is about what war does to people as that kind of book it's a very good book i was thinking at first that this is another one of those books with very unlikeable characters but they're not unlikeable they just don't like each other no one trusts anyone and no one wants to get close to anyone it's very dark and depressing but in a war where people are turning on each other and getting each other killed i think that represents perfectly what would happen the story all comes together very well and it is very suspenseful i was really caught up in it i recommend it highly to anyone who wants to read about the human experience during war i do not recommend it to someone who wants a romance","320":"i could not put this book down a different perspective on nazi germany beautifully written","321":"i loved that this book about world war ii was written from the perspective of a berlin woman sigfrid finds her job uninteresting lives with a suspicious and untrustworthy mother in law misses the men of berlin and is even bored with the constant bombings a gutsy woman who finds her life mundane sigfrid inevitably finds some intrigue to shatter the monotony a great novel for book clubs","322":" i've read so many wwii books with the last couple of years and it's always amazing to me how varied they are in spite of dealing with the same basic subject this book is once again told from a different angle than any of the other books i've read sigrid schroder is an ordinary woman living in berlin during the war the entire city seems to be composed of many ordinary women going about their daily routine while their husbands are soldering sigrid goes to work everyday and then comes home to her demanding and dismissive mother in law rations are meager but they do what they can she obviously knows there's a war going on but doesn't really see all the implications or realize that some horrendous things are going on with people of the jewish faith sigrid is also a woman full of passion and missing her husband whom she had already fallen out of love with eventually becomes the lover of a jewish gentleman this relationship draws her ever closer to realizing what is going on in not only berlin but the entire reich she eventually starts aiding jewish families who are trying to escape the trains to the death camps and learns much about who can be trusted and who cannot this extraordinary book is much more about the mental struggles of the average german than about the explicit struggles of the men women and children being held in the camps we can see that not all of the germans are monsters and that not all of the jewish people are victimized but can be treacherous if they believe they can save themselves by adding hitler's henchmen wonderful historical fiction","323":"it was nice to read a book that did not have many more pages than than were needed and that did not flip back and forth between time periods as seems to be the current writing style the characters were not all that likable but the suspense was definitely there one more book about wwii but this one caught my interest and kept it all the way through","324":"i really enjoyed this book it was one i couldn't put down i read many wwii books but this one had layered and complex characters and an exciting plot great read","325":"berlin 1943 the war from a german woman's viewpoint loved this novel fabulous","326":"definitely not one of my usual reads but city of women was great the history was really interesting as well as the story sigrid is a great heroine she has her strengths and weaknesses but she's very likable the decisions she made and the things she did all made sense to me she grew a great deal throughout the book by the end she is a completely different person the plot was interesting with several twists i wasn't expecting the descriptions of location were great you didn't get bogged down in it but you had a very clear picture of what was going on gillham did a great job of keeping me interested there was a bit of sexual content not much but enough that i would only recommend this book to adults overall though a great read","327":"i listened to the audiobook of this story and have to say it took a bit of getting in to mainly due to the narration style the problem with audiobooks is you have to have a good story and a good narrator for it to work anyway it did win me over the characters are complex in this book and i didn't always understand what our heroine was thinking at times but it does offer an unusual perspective on life as it was for those left behind while the men fought in wwii the storyline is complex and i liked the way it came together at the end as i'd no idea how events would unfold i think if i'd read it rather than listened it'd been a 5","328":"i didn't believe in the characters but it was well enough written","329":"i stayed awake all hours to find out what happens so i guess that means i really liked it four stars gillham did a lot of research and there is a sense of authenticity about the book and the characters the book does a good job of presenting various people and the decisions they make in berlin during the war years","330":"this book thoroughly absorbed me i really felt i had been transported back to berlin in 1943 the novel focuses on sigrid a woman in her 30s whose husband is away fighting at the front and who is left sharing a flat with her awful mother in law and working in a boring office job but she has a lover egon who is jewish who ignites her passion and her spirit and when a young girl asks for her help in the cinema she says 'yes' these two things start sigrid off on a secret mission to smuggle jews out of germany this book superbly evokes time and place and is beautifully written war time berlin really is a scary paranoid society where no one can be trusted sigrid is an ordinary woman who chooses to do what is right rather than what is easy the book confronts us with the unsaid question what would we do in her position would we risk our life to help others","331":" a story of women left behind in berlin during wwii sigrid the main character is a lonely woman she married a man she didn't love she was stuck living with her mother in law when he went off to war i scratched my head at how easily she was seduced she must have been very lonely and desperate egon is the jewish man she meets at the theater why is he there when all the men are gone why why why sigrid she does not figure this out until much too late the whole relationship with her neighbor's brother not sure if she is using him or vice versa maybe in those desperate times people took pleasure where they could because you never knew if you would be around the next day bombs were falling on the city men were killed by the thousands in battle neighbors reported each other and could be arrested and taken away at any moment sigrid gets involved in illegal activity helping jews escape egon disappears and reappears again is she really in love with him does he really love her is anna really his wife these things were not really clear but is those chaotic times maybe this was just how things were at the end of the book the author asks what would you do a very tough question","332":"a dark book but then the place and time the events take place was a dark time in history i found i could be annoyed and almost angry with the main character but at the same time feel sympathy and proud of her it's a book i'll read again trying to understand a little more of what these people felt and how their lives evolved","333":" i wasn't sure how i felt about city of women when i first started it admittedly wwii stories are not my favorite mostly because i know going in that it's going to be depressing sometimes oppressively so and i'm a sensitive person so those things really affect me city of women isn't a depressing story per se although it's certainly not a happy one either but there is a lack of tenderness that really sets the mood for the book and put me off at first i kept waiting for something to lighten the heaviness and give me a respite but you never get it with all of the people that sigrid has relationships with from her mother in law to her friend at work to her husband and even her lover none of them show any tenderness they are not happy relationships and at times are often crude even the way sigrid is portrayed and described isn't always the most flattering which is why it took me so long to get into this book i had a hard time liking the characters she seems cold closed off and uninviting but as things are revealed i began to understand her and i found myself wondering what i would have done in her shoes i could understand her feeling trapped and her anger about it i could understand her trying to find a way to feel alive when everything seems to be falling apart i could understand her wanting to make her own decisions and live a life of her choosing while so many of her freedoms were limited i may not have liked sigrid in the beginning and i didn't always agree with her but i could understand her it wasn't until over half way through that i realized what a grip this story had on me these aren't easy characters to like but everything becomes so tangled that i had to know what was going to happen to all of them this is the kind of book that i thought about more and more after i finished the last page and i found myself often wondering what kind of person i would have been and what i would have done had i been living in berlin during the war in the end i loved this book","334":"3 5 stars really interesting in the history it provided but i am not sure that i really liked the main character and that made it a little difficult to enjoy as much as i would like to have","335":"3 1 2 stars although the last couple of chapters were a 4 there's a deus ex machina moment but hey wartime berlin so i suppose those things really did happen","336":" beautifully written utterly compelling and absolutely achieves the author's stated goal of making you question what would i do in many ways this is a more intimate shindler's list but from a feminine point of view gillham does an excellent job of drawing the portrait of 1943 berlin when everyone's so caught up in their own subsistence and paranoia that it's easy to turn aside and say that has nothing to do with me but when you're pulled in by chance when you see up close what's happening would you turn aside there's just the right balance of thriller emotion and social consciousness to keep you turning the pages as fast as you can just the right balance of light and dark to keep you drawn in but not depressed","337":"ok this may not be fair because i technically didn't read this whole book i'm tired of picking up historical fiction and having it be all about sex i have nothing against sex itself and don't mind a good love story but there has to be actual love and an actual story not just random sexual encounters followed by the woman accusing the man of not loving her and him vowing that he does so far i just don't know enough about the main character to make me like her or invest any more time in her story","338":"city of women is the story of life in 1943 berlin as seen through the eyes of sigrid a german woman at first sigrid is just trying to endure an unhappy marriage a verbally abusive mother in law and the deteriorating conditions in berlin however as time goes on she meets and becomes involved with a jewish man who is hiding from the nazis she also meets a young woman who is actively helping hide jews and helping them to escape the nazis the story of sigrid's awakening and growth as well as the the view of life within nazi germany are fascinating at first sigrid is not very sympathetic but her development from willfully blind to amazingly involved is stunning the book bogs down a bit in the middle but it picks up and comes to an exciting and satisfying conclusion","339":"i really liked this book the suffering of the common person during world war 2 was awful this book let you imagine how you might have behaved in the same circumstances hunger does awful things to people","340":" fascinating story of a woman who discovers herself amidst in berlin during the ravages of the second world war the war is an appropriate counterpoint to the emotional turmoil sigrid buries deep so she can function while initially she becomes involved in ericha's intrigue in a haphazard and not particularly well thought out way despite what she tells herself and continues because of a sense of power over others' lives she eventually finds her humanity sigrid understands people are often not what they seem on the surface but as she gets more involved in a covert world of smuggling she sees just how much can be hidden in the end all of her assumptions and beliefs have changed and she sheds her former life figuratively and literally","341":"too tired to write a long review because i got totally sucked in and read the last 170 pages of this book just today a beautiful and subtle humble heroine plenty of intrigue sex and history i found the characters layered realistic and easy to relate to all in all a great story","342":"it's the perspective that makes this such an interesting read the german hausfrau's voice during the second world war isn't really heard that much note is the experience of jews outside the concentration camps as the circle closes upon them a mixture between a whodunnit and a historical drama","343":"this was a captivating book from page one loved it i'm not generally a big fan of historical fiction but this tale of wwii berlin was so good mr gilham brought to life the sights sounds and smells of the time more than that he captured the feelings of fear guilt love duplicity mistrust and so much more city of women is one of my new favorites i highly recommend","344":" this book is about berlin in 1943 referred to as a city of women because most of the men were away fighting the characters were very well portrayed and yes there were some men around wounded soldiers jews either trying to escape or collaborating with the gestapo gillham does a great job describing the civilian side of the war in germany the heart of the book deals with how ordinary people made hard decisions in very difficult circumstances e g sheltering jews and helping them escape from germany a wonderful read","345":" i started reading this book and finished reading it on the same day not because it was such a good book and i just couldn't put it down but because after reading the first 20 pages or so i just couldn't go on it felt like i was reading one of those romance novels and the fact that it takes place during wwii in berlin and has vague descriptions of the bombed city gestapo agents etc did little to impress me to continue what can i say if the author needs to throw in a hot sex scene right at the beginning i tend to be very judgemental and don't even want to give the book a chance not only did i not like the writing style from the first few pages but i already felt i couldn't stand the main character her rambling thoughts her vindictive mother in law her apathetic and cold husband the feeble descriptions of war torn berlin the many german words sprinkled throughout the narrative that the author did not even find the time to add notes of translation for just in case you need to brush up on your german there is a much better book on the subject of civilians living in wartime berlin alone in berlin aka every man dies alone by hans fallada maybe because i have read that book twice before i picked up this one this book made me feel like it was indeed a waste of my time but for those who like a romantic story with a torn heroine won't reveal more as that would be a spoiler and find the hot sex an interesting addition just in case the real events surrounding the story are too boring without it then read on this book got a one star rating from me wholly deserved","346":"the story is well thought out and well written i enjoyed it immensely","347":"very worthy readmerged review very worthy read a woman transforms in the heart of nazi germany","348":"tense suspenseful enjoyed this very much","349":"the conclusion helped my rating the book was rather dark and disturbing but upon finishing i decided i enjoyed it more than i thought i would while reading it","350":"so much is written of the fighting the concentration camps and the many atrocities that occurred in germany during wwii but what of the wives mothers and others left to live their lives in berlin and other cities of germany sigrid's husband is fighting at the front and she shares an apartment with her mother in law she escapes to the cinema from the bleakness of her days there she meets a jewish man with whom she has an affair there is great passion between them she also befriends ericha a girl in her apartment building through ericha sigrid is slowly drawn into the underground protecting and transporting jews to safety whom to trust is so hard to determine loyalty such a rare commodity amidst the fear and anxieties of the time sigrid is a remarkable heroine passionate loyal and a true friend what a great story of those willing to risk it all","351":"a weird sort of wwii nazi soap opera it was ok but pretty light touch on the nazi's and the war that interefered with all the love affairs etc not as good as the reviews led me to believe","352":"great book i've read many books re wwii and the nazis this one was different it kept me riveted many twists and turns","353":"3 5 starsan extra half a star for clever and unpredictable plot twists but the book just struck me as a bit implausible at many points","354":"i couldn't really relate to the characters and the story it all seems constructed and unreal to read about life in ww ii germany fallada","355":"pacing stalled a bit in the middle but then picked up again i generally liked it might make a good film","356":"as a child of a holocaust survivor i am always curious about stories that are from the german families perspective during wwii a little slow not the greatest writing style but nevertheless enough story to keep my interest to the end","357":"i don't usually like to read books about wwii germany as the stories are so gruesom that i have a hard time letting them go i began this one with the notion that i could always stop and send it back to the library however before i knew it i was sucked into the characters and couldn't stop until i knew their fate this was a great suspenseful read and i love that it was from a women's perspective","358":"quite a good story i had difficulty with the dialog and action scenes i did a lot of re reading to figure out who was speaking and who was involved in the action this is a book that needs careful attention and it's worth the trouble","359":"enjoyed the different perspective this story offered i seem to particularly enjoy reading books written during this time period wwii and usually learn at least one tidbit of information","360":" this is the first book i have ever won through a first reads giveaway i am very much looking forward to reading it as well as reviewing it update i have just finished reading this book and i am absolutely in awe at how well this book was written as soon as i had begun reading i was instantly in berlin during 1943 the story drew me in right away and each character brought something new and exciting i found each character to be portrayed very realistically and everyone in this book portrayed many different sides of humanity during a time of war and fear the plot of this book was always surprising me there were characters i thought could be trusted or not trusted and a few turned out the exact opposite i was going through each challenge with sigrid and her companions i found this book to be very suspenseful especially towards the middle to the end i read more than one hundred pages in a single day because i was so interested and anxious as to what was going to happen next with sigrid and the other characters by the end of the book i was left satisfied and yet i wanted to know more i simply adored this brilliant work of historical fiction though it was incredibly well written realistic and emotional","361":"excellent well written fascinating full of the the atmosphere of wartime berlin characters are fully developed and completely believable their moral issues are complex but their motivations and their interior conflicts are made clear the suspense element is handled well and the bad guys are not one dimensional monsters over all but the moral imperative is clear this is his first novel and needless to say i will watch for future writing from david gillham","362":"this is an interesting story and nicely atmospheric loved the glimpse into berlin during wwi from the point of view of ordinary citizens however despite these strengths the characters never fully drew me in i didn't feel what they were feeling and always felt that i was at a bit of a distance from the story","363":"i couldn't finish this book i found the writing amateurish and the plot predictable","364":"it was a slow but excellent reading experience will read more of war fiction novel and hopefully gillham will come up with a new book soon","365":" overall i really liked this book some reviewers say it's not a light or fast read but i will respectfully disagree because it was very quick for me to finish it within a few days mostly because i didn't want to put it down i will warn you though that if you are very emotional or have a hard time reading about horrible happenings then don't read this book the book follows a hausfrau in wwii berlin named sigrid who is pretty much ordinary with nothing really remarkable about her she lives in an apartment with her mother in law and her husband is away on the front lines of the german army fighting in russia she works as a typist in a patent office in the day time after work she goes to the cinema to unwind and there she gains a lover who is jewish and in hiding then a mysterious teenage girl moves in with her neighbor as a duty girl and sigrid begins to wonder what she is up to when she has to cover for her one evening at the cinema i don't want to spoil too much but if you are okay with imperfect characters erotic writing and scenes and then of course the inevitable blood and deaths to follow then you should pick up the book it is fast paced and engaging the writer does a good job in weaving out a historical fiction that is not long or meandering all in all i enjoyed it","366":"city of women is an incredible book and a compelling look into the underlying forces that ordinary citizens mainly women in berlin chose to implement during world war ii sigrid is one of those women and she not only masquerades her daily life and its journeys but also has an affair with a jewish man eventually she must reconcile her life as a wife with her life as a lover she must reconcile her daily life and its goings on that are expected of her with her pursuit to help jews while the berlin residents do almost anything to avoid interacting with the gestapo sigrid lives with her mother in law and her husband is off to war her love of movies brings her a chance encounter with her soon to be jewish lover the movie theater also bring her to meet a woman who calls on her to help in the hiding of jews in the underground movement the book is a page turner and once i began it i read it straight through it is a metaphor for the strength of women and the heroics that german women displayed during horrific and the tumultuous of times it is a book of love and war and of redemption","367":"there are so many other books about this time period that are so much better that i would not waste your time the dialogue is as awkward as the supposed sex scenes and the characters are unlikeable i thought it was going to get better and it did 2nd half of book is better so i would give it a 1 5","368":" berlin 1943 has become a city populated mostly by women while the radio broadcasts make it sound as though germany is still winning people begin to wonder since the british bombings have resumed and the numbers of soldiers who have died is staggering sigrid befriends a young woman and is gradually drawn into her clandestine activities which included hiding jews the book explores the question of how ordinary people act in extraordinary circumstance very well written with a great twist at the end","369":"very realistic depiction of what life must have been like back then and sigrid was quite a force","370":"i enjoyed this book and the time period it is the beginning of a series and i am not sure i want to actually read more of the series","371":"an interesting and engaging story but ultimately unconvincing and unsatisfying without a feeling of authenticity substandard robert harris at best","372":"fabulous ww2 and a spiders web of characters all intertwined for survival during such a horrific time in history city of women is an accurate account of some strong courageous men and women who surprise even themselves in their quest to save those against hitlers army of gestapo","373":" the story takes place in berlin 1943 during world war ii regiments of men have been sent away to fight in the war and berlin has become a city of women this book was built on one of the darkest periods of history and written from the german perspective it is highly suspenseful complex and dramatic with a cast of powerful characters a story wrapped up in survival and tragedy the story of world war ii and the holocaust brings with it great sadness a story you'll not soon forget one negative comment in my opinion the graphic sex scenes were overdone and detracted from the book they did not add to the storyline","374":"the atmosphere and tension of 1943 berlin germany are extremely well written reminiscent of sophie's choice warning high sexual content","375":"loved this book very engaging and intense couldn't wait to see what would happen as i was reading it makes you aware of what the german women went through during wwii","376":"full of moral intrigue didn't want to put it down addresses the notion of complicity","377":"just as good the second time around","378":" could not put this book down the loose morals had me shaking my head seemed unrealistic but i guess they had to do things in order to survive it just didn't seem that sigrid had to though her relationship with egon was so intense as well as seemingly one sided ericha's morals seemed to have a more intrinsic purpose as she seemed to do what she did to save lives getting necessary paperwork etc i did feel bad for sigrid in a loveless marriage with that nasty nasty mother in law though cried at the ending","379":"this was a fast read and couldn't put it down 'til finished the last word","380":"beautiful yet tragic marriage of love and sacrifice during wwii","381":" what can i say about this historical fiction that has not already been said about so many ww2 stories of the horrors nazi terror hiding jews and the very evil v good that exists in societies even in today's world the spin is 'what would you do' facing the evils of this upside down time and the back story toward the end provided plenty of suspense and doubt on who the good people were david gillham's debut novel city of women opens in 1943 berlin the main character sigrid is a soldier's wife living a loveless marriage putting up with an unfriendly mother in law struggling through each day in a state controlled job as the story progresses sigrid becomes more and more involved in saving jewish people and takes risks other 'good' germans avoid telling on neighbors and looking the other way when jews are brutalized on the street are commonplace despite my reluctance to even 'like' sigrid she manages to become a sympathetic and admirable character there is a twist in the end that i had not anticipated even so my 3 star rating is due to the adulterous scenes sprinkled throughout the book","382":"i've read quite a few wwii novels and yet this is the first i've read that is about the women who were left behind in berlin during the war the author did an excellent job of developing his characters and i especially liked the love hate relationship between the main character and her mother in law","383":"german world war ii fifty shades of grey","384":"this book described the mood of berlin during world war ii during the war it did seem to be a city where the women did the work and the espionage as well as participate in the underground movements it is a good war story which keeps you guessing a little slow going but with a bang up of an end","385":"i'm always intrigued to read about life and times during world war 2 this book was slightly different in that it allowed me a glimpse in of life for women during this time","386":"wonderful gritty hard edged sharp corners and bruising darkness that leaks light read this book","387":" i don't want to sound like the hapsburg emperor in amadeus who told mozart that his music had too many notes but this book had too many main characters too many sex scenes she meets a man in the movie theater and they do it right there in the back row for example later he insists she stare at and comment on his genitals he is circumcised couldn't he have just said to her i'm jewish you know too many sub plots one might say too many pages other readers noted that they struggled to stick with it for the first 100 pages or 150 pages or more then it got good i haven't that much patience and ended up scanning and skimming for a somewhat similar theme a non jew under the third reich gets caught up in the hiding of jews read the paris architect city of women could be worked into a good screenplay however could be streamlined into a good film","388":"this story is set in berlin during the last portion of world war 2 i found it to be dark and somber and oppressive as i am sure life must have been for most berliners the city is filled with women because naturally most of the men were off fighting the war the story is mostly based on the life of one woman in particular who is dissatisifed with her life and was prior to the war she lives with her bitter mother in law and in their building there are a mixture of women left to fend for themselves during the war years she met and fell in love with a man not her husband who turned out to be jewish they parted ways and yet he comes back into her life again she meets and befriends a young woman who is hired help for a family living in her building through an odd friendship with this young woman sigrid learns of the vast underground system used to try and transport jewish people to safety before she knows it she is entrenched in this underground the ending surprised me in some ways it was a little too neat and tidy and in others it was not what i expected","389":"this is the tale of a bored german housewife who winds up in the berlin underground saving jewish lives during ww ii and what a story it is fear suspicion betrayal war love yes it has it all and is a thriller but you get so much more from this book this author did impeccable research to make you feel as though he must have grown up in berlin during the war i also find it hard to believe this is gillham's first novel as it turns into a great page turner i look forward to his next book","390":"i recently finished reading city of women by david gillham i really liked it","391":"something about this book didn't work for me felt ike chick lit set against a historical backdrop the male author didn't make any of the female characters strong or interesting to me as i read i wondered if i would have enjoyed the story better if it was written from a women's point of view","392":"great book the characters were believable in their unbelievable circumstances they were flawed but so very human this was an interesting setting berlin in 1945 made me think about the good german people and how they lived in nazi germany i highly recommend this book","393":" well i really hated this book in the beginning and had to force myself to keep reading as this is our next book at my book club i didn't like all the german interspersed i realize why he used german but it just made it more difficult for me to read the moving back and forth in time in the first half of the book was confusing finally the book picked up and i must say that i enjoyed the 2nd half in all fairness i must admit i read this as an ebook which is new to me and i much prefer paper","394":"a little slow and a lot of german places to keep track of good ending though","395":"would like to go 3 1 2 stars i disliked the protagonist so much i almost rooted for the nazis","396":" this book was great the first 30 pages or so i was a little skeptical about whether or not this was going to be a good one glad i persevered because the book was so good lots of twists that i didn't see coming and an ending that was satisfying but i still want to know what happened next it wasn't a typical holocaust novel it was a novel about choices sigrid and ericha change as the story unfolds and they are forced to make many choices gilham's writing style is an interesting one at least in my thinking he started off slowly but as his characters grow and the plot thickens for lack of a better phrase his style became more engaging it was a really good and satisfying read all around","397":"loved this book brought home how it might feel living as an ordinary citizen under the nazis and the choices you may have been faced with compelling","398":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i thought the writing about women was so obviously written by a man you've the horrible mother'n'law sex starved women having sex in the back of a movie theatre easily gets caught up in saving jews most of the characters were very one dimensional book about nazi berlin and the women left behind","399":" this week i stayed in berlin after having read my berlin kitchen last week and read city of women by david r gillham this novel is set during world war ii and it follows the daily struggles of several women living in an apartment building in the heart of the city gillham's premise for this book is what would ordinary people do when placed in extraordinary circumstances i found myself wondering what choices i'd have made and i admit that i didn't like dwelling on those questions for very long sigrid schroder is a late twenty something soldier's wife who works as a stenographer in the applications department of the gitschiner strasse patent office on the surface sigrid seems ordinary she works hard deals with shortages and rations lives with her condescending mother in law and escapes to the cinema every chance she gets two life changing events happen to sigrid while at the cinema she meets her lover for the first time in the mezzanine and they use the cinema as a rendezvous spot her lover is a jew and he has disappeared most of their narrative is told through flashback and sigrid returns to the cinema night after night in the hopes of seeing him again one of sigrid's neighbors a young woman serving her duty year as a nanny in her apartment building sits by sigrid during a film and begs her to swear that they came to the cinema together sigrid lies to an ss officer for ericha thus entangling sigrid in ericha's world of intrigue complicating sigrid's life even further an ss officer and his very pregnant wife move in across the hall from sigrid i suppose that sigrid's life would have remained very mundane had she stayed away from the theater sigrid continues searching for her lover while helping ericha hide jews until safe passage can be bought for them the suspense in this book is palpable as is the paranoia and fear the smallest little gesture can attract the attention of the gestapo and some characters who appear trustworthy are anything but sigrid's character development and growth is startling buti can't understand why she's so obsessed with egon her jewish lover i really didn't like him and i found it difficult to sympathize with most of the characters in the novel please if someone else has read this book explain to me what did sigrid see in egon i don't understand her love for him gillham might have done an amazing job spinning a tale about average folks caught in extraordinary circumstances but what motivated these characters into making in some cases extreme decisions gillham is such a good writer and i will definitely read his books in the future the only reason i'm giving this book 4 out of 5 stars is really not any fault on gillham's part but because i just don't get the relationship between sigrid and egon","400":"loved it has everything love romance suspense intrigue you will not be disappointed","401":"while it seems by dates it took forever to listen to this book truth is we listened to it every summer on the long trip to and from vacation and it was just the perfect page turner to totally distract and engage us we always knew where we'd left off and couldn't wait to listen to more and the narrator finally a book enhanced by audio format clearly an actress turns out a rather celebrated member of the royal shakespeare co with wonderful accents and voices that made the characters come alive in this berlin wartime tale of intrigue and love terrific","402":"a bit of a different take on a ww2 story it made me really think about many of the women carrying on with some semblance of life in the cities while war was being fought all around them at first i was not connecting with the main character sigrid but happily she did experience some growth throughout the story and i really began to empathize with her there were times when it was obvious a man had written this text some of the dialogue sounded funny coming from women and some of the actions but eventually the author found his groove and it became more believable the only aspect of the tale i did not enjoy was the love story between sigrid and egon well maybe i loved to hate it and i don't think this is spoiler ish but i just did not like him from the start and i could not conger any real feelings about their relationship to compensate i began reading it through sigrid's war time ennui and it felt a bit better i really loved the characters of carin brigette and wolfram and the evolution of ericha was well done overall a good read several friends had mixed reviews about this book but i will happily disagree with them because i really enjoyed it interested to see what gillham writes next","403":"decent story line but slow","404":"a complex and riveting story about the sacrifices women made during world war ii in berlin","405":"this probably would've gotten a higher rating if i hadn't read so many other holocaust books at the time i had a disturbing dream while reading this so i put the topic down for awhile it was a good book","406":" a fantastic look back at a time filled with fear sadness and utter heartbreak sigrid schroder portrays the reality of what it was to be a german housewife in the midst of one of humanity's worst genocides recorded absolutely a must read not only for the rawness with which gillham describes each character's emotional reactions to the fear and uncertainty of their lives but also for the fast paced unfolding of events brief yet final and immensely life changing an infuriating epic and heartbreakingly intimate portrayal of both jewish and german casualties in world war ii hell","407":"one of the most difficult books to read as it pulls you so close to the ravages of this time in our history a must read for those of us who feel compelled to keep this topic alive as a lesson as a warning and as a reminder of what people can and will do","408":"i thought it was a very good story ended too soon for me with a few too many questions","409":"berlin during the war and the women and men who tried to save those in hiding","410":" rollicking story unexpected twists in both the plot and for the characters happening just enough to keep it better than fresh lots of true to life detail passionate sex which can never be bad though how everyone stayed so lusty on such terrible food seems more than a little unconvincing to me as does the cleanliness of war time berlin of course we all secretly think we too would be heroes in an appalling situation but the reality is that most people just look away or more actively collaborate so i wish there had been a little more exploration of this not just a bad person shoehorned in expanding on someone we already surely didn't like and another tagged on at the end bad people are all around us most of us at least have bad patches and i think badness comes out more in bad situations that's probably not what the marketing department wanted but the author was so believable with his heroes that i wish he'd tried a little harder with the villains","411":" i really enjoyed this had me up all night til i'd finished thought it might be a bit cheesy to start with but it was actually very thought provoking and gave a different angle to the realities of those involved in hiding jews during the second world war the author never used any cheap thrills or shocks just the thoughts and actions of the women involved their choices and consequences i'm not usually one for romance or sex in my novels but the sexy bits of this were extremely erotic and real","412":"i loved it set in 1943 berlin the book describes the intense parananoia and weariness of the war through the eyes of a young woman having fallen in love with a jewish man who's gone into hiding the main character leads a double life by day a stoic patriot but at night an intensely passionate and almost reckless woman read it","413":"good plot but the love interest was weird and unconvincing and unnecessary for the story line","414":"took forever as i went back to work found it hard to get into as i really didn't warm to any of the characters interesting to read about the german resistance though as i knew very little about it","415":"this book started as a three star for me but once i started to like sigrid it ended as a five star one","416":"couldn't put the book down loved it","417":" 4 5 starsi read this book for my book club though the description sounded interesting i hadn't heard of the book at all before reading it and hadn't ready anything by the author before so i was unsure of whether i would like it maybe i've just been reading compelling books recently e g gone girl but i stayed up really late to finish this one too the title city of women refers to berlin in the throes of world war ii when most of the men have been called up to the front the main character sigrid is thought by all to be a typical hausfrau until she gets drawn into a much deeper plot the overarching and haunting question the book leaves you with is what you would do in her situation would you trust your government to do right would you turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed all around you in the name of self preservation or would you try to reverse some of the wrongs even if you put yourself into significant danger it's hard to know ahead of time how you would respond in such an unthinkable situation but provocative to consider","418":"i enjoyed this book although at times coincidental unlikely scenarios","419":" berlin during the 2nd ww sigrid's husband is at the eastern front and she's living with her miserable mother in law in an apartment building where the superintendent has her eyes out for anyone that might not be everything the fuhrer and the fatherland desires in good aryans don't want to give much away but this layered story includes 'love' affairs life in a city where everyone fears the gestapo and sigrid's dangerous involvement in hiding jews a very good book thanks to dawn for recommending it","420":"i'd actually give this 3 5 stars i like the storyline and this take on berlin during wwii interests me but i didn't find the main character especially likeable","421":" a fascinating read about the women left in germany in berlin during wwii and the choices they have to make sigrid makes a small choice to help a young woman that runs into the movie theater this snowballs into more choices that lead her deeper and deeper into the secret life happening in berlin to protect and help the jews and other people threatened by germany it's an amazing look into the divided loyalties and confusing moral situations surrounding the war i've certainly not read a war book quite like it before the characters were so complex and i loved and hated them at the same time the author is definitely right to say that it makes you think what would you do this is a great book about the war but definitely prepare yourself for heartbreak and sadness","422":"took a little bit of effort to get into this book but then it hooked me a typical german housewife in berlin challenges complicity and becomes part of a network to hide and protect those who need protection during wwii this book just fed the fire within me that rages for justice equality freedom beautiful story","423":"this was an adventure mystery set in berlin in 1943 the main character finds herself in a situation where she decides to help a stranger then she becomes a part of the underground network of individuals who hid and transported jews out of the city the last third of the book was especially exciting","424":"i seem to be reading a lot of these world war ii books lately what made this one stand out is it was well written i think it got a little too soap opera y at times which made it drag a bit especially at the end but i still really enjoyed it","425":"a fast and mostly unpleasant read unremittingly grim i can't say it was exactly bad just that i enjoyed it not one whit which is probably about right for a book about berlin during wwii harboring jews illegally infidelity and endless vats of malodorous cabbage soup now that i think about it","426":"takes awhile to get into but then truly worth the read","427":"it was a very slow drawn out story but the characters were very well developed i honestly just wanted to get it over with after a bit but it was a decent time passer","428":" from the cover image and title i expected a book club pick or something that would implode with pretension instead this is a lovely well crafted novel set in 1943 berlin all the men are away fighting and the titular city of women is starting to feel the strain as the war escalates air raids ration shortages brave faces and economizing to the point of subsistence become routine sigrid a soldier's wife lives with her stepmother and still daydreams about her former lover a subversive jew who has escaped the city she helped him with teeny delivery jobs and loved the thrill gradually though sigrid is drawn into the perilous dissident activity of hiding jews gillham has set the pace at a slow deliberate crawl so that readers can drink in the setting and the details he adeptly captures the women's fatigue the smells of old blankets the delicious tease of shop windows labeled \"nur antrappen\" - \"for decoration only \" a simple walk by the cemetery features \"... ancient flat faced headstones caked with moss choked by vines obelisks and mute stone angles blackened by wreaths of the city's soot \" 50 dudes hoping to find industrious frauleins dressed in rubber and lipstick will be disappointed to find basically throwback german versions of women they may know annoyed tired worn down hausfraus who feel trapped find reviews of books for men at books for dudes books for dudes the online reader's advisory column for men from library journal copyright library journal","429":"i listened to this book on my kindle at work and even with the droning voice thoroughly enjoyed it i almost cheered out loud when sigrid finally had enough of her mother in law and lit into her i don't think i have read any books outside of the book thief that were about citizens of germany and how they were affected by the war the characters are well thought out and believable it is a book that you are unable to see whats coming next definitely will have to actually read this at a later time because i am sure there were several things i completely missed with the drone of the kindle voice it is sometimes hard to tell when one peron stops talking and the next person picks up a bit naughty but not disgustingly so","430":" i get that people liked the setting certainly many things were well written and i get that the suspense is well done but well you kinda picked a suspense guaranteed setting is it worth getting a ground level discussion of complicity wrapped into a story that will keep people reading does that redeem the use of a complicated terrible piece of history as a sexy backdrop i don't know but i have a bit of that fast food aftertaste that sometimes accompanies popular cinema as if i've been cheated i see reading here that i should have expected a romance thriller but this book was passed on to me and i never read the back i thought instead i'd get stories about the women in berlin with realistic perspectives here i was unequivocally disappointed","431":"this is a very good book history fictional it is easy to read it lets us know how it was to live in berlin when everyone was living in the life of a woman in that era and trying to survive the bombs and affairs helping the jewish to survive by hiding them falling in love living with a german mother in law i recommend this book a little of everything","432":"i am a bit of a history buff and have a real soft spot for historical fiction i loved city of women for all the reasons i hoped i would a perspective on a major event in modern history told from a different place a view from within the characters felt real not glamorized or cotton candied up to romanticize an ideal they all faced honest challenges in a crazy time where no one was who they said they were and no one was who they thought they were masterfully spun","433":"i only got 125 pages in and said enough i didn't even finish this book i love historical fiction but i just couldn't get into this book i've decided that the author is some sort of pervert the sex in this book added nothing and he made sigrid out to seem stupid every time someone would ask her a question she'd ask it right back to them as if she was a blithering idiot i can't take anymore of this gag","434":"interesting topic how were berliners living during wwii and the moral choices that they faced","435":"3 5 stars different take on the whole era i didn't find any of the characters likable but did like a different approach to the era","436":"this was a wonderful read set in berlin during the last years of wwii it is full of suspense intrigue complex characters and ethical dilemmas that will leave you wondering what would i have done","437":"it's taken me almost a week of mentally digesting the book to come up with a review of any kind i also initially wavered in the 4 star 5 star area but plumped down with 5 after considering the complexity of the story and characters and its overall readability it does have a few conveniences to the plot line but it's fiction not non fiction and although i predicted a few of the twists because of that it didn't detract from the great read more than anything the book depicted humanity a lot of the reading group activity seems to focus on 'what would you do in this situation ' i think what the book illustrated most successfully was the way our lives drift even in the most intense of human arenas involving us in situations despite our natural inclinations humans have an amazing capacity for reducing life's drama to their own their food their family and friends their husbands lovers all of this is depicted so effortlessly it would be wrong to give the book less than five stars the background story of jewish 'collections' is as horrifying as ever yet doesn't dominate the story the story is of other people's responses to that situation their involvement in it willing or unwilling and the progression of their daily lives that portrayal is magnificent and sigrid schroder is one of the best 'ordinary yet extraordinary' central characters i have seen in a long time","438":" can one person make a difference that is the underlying question through city of women the story of berlin in ww2 when most of the men are off at war and the women in germany are left behind what do they do how do they react the main focus is on sigfried the wife of a soldier fighting in russia and the dilemma and decisions she faces to support the fatherland or help fight against the atrocities that the government is performing in hers and other german citizen's names very well written with a real flare for the dramatic the book reads like a movie script with the scenes plying out vividly and theatrically i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this era who wants a feel of how the other side's citizenry was reacting to the war on a daily basis","439":"wonderful character study that had a great plot and kept you on your toes","440":"i enjoyed this thriller the ending makes me think that there could be a sequel to the novel i hope so","441":"first time hearing of this author and i quite enjoyed this read some parts moved slower but my interest in historical fictions kept me going","442":"powerful and entertaining provides a different perspective on the war from a young german woman whose husband is a member of the ss while she is a part of the black underground reminds me of invisible bridge by julie orringer","443":"oh my did this book affect me the sacrifices the risks the hardships the 'left behind' german women went through we only know our side of the war but so scary how those who wanted to help dodged the nazis and helped others i always wonder would i be so strong great but depressing read","444":"deeply moving highly emotional a revealing glimpse of the horrors in and around berlin during hitler's time from the perspectives of an extraordinary woman and of those she reveals through her interactions the audio is masterfully narrated and the fear horror and growing sense of the human cost is stunning in the complexity of this well written and well constructed story","445":"entertaining kept me turning pages i got fooled a couple of times i think the gratuitous sex scenes were written by a man with too much of that on his mind and some strange ideas on what constitutes a sex life for a woman in 1940's hitler germany rather silly i thought a few strings were left untied in this novel too characters that were introduced and then never heard from again still i enjoyed it","446":"read as the sai king recommends book of the month selection mildred pierce meets bernie gunther if you want to be cheap and dirty describing it just remarkable though","447":" world war ii is certainly well trod territory for novelists so it's worth pointing out a novel that brings something fresh to the era most of the novels i've read take place either from the english perspective or from a jewish perspective this one is about sigrid a german woman living in berlin in 1943 her husband is fighting on the eastern front and she lives with her mother in law their antipathy towards each other seethes below the surface of all their interactions as londoners did during the blitz berliners trudge down to their basements or subway stations many nights to wait out the bombers what's different in berlin of course is that prisoners work in the streets and the gestapo lurks around every corner sigrid is not a nazi nor is she sympathetic toward them she has a jewish lover and yet she has mostly ignored what has been going on around her putting her head down and going to her typist job at a government office but when sigrid befriends a young woman in her building she soon finds herself unable to turn a blind eye to the activities of the nazis any longer i don't want to give anymore away but what follows is lots of action and intrigue at the core of the book is the issue of betrayal and loyalty and of course as is often the case with books about the nazis the book wants you to ask what would i have done if you want a smart summer read i highly recommend city of women","448":"suspenseful and an interesting wartime story from a different perspective i found the characters a bit unbelievable at times but it was a good read","449":"i received a copy of this print galley free in exchange for my honest opinion i received this arc as a part of the penguin debut authors program and i am glad for the opportunity i f i was to be honest and you all know that i will be i would have to say that this is not a book that i would have picked up on my own the cover is beautiful but it takes place in 1943 berlin again historical novels are not really my specialty a lot of readers of historical fiction enjoy the books for their accuracy that is not something i can vouch for but i keep coming across historical fiction that i enjoy so maybe i shouldn't write it off altogether in this case it would have been me that would be missing out city of women was such a beautiful piece of work i was forced to read at a slower pace but i was able to truly get lost in the 1943 berlin i was able to see the way things were as if i was a fly on the wall this made it easier to feel and vicariously experience the changes that occurred in frau schroder all of the characters were well developed and came alive there were moments when it felt more like watching and old black and white movie instead of reading a book everyone had a part to play but this was frau schroder's story i am not sure what i expected from frau schroder but i did assume that at the first sign of trouble she would run if she got involved in the first place it takes a certain kind of person to get involved and i honestly didn't think she had it in her as the story unfolds the line between truth and lie gets blurred those who would most likely betray stay as honest and loyal as they said that they would the ones who you expected to remain loyal are the ones who betray you in the end it was frau schroder who steps up and that surprised me this story is not just about hiding jews it is the story about love and betrayal in both obvious and mundane ways it is the story about a woman who has to learn to step out of convention to find the strength she never knew she had recommendation this is a story definitely worth reading if you find it a bit slower than your normal reads keep going you will find beauty here what's next i am honored to be part of the first flights program the next book to be reviewed for this program is a working theory of love by scott hutchins 4 stars","450":" sadly for me this book picked up speed only towards the end otherwise i'd have given it a higher rating it felt like the story moved with a lack of urgency and that's why it took me over a week to read it most of the characters were emotionally charged but you wouldn't know it from their mannerisms you knew there had to be tension but it was so controlled i don't know i didn't feel desperate and i wanted to feel desperate i wanted wrongs righted then and there whether it be between only two people at a given time even the ending was disappointing because when i finally got to really know the main character and she's fully taken charge of her life convinced of her purpose this story ends frustrating","451":"i don't know berlin and i don't know the german language so at times it was difficult to identify the places talked about in the book the story of an ordinary woman making extraordinary choices is very good the insight into the lives and minds of germans during hilters reign is enlightening","452":"this was an exciting page turner with vivid characters in desperate situations in berlin during wwii it also makes you think about what you would have done if you had been german or jewish in those circumstances","453":"this book was dark but it dove into the murkiness of humanity during the nazi regime in germany it was a fascinating read one that haunts me even as i close the cover","454":"this is a really good book sigrid is a complex anti herione the concept that a city is left with only women is frightening because they are at the hands of the government and police but it is also powerful because well women are powerful enjoyed a lot","455":"i wanted to like this book and did enjoy certain aspects of it however while other reviewers reference the love story within the overall depiction of wwii germany i am at a loss to understand that relationship at all i just did not find it believable from the very beginning so its role as a lynchpin in the overall story failed for me","456":"a fictional story about the role of one particular woman in berlin at the height of ww2 a genre that i love this had a bit of everything passion suspense interesting characters woven into a story with a holocaust ww2 background not exactly uplifting and light but extremely addicting","457":"this was a very compelling story and i enjoyed it very much it's hard today with our freedom u0026amp comforts to imagine the day to day terror of life during ww2 this is the story of one german woman's trials moral dilemmas and choices which put her life in irreversible danger it was like being there with the threat of gestapo ever looming and the paranoia of never knowing if you could trust even your best friend highly recommend","458":"people and situations are inevitably more complicated than we think the layers and intrigue here were great aside from the obvious war atmosphere bombs rations etc it must have been so odd to live in a world of mostly women where the bulk of the remaining men were strutting dangerous gestapo like guys or shell shocked injured soldiers the first chapter was slow and i almost put it down but was so glad that i kept reading","459":"fast read enjoyed this a lot","460":"personal relatable and important the author brings to light flickers of humanity at surprising moments in this novel i enjoyed it","461":"sigrid's husband is far away at the war and she's living very bored life with boring job and living with her mother in law but then she meets egon at the cinema and they became lovers she also befriends young girl named ericha who has ties with underground movement that helps jews i had read lots of great reviews about this and i was quite excited to start this but unfortunately this just wasn't for me the first half started very slowly i couldn't connect with the characters and i didn't like either sigrid or egon we have many and i mean many sex scenes and i'm not sure if her adulterous relationships were supposed to make me like her but it didn't and while she seems so in love with her jewish lover she also has sex with her neighbor's brother i didn't quite understand how she even became to have any feelings for egon because besides sex they don't actually talk very much or when sigrid tries to talk and get to know him he just shuts off he never tells her anything about him or his past and she just takes it all and also what kind of intelligent person would have sex with a jew in a crowded cinema at the times like that i mean you could end up in prison or whatever for that but apparently you just can't help that... and when we do learn more about egon's dealings it definitely didn't make me like him any more i liked the second part more and the parts where sigrid was helping the jews and her relationship with ericha but otherwise this just fell flat for me","462":"really enjoyed the storyline minus the smut","463":"another dreary world war ii book set in berlin i got this as an advanced readers copy i gave up around page 120","464":"disturbing but an excellent book with lots of feeling","465":"this one was set in berlin during wwii it showed characters who made decisions that were not black and white there were people doing the right thing for the wrong reasons and those doing the wrong thing for if not the right reasons at least understandable reasons the good people weren't all good the bad not all bad","466":" i found this book based on a review by stephen king so needless to say i was quite curious this was a wonderful read from the perspective of developing the main character she is complex layered and i found myself really caring for her i don't often read books set in wars but the description of berlin during wwii kept my attention especially as it describes the day to day existence of those left behind one sees how these women keep the wheels of life turning and is impressed by their courage and fortitude simply put this is a novel i might never have selected for myself but it reminds me to stretch my reading choices beyond the norm that is after all what reading is largely about widening one's perspective","467":" the city of women by david gillham follows the journey of sigrid a young german woman whose husband is on the front line during wwii fighting for germany the story this book addresses is not the story that tends to be in the forefront when picking up a book about wwii rather the story here is the other side how the german women lived while their husbands were away how they adapted to being the model aryan wives how they handled subjects like infidelity infertility injustice and how they fought back passively and aggressively city of women is remarkably well written and well paced i always felt as if i needed to read just a few more pages because the story's unfolding was so exquisitely painful however that said there were times that i felt a little put off sigrid is an incredibly sexual woman and those appetites were described in depth throughout the course of the book what this did to me was make me wonder what exactly was behind the story was it that sigrid got involved in illegal activities because her moral conscience begged her to or was it because her sexual appetite drove her to do so and there's where the book struggles for me the description of city of women talks about sigrid having a jewish lover and i understand that is the whole catalyst for it all but for a woman who will stop at nothing apparently to do the right thing sigrid's version of abuse of her body is completely at odds with what ericha does for example it's the complexity of that struggle and the differences between those women that will have me thinking about the story here in the days to come the biggest question this book poses to the reader and fails to give the answer to but i believe that's intended is just what will you do to save the lives of those who are being treated unjustly what will remain sacred to you your vows your body your mind your soul this would be a very interesting book club read a discussion to go over those very questions could lead to some enlightening and thought provoking ideas","468":"in a word fabulous just fabulous okay two words","469":"i loved this book once i started it it was really hard to put down if it wasn't for the fact that i had to work the next day i would have read through the night the city is berlin in the last days of wwii it really is a city of women as the majority of men are away fighting the war the main character sigrid is one of those women while sitting in a movie theatre she meets on separate occasions the love of her life and the woman who would change her life egon is a jew on the run from the gestapo the more we find out about him the more we are torn between respect and disgust ericha is a young woman working with the underground to save the jews and any other dissidents when she and sigrid first come together it is in the balcony at the movies where she grabs sigrid's arm and begs please if they ask say we came together the they is the police who are checking identity papers sigrid only knows ericha slightly because she works for someone in her apartment building but without thinking she helps the girl and thus gets herself thrust into the resistance at the end of the book the author asks what would you do i would like to hope i would act like sigrid did i was said at the end of the book because of what happens to egon but overall i felt the author captured women's voices very well did a great job of getting the feel of the time and place correct i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history it is well witten and well researched","470":"this book depicts love and loss in a time of war and it truly makes you question if you would risk your life to save others i really enjoyed it and highly recommend the book","471":"berlin 1943 was filled neither with heroes or villains but characters--the majority wives mothers sweethearts and daughters--who struggled to survive and save their loved ones despite the miasma of treachery fear and unacknowledged impending defeat not easy reading but enlightening","472":"an amazing book i hated to put it down","473":"suzanne bertish as the narrator of this book had me captivated from the first to the sad last page i felt grief when i was forced to part from my involvement with sigrid so intimately conveyed by suzanne bertish this book ticks all my boxes i love history conveyed through the experiences of whole real characters add credible relationships that grow shatter resurrect implode as flawed people are forced into situations and circumstances crafted by insane leaders as a second ingredient and the setting berlin what a magnificent work the atmosphere the dynamics the depth way into my new reads i keep thinking back to that realistic mother daughter in law relationship and find myself wondering how the sparring is going definitely a book to enjoy all over again from the very beginning a triumph","474":"a brilliant beautifully written debut novel set in war torn berlin during wwii there is so much depth to this story from the complex characters to the historical detail and surprising plot twists i couldn't put the book down highly recommend","475":"loved this book true thriller nothing as it seems with a moral core","476":" wow i really enjoyed this book not to often that we are able to place ourselves in the shoes of a young german woman living in berlin during the war what would i have done in her place the sex is there as she uses it to her advantage husband gone fighting a young jewish man who uses her for sex and passing of documents a young girl who lives by her rules and protects jews it also gives you another perspective on how the germans ignored the jewish problem turn your head and pretend it isn't there in some ways we do this with the homeless situation in our city ignore them and they will go away","477":" i saw a copy of this book at barnes and noble a couple of years ago and after reading the cover blurbs put it on my wishlist at paperbackswap com received a copy from them a few months ago and finally got around to reading it it was a somewhat difficult book to read given the subject matter but as the novel developed it kept me interested and turning the pages the novel takes place in berlin in 1943 at the height of wwii the novel is called city of women because most of the adult male population has been drawn into the nazi war machine berlin is a place where the remaining germans are living lives to avoid the police where a wrong word slipped against the powers that be could lead to torture or to a nazi concentration camp this is the world where sigrid schroder lives with her mother in law while her husband is serving in the army on the russian front sigrid meets one of her neighbors a young woman named ericha at a local cinema who begs sigrid to tell the local police the she came to the cinema with ericha the police suspected ericha of crimes against the state sigrid subsequently gets involved in helping ericha protect and hide jews from the gestapo in a sort of underground railway this reminded me somewhat of anne frank's story sigrid also meets a jewish man at the cinema who becomes her lover but can she trust him i was really unaware of how the everyday citizenry of germany were affected by the war and how some acted against the nazi policies while others just demurely went along with them even though they witnessed jews being rounded up in the streets and sent away to concentration camps overall this was a very engaging novel highlighting the brutality of the nazis the fear of the citizens and how some were trying to be redeemed in a very difficult situation","478":"the characters were interesting the story and action fast paced and i enjoyed it more than i thought it would considering the setting is berlin during the war i am not fond of war stories but this was truly more a story of human survival human sacrifice to help others and how love comes in various forms i read it straight through over the weekend so it was a quick read","479":"this book was really interesting the city of berlin in 1943 had been left pretty much too the women it gave an idea of what their day to day lives might have been like during that time it also asked the question what would i have done in that situation could i have ignored or not seen what was really going on around me or would i have taken a stand makes for some interesting self reflection","480":"excellent book about wwii and the moral dilemma faced by german women in nazi germany whether to ignore what was happening to the jews around them or take a risk and help their fellow man","481":"it is 1943 the height of the second world war and berlin has essentially become a city of women sigrid is what most people think is a model german soldier's wife she goes to work each day does as much as she can with her rations and dutifully cares for her meddling mother in law but behind the facade is a different sigrid a woman who dreams of her former lover he is a jew before she knows what is happening she is embroiled in helping jews escape and find refuge it was really good and i would have given it a 4 but it did have to much sex situations in it that i didn't think were all necessary i did like the ending it surprised me but i like it","482":"could not put this down it's a must read for sure berlin during wwii choices to make twists u0026amp turns fantastic","483":" i am a fan of historical fiction especially those works centered on the world war ii years i found this book to be rather unique as it focused on the city of berlin and how the residents especially the women were horribly affected by the war the city is under bombardment by the british and the citizens are subjected to the unrelenting propaganda of the nazis against this backdrop the main character a young german decides to risk everything to become involved with a small group of people trying to smuggle jewish citizens out of germany the suspense is high throughout and the outcome is uncertain until the closing pages aside from the terrific plot this work provides a chilling reminder of the horrific effects of hitler's regime the gestapo were unchecked and unstoppable no one dared to speak out against hitler the book serves as a warning to cherish our freedom and to be wary about propaganda being generated from any source whether it be from politicians or the media the book also raises questions of a personal nature such as what would the reader do if faced with a situation of becoming involved in helping strangers or of just turning away from the abominable happenings i think that this would be an excellent book club selection","484":"i found this book a bit boring in the beginning and it took a while for it to actually catch my interest however before i got half way through i was hooked the characters are strong some likeable and some not so much the plot has many twists and turns the main character sigrid is very passionate and extremely resourceful and brave she has a very passionate love affair with egon while being married to kaspar and egon is not what he seems to be she befriends a young woman named ericha and together their risk everything to hide jewish people from the nazi's a truly unforgettable novel","485":"i really enjoyed this book i liked learning about the city of berlin during wwii and the plight of the women who were left on their own to survive as best they could lots of mystery and intrigue in the story good read","486":"151st city of womenchosen by mariannetrivia winner nicole~cove opinion c above average storywe discuss city of women in the 31st episode of our cove podcast listen in","487":"very interesting study of world war ii from the perspective of a german house frau and fascinating study of human nature and the good and the bad in all of us","488":"for a story ostensibly about women during wwii the storyline sure was driven heavily by men not a bad thing in and of itself but definitely not what i was anticipating would have found more interesting some of the prose was repetitive as well repeated similes all over the place decent plane reading from dc to ca though","489":"it was a little questionable at the beginning hints of the past then the present finally it came together and then i couldn't put it down certainly an interesting view of wwii and what it may have been like to wonder if you are being propagandized inspiring in that you can see the struggle of wanting to do what is right makes you wonder what are we being told and what is actually happening","490":" city of women captures the sights sounds and stress of war time berlin with the men off fighting for german glory berlin has become a city of women tensions are high the raf runs bombing raids almost nightly ration coupons run low neighbors watch each other closely for cracks in home front stoicism sigrid works in a patent office and lives with her difficult mother in law her husband is fighting the russians on the eastern front the cinema has become her escape but may also become her downfall egon a handsome and aggressive man approaches sigrid during a film and the two begin a clandestine affair but he abruptly disappears sigrid returns to the cinema hoping to see egon again when she is approached by a young woman ericha is the caretaker for her neighbor's children ericha is distressed and asks sigrid to say they were watching the film together moments later the police stop the film and question the women sigrid protects ericha but demands to know what ericha is hiding as sigrid learns more about this mysterious young woman she also discovers difficult truths about the german war effort under the scrutiny of her mother in law neighbors and co workers sigrid involves herself in ericha's schemes making life altering decisions that impact everyone around her sigrid's dramatic decisions will make readers wonder what difference can one woman make","491":"berling during world war ii and the women left behind","492":"i enjoyed this for the most part beautiful haunting imagery only flaw was i definitely knew it was written by a man there are just some male writers that can write women better so to speak a depressing topic but overall well done","493":"very exciting you are on the edge of your seat not knowing who to love or hate who to get attached to and still getting attached to sigrid and involved in the story and of course certain characters like the older mrs schroeder is a character you love to hate","494":"i finished this book last night and loved it gillham is a great story teller and i like how he built up the suspense and the ending was terrific had me on the edge of my bed since i read before going to sleep since i enjoy pre wwii and wwii novels this was perfect i am so glad i read it","495":"kept me on the edge of my seat loved it","496":"i thought this book was very well written very descriptive i listened to the audio also and the women who did that was fantastic i sometimes don't like listening to audios but this one was exceptionally well done","497":"to say city of women by david r gillham was compulsively readable would be an understatement in a statement following the conclusion he explains the plot was inspired by a visit to berlin shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 throughout wwii the city was left mainly to women as the most of men were away fighting on various fronts the author pictured these women as they went about the stark winter of their daily lives an existence marked by hunger loneliness and bitter cold where sex was often rough and desperate even at times a commodity the ongoing roundup and deportation of jews in their midst continued to be a lengthening shadow 'what would you do' is an underlying theme the tale surges with suspense of all sorts as sexual tension and imminent danger are interwoven in a climate of unmitigated evil those struggling to survive lived constantly with the threat posed by informants the city surely witnessed selfless acts by unsung heroes so thought david gillham and he has written a haunting powerful mesmerizing novel","498":"excellent would love to see a sequel set in the cold war era","499":"well written full of complex characters and an insightful view of something that's difficult to understand why the majority of german citizenry did nothing to stop the slaughter of the jews","500":"set in berlin in 1943 sigrid married to a soldier in hitler's army becomes drawn into helping jews and others escape to freedom it's a mesmerizing account of how people silently will risk their own life to do what's right","501":"berlin 1943 is a city of women sigrid is the main character a flawed married woman who is having an affair with a jewish man everyone has secrets everyone lies most of the characters have hidden goodness sigrid becomes involved with a group helping to smuggle jews out of berlin an amazingly diverse group of people are involved in the process i loved the way the book ended although i was surprised","502":"another book set during wwii what could be left to tell the author manages to weave an engrossing story from the german citizen's point of view there are mostly women left in berlin as it is set during the waning days of the war the germans are losing although the propoganda on their radios tries to tell them differently this is an engrossing story which drew me in immediately and kept in interested all the way through there are some steamy sex scenes intrigue and moral choices to be made our flawed but admirable heroine sigrid shows us how it's done","503":"moving story main characters all women though it is written by a man great ending","504":"this book is a difficult one to read or at least it was for me it is very haunting throughout the entire novel and i had a sick feeling et every turn of the page i think it was designed to make me feel this way though and in that was brilliant this is not a feel good story but i was in the mood for some depth and that is exactly what i got from this it is probably not one i would read again only because of the subject matter but it is definitely one i'm glad to have picked up","505":"sigrid lives in berlin as wwii is coming to an end her husband is on the russian front she's working in the patent office and having an affair with a jew her life is monotonous and routine but she comes in contact with a young woman who is trying to make a difference in the berlin culture gradually sigrid begins to understand what is really going on in germany where the jews are really going as they get on those trains and her life begins to change in ways she could not have anticipated","506":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i received a copy of this book from a goodreads giveaway i was not compensated in any way and was only asked to give an honest review this novel was one that while it moved fairly quickly did not always fully engage me perhaps it was the initial distance i felt from the main character sigrid she was portrayed as a lonely wife whose husband with whom she held no great feeling for was away at war she filled her empty existence with work making meals sleep all this punctuated by air i received a copy of this book from a goodreads giveaway i was not compensated in any way and was only asked to give an honest review this novel was one that while it moved fairly quickly did not always fully engage me perhaps it was the initial distance i felt from the main character sigrid she was portrayed as a lonely wife whose husband with whom she held no great feeling for was away at war she filled her empty existence with work making meals sleep all this punctuated by air raids and the resulting aftermath she lived with a mother in law who despised her and sigrid's feelings mirrored the older woman's she was stilted and morally vacant she attempted to create passion in her life by engaging in numerous affairs while she spoke of love it appeared she really could not separate the physical acts she performed from the complexity of a emotionally fulfilling relationship unlike other reviewers i was not offended by her extracurricular activities rather i grew weary of her naive and morally superior attitude she seemed wooden and one dimensional at times she seemed to start to break out of her mold as it were when she assisted a young woman who asked for her assistance while watching a movie at a local theatre from this moment on her decision resulted in a snowball effect that led her to discard her self centered and yet passive complex and move on to a more active role in the resistance in particular helping to relocate jewish and other persecuted people out of the country i did enjoy the atmosphere that the author recreated for us it was interesting to me how oppressive it was to simply live in germany without the fear of religious persecution women could not smoke it was illegal to be late for work allegiance to the nazi regime was required while the air raids increased and reports of lost battles circulated the german government increased its genocidal campaign against the jewish people hoping to distract its people from a war that was all but lost as the author stated in his final notes at the end of the novel sigrid has watched as the casual anti semitism of the german middle class in the 1930s has transformed into state sponsored persecution and state supported pogroms for years she may have disapproved she may have felt shame for her nation but she did not resist did she feel helpless to act most probably what after all could one woman do did she feel relieved by the fact of her helplessness very likely if she could not act then she did not need to feel a responsibility to act it was not until sigrid freed herself from this thought life process that she became more real to me even after turning the last page and i highly recommend that you read the author's notes at the end of the novel titled what would any of us do i continue to think about the novel and the circumstances it depicted more","507":"it was a page turner it was full of questions about morality greed fear and love i found i had a little trouble accepting some of the coincidences that occured but i definately got attached to many of the characters and was hoping for a happy ending somehow the wrong time period for any such thing","508":"i was very much looking forward to this apparently over hyped book i thoroughly enjoy well researched historical fiction novels but this was not one of them the book had an interesting enough plot but there is minimal development and redemption of characters it drove home the sad existence of the women wounded soldiers and hidden jews the numerous sex scenes didn't really add much to the story other than it was a means to an end i'm hard pressed to recommend this book to anyone i know","509":"i really enjoyed this book it is very thought provoking","510":"i listened to this book on audible and it was a good story takes place during world war ii in berlin and focuses on an ordinary wife who gets involved with helping jew leave the country","511":" berlin in 1943 is a city of women because the men have gone to war it is also a city of rationing drabness enforced patriotism fear and suspicion sigrid schroder lives in a small apartment and argues with her mother in law while her husband fights on the eastern front then dutiful sigrid meets a mysterious man and becomes involved--in lots of things this well written and compelling debut novel by david r gillham is a character study a morality tale and a thriller one of the best novels i've read this year other than my own","512":"about a german woman who becomes involved with a group hiding jews in berlin during wwii interesting story but sigrid is difficult to both like and understand","513":"this is gritty realistic fiction at its best i felt like i was right in war time berlin with all its sights sounds and emotions gillham did a fantastic job bringing it to life and the story itself has so many twists and turns sigrid's character grew and changed so much from beginning to end as she faced questions of morality and guilt and so many more amazing book highly recommend","514":"a very satisfying novel great characters great setting great plot definitely recommended","515":" city of women by david gillham is not the run of the mill wwii story rather gillman takes the readers deep into 1943 berlin where he allows the reader to see another side of life for the wives left behind the choices they must make on a daily basis and begs the question what would you do to survive city of women will keep the reader thoroughly engaged from beginning to end i was unable to set the book down as i could not find a spot to stop reading i kept wanting to know what would happen next i highly recommend city of women and believe it would be an excellent book discussion group pick","516":"this was a very good book my only complaint is that i found it hard to follow at times i don't know maybe it was just me not focusing or trying to read when i was tired","517":"interesting story about the women in berlin during ww 2 and how some helped the jews left behind","518":"amazing truly a great read","519":"it's a meh book it's an interesting book for the simple fact of the point of view i have no real complaints nor raves","520":"excellent and thought provoking his first book i hope he writes another","521":"interesting perpective from the german life","522":"my mind kept wandering while read this not sure if it was me or the book","523":"simply wonderful","524":"the first 3 4 of this book's plot revolved around adulturous trysts by the women left behind in the war it was too much the last quarter once past the all the sex actually picked up and became pretty good","525":"i'm totally blown away probably one of the best things i've read ever mainly because of the exploration from so many angles of what the f were the common citizens of germany doing issues of fear trust lust survival","526":"artful reading by suzanne bertish","527":"pretty good a lot of errors towards the end misspelled words missing words etc but overall a decent read","528":"passionate edgy loved it","529":"another angle on wwii and the holocaust slow to get into but worth the journey","530":" this was a very interesting book i've never read a wwii novel from the perspective of the german side before written by an american man the main character is a german woman while she isn't particularly likeable it is a good portrait of an ordinary person trying to ignore what awful things are happening all around her until she just can't stay uninvolved any more this book has the air of being very well researched one gets what feels like a real sense of what living in berlin in the early 1940s might have been like a book well worth reading","531":"careful about your emotions you can't afford to form any attachments","532":"started a little slow but picked up anything with world war ii backdrop i find interesting","533":"not a light or pleasant read but you don't forget it","534":"didn't love it didn't hate it as the book progressed the editing was worse and worse when a book is badly edited it becomes a distraction to the story there's a great story in there hiding behind all the poor editing and sex","535":"i liked this book but it was depressing made the mistake of reading it during hurricane sandy probably not a smart thing to do","536":" one of the best stories i have ever read you get to see wwii germany from the point of view of the many women who were left behind in berlin when all the men went to war or went into hiding the plot has several unexpected twists and turns but in the end it all comes down to the power that each of us has to make a difference if we are brave enough be aware there are some very frank sex scenes for better or worse depending on your point of view but do read this i predict it will be made into a movie","537":"the plot to city of women is amazing it follows a soldiers wife through the turbulent day of 1943 germany her personal journey through tedious daily war routine and into a member of the underground movement to shield and help people escape from the violent and deadly hands of the gestapo she herself is engaged in an affair with a jew what i did not expect was that her jewish lover was one of the most unlikeable people in the story i was fully expecting a tragic romance but what i got was an abusive lover who doesn't really care about her at all who uses her and i was pretty shocked to see a rape scene quarter way through i'm not sure if the author realizes this but any sex scene with a noticeable absence of a yes is rape even if that person is your boyfriend and he was pretty rough so yeah the dude proves himself to be quite the asshole later on too i know this is about the realities about what people are willing to do to keep themselves alive during wartime but this guy was so unbelievably horrible i could not for the life of me figure why she felt such an attachment and he is later described by another character to be charming which i couldn't see at all i loved the realism of everything the war torn city the complicit millions the death despair the brutality the dreariness the old time misogyny i liked ericha and sigrid the most of all the characters unfortunately the characters is where the novel falls down a bit most of them are hard to like and hard to relate to and in some ways its hard to really get to know a character what makes them tick why they do what they do who they really are the connections just werent there but the ending of the book surprised me it was really good","538":"berlin during wwii is the city of women this is a gritty look at life in wartime germany sigrid's husband is in the army u0026amp she is living inharmoniously with her mother in law she becomes involved with a young girl who is helping to spirit jews to safety along the way she is drawn into a tumultuous relationship with a jewish man in hiding this book very effectively evokes the horror of bombing raids as well as day to day dreariness u0026amp food shortages","539":" city of women is a big book but then again author david r gillham has a big story to tell world war ii berlin has sent away its men to fight leaving behind women of all ages and social standing to cope and continue a shell existence nothing can be right until the cruel conflict is over but will it ever really be over as sigrid schroder's husband wages war on the eastern front sigrid goes through all the expected motions she goes to her job manages to sustain with rations and other deprivations and dutifully suffers her mother in law's attitude and opinions all outward appearances suggest sigrid is loyal and true to the german regime however her dreams of her dangerous involvement with her jewish former lover begin to unravel the wool over her eyes sigrid recklessly shelters a woman and her children whom she believes to be the family of her lost lover the choices sigrid is forced to make will no longer allow her to ignore the atrocities of the war around her david r gillham is an extraordinary storyteller creating imperfect unforgettable characters most of all he paints exquisitely intimate portraits of women who live with the face of death beside them in their mirrors david r gillham what will be your next gift to your readers review copy gratis amazon

sentence and find out about why i have mixed feelings on this book","541":"mix of historical setting berlin wwii as german woman married to a soldier and an exciting dramatic plot are great with this book couldn't put it down a compelling read","542":"i kept waiting for the story to get really really good but it didn't though i liked much of it i was never convinced by the relationship between the main character and her lover so everything that followed from that did not quite ring true still an interesting interpretation of wartime germany","543":"i really enjoyed this novel it is set in wwii but from a german perspective it altered my perception of the average german citizen during this horrific period in history","544":"gripping and pacy but with moments of beauty and humanity too full review here http theselittlewords com 2014 01 1","545":"i've read a lot of books fiction and non about wwii and nazi germany and this wasn't among my favorites it really only deserved about 2 5 stars but i went ahead and gave it 3 an okay book with intriguing characters but hard to follow in many places","546":"wwii germany setting told from the perspective of a german woman who becomes involved in helping jews escape a page turner","547":"interesting perspective on what it would be like to live in germany as a female during the second world war 1943 what would you do given the situation of death or betrayal","548":"berlin in wwii was a city of women with all the men off at war this was an interesting book suspenseful enough that i had a hard time putting it down i thought this book rated 3 5 but since that wasn't an option i gave it the benefit of the doubt and scored it a 4","549":"i am really enjoying this book easy to read flows well i am eager to see how it ends","550":"great read started on a flight to dallas and finished on the way back","551":"it was a slower read than i had hoped it jumped a bit too much but all in all it wasn't a bad read","552":"ordinary folk fall into situations during un ordinary times i knew such a person in france it brings out the best and worst in us humans our heroine goes from just surviving through a war and doing something about it","553":"dark morality tale with gritty view of war torn berlin wonderfully written not for escape or poolside reading","554":"this isn't a typical read for me this is straight historical fiction and a novel about germany during world war ii which has been covered over and over again gillham like many before him asks his readers what would you do and why that last question is ultimately the more interesting one i think sigrid schroeder is a woman hiding anger in heart and jews in an attic who sleeps with men who are not her husband but is offended when she finds her young neighbor to have posed for a deck of salacious playing cards yes she grapples with the distinction between a good war time german and a good person what it means to betray an extinguished marriage but she also considers some terribly cruel actions for equally terribly understandable reasons in a book about nazi germany it's easy to resort to stereotypes but gillham has done anything but his people are well considered and deeply convincing","555":" i've been reading a lot of different perspectives of world war ii over the last couple of years and it's really fascinating to learn through fiction how much of the world really was affected by the war and to see what that looked like in many different places this book takes place in berlin during wwii and it just grabbed me and wouldn't let me go i loved it i am suspicious of people who think it's obvious that they would have been on the right side of a historical event for example americans who say that of course they would have been revolutionaries hindsight is 20 20 and all that that's just not good cultural relativism anyway this book explores that issue in a way i really appreciated people are more complex there's not just good and bad it explores the complicated moral landscape in a way i found very satisfying what causes someone to get involved risk their own safety what holds someone back what things do we think we should feel and what do we actually feel who can we really trust definitely recommended if you like reading wwii historical fiction","556":"i enjoyed this book at first hard to keep track of some of the characters names but once got that down went smoothly definitely kept me interested and had a few surprises","557":"although i have not finished i hate doing the updates that said this book shows how a country involved in war the citizens of germany during wwii could ignore then be intimidated into inaction when confronted with the reality of a government they voted for is out of control kind of like our country and how it is using secret drone programs to eliminate those we do not like even our own citizens we have a size able number of politician willing to shoot first and negotiate after the murder of people why are we the most war like country on the world is might always right where does a country draw the line","558":"while the book was definitely moving it was extremely slow moving and a little bland a brilliantly generic wwii story","559":"it took me about a month to finish this book a lot of stops and starts but it was worth it in the end very gritty dark and complex paints a very stark picture about the lives of berliners as germany starts to suffer losses in wwii sigrid is a war wife who is drawn into a secret world of those who are helping to shelter and protect jews as well as those who are seeking to find them the seekers include the nazis and 'catchers' jews who have turned against their own in order to save their own lives a lot of twists turns and reversals you're never sure of the motives for the key characters","560":"the question of what you would do during wartime is often posed but never answered in such a strikingly factual yet imaginative way as it is in the city of women the truth of the situations used as a platform for the gritty story made the characters appear real the plot was factually accurate without being dull finally picking up near the 100 page mark a little too far into the novel for my taste but the more i read the more i liked the book it's hard to describe everything about this novel other than to say it was a mixture of several plot lines that all merge into a story of how individuals react in wartime the author brilliantly interposed the plight of jews and germans both turning on each other turning on their own race and of course turning on the nazis through sigrid the author examines whether she can be a good person and also be what the germans consider to be a good fraulein i was surprised that the main character was a german woman who is suddenly thrust into the dangerous position of helping jews hiding from the germans what struck me the most was how the authored used so many factual details to create a complete backdrop for each character he managed to describe not just the underground system used to hide and transport jews out of occupied cities but also the inner workings of the german army the use of propaganda against the german people was overwhelming i had never thought too much about the german people's interpretation of these obviously false statements or on the impact of nightly bombings in germany on those left in the city sigrid provides the perspective not only of the terror women feel as they leave home each night to sleep in the bomb shelters but how they constantly grapple with remaining faithful to their husbands amidst so much turmoil the characters' actions were thoughtful which was clear from the plot and conversations each chapter revealed that nothing was as it seemed and the constant twists were unexpected everyone is hiding a secret the question is how big the ending was a little quick but the story had a lasting impact and was the definition of thought provoking for wwii buffs this novel is a must","561":"beautifully assembled and lush ultimately deeply satisfying even though there are no happy endings with a setting like this and topics like these highly recommended for putting a human face on the choices none of which were clear or easy that must be made nazi germany","562":"sigrid is a great character and the i loved the story at times it was a little hard to follow as the author includes so many sub minor characters i think i understand his reasons but it makes some of the scenes a little confusing","563":"i'm afraid i didn't care for this book all that much but the setting atmosphere sense of place u0026amp time was so well evoked that i can't totally write it off i know people are really in love with this novel and once again i'm swimming against the current of public opinion here because it just didn't do that much for me in my long review i make the point that the author's original intent to write a novel with a completely female cast of characters because i wanted to explore wartime from a feminine point of view would have made this book more realistic and would have added something to the existing works of historical fiction set during this time period but i felt that what i got instead was like chick lit set against the backdrop of the holocaust rather than following his instinct the author decided that his original idea fell flat and that he needed the dramatic tension of the love affairs to keep the plot moving and the suspense tightened from an interview at psychology today now i know my opinion sounds kind of harsh but well i can't help how i feel how can there not be real suspense when at the very least the novel recounts berlin in 1943 where people are being watched or are themselves agents of the watchers or where there are regular bombing raids that create tension and a fear of nothing to go home to when the all clear sounds then there are some of the other female characters in this novel whose stories had they been considered and more developed in terms of the original idea of wartime from a feminine point of view would have made for much better reading and may have offered more of a look at what these women might have actually gone through during this time i think i'd recommend city of women to people who like their historical fiction on the lighter side this one has more of a beachy feel rather than a serious examination of lives where regiments of husbands uncles and brothers have been mobilized and berlin has become a city of women","564":"after the first half of this book it was a great page turner i appreciated the fact that i finally found a book about ww2 and the holocaust that depicted the moral dilemma that german aryans experienced often books just show the heroes who know it is wrong this book does that too but it also shows a relatively intimate look at those who conformed i liked the main characters and felt the book's plot developed nicely","565":" the story was good lots of detail about wwii germany and its citizens but i must agree with another reviewer who said that many characters were unlikeable and the sex scenes were stilted and cold i hate to think this but one can almost tell it was written by a man sigrid is apparently so sex starved that she jumps into bed at the romantic invitation to feel a penis do you know what this for best pickup line ever it worked there was just a cold unemotional feeling among the characters that made it difficult to believe i gave it a 3 due to the setting and overall story because it was interesting enough to continue but definitely needed an infusion of emotion in all the characters instead of feeling empathy for sigrid the main character i felt sorry for her husband who is a very minor character in the book","566":"this is a tough one to read if you have any imagination because it was such an awful period of history the book is set in berlin where we lived for a couple of years so i could recognize the setting which made it even more real the protagonist is the wife of a german soldier living with her grim mother in law while her husband is off at the russian front she ends up helping german jews and other undesirables escape and has a couple of scary affairs not a happy book but engrossing","567":"didn't really connect with the characters but well plotted","568":" i can't even begin to describe how enveloped i became in this novel i have taken quite a liking to audiobooks i had wanted to read this from the moment it had come out many people had recommended it to me and finally saw it on sale as an audio i took advantage i am so happy i did it is heartbreaking and beautiful i could see the life the main character lead her having to deal with the rough choices of whether to go left or right she is by no means the perfect woman sigrid has many flaws i felt compelled to her even more so because of how human she became and gillham had described her and getting in her head i cannot wait to re read it to pick up on the things i missed the first time around","569":"very good period novel with a different perspective this novel is told from the point of view of a berlin housewife during wwii whose husband is at the front who has a jewish lover and who also works for the jewish resistance in berlin david gillham has amazing insight into the thoughts and feelings of a woman in this suspenseful dark novel","570":"it was interesting and sad worth the read but i think i need a break from these war stories","571":"i really really wanted to give this book a higher rating but just could not interesting idea for a story appears a great deal of research was performed it fell short too many editing and continuity bloopers not to give anything away but the scene toward the end between egon and sigrid really the author apparently did not research the plausibility of such an incident","572":"i didn't like this at first but didn't have anything else to read the story became more interesting and i ended up enjoying it it was very different from other books about wwii","573":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book following the lives of some of the women in berlin during wwii the characters were engaging and the story was believable i found myself very taken in and wondering what would happen as sigrid turned the corner","574":"i'd give this 3 5 if i could it took a while to get into it and the ending was too wrapped up in a bow for my liking but it was an interesting wwii perspective that i have not seen before one does not often think of the women who were left behind in germany it makes me want to read a book about the war from a russian woman's point of view","575":"a compelling novel that answers the question what can one person do in the face of evil an excellent historical novel of berlin during the 3rd year of the war told from the viewpoint of a wife on the homefront highly recommend","576":"this was a great book with good characters it takes place in berlin in wwii and brings up a lot of interesting moral questions concerning ordinary citizens during war time in this case it's mostly women because most of the men are away fighting even after the book is finished i find myself thinking about different characters and decisions or choices they made","577":"story of the life of a married woman living in berlin during wwii the story is specifically set in 1943 when berliners are realizing that they are going to loose the war stark acts of cowardice heroism and lives unimaginable to me are couched in the every day mundaneness of lives in hunger and despair exceptionally well written","578":"i absolutely loved this book a fascinating look at ww2 from a perspective you don't often see the german wife at home in berlin","579":"i really loved the premise of this book however i found the writing hard to get into and the characters difficult to like","580":" i think it is important to ask yourself how in all honesty would you behave surrounded by death destruction and isolation i've read other reviews in which people are taking a moral stance against the main character i find this ludicrous and think the author did a fine job asking himself how one's psyche might crack under the bombardment of their home the paranoia of the party and the mass murders of a group who's only crime was being born jewish i wonder if i would be as strong as the heroine of this piece or if i would have swallowed the propoganda like a bitter pill and been a good german","581":"berlin in 1943 almost all the men are gone to war sigrid schroder lives with her very unpleasant mother in law and becomes involved in an affair with a jewish man and in an underground group who helps to move hidden jews out of germany and you can't always tell who are the good guys and who the bad","582":" as i was reading this book and all its references to sex i would go back and look at the cover and ask myself is this danielle steele i felt betrayed by one review comment comparing it to bel canto then i remembered it was written by a straight man but had a female protagonist so i let all the wwii sex go and really enjoyed the deeper and thought provoking story what was happening in the cities of germany at the height of the war and how did naziism affect various residents worth a read if the time period means something to your already preconceived notion of who germans were during the war","583":" this was an absorbing disturbing novel about a berliner frau struggling with wartime privations claustrophobic propaganda and mounting ss and gestapo terrorism in 1943 4 berlin sigrid's moral foundations are challenged and reconfigured by events and the people she knows and encounters on the damp gray berliner strasses the cinema mezzanine and hidden rooms her carping mother in law absent at the eastern front soldier husband and suspicious judgmental apartment neighbors create an oppressive atmosphere that is counter balanced by sigrid's daring affair with egon affiliation with fraulein ericha kohl who is much more than she seems and the consequences of these contacts her decision to help persecuted jews flee to uncertain freedom all while the tommies drop their bombs on nights when the sky is clear this would be a good book club book and it even has discussion questions at the end well worth reading","584":"an excellent read berlin during world war two two strangers become involved with hiding jewish women and children","585":"i love to see a character discard convention flout expectations and be the better for it","586":"this had so much potential were it written by a woman who understands that women generally aren't sexual deviants nor constantly thinking about sex especially with multiple people this could've had a good story too bad not recommended and certainly not a romance as some reviewers say romance implies love which pretty much most characters severely lack","587":"interesting but depressing story of a german woman during world war ii","588":"it was ok but not great","589":"this book was chosen for our monthly selection at first i thought oh no not another holocaust book but i just loved it i was listening to the audiobook and could not stop listening to it i'd listen to it on the way to work and then take it in to listen to it in the kitchen the main character felt like a real person who i liked very much sigrid is an average german frau who is faced with decisions as to doing the right moral thing or follow the laws of the land her process and the relationships she develops makes for a wonderful story strongly recommended","590":"close to 5 stars men at war women on their own for the first time people making ethical moral and expedient choices wow this book has it all publishing date 8 07 12","591":"a fascinating insightful read about a woman's introduction to and subsequent support of the hiding of jews from german nazis during wwii it really opened up my view of the time period although i understand that sex was one of the people's only ways to drown their sorrows i just wish it wasn't so graphic in this novel","592":"i like the look at german citizens the book gives us it's hard to imagine the choices the average german was forced to make during the nazi regime it also showed the great danger one and one's family would be in if the chose to think independently i like the way the book showed that just one ordinary citizen could make such a difference the ending was a bit abrupt and the foundation for the end could have been built better all in all this is a book i'm glad i read and time well spent","593":"4 1 2 stars makes you think what would you do if you where put in that situation","594":"haunting and evocative look at life in berlin during world war ii","595":"there's something very haunting and insightful in this novel set in berlin in 1943 the author skillfully details much of life in nazi germany as the british keep up a steady bombardment some characters aren't fully fleshed out but the character studies are memorable and the plot never loses the dread it builds it is a book that will stay with me for quite a while","596":"this book seemed to have so much potential but it just fell short for me the characters never seemed to really show the emotions that i would expect in fact they showed little real emotion at all this left me wondering why i was spending the time reading this novel","597":"i didn't expect to enjoy this so much that i'd get through it in a day it's exciting and well paced and the writing and characters are fantastic rather than shoehorn some formality into his writing to evoke the time period gillham's prose is beautiful while still effective and down to earth and his characters are wonderful sigrid is definitely one of my all time favorites rather than being a self righteous martyr she's passionate without being irrational caring without being saccharine and most importantly not really a good person the rest of the cast is just as interesting and just as likeable definitely not one to pass up if you enjoy historical fiction","598":"this was a good book from the perspective of a german woman who defies everything a good german woman is and instead choose who she wants to be she collaborates with one of her neighbors to help jews in hiding she has an affair with jewish man which is the catalyst to her decision to help other jews and along the way she also has an affair with a german officer war books like this horrify me as i read because i just can't understand how people could be so base and so inhumane it boggles my mind but i liked the book and it certainly makes you wonder what you would have done had you been in her same position but i felt like i had a hard time connecting with sigrid to me it seemed like she seemed emotionally distant she just seemed so hardened callused and i felt like it portrayed the germans as an immoral people having affairs betraying friends neighbors etc but again what would i have done if faced with the same situation tough stuff and i could have done without the crude usage of some profanity","599":"gripping i was gripped by the authors style story and character development throughout i wondered 'what would i have been capable of doing ' i'm jewish so i've pondered this for many years this story is heart wrenching and i suspect was the true story of two many people","600":"thought provoking suspenseful couldn't put it down","601":"amazing intense thought provoking novel i loved the main character sigrid she was a strong brave smart sarcastic real woman she risked her life because she was a good person i think that was at the heart of her anyway she was just a good person moral honorable the author asks us at the end what would any of us do hard question to answer i'm sure everyone wants to answer that they would do the right thing but going back to that time period and putting yourself in someone's shoes is impossible that place that war is too sick for words and too out of my breadth of reality i can't even imagine living through that this story is very intense sad yet uplifting as well makes you think about good and bad right and wrong life and death great book ps i also liked how the book was told in 3rd person i feel like i haven't read a book in 3rd person in awhile it's always 1st person nowadays","602":"love this book","603":"could not get into this book past the first few chapters did not seem like what a real woman would do think","604":"lovely written book about the unlovely wwii ers and the things people do to survive in this case the women left behind when their soldiers went to war plot twists victories sadness","605":"i like this book it is a mystery love story and is a history in the lives of 2 women in nazi germany iin 1943","606":" if you liked the nightingale you'll also enjoy city of women by david r gillham i accidently brought it along on spring break thinking it a beach read back cover description notwithstanding turns out to be another variation on the theme of world war ii nazi germany complete with genocide paranoia bombing but even though the story is not new this version is an excellent thriller that will take you down all kinds of twists and turns if not alleys and other dark places set in berlin city of women's characters each have their own way of coping with loss both physical and emotional as well as of the once great city that no longer exists the will to survive in such uncertain times is a personal matter of choice and character and no one is spared the need to behave in a manner that would have been unthinkable in more civil times the suspense from page to page is palpable as is the sexual tension throughout you won't want to put down the book until you know what happens in the next chapter and then the next and then the one after that 24 hours was all i needed to zip through this 400 pager no matter which character you root for you'll still come away with that awful sense of hurray for my guy gal but what does it really matter when you think of all the others who didn't make it during this horrible and not so distant period of time","607":"four stars mostly because of the afterwards note by author gillham titled what would any of us do in which he explains his purpose otherwise i found myself as a reader occasionally confused especially towards the end by various characters and their apparent hidden agendas","608":"started off very well and sagged in the middle lucky the ending redeemed itself worth the read","609":"amazing book loved the world of the book and the character story was amazing i highly recommend","610":" i really liked this novel first of all the characters are realistic even if not really likable that being said i did like sigrid there's no sugarcoating especially of the main heroine whose motivations are often obscured but this does not mean they are less believable i actually thought this is what it would probably be like for the most and is kind of refreshing after reading dozens of novels where similar characters working for the resistance seem to be the embodiment of heroism and nobility the whole atmosphere of the wartime berlin is depicted wonderfully full of disillusioned inhabitants still gripping on to the empty promises of a great victory which would never happen the love story was a bit of a drag with sigrid constantly coming back to her cruel lover who was simply using her all the time but if he hadn't been like this the story would have less depth and would be a lot more melodramatic i think it gave this extra dimension to her character reminding me of sylvia plath's daddy sigrid having fallen for a man who is simply put a brute no matter the circumstances on the other hand i felt like sigrid was too lucky in reality it is very unlikely she would so easily get out of all the troubles the way she did in this story this was a little too much even if allow for the licentia poetica also the end of the novel left a lot to be desired the stories of some of the more interesting characters felt unfinished also by the end of the novel i really wanted to know what would happen to sigrid after would she live to see the end of the war in berlin and the soviet invasion together with the atrocities german women had to endure later on","611":"the book examines how the women of berlin coped during wwii focusing on one woman who is married to a soldier serving on in the east","612":"good book slow start for me touch topic page turner at the end","613":"i like historical fiction i anticipated that this would be a really good read instead i would describe it as a really slow read i was disappointed in the book it should have been so much more than what it is where is the gripping tension and fear living in war torn berlin i have read many novels on the holocaust and this one is more fiction than historical","614":"review to come","615":"this book was good but challenged me a bit because of all the german names of places in it it takes place in berlin but lots of towns and street names that were hard to read and pronounce in my head the ending was really good but the book didn't wow me like i thought it would","616":" a very chilling and haunting look into the berlin of wwii and a gripping novel that asks some very provocative questions how do you define what is right and what is wrong does breaking the law always mean that you're a criminal this is a darker novel that what i'm used to but one i'm glad i read anyway because there aren't a lot of novels that explore hitler's germany it goes to show that those who choose not to see and not to act can also be as criminal as the ones who commit atrocious crimes and it brings to mind ways in which this mindset is still alive today in what ways do we choose not to see because it's easier be prepared because this novel will make you ask that question of yourself","617":"i always love when a male author can authentically give voice to a female character this is such in the case of sigrid during nazi germany","618":" i see i'm in the minority here i did not like city of women berlin very much could just as easily have been version city of women paris with its insight into how war affects women left behind when most of the men go off to fight sigrid comes across as a cold and selfish person not really someone who would befriend a young girl and then help her to hide and rescue jews we had a flavour of how it would be to have to keep secrets avoid ss suspicion and carry on as normal - but really everything fell into place so conveniently there wasn't much in the way of suspense clearly a story of this type is all the better for some moral and trust issues but really i'm no prude but really sex in a cinema with a complete stranger in the seat with no one noticing in wartime when you can't trust anyone not even your fellow germans the things we do for love - or in sigrid's case obsession how could sigrid not have guessed that her jewish lover was secretive nothing he said made sense the numerous sex scenes with the jewish lover the german officer and the husband keep up were unpleasant and awkward the author's obsession with erections depressing lots of loose ends i had a hard time putting all this together my feeling is that this should have been a much better novel than it is and would have been had had the author relied more on actual historic facts and accounts","619":"this book chronicles the women of berlin during wwii how they coped with their husbands being away at war their reaction to the treatment of the jewish people of berlin and the difficult choices they had to make to survive","620":"i had higher hopes for this book i enjoyed parts of city of women but it was hard to get hooked into the story","621":"gillham provides the reader with an interesting look at 1940s berlin the story is quite compelling and highly suspenseful my only criticism is the number of typos grammatical errors throughout the book","622":"amazing a page turner with brilliant writing that transports the reader to war torn and bomb blasted berlin during the heart of wwii it is a city of women whose lives are challenged in ways we can't imagine and whose days are measured in dread fear and individual strength suspenseful intense highly recommend","623":"sorry just wan't for me sigrid was unlikable in a harsh cold way the dialogue was stilted and the sex scenes were awkward not even including the several times male characters got a kick out of placing sigrid's hand on their erections plus and i'm not sure here but i think it might be a bit harder to have sex in a movie theater seat something involving very skinny people who wouldn't take up too much room in the seat and one of them having very flexible knees than the author made out i wanted to like this book because of the perspective of the good german but i'd recommend stones from the river or the book thief over this unpleasant effort","624":"i actually considered giving this book a 5 and still would like it to have a 4 5 the writing style and story line seriously took me back to 1943 berlin pulling me deeper and deeper into the question what would you do a philosophical issue debated by my freshmen history students each year sigrid is such a fascinating character so utterly human so full of frailty and ultimately so easy to identify with","625":"didn't feel compelled to finish it","626":" i found the book slow but it had to build into the novel all details and factual data it is what i call 'a book to read to wake you up' it's not a real 'entertainer' but it definately refreshes your history yes it's a novel but i met with the author with my book group he did a thorough research on this book and he's been to berlin at least twice he knows his stuff the main thrust of the book that the author wants everyone to get is what would you do if you were in this extrordinary time what decisions would you make it was a 'get out of my box read' it made me think and go back to a time that was impossible to live during the war in berlin and the germans and all the horrid experiences that jewish had to endure","627":"just an extraordinary novel if you ever wondered what life was like in berlin in 1943 this book should give you a good idea definitely worth searching out and reading","628":" ok so we know from the book flaps that probably there will be some hiding of jews right in berlin under hitler's nose there will be shortages of all kinds from food and clothing to news the gestapo will be everywhere and sure enough there are the first 2 3s of the book isn't bad it moves quickly good research sets the mood but i felt the author was following the usual wwii formula for novels if you can make it through that you will be rewarded with some twists what if someone who thought they were helping really wasn't accidentally or on purpose i didn't quite get all the names and action at the end of who had papers for where and it was confusing for a city of women there were quite a few men most of them were very unlikeable my favorite part was near the beginning where older women were turning on each other i really hoped the mother in law would play a bigger role","629":"this book was really interesting as it showed what people were doing to survive and help others in germany at the time i felt this book was very shocking and raw at points and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 16 17 as it's quite sexual and violent at parts the ending i felt was a bit meh and i realised i hadn't had any strong attachment to the characters and for that reason i give it 3 5 stars","630":"started out good but i was a little annoyed by the main character by the end","631":"this book managed to surprise me i like the twist i like the historical backdrop i always like books that teach me historical facts","632":"this book was a really good thought provoking read while being thoroughly entertaining as well i could hardly wait to turn the page it started out slowly and i even considered abandoning it at one point early on but i'm really glad i stuck with it the writing is realistic not flowery it made me ask the question what would i do","633":"4 5 stars a very interesting story","634":"really enjoyed this book as it was from a german perspective most of the wwii historical fiction i've read deal with the jewish story understandably would definitely recommend","635":"an enjoyable enough read but my unanswered questions along with a mediocre ending have rendered this one a 3","636":"just when i think i've read every kind of war fiction there comes something new this book was fresh and painful to read at the same time but the women left in berlin when all the men had been sent to the russian front embody every kind of feminine tragedy human tragedy","637":" in berlin germany set against a dark and foreboding background during the last part of wwii we meet sigred shroder the wife of kasper who is anazi officer fighting on the russian front while she tries to survive in a city inhabited mostly of women she lives in a world of hatred and suspicion where people are turning in their neighbors to the gestapo for unfaithful behavior to the regime making it impossible for anyone to be trusted or believed in the midst of this horror she consumed by the grief of the child she miscarried and loved from the beginning of conception in spite of disappointment of an unfulfilled and loveless marriage she has all the appearances of a good german wife as she takes on her jewish lover housing and food is in short supply and sigred lives in an apartment with her disgruntled and extremely hard to get along with mother in law soon she meets a neighbor and it is revealed that she is hiding jews in her attic and sigred is astonished this is when sigred has to make some extremely hard choices about how she is going to respond should she turn away or help hide the jews to save them from execution from here the novel rapidly unfolds with suspense and surprises around every corner this is david r gillham's debut novel and he has brilliantly told the story of a german woman's plight and choices in 1943 berlin i listened to this on audio and the narrater did a very good job with authenticity of german accents i would recommend it on audio for anyone who likes to listen to a novel being read i am looking forward to more of this author's novels","638":"i thought the book did what it set out to do quite well depict ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances the thriller aspect may have been a bit overdone but it kept me enthralled till the end","639":"i like books with story lines about wwii this one was different from others i have read because the main characters were women all the german men were fighting and berlin became a city of women there were a lot of twists and turns but i found it to be a little confusing a lot of names people places etc i don't know maybe i was losing interest or perhaps would have liked it better another time still worth the read","640":"it took more than 200 pages for the story to really get going but once it did it was a runaway train there were also a couple of characters that struck me more as stereotypes than full round characters and near the end there were a couple of plot points that came out of nowhere and could have used more foreshadowing or foundation earlier in the story","641":"i loved this book it was very interesting","642":"a very good look at a troubled time clear depiction of what humans do when pushed to the brink i found myself wondering how i would have survived there were a few parts that dragged a little but in all a great read","643":" i really enjoyed this book it did start slow we have a woman who was in love with her husband and they grow apart she has an affair it is wwii berlin she goes to and from work and through her life seeing nothing noting nothing just another day even if she sees a jewish woman pushed off a bus because she is not allowed to ride the only outlet is her affair she is a complicated woman who is convinced that she should help jews and others being targeted by the nazis she knows the risks her lover is jewish and a traitor to other jews why did they make those choices the girl who gets ingrid involved in saving people gets pregnant 1940s berlin what choice does she make there is so much more to the story and worth finding out","644":"i found myself absorbed by the many layered characters in this convincing work of historical fiction who we are is partially determined by the time and place in which we live this book has me wondering if i have had the courage and insight of the main character while i would like to believe that i would be so insightful and brave i am not sure that i would have been","645":"4 stars very good different side to the war would read more by this author","646":" i wanted to love this book about berlin during wwii but in the end i just liked it i felt that there were so many facets of the story that could have been taken farther and one facet which maybe should have been dialed back a bit the sex scenes what is it with men and their inability to make a sex scene sound like anything more than an animalistic act and what did any of these scenes add to the story not necessary anyway a good read but not my favorite book about this time period worth a glance","647":" although not as elegantly written as a constellation of vital phenomena this book takes on many of the same issues berlin in 1943 is a city with very few men and the ones that remain are either gestapo or crippled war veterans or jews in hiding as the women are beginning to realize that germany is losing the war they must make difficult decisions to save their families their honor and survive the nightly bombings sigrids change from an apathetic hausfrau to an underground smuggler and jew rescuer is an important study in personal responsibility and conscience","648":"i really enjoyed the strong women characters in this book the story is not as compelling as say the book thief but the characters are what give this book oomph i would definitely love to hear the continuation of sigrid's and ericha's stories","649":"berlin 1943 rescuing jews who are being hunted by the gestapo and having affairs with available men this book was discussed by the library's book discussion group and they are going to have a skype discussion with the author on tuesday apparently some of the women in the discussion group were not so happy with all the sex in the book but i thought it was an integral part of the story and it would have been impossible to tell the story without it","650":"city of women set in 1943 berlin slowly reveals the character and complexities of sigrid schroder a seemingly ordinary hausfrau whose husband works in a bank like so many other women in berlin she is trying to cope with the hardships of life during war after her husband is sent to the front but underneath this facade is a a woman whose passionate nature dictates many of the choices she will make the novel is complex and centers on the passions motivations strengths and betrayals of the women in the city with the male characters in the background the depiction of berlin and its inhabitants 1943 berlin is compelling","651":" this book is a slow starter but it is so worth it in the end berlin has become a city of women the men all at the front or pretty much buddy buddy with the gestapo the backbiting and theivery and constant bombing has everyone pretty much ready to snap in the middle of this is a woman whose husband went to the front leaving her with her meddling mother in law one day at the cinema a young girl begs her to say they came together even though they did not and her life changes from that moment on a mix of confusing flashbacks comes together in a very strong denouement an ending i didn't see coming","652":"fabulous i could not put it down","653":"i'm in this phase of reading about the role of women in nazi germany both as survivors and as saboteurs this work of fiction and true story 'a train in winter' are must reads","654":"wanted to like it more than i actually did too bad","655":"wow i had no idea what to expect with this book another book about war torn germany another love story another story of unrequited love yadda yadda yadda but i was blown away by the characters the plot the suspense the setting...all unexpected it really is a story to make you think what would i do in a similar situation there are no idyllic characters all are very flawed all struggle with morality all are very human which ones do you like which ones can you forgive don't be deceived by the cover art or the title or the description of the story on the back it's not chick lit this is a book that i will think about for a while","656":"every event has two or more sides i had never considered wwii from a german woman's perspective i was fascinated fast exciting read","657":"great book wonderful characters i felt like i was there","658":" this story is set in 1943--the height of the second world war--and berlin has essentially become a city of women sigrid schroder is at the center of this story a women who on the surface seems like the model german soldier's wife but she finds herself pulled into a different world when she rescues a neighbors duty year girl from the gestapo she becomes a keeper of secrets both her own and others her involvement in the jewish issue and helping u boats escape may cost her everything this is a page turner and a great story i loved the characters and felt that sigrid was a perfect hub for the story to work through her interaction with each character carried the story forward and gave it depth i thought about this book long after i was finished the author asks us the question what would we be willing to do to help a stranger would it change your life","659":"not in the mood for reviewing but it was excellent listened on cd and it kept me intrigued","660":" it took me a long time after finishing this book to write my review that's because there were things i disliked about it rather intensely - such as the graphic description of sigrid who's married having sex with a stranger in a darkened movie theater however there is much to recommend city of women specifically i liked the way gillham unfolds sigrid coming awake to the reality of jews' fates as hitler intensifies his agenda to eradicate them from berlin the best part of this book - in addition to the cloak and dagger who can be trusted stuff - is sigrid becoming her own person apart from the influences of her dreadful mother in law her racist colleague and her done with life husband even in the midst of war gillham effectively captures what it must be like to live in a desperate city where people must always guard themselves from countrymen as much as from the wartime enemy fear and suspicion are constant companions while most seem to believe the only way to survive is to avert their eyes and be as invisible as possible sigrid becomes a woman who risks everything even though she doesn't have to to help jews survive her transition which gillham develops believably and commendably is the highlight of the book","661":"you can read my review at http www thereportergroup org artic","662":"was a little slow to start but once i became immersed in the world gillham has created and the lives of the characters i found the story incredibly moving poignant and fast past not to mention the twists and turns it definitely shined a light on a world and a perspective that isn't usually shown the lives of berliners during the war","663":" it was a page turner and i enjoyed the first 2 3 but the relentless grimness pacing and my annoyance with sigrid's blindness about egon eventually made me finish the book just to have done with it many characterizations to me seemed false or women written from a man's pov sort of fantasy of women not anyone i know characters i found more believable were left drifting away finally i became bored then irritated by all the place naming ok i got it you did your research but a little of the strasse's go a long way","664":" an extraordinarily well written and well developed story of a good german wife living in wartime berlin and how the war changes her we watch as sigrid's life changes through shades of grey and she begins to make decisions she would never have previously dreamed of this story is an account of what one woman might have done but will make you wonder about how you might have behaved under similar conditions a great look at ordinary people in circumstances they are in no way prepared for i expect this will end up as a movie at some stage","665":" i really enjoyed this book it evoked a real sense of a bleak grey berlin and its people trying to survive during war none of the characters were particularly likable but their stories were totally engrossing at the end of the book the author speaks about the book asking the reader 'what would you do ' and i think he was totally successful in achieving that aim city of women was one of those books that kept me awake at night thinking about how i would live in such circumstances and how much my sense of morality is a result of the comfortable time place i live in","666":" also focused on the ravages of war this novel is set in wwii berlin as it is becoming clear at least to some that hitler's promises of a glorious victory are neither achievable nor glorious british bombing raids are routine and more inconvenient than demoralizing far less treacherous than daily life among family friends neighbours and strangers in whose presence an incautious word may be deadly very insightful portrayal of life on the home front as equally devastating if not more so than the front lines where at least one's enemy is clear","667":"this had a fascinating plot idea berlin in wwii with most of the men off to war but the main character never became likable even when she eventually embraces selflessness and heroism without a clear motivation for her change the sexual liaisons every 50 pages or so seemed meaningless and designed to titillate rather than show any kind of intimacy this just seemed flat despite the interesting history woven throughout","668":"a different perspective of wwll","669":" honestly fantastic there were so many intertwining twists and turns catchers mischlings betrayals it just got better and better the novel as a whole made me consider what is actually good and what is actually bad despite society's definitions especially in nazi germany the biggest lesson stand up for what you genuinely believe in the author is a supporter of my history page and i believe that he carried out a great amount of research to get the atmosphere historically accurate another plus","670":"at first i found the novel a bit turgid with its characters uniformly unlikeable u0026amp unconvincing however midway through the book i became more engaged u0026amp ultimately enjoyed what is not at all a happy story set as it is in berlin late in world war ii when the myths are crumbling u0026amp all too brutal reality gets harder u0026amp harder to ignore the female protagonist ultimately must choose to engage with that reality","671":"i dragged my feet to start this book i was pleasantly surprised at how engaging of a story city of woman is wwii berlin comes alive with many shades of grey lots of twists and turns and even some men to have affairs with i give it a thumbs up","672":" very good book about berlin in 1943 when all the men were in the war and the city was full of women the main character lives with her mother in law and works as a typist while her husband is fighting in hitler's siege against russia she's basically numb until a young woman asks for her help during a police questioning and she slowly becomes involved with an operation to protect and transfer jews the author says he's always been captivated by people's roles during difficult historic periods as have i wondering what i would have done","673":"thought this book was very intriguing characters well developed u0026amp i like historical fiction","674":"incredible story about flawed heros heroines in nazi germany","675":"i am always drawn to wwii historical fiction so a book about the german home front sounded intriguing i did enjoy the plot an everyday berlin wife becoming involved in hiding jews from the gestapo the problem i had was that i didn't actually like any of the characters which for me is pretty crucial in loving a novel","676":"i was disappointed with the ending","677":"the secret life of women in nazi germany during the final years of the second world war lightly sprinkled with contemporary german berliner words if you don't know german the meaning is clear from context mostly the german look a furtive semi involuntary look to either side checking for eavesdroppers i read a review copy from the publisher","678":"sigrid was a bit hard to take at first but the story was very engaging an especially great audiobook 3 5 for me","679":"this book stayed with me for several weeks after i finished reading it i found my self thinking about it while grocery shopping for filling the tank in my car i guess it left me with a lot to think about i had never read any fiction set in germany during the nazi regime and this book gave me a glimpse of what day to day life in berlin was like during those hellish years i can honestly say this book has spurred me seek out other books set during this period and to learn more about this time via well written fiction i think david r gillham is a good writer who may even become great the plot in this book was interesting more so than some of the characters he offered there were times when i felt the writing was a bit uneven but it did not deter me from moving forward i was indeed riveted at times and i guess that says it all","680":"great story page turner","681":" not sure the main character sigrid's persona hung together convincingly - does her huge capacity for empathy rhyme with her emotionally disturbing childhood with seemingly far too little affection and worth her ongoing starvation for sex her presence of mind in all situations and powers of self reflection the first 10 or so reviews on goodreads are written by women maybe the word 'women' in the title scared off male readers highly readable story made me feel i was looking over somebody's shoulder seeing 1943 berlin streets and interiors sensing sigrid's fear when she is being followed her doubts about who she can trust gives a convincing picture of certain aspects of how jews were helped or betrayed how complicated it all was though that's only a part of it perhaps more space was allotted to situations and relationships not involving jews good in how people relate to each other--mother in law with daughter in law husband and wife woman and lovers neighbors who do not trust each other \"who do you trust \" asks the book cover well the decision seems to be based on a sixth sense the publishers blurb on goodreads says \"whom do you trust whom do you love...\" but the penguin edition has what i find much more comfortable \"who do you trust who do you love...\" - modern english has largely moved beyond whom the meager awful food dried up potatoes is mentioned many times but little is done with that i could not taste the bad food and there's no indication that the main characters are weakened or ill in any way because of the food but ok you can't get everything into the book interestingly given the title it seems there are more male characters in this book than female and their roles are certainly as prominent as those of the women the book did not make me feel like wartime berlin was a 'city of women' a 'page turner' with suspense and lots of action yet with a large component of 'psychology'","682":"some of the characters weren't well developed but overall it was a pretty good story","683":" 3 5 stars berlin is the city of women in 1943 mothers wives and girlfriends of men fighting for germany these women lead a bleak existence enduring rationing and incessant bombings by the british and living in fear of the gestapo those who do not bear proper allegiance to the fatherland are suspect and there are many who would turn in another to gain favor with the gestapo the story revolves around sigrid a pretty young woman who works at a patent office and returns home nightly to her difficult mother in law her husband is fighting on the russian front but sigrid's life is much more complicated than it first appears she has a jewish lover and then unexpectedly becomes involved with the messy and dangerous business of hiding jews from the police and anyone else who might turn them in who can she trust this book a page turner and the suspense builds gradually but steadily towards the eventual climax the author does a wonderful job of evoking the setting atmosphere of 1943 berlin i could easily see this book as a movie","684":" this was a really well written book i believe it it has heart gillham clearly put a lot of thought into it i would recommend it to my friends actually this was a recommendation however i have a few complaints since a man did write a book about women i expect several stereotypes however i really hoped that he would not rely on stereotypes to create this novel since it is a great concept i wanted more nuance from the women and not just the stereotyped women the sex crazed unhappy housewifethe terrible mother in lawthe slutty friendthe women appear to be objects being used by men and of course their bodies are used for the good of the jews i cannot help but notice that in the middle of the war all these women can think about is sex however i did appreciate kasper's version of events regarding sex during the war in addition in the final scenes of the novel the protection of jews played out like a game and it didn't suit well with me at all overall good book","685":"the setting was world war two in berlin this was a very interesting and fast paced book about the smuggling of people products hiding jews infidelities interpersonal conflicts with more sex than the plot needed to keep it interesting brutal but very interesting","686":"this novel is undoubtedly well written it features a gritty bleak landscape making the horrors of the holocaust all too evident add to that the indifference and general surly nature of our heroine scratch that the majority of the characters and city of women reads like a finely tuned 1940s noir film kudos to the author for resisting the urge to manipulate us into if not liking at very least sympathizing with our leads we the reader are left to draw our own opinions and for that i'm grateful and now the drawbacks for each positive there was an equal and obvious negative while the author's literary mastery is evident i felt the storytelling took a hit a excellent example of style over substance i also can't help but wonder if somewhere along the line an editor asked mr gillham to beef up the story what else could explain the overuse and i do mean prolific overuse of terms like german glance and gnadige frau this was not only annoying but distracting overall it's a mixed bag","687":"set in berlin during the second world war the wife of a german soldier trying to survive in a besieged city finds herself questioning her marriage her morals u0026amp her country's laws her choices mean life or death for many who become dependent on her for survival who to trust who to love who to go to for help this is a fascinating tale that surprises at every turn","688":"maybe 3 5 if i'm feeling generous i don't think it is all it was hyped up to be although the fact that everyone was morally flawed was a nice change","689":"really a four star well written fleshed out characters but the subject matter wwii in germany was difficult to read as always sigrid is a german wife living with her mil while her husband kaspar is fighting she gets involved with a jewish man and also caught up with helping hide jews from the gestapo","690":"i enjoy world war ii historical fiction so i enjoyed the story it's fast paced and full of air raids ration shortages and schemes to hide jews the main character is a woman named sigrid strong independent and brave this novel isn't a work of literary art but i found the story to be very interesting even though it's very difficult and sad to read novels about how the jews were unjustly targeted one reads about women like sigrid even if fictitious who tried to save the jews from the atrocities that were being committed towards them during that period and it somehow restores one's faith in humanity","691":" this novel is set in 1943 in berlin sigrid is a middle class german woman married to a kaspar a man she is no longer sure she loves kaspar worked in a bank before he was drafted to the eastern front sigrid became involved with a man she met in the cinema a man whose story both intrigues her and angers her he is a jew but she hasn't seen him lately when the girl ericha assigned as mother's help for her downstairs neighbour asks her for an alibi she becomes interested in ericha and what she is up to when the new neighbour across the hall turns out to be the wife of a high ranking officer sigrid finds herself drawn to the woman's sister and brother with everyone having secrets and with the stories they tell about themselves covering their secrets sigrid finds herself with more and more secrets of her own she must make choices and puts herself in danger as she moves forward with a life helping others a great homefront war story centered on an ordinary german woman who begins to find herself in more and more extraordinary situations i really enjoyed this read","692":"very intense and dark after all it's berlin toward the end of ww2 loads of atmosphere gillham builds the tension until you're flying through the pages to see how it turns out","693":"i seldom abandon a book but this was depressing it's a fictional account of women's lives in wartorn berlin although well written the book is an exploration of the sordid side of life albebit based on things that actually occurred i probably would have discovered redemptive value had i continued but i began to feel that reading this was a waste of my time","694":"totally over hyped","695":"i found this book lacking in complexity the author took a basic framework of german women and their experiences during the war but did not make the plot particularly robust there were sections that really were well developed but most of the book was simple and ho hum something i find bewildering given his cast of characters and historical background nonetheless i did garnish enjoyment from the read and satisfaction i receive from reading historical fiction","696":"city of women is a troubling book the author has used his screen writing training to re create berlin of 1943 a city of shadows destruction hunger and death he also creates ordinary people trying to survive and being forced to make choices amid the debris of bombs nazis the gestapo battles and the final solution sigrid the main character is not very likable at the beginning of the book nor are most of the characters there is a hard selfish side to them perhaps it is their way of surviving gillham draws his people with an objective pen as if they are on the silver screen and we are watching them we see their actions and reactions but must understand them through observation rather than long subjective passages in the first chapter sigrid is approached at the cinema by an acquaintance asking her to vouch for her to the gestapo agent following her with this request sigrid reluctantly steps into the underground and all of its dangers the story line involves other characters with shadowy stories but as with sigrid's character we can only observe them not ever really knowing any of them well the duplicity of all of their lives the risks and uncertainties of life in berlin will either redeem those living there or destroy them gillham has written a thriller in the vein of alan furst he recreates the lost city of wartime berlin leading us through her dark dangerous streets onto the bannhof into the air raid shelters and even to the zoo he takes us into the dangers of the underground the attempts to save lives by a network of strangers it is a gripping book well worth reading","697":"one of the best books i have read in a long time","698":"very good suspenseful and foreboding great sense of claustrophobia and paranoid fear","699":"i like historical fiction that teaches me something i didn't know about a place or a time period if that isn't done then the story or characters need to be well developed enough to make the period inconsequential didn't feel as though this book did either i never felt like i got to know the main character well enough to understand the choices she makes and the other characters seemed to come from a small selection of cookie cutters","700":"in city of women our main character sigrid juggles and struggles with two lovers a husband her nettlesome mother in law a bitchy boss brown cabbage and shitty smokes all theses things are going down in berlin during world war ii well i don't want to give away what goes down but the writer kept me reading to the end and i did not have to push myself for the completion of this book","701":"this book was well written depicting time and place and deep characterization however it was totally depressing","702":"i am not sure if my reaction to this book was fair to it or if perhaps it was just the wrong book at the wrong time for me these are the very lazy hot days of summer in the desert i'd overdosed on very light reads and decided to try to find something more thought provoking so last week i read the paris architect and found its brutality so jarring that i should have known not to follow up with another story of nazi terror i can't blame david r gillham for my pain in facing historical facts but i am sufficiently aware of the painful period that i needed something very special to happen in the book to keep me committed this didn't happen to me the one aspect of city of women that impressed me was the author's very effective use of berlin as a character the city has a personality a presence moods and a genuine feeling of menace in contrast the paris architect could have taken place in any sophisticated european city under occupation the author didn't bother to give paris a personality or a sense of place gillham conversely did a superb job of placing his reader on the streets of berlin in the shelters in the movie theatres that seemed to exclusively play german propaganda films and in the homes of war weary and frightened people city of women would will probably make a wonderful film and for me may have been a much better book on a different day","703":"really enjoyed this book different from other books i have read about germany during ww ii as i listened to this book on discs i found it very dramatic it helps when the performer reading the book is indeed a good actor","704":"3 stars for this book when i started it i could not get into it although the writing was done well no over emphasis of detail as other writers struggle with it just seemed bland however around page 200 it starts picking up and for the remainder of the book i was hooked possible spoiler the end of the book wrapped up almost everything but there were a few people who just got discarded from the conclusion all that said it was a good look into exactly how it was in germany during this time and i found it a very interesting read","705":" i mostly read this because all the details of berlin felt like i was revisiting it i loved being able to picture the different landmarks although many have changed since 1943 but the overall mood and feel of the city portrayed in this book is much like i remember it things like the sound of hard soled shoes on the sidewalks the smell of cigarette smoke in frosty air the clump of climbing stairs to a flat the sway of the trains even the crusty direct manner of the people rang true it truly felt like i was in berlin again","706":"started off a little slow but got better after about 100 pages 4 out of 5 stars","707":"this book is set in berlin during wwii the main character sigrid becomes connected to the war through her soldier husband jewish lover and a young friend she meets in a movie theater this story describes the trials and tribulations that germans experienced on the homefront gillham is a talented author who offers a different perspective of life during wwii","708":" this is another book that stayed on my currently reading list much longer than the norm it didn't hook me early on but once i came back to it i found that the later chapters were faster paced and more compelling though the author poses the question what would you do how would you react in the face of a nation gone mad really i felt as though he strayed too often into the sexual proclivities of the main character i'm pretty sure that i'm not a prude i just don't need sexual interludes to keep me interested in a book","709":"wonderfulthis book was great the history was accurate it was realistic truly a wonderful book i got it as a monthly deal but i would have gladly paid full price","710":"for me this book was really in between 3 and 4 stars i liked the second half much better i don't have any talent for writing reviews especially without giving the story away if any of my friends have read let me know as i have questions about this book","711":"excellent describes the survival of women during wwii","712":" when i lived in germany for a year in the late '60s my landlady told me stories about taking potato peelings to the polish prisoners at night and how grateful they were as a devout catholic she felt suppression of her church and her beliefs she talked about displaying the old german flag on a german holiday and how proud she was of her father her husband lost his right leg on the russian front he did not share much about his service but seemed to distain the current german and american military we were soldiers it was very easy for me to visualize the people and places the author and i saw the same germany and the same german people there was sexual content and some violence some people might have wanted more the real story was the complex relationships that existed in that terrible time trust vs distrust people livng as unobtrusively as they could and still faced with making incredible choices as others have said this would make an excellent movie i did not try to guess the ending and i don't think i could have it was a complete surprise excellently done","713":" i loved and enjoyed this book i love historical novels especially when they take place in the ww2 era it was so easy to forget that while the character was female this book was with by a man easy to forget i was able to plant myself in sigrid's place this story flowed that beautifully and i rarely place spoilers in reviews so i won't start now however i will say this this book has a bit of mystery romance like all war time books it's very sad the things people had to do just to survive the choices they had to make the choices they took from others just to live another day is horrifying and i found myself thinking of what i would do if found in any of these characters positions so this book is a five star i'm so glad i grabbed when i did","714":"loved the atmosphere and a point of view i've never read about before that of a german housewife during the war but the ending seemed farfetched and quite perplexing","715":"intense compelling a finely written intricately plotted novel that made my heart race highly recommended","716":"hauntingly beautiful depiction of what berlin must have been like for the women left behind in war it is a powerful as the book thief sigrid stumbles day to day to her mundane job putting up with her less than friendly mother in law and going to the cinema to see her secret lover which seems to be the only release from the monotony of berlin during world war ii her husband is on the eastern front and all that is left in her building is a misfit group of women and wounded men all of whom live in fear of not coming across as a good party member finding enough food and surviving the bombings sigrid is very good at keeping secrets others and her own and we see her life change drastically as she begins to trust a young woman au pair and get pulled deeper and deeper into a world of lies she is not perfect none of the women in the book are and must decide whom to trust and how much truth to give up the characters we hate we begin to understand and love while the characters we love we begin to mistrust and feel betrayed this book will be a book club selection for years to come due to the masterful writing and depth of characters a fantastic debut for david r gillham i was lucky enough to receive an arc copy but have already ordered a copy for the library","717":"what a fantastic adventure really recommend this book not what you would expect","718":" in 1943 during the heart of world war ii in berlin the capital of nazi germany sigrid schroder is pretending to be the perfect wife of a nazi soldier going to her job as a stenographer each day returning to her apartment every night to cook up whatever food she has been able to buy with strict rationing sigrid though also has a secret in the middle of the day at lunchtime movie matinees in a darkened theater she meets her lover a jewish man when her lover disappears sigrid finds herself entangled in the underworld network of people helping jewish people in hiding in berlin and attempting to smuggle them out as her watchful mother in law starts asking questions and as a high ranking ss officer moves into the apartment down the hall how long can sigrid go without being discovered and denounced","719":"although it begins slowly this becomes a page turner of a novel set in 1943 berlin the book's main character is a good german housewife who tries to remain ignorant to the atrocities going on around her but finds she cannot continue to do so she and the other characters are morally complex often in troubling ways and i found myself alternately cheering her on and disliking her but this made for a more interesting read both the characters and plot are strengths of the novel my main criticism the sex scenes could be a bit too ayn rand ish for my taste and the main character's obsession with her lover a bit too harlequin otherwise an excellent read ps amy einhorn books really needs to invest more in proofreading admittedly the copy i had was from the first print run but there was still a distracting number of typos","720":" i picked this up because the idea of a city filled with women because most of the men were off at war appealed to me that the city was berlin was also a different setting that the women were german was also different from the other world war ii era books i've read initially i was not completely drawn into sigrid's story i had a hard time reconciling the woman i was getting to know with her feelings for egon in no way did his character appeal to me but that's part of the story despite my feelings of revulsion for him egon was integral to sigrid's release and her growth gillham posits the question in his afterward what would you do and that's what i found myself thinking throughout well paced vivid characters makes you think","721":"this book was tense unpredictable and definitely riveting it did have me constantly asking myself what i would do if i were put in the situations of the characters the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because it was so depressing i had a hard time falling asleep every night after i read a few pages","722":"i couldn't put this novel down historically very interesting this novel made me stop many times to ponder what it would have been like to be in sigrid's position what would i have done or to be in frau weiss' position hiding herself and her children in a closet for weeks on end surviving on a bit of this and that a great read","723":"i really wanted to give this more stars than this because so much of the book is so well written the mood and pace is simply excellent it involves a female protagonist living in berlin during the second world war she's a good german but even as a child she liked to break the rules though not too much as an adult she finds herself bending the rules more and more and we like her try to figure out where the limits are breaking the rules in nazi berlin is a dangerous occupation and the tension and the dark mood of this novel grow in a wonderful way i enjoyed this aspect very much and found myself reading bits of the book on my smart phone while sanding in line at places because i was so engrossed ultimately though it's impossible not to carry along with the reading the knowledge that even though the story focuses on sigrid a woman the author is a man every woman in this novel with possibly one or two minor exceptions falls into one of 3 categories 1 beautiful and highly sexual 2 an embittered hateful hausfrau or a tough lesbian sorry that's a major flaw and a major disappointment when the writing is so beautiful and the story pretty compelling and to top it off with all those sexually active women there is not a whole lot of sex happening on screen hell if i have to suffer the stereotype at least give me a few sweaty scenes all in all though i would read something by this author again though i think a male pov would be safer","724":"good story but a little difficult to follow in the beginning plot slow at first but picks up as events unfold holding your interest to the end","725":"this was a very suspenseful book about berlin during 1943 there were lots of twists and turns along with the usual suspects whom would you trust and what would you do given the same circumstances","726":"this is an exciting book with all the fear and suspicion of hitler's berlin during wwii it follows sigrid who is dragged unwillingly into a situation that changes her life for better or worse it was very well written with the action keeping the book moving forward at a steady pace but not so fast that your head is spinning i received this book for free from goodreads first reads","727":"the idea of this book has great potential life in berlin during wwii when most of the men are gone what do the women do how they survive how they help jews and others being persecuted etc sadly though it falls short the characters did not draw me in and i found the sub stories stumbling over themselves lacking clarity and creating a hope for the end of the book i'd pass on this one","728":"1943 berlin becomes the setting for a real tear jerker of a soap opera sex is everywhere both the rough sort and the solo but no one is happy sigrid is busy with her dead end job and life with mother in law while hubby is fighting on the eastern front she makes the acquaintance of a little snippet who works as a mother's helper in their apartment building who subsequently involves sigrid in the savory business of hiding jews from the nazis sigrid drowns her sorrows in sex first with a nasty jew with a nasty history then with a suave yet crippled soldier man no one is happy or satisfied i would have enjoyed the story more if sigrid had had more character all of her whingeing became tedious and her air of martyrdom rang falsehowever as a beach read for the depressive set this wasn't half bad3 stars this was a net galley","729":"it is a really hard book to get into in the beginning don't put it down somewhere in the middle it does get interesting there are events that happened during the ww2 era that will shock you some things i read i had never heard before it is a sad story but worth the read the characters are very strong in this book and they really stand out","730":"city of women is one of the best books i've ever read i read it while i was in the hospital and couldn't put it down the novel takes place in berlin near the end of world war two the germans are losing the war but continue to post propaganda that makes them look like heroes a young wife sigrid shroder lives with her malicious mother in law as she waits for the return of her husband she no longer loves from the russian front she has a part time job that leaves her time to go to the movies here she begins a passionate affair with a jewish man who's on the run she also befriends a young woman working in her apartment house who is helping people escape from germany sigrid gets involved and wonders if a young woman and her two daughters the group is hiding are her lover's family sigrid's husband returns wounded and surprises her by reenlisting she gets involved with two sisters and a brother who live in her building everyone has a secret no one is as he or she appears some people are willing to help her when she least expects it and others she loves commit terrible deeds though danger is everywhere sigrid continues to do what she believes is right a fast paced novel you won't forget","731":"this is a very hard book to review it took me a while to get into the story but about 50 pages in i started to really enjoy it there were also a lot of typos that ticked me off because they were frequent and obvious not to mention some blatant inconsistencies like having the main character agree to a 7 00 meeting with someone and then five pages later she is somewhere else at the time and then somehow makes it to the 7 00 meeting with the person she agreed to meet on time how is she in two places at once so frustrating that was just an example by the way despite all of this i was ready to give the book four stars because i was really enjoying the story and liked the characters sigrid carrin wolfram and ericha i found sigrid both entertaining and likable and i enjoyed her sarcasm i also liked the setting of the book berlin during the 1940's however i can't give this book four stars because of the last 50 pages or so it seemed as though the author was trying to wrap everything up took quickly and at that point things started to become unbelievable","732":"kept me on the edge of my seat loved it","733":"love the writing style in this story the tension begins in the first page and doesn't let up","734":"berlin during world war ii is the city of women referred to in the title it's the story of how different people react to poverty persecution and the jewish question it's a book that constantly makes you think of what you would have done when faced with such choices of rescue and basic humanity","735":"i love reading about life during wwii this book helped me appreciate the lives of the german women in berlin and the very difficult decisions they had to make","736":"i did not want this book to end left me with many unanswered questions","737":"i liked this book not loved it the first 80 pages were very slow moving but then the pace picked up and it became more exciting a lot of the german names of places were confusing to me i just enjoy reading about the wwii period and this book was written from a different angle all together what the writer had to say in the afterword really made me think","738":"i enjoyed this book written from a different perspective the german female during wwii i didn't love the protagonist sigrid she had low moral standards but i will give her credit for her courage","739":"read an uncorrected proof for this book checked out from the library and found i didn't want to put it down berlin in 1943 is not my usual reading favorite but i was intrigued by the characters and the story development highly recommend","740":"a beautiful novel that broke my heart and made me angry but still gave me hope that there will always be good people in this world it asks the question 'what would you do' i thought it was fantastic","741":"just finished this book and the layers developed in the main characters of sigrid and erica were compelling the author did a great job of layering with all characters even the horrible mother in law had some evidence of human feelings towards the end the male characters egon and her husband took some twists through the book as well i do not enjoy many books about the holocaust but this did bring to light some humanity in a horrible time","742":"this book follows sigrid as she comes around to the idea that life isn't the order she believes it is in berlin in the second world war i don't normally read books set in this time period but this one seemed a bit different than the usual books as it foolws mainly the lives of the women left behind when all the men are off fighting sigrid becomes part of the underground getting jews and others out of the city and tells of the difficulty this is when trying to get even the basics to all these people the book draws you in and i found it a hard one to put down the author discribes the era so well the characters are all wonderful as well i loved how sigrid became attached to the people around her it made her more human the difficulties all these people were living with was just so bad always terrified of the gestapo always knowing how easy it was to get caught but having to help all these people anyway i can recommend this book if you have a love of historical fiction for this time period","743":"staggering extraordinary exhilarating in the darkest of times berlin 1946 in the most hellish circumstances this story comes alive in stunning characters i will carry this one in my mind for a long time","744":"berlin 1943 full of suspense","745":"first thoughts a little bit too long some creepy sex scenes but overall really quite good review to come","746":" city of women chronicles the daily life and hard choices faced by women left in berlin during wwii while the men are away fighting the war i found if difficult to relate to or like most of the characters in this book but their stories were compelling then again i am not currently thrust into extraordinary times as these women were the writing is sensual and draws you in immediately the author evoked the city underground activities and bomb scares well lust and secrets are constant players in the plot sigrid works at the patent office takes care of her difficult mother in law and tries to keep food in the house back stories about her marriage and youth fill us in on her character although a strong person she seems morally fractured and personally conflicted i found the relationship between sigrid and ericha fascinating it is tenuous but grows closer as the novel progresses we learn much about sigrid from ericha who accuses her of not talking about her husband who is at the front and wonders about sigrid's motives erica has the moral high ground and shames sigrid into helping her cause \"convince yourself that there is nothing you can do as the police drag their victims from their beds \" the trust ericha places in sigrid is unsettling but ultimately brings forth sigrid's protectiveness","747":" there are always two sides to a story in germany during world war ii the citizens left in the cities mainly women were fed propaganda which they did not always think to question if the leader of your country the person who is supposed to be bound to take action that is in the best interest of all citizens is telling you that one race is scientifically superior to another and that the war is being won there are few people who will question him but one day when you are approached by a young woman for help you have the chance to realize that there is more to the story than what you're being told","748":"good read somewhat predictable very exciting climax","749":"finished this book in 2 days proof positive i loved it i felt i knew every character and was part of their story living it with them","750":"city of women takes place in berlin as wwii nears its end it evolved into a thriller type of book involving smuggling jews out of the country the books centers around one woman sigrid wonder if this really represents the city at the time","751":"this took me a bit to get into and i don't need a fast moving story but once i did i really had a hard time putting it down i love the look inside germany in wwii read the book thief and stones from the river and this was one more layer more about the reluctant not so likable person doing her part","752":" the first couple chapters were slow for me but i slowly got attached to sigrid the book addresses the question of what would you do in nazi germany the main character has spunk and i admire her tenacity she rebels against the required mold of german women and women everywhere she comes alive and independent and does the right thing the raw and direct sex scenes and language may throw a person off initially but today's generation isn't the first to experience passion and sometimes we forget that it actually adds to the story and gives another layer of insight into the characters great book","753":"i loved this book one of my favorites readsin a long time","754":"i found city of women to be on the dark side there were times i found it difficult reading however though it took me a while to finish it it was worthwhile","755":"tore through this in 2 days lots of suspense good depth in the characters and situations that aren't black and white","756":"frankly it lost me the second the man picked her up in the cinema unlikely u0026amp embarrassing the whole love affair was lacking in plausibility u0026amp emotion did he write it for convenience of the rest of the plot","757":" i think if i could i would have given this novel 3 5 stars it reminded me of those who save us by jenna blume an equally morally ambiguous tale set during wwii in germany the choices people make in situations beyond our wildest imagination are easy to judge based on our safety and a black u0026amp white tunnel vision this novel left me thinking wishing to know more of the main character since the novel fully occurs during 1943 in berlin just as the war is shifting in the allies favor despite the axis' denial machine i did not feel a particular kinship to any one character but i did enjoy the book and found that after the first 100 pages it was difficult to part with and i would be interested to see if a sequel is every written","758":"brilliant read the main character sigrid is amazing set in 1943 berlin most of the men are away fighting and the city is left to the women sigrid's husband is at the eastern front whilst sigrid is trying to go to work put up with her unpleasant mother in law queue for food and trying to make the rations last meanwhile there are air raids to contend with and trying not to let the oppression of the nazi regime get you down people getting the bus to work giving up their seats to those who need them more whilst outside jews are being rounded up and beaten would you turn a blind eye berlin is full of mistrust people putting on acts and others informing on their neighbours this book explores 'catchers' ie jews who work for the gestapo searching out other jews however there are reasons why people do this and this book is full of moral situations which make you think how would you behave sigrid is a great character i was not too sure of her at the start however she improves as the story unfolds i could not put it down and the pages wre turning quickly as there are some twists and turns gets you thinking recommend","759":"a 4 5 set in wwii berlin it tells the story of desperate people in desperate times sadly not new material but the characters are extremely well drawn and the story is raw and vivid it certainly makes you wonder what you would have done when faced with such horrific choices","760":"almost 4 stars interesting historical fiction i liked hearing about everyday life during hitler's climb to power heavy and tragic but a great story to read","761":"the book gives a glimpse into the the lives of a few women in berlin as they struggle through the second world war the author poses a question for us what would be your breaking point","762":"a fresh perspective of wwii and the women who are left behind this powerful novel really questions who a person is when truly tested in ways never thought possible","763":"it was okaaaaay i wanted there to be more historical fiction in it it didn't have a lot it was mostly the love story set in 1943 germany between sigrid a bored german housewife and egon a jew on the run sigrid ends up abetting some jews in hiding and i really enjoyed that part the end was full of surprises and intrigue also good but just not enough substance for me","764":"wwii germany fiction","765":"this one was hard to break away to make dinner the choices women made during wwii impossible to comprehend but such a powerful book of right and wrong and all the inbetween","766":"a pretty good cloak and dagger thriller set against the backdrop of wartime berlin my enjoyment was a bit hampered by the absence of any sympathetic characters despite the fact that many of them were involved in saving the lives of entrapped jews the characters are far from noble although this also made for a richer reading experience not quite up to the standards of alan furst but nonetheless a very good read","767":"a city of women is extraordinarily compelling the story takes the reader on a roller coaster ride or to be more precise on a zigzag narrow mountain road full of twists and turns and unexpected encounters along the way it is a sad story and it causes reflection as to what one would do in such circumstances","768":" berlin 1943 most able bodied men are at the front leaving behind a city of women events occur which cause one such hausfrau to question the routine and drabness of her life and her responsibilities as a citizen a neighbor a wife and a human being this is another amy einhorn edited book the help water for elephants the good american so the story moves along the writing is crisp and the characters are shallow ie it is ready to be turned into a screenplay having said that this book takes you to a place you have not been war torn berlin as seen through the eyes of a working woman there are enough plot twists to keep the story interesting this is definitely worth a read","769":" aside from a number of editing mistakes this book was highly enjoyable and kept me on the edge of my seat almost the whole way through i was caught off guard more than once and the characters are so real complex and human i grew very fond and protective of the protagonist sigrid the side characters are incredibly diverse sympathetic and at times horrifying i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to read as the author himself describes it a book about ordinary people who have to make hard choices in extraordinary times and live forever with the consequences of those choices","770":" i loved this book a lot it made me feel as if i was really in 1943 berlin sigrid the main character of this novel through her relationship with her jewish lover and a young lady working in her building comes to learn the horrors of war and help hide people from the nazi's the writing to me had a very cinematic tone in that i could picture the scenes of what was happening through his writing gillham gives you a good sense of what the people living at the time must have felt i kept reading in anticipation of what would happen next it has good mix of love story mystery i didn't think it was too wordy it's something i'd read again one issue though is some obvious typos in the kindle edition which you don't expect from a major publisher","771":"it was recommended but i jjust couldn't get involved in the story just an ok read","772":"one moral dilemma after another the characters are surprising and the plot offers non stop action really really liked this book","773":" it's 1943 in berlin where very few men remain sigrid schroder is the model german soldier's wife she goes to work at the patent office day in day out cares for her obnoxious mil and keeps her head down while trying to ignore all the immoralities of the third reich all this changes when she is confronted by a young girl who asks for her help the characters are multi layered somewhat flawed and totally remarkable very few books address the german individual in germany during the war and what it was like to live there sigrid is forced to make many choices and finds herself in the process ordinary people making choices under extraordinary circumstances how would you react","774":"reads like a good wwii nazi berlin movie if you like books about this era i a do this is a different angle on it","775":" berlin 1943 with virtually all of the men off fighting in the war has become a city of women each navigating as best she can in a world full of hazards both seen and unseen the author says that the book for him is about ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances and to some degree i can see that what struck me more about the book was the messiness of it you can be heroic and still not be a very nice moral commendable person in other respects you can know the right thing to do in one situation but not in others decisions even the small ones have consequences and domino effects down the road and it isn't always clear what those consequences will turn out to be i was also struck by the repeated revelations that things and people were not what they had seemed to be the pleasant and unpleasant surprises seemed endless the dislocation caused by all of these reinforced to me the pervasive unease of living under such a regime in wartime whom can you trust including even yourself and who will find the courage to stand up when wrong is done","776":"i truly liked this book by local author david gillham it takes place in germany during wwii a young german woman becomes involved in saving jewish people intrigue passion destruction love hatred a page turner","777":"i wasn't sure if i wanted to read this book it seemed some lighter summer fiction was in order but i did give the first chapter a try and 24 hours later i was racing to finish the book i love historical fiction city of women had an intricate plot strong characters and turned out to be real page turner","778":"a great book set in berlin during wwii i found myself looking at life from a different angle ordinary people do extraordinary things and the reader has to constantly ask himself 'what would i do ' the story line is engrossing and the characters are edgy and complex a wonderful book club selection with many women's issues","779":"compelling story set in berlin in 1943 the story is told through the women who struggle to live out the war under the nazis not grizley but seemingly realistic","780":"wonderful book as i was reading i could see a definite cinematic quality it would be a heart wrenching movie when i read more about the author i understood why must read more by gillham","781":"you avert your eyes enough times and finally you go blind ~ 101","782":"good read good story not a favorite","783":"yeah pretty good it's not like anne frank's diary or number the stars it doesn't try to pull on your heartstrings at first which helped me get into it it reads like a cia novel it's fun to read all the details of how they evade but the characters and relationships are interesting too","784":"an excellent read i highly recommend it","785":"i really liked this book i am a fanatic wwii reader the take on this one is so different than any others i have read it is totally about the women left behind to handle things in more ways than one","786":"full of suspense loved it","787":"i absolutely loved this book couldn't put it down","788":"this book and its characters didn't grab me instantly it took me about 250 pages to really get into this story but the ending was interesting and kept me guessing","789":"the authors note at the end makes this book excellent","790":"i enjoyed this book it was a quick read because it was so exciting plus it is an historical novel always a favorite set in berlin during wwii i found the characters plausible if not entirely fleshed out a lot of proofing errors near the end which detracted somewhat but overall a good read","791":"an interesting viewpoint from the perspective of someone on the other side as well as female during ww ii for most of the book i really did not sigrid but suddenly she became a like able person she woke up perhaps grew up to the realities of what was going on in her country and personal life and decided to take control instead of others being the controlling factor","792":"a good read you kind of know where it's going to end up but there are enough twists and surprises that it's not boring i really liked the main character and the supportive characters as well it was a different take on wwii not the usual story there are no real heroes everyone has flaws and makes mistakes but i liked it because of that no predictable heroism","793":"this got great reviews and the setting seemed promising but i found the characters flat and unoriginal had to chug my way through it","794":"this author did a wonderful wonderful job of keeping the setting dreary gray and depressing which i think is perfect for 1940's era germany i would have given it an amazing if it hadn't depressed the hell out of me","795":"it took a while for the book to grab my attention it was worth continuing to read the characters are complex capable of good and evil what choices would i have made in ww ii germany","796":" can i just say that i loved that this novel took place in berlin i absolutely did it heightened the suspense of the novel knowing that everything was taking place in the heart of the nazi capital here we have sigrid who lives with her mother in law is cheating on her husband and starts supporting the resentment her mother in law dislikes her neighbors are nosy and she doesn't trust her only friend she is testing herself and her limits all while in the middle of committing crimes that could likely get her whole family killed i liked her she was a well developed character with obvious flaws but i was drawn to her and as the story progressed and intensified i was rooting for her scared for her and proud of her in times of war you have to constantly reevaluate what you stand for and she was constantly doing that it was obvious she was becoming stronger and i admired that it lent itself to a great story tnow how is this historical fiction novel set in world war ii germany different from any other novel of the same genre i have no idea i haven't read them all but i will say that this one was very suspenseful and filled with drama it focused on the women waiting at home and that was a view point i wasn't familiar with it was also filled with suspense a good helping of backstabbing and rumor mongering with a little forbidden sex thrown in for good measure it was a page turner filled with unexpected plot twists a sense of danger and a touch of helplessness no one can imagine how they would react in these situations but i thought gillham produced an extremely telling rendition of what life may have been at this time i give city of women book 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it to fans of historical fiction full review and many more reviews available at the next book on my list","797":"this was the monthly selection for the book club i am a member of i did not like the writing style and it was a skim to the end read for me it was ok and i can see it making a good discussion","798":"i really enjoyed this book there are many books about the wwii time period but not as many told from the perspective of a german woman the main character was complex and the descriptions of the world around her were riveting at times","799":"this story is powerful and suspenseful i learned more about berlin and its women during ww ii from a master story teller i highly recommend this book","800":" this book was rich in history and vivid in emotions a story of bravery suspense love lust and tragedy my heart was torn and teased while turning the pages one minute i was consumed with anger and the next my body was hot with seduction its a bit of a love story but the major plot is about helping the jews seek freedom sigrid places her life on the line for others and falls into the trap of temptation her husband is a soldier at the front and she is left home to drown in her own thoughts when she meets a man in the cinema her life takes a wild turn secrets are hidden and sexual escapades are exposed mix a wounded soldier husband a spit fire guy a strong willed teen a snotty mother in law and you get pages full of intrigue passion and unexpected outcomes i really found the story to be interesting and the words to be unraveling there were a few parts that were meh but overall i thought it was a great story i recommend it to all readers that like their books historical and sexy with a bit of suspense","801":"excellent read i loved the characters and learning more about nazi germany","802":" to followok first up a reviewer has stated the sex in this book is 'hot hot hot' now i don't know what 'sexual content' this person usually reads but the sex in city of women i can assure you is not in the hot hot hot category there is sex but the fact that it did not make any lasting impression upon me please refer to my book listings for a measure of what is hot quantifies my comment i write this because the statement made by this reviewer may put some readers off the story is not erotic and the sex is story based therefore not porn it is a reflection of a sad desperation in a world filled with the horror of war starvation death and the gnawing chasm of loneliness imo this book is well written and considering it's written by a man from a woman's perspective is pulled off well usually men are unable to'get women' no matter how much they 'think' they can the pov jumps around a little but that's not a bad thing and certainly not distracting there are some neat twists and turns to the story line and my only issue is that 'trust' was given away to easily that being said who do you trust if not your friends or people who appear to ally with you on certain matters the story line flows smoothly and lyrically and evokes the dark and dismal 'landscape' beautifully well worth searching out","803":"i didn't love this book but had to finish it i found its characters confusing at first then compelling the description of life in berlin at that time was very atmospheric you could taste and smell the poverty and fear","804":"a marvelous book detailing the story of two german women who help jews escape germany during wwii well worth the read","805":"i thought this was good i liked the story and character build up the changes and twists","806":"ok i like it alot not so much at the beginning and i'm not crazy about his writing style but what a good story life in berlin for everyday people when the germans are starting to lose the war how does one survive through all the laws pertaining to patriotism morality loyalty purity of race what would you do what would any of us do hope we never have to find out","807":"the time is 1943 berlin and i thought here's another book about the germans in world war two it seems like i've read a few of these lately so i was prepared to not like this book added to that is the fact the the author is an american male writing about women in 1943 berlin the book starts out with sigrid a married woman with a husband in the war there is a lot of sex another reason for me to not like this book the sex sets up the rest of the story could have done with less detail but the sex does become less as the story progresses this story sucked me in it's tense with some twists and it pulled me along on a very thrilling read i ended up loving this story even crying this is a well written story and the narrator was easy to listen to with her german accent","808":"i loved city of women the story takes place in war torn berlin in 1943 i was quickly drawn into the life of sigrid schroeder the wife of a frontline ss soldier sigrid falls in love with a jewish man and soon joins others in hiding and transporting jews to safety this novel is filled with passion and betrayal i didn't want to put this one down","809":" i think i liked it if it weren't for that annoying distracting present tense and the repetitive use of the adjective thick i mean c'mon how can everything be thick and what does it eventually mean anyway i cannot however completely knock gillham's writing skills there were numerous bits of prose that i highlighted for its creativity but they were pretty much used up in the first chapter like bait then everything became thick and otherwise redundant in description that said the plot is excellent with parts that i sped read in excitement then reread or thought through to make sure i got its twists and implications i would've given it 4 stars if i liked the story better it was difficult for me to appreciate all the german terms and that period disturbs me but it was worth reading for the thought provoking portrayal of women which is the only reason i did read it what i appreciated most was the conflict between those berliners who believed in the party and those who had sense to know it was insane this story could've delved much deeper into those characters in order to truly be a better historical novel that's complicated tho and would've turned this book into a literary epic rather than the airport novel it is i noticed some readers complained about the necessity of all the sex perhaps not but it does not detract from the story i'd say it lends to a particularly well planned ironic twist on page 352 you'll see the 3rd act was gripping in which the growth of the heroine amidst various betrayals is inspiring if you like period stories with leading heroic women i recommend this story","810":"city of women gives another view of world war 11 through the eyes of non jewish german women","811":"city of women grabbed and seized my mind my thoughts my emotions my conscience and my gut it still has me in it's grip and won't let me go every few pages i found myself mouthing words and sentences over and over again they caught me off guard shocked me made me blush bored me for a page and then whirled me around catching me totally off guard and then filled all of me with adrenaline like nobody's business some words were harsh with a flash of the gutter that harshness and flash of the gutter belonged where they were put things that happened and shaped the characters in sharp relief the characters in the book weren't characters to me these were real breathing people with real lives i felt like i went through some portal and was right their with them in their lives and world when i looked up every now and then i couldn't believe that they weren't with me or i with them such vivid descriptions without one wasted word no sugar coating of anything in this book that took guts on the part of this author i haven't read many newly released books of late that even come close to the truth that david gillman laid bare here this book made me look at things i wanted to see and it made me look at and feel things i didn't want to look at or feel i looked up every few pages and re read a few sentences or passages to make sure that i had really read and heard what i thought i did yes i didn't just read this book i listened to and heard this book i loved the fact that at one moment the prose and writing would be uneven then would get straight to the point and then languish with beautiful and sickening longing for just long enough to catch me off guard for the next jerk and pull in the prose or plot lyrical writing and magnificent word choices abound in this book you don't find emoting over and over again here thank goodness you do find authentic voices and descriptions that don't feel forced or conjured to suit the author hallelujah i can't believe how a man could have written this book but david gillman a man did that rocks my world so much that it has me wondering whether a woman really wrote this using a man's name as if it were her bard he she got into the heads and hearts and minds of the women in the city and of all women if gillman really is a man i want to meet him someday some day soon if you want to read about real women read this book a few men are thrown in for good measure too their characterizations are every bit as real as those of their opposite sex","812":"good story","813":" while not a perfect book city of women tells an interesting story with a great deal of moral ambiguity sigrid like many women in war torn 1943 berlin has a husband on the front sharing an apartment with her difficult mother in law hardworking stoic sigrid is gradually drawn into a love affair with a jew and illegal activities involving saving other jews the book reminded me of those who save us but raised moral questions that were more interesting in my opinion now for the flaws certain characters and interactions strained my suspension of disbelief just a bit too much as another reviewer noted what's up with all the love affairs when people can barely eat i also felt that though the author succeeded in making certain characters and their situations complex others were a bit simplistic for my taste still highly readable interesting story interesting situations and moral questions worth the read","814":"this is an interesting book that raises a lot of good questions the story moves fast and there is a lot of action sigrid carin kaspar and several of the other characters are well developed on the downside some of the characters are a little flat the mother in law mundt and it seemed like he tried to fit too many characters into the story the book was engaging but more for the extraordinary circumstances than incredible writing i also felt that things tied up too neatly and with too many coincidences at the end this is a popular book and worth checking out it would also be an excellent choice for a book group","815":"excellent historical fiction novel set in wwii berlin sigrid schroder seems to be the model german wife lurking beneath her placid surface is a rebellious sensual woman sigrid's former lover is a jew and sigrid herself soon becomes involved in an underground network hiding jews there is lots of moral ambiguity in this book and the plotting is as suspenseful as a thriller a good book discussion book and for readers who enjoy wwii era fiction","816":"this is a novel about 1943 berlin the title referring to the fact that most men are fighting at the front and the city is full of women sigrid is an unhappily married woman who becomes caught up in the resistance hiding jews taking messages delivering money taking a jewish lover the book was at times tragic very disturbing and often inspirational as people risked their lives to do what they thought was right i listened to this book on cd in the car and it was hard to leave it","817":"this book is not a fun or light read it takes place during wwii in berlin germany as the war is coming to an end the characters are german citizens of all ages and beliefs however there aren't many jewish characters by then as most have been sent to concentration camps or have been eliminated those that remain are in hiding from nazi's and or germans who still believe in hitler's party line the interesting characters are those who oppose the treatment of jews and others who don't fit the perfect 'aryan' mold the fear throughout all germany as described is palpable i've often wondered what i would do in that situation would i be brave enough to work for the underground knowing i risked torture humiliation and death this is the question many citizens asked of themselves throughout this book the characters that decided to help save those who were defenseless were always afraid as they weren't able to trust anyone well written thought provoking book highly recommended for those willing to delve into the serious issues put forth within it","818":"excellent writing which evoked the dismal confused and gray days of berlin at the end of the war it created some interesting discussion in our book club about conscience racism and human nature","819":"gripping story well written complex characters forces you to think about how good and how evil humans can be to each other and how that decision is not always so neat u0026amp tidy grief passion hope so much in this story well worth the read","820":"really liked 4 5 stars kind of empowering in a weird way","821":"it has all the elements of a good book intrigue romance and mystery i liked it very much","822":" how do any of us know how we might act if the world as we knew it collapsed would we be willing to do the right thing if we could figure out what it was even if that act endangered our lives city of women is about a variety of german women living in berlin 1943 the nazis are in power german citizens are supposed to automatically hate all designated \"enemies\" even if they are unsure how much they like hitler and his government sigrid schroeder is the main character with numerous other women in smaller roles i found sigrid unlikeable for at least half the book but again much of that may have been who sigrid was at that time and place suffice it to say that as actions and relationships complicate i found myself rooting for sigrid and for erica a younger woman who gets sigrid involved in helping her hide jews and get them out of the country nothing is just as it seems who can the women trust can they even be sure of each other what if their movement is infiltrated some of these situations have been dealt with before but this author gives us a \"good german wife\" who happens to have an affair with a jewish man two german officers who are not what they seem and are of surprising help and the realization that nothing is black and white good and evil safe and risky i listened to this book on audio well done and as the book barreled toward its end and the stakes grew higher and higher i even had one sudden intake of breath at something a character confesses at that moment i was right in the story stunned as other characters might have been stunned and there i was right along with them hurtling toward the ending","823":"i was disappointed that this novel of ww2 berlin spent more time describing the main character's sexual escapades than really dealing with the other dramatic events going on instead of what i was expecting some kind of cross between casablanca and diary of anne frank i guess i got a steamy romance novel with a side story of underground networks and people in hiding i didn't hate the book i just wish it had focused more on the issues of everyday life and the decisions and struggles of all the characters instead of on sigrid's wild sexual life for living in a city of women she found plenty of men to sleep with i did like the character of ericha and i could not understand why sigrid looked down on ericha for trading sex for food money papers or other things the underground needed when sigrid would sleep with a man she just met in a dark theater and knew nothing about i did appreciate the look into the daily life of the german people during this time and the story of those who helped the jews and others in trouble with the nazis but again i think those parts could have been given more emphasis and detail and less focus put on sigrid's multiple affairs i think the author was trying to show the reader the complexity of life that not all germans were nazis not all jews were innocent victims and not all nazis were totally cruel and heartless and that it's not always easy to decide what is right in any given circumstance he did this to some extent but i just wish he had focused more on that and less on descriptions of sigrid's sexual liaisons also i was surprised to find a lot of typos and errors in this book i have come to expect those in self published e books but i don't expect them in a hardback novel put out by a well known publisher","824":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is such a good book the story the research that went into it the writing it takes place in 1943 and tell the story of sigrid who decides to become involved in hiding jews and other refugees from the nazi state she is amazingly well developed yet one feels there is a part of her always shut off private seeing the relationships she has with all the others in book evolve was amazing i tore through this in a couple days i will have to read it again someday i kept using post its to this is such a good book the story the research that went into it the writing it takes place in 1943 and tell the story of sigrid who decides to become involved in hiding jews and other refugees from the nazi state she is amazingly well developed yet one feels there is a part of her always shut off private seeing the relationships she has with all the others in book evolve was amazing i tore through this in a couple days i will have to read it again someday i kept using post its to mark particularly well written passages p 65 while they are in a bomb shelter and the new neighbor is reading a letter from her husband who is at the front by this point sigrid is praying for a bomb to hit fortunately the all clear sounds before her prayer is answered p 178 between sigrid and ericha sigrid is shocked to discover that ericha has posed for pornographic pictures yes yes i know you are a fine one with your high talk but the truth is talk can just be an excuse a justification to act as you wish the rest of the world be damned there there are rules still rules about respecting yourself and one's body rules about displaying oneself naked for payment p 214 years earlier sigrid has suffered a miscarriage and had spotted the stairs to her apartment after sigrid had miscarried the women of the house had gotten on their hands and knees and scrubbed the spots of blood from every step it perfectly captures the tightness the judgment that the women in the building show each other more","825":" it took me a long time to start this review i'm not really sure why but for some reason i was finding this book hard to describe after much thought i've finally found the word that i've been looking for melodramatic city of women is a melodramatic novel of course i mean that in a good way david r gillham does a great job of bringing the reader back to 1940 war torn berlin so much so that while reading this book i imagined everything in black and white the year is 1943 wwii is in progress and the majority of berlin's male population is away fighting for the fuhrer and fatherland the city is mostly made up of women wounded soldiers and of course the gestapo also referred to as the secret state police our two main characters are fraulein ericha kohl and frau sigrid schroder these two women have nothing in common except for one thing their desire to help and protect the innocent the innocent in this novel are the many german citizens that are being persecuted simply because they are jews if you enjoy reading books that describe the events of wwii from many different perspectives then you will definitely enjoy this one city of women tells the story of the many german citizens who risked their lives in order to help oppressed jews it describes a kind of underground railroad where jews are hidden moved and finally transported to safety these citizens do this without a thought as to what will happen to themselves if they are caught i totally enjoyed reading city of women it's filled with many interesting characters a few twists and turns and in between all the cloak and dagger stuff there's also a love story david r gillham i'm going to give you four stars p s here's an interesting historical fact in 1943 germany jews that lived in hiding and evaded arrest and deportation often with the aid of non jewish germans who sympathized with their plight were called u boats or submarines","826":"it was interesting enough story wise but the characters all felt flat and unrealistic we spend the whole book with sigrid but who is she really a bored housewife that falls completely head over heels in love with a man she meets in a movie theater who on their second meeting guides her hand to his trouser bulge and whispers do you feel that then you know what it's for wow gag it seems very unbelievable that a line like that would set someone's heart a racing yet sigrid flashes back a couple times to this cherished memory amid all the terror and chaos of war ravaged berlin such romance the author seems to have no clue of what turns many women on and it ain't getting pounded into a velour movie theater seat so much of this book is wasted on hollow sex scenes and sigrid mooning over egon i didn't understand their so called relationship from the beginning and it only gets worse as the story progresses i have no idea why she would care about nasty egon and it's apparent she is just a sex partner for him she seems surprised again and again when he acts abusive and selfish her husband remains a characature of a man and is always distant even when not on the front lines still i find him a bit more likable than sigrid even though he has done terrible things in the war the book picks up pace and starts to get decent more than halfway through i did stay up late reading the last chapter i wish the relationship between ericha and sigrid were more fleshed out","827":" this was a fascinating look at germany in wwii from the eyes of a german woman in the beginning sigrid sees herself as just the wife of a german soldier but that changes quickly first she takes a jewish lover but what changes her is her relationship with erika cole a young woman assigned a nanny in her building who works for the underground getting jews and others out of german sigrid is at first reluctant to get involved not because of the danger but for disinterest but then she realizes that it is the wife and children of her lover that are in hiding and suddenly these people become real and the war becomes real as if the bombings and air raids and rationings aren't enough sigrid becomes real to herself through this novel suzanne bertish's accent made me feel as though i was in germany i felt foreign i got a sense of the war though i didn't feel fear but i think that's because when you live in fear on a daily basis you simply become inured to it there are not strong emotions in this book sigrid takes several lovers over the course of the novel and she feels deeply for each of them for different reasons but since we only see through her eyes we only really see their impact on her rather than the other way around a very different take on the war","828":"i really enjoyed this book very suspenseful with excellent character development","829":"although it took me a while to get into this book because the mood and depiction of berlin seemed so sad once the story began to evolve i was hooked the author has a true gift for depicting character and place and the reader is constantly surprised by twists of plot a good read","830":"wow this is what a book should be enthralling tale of a woman living in berlin during the second world war it's romantic suspenseful chilling dark sad horrific erotic beautifully written but i still couldn't slow down to savour it i had to know where her choices would take her","831":"another world war ii book but from a woman's perspective it's berlin 1943 and it's a city of old men children and women the premise of the book asks the question how do the ordinary german people respond to the crimes being committed all around them and in their name by the regime sigird is a young woman whose husband is serving on the front she lives with her motherr in law works in a government office and one day while in the cinema is seized by the arm and asked by a desperate young girl please say that we came here together what would you do","832":"just barely four stars i liked the main character but the plot was heavy handed and needlessly full of red herrings","833":" there was so much sex in this book that it really took away from what could have been a fascinating story about the women of berlin during the war this book had it all hiding jews the ss coming to search your home but the real story of the time seemed to get lost in all the sex these women were having there are times when i was really enjoying the suspense of the story and it's really good then she says something like kiss me to whoever will listen and it just takes me out of the story because it's so farfetched that while all this stuff is happening that she would say it i know i sound like such a prude and really i'm not but i am one that would rather not have a description of body parts or who was on top of whom i'm more of a they went in the bedroom and closed the door type of person and my own imagination can fill in the blanks but i did like this book i just wish there had been more of the historical story and less sex i had to keep listening i needed to know sigrid's fate and the fate of all the people she has been helping i did really like her story i've read plenty of books about england during the war but never one about berlin and the women left behind i hope that the parts about them helping jews and not totally buying into the fuhrers beliefs were true but i'm just not sure they had as much sex as the author would like us to believe ok enough talk about the sex i will say i liked this story and as i said was fascinated by the setting of berlin during wwii it makes you wonder how many germans had jewish friends lovers neighbors and the choices they had to make about these people in their lives would you choose what sigrid's mother in law did or what i feel is even more reprehensible what egon did but you can't really judge what you would do in this situation because unless you are there with the threats over your head you have no idea what you would do i am hoping everything turned out in the end no spoilers i loved suzanne bertish's narration of this her voice is like a cross between lauren bacall and ingrid bergman so throughout this book the images in my head were like an old black u0026amp white movie and sigrid was played my lauren bacall and all the other women were ingrid bergman i would definitely listen to this narrator again i truly enjoyed her narration ps if you don't know who i am talking about in this paragraph you need to tune into tcm more often or find the big sleep starring bogie u0026amp bacall and the movie gaslight for ingrid bergman 3  1\/2  starsi received this book from the librarything early reviewer program but fell behind on my reading and ended up buying it on audio which i am so glad i did","834":"full review and a possible rating change after book club","835":"reading the stories of the women who were affected and took ownership of their lives during the was was an eye opener all you ever read abut the war is the military triumphs and losses david give the victims a face and voice","836":"at first i had some reservations but as the story unfolded it gained in depth and power sigurd is an interesting character who grows in her awareness of the persecution of the jews in berlin and in courage as she does more and more to help them the 3 men in her life are multi layered and you can't guess their secrets until each reveals his own a complex and satisfying look at a sad point in human history","837":"i picked this up because it got a great review by writer stephen king a very tense book apropos of people risking their lives to try to save jews from the nazis in berlin during wwii plenty of twists turns and double crosses to keep you on your toes","838":"the story was compelling the characters felt pretty standard","839":"this is one of the best books i have read this year it is one of those books that you sit down and read and get lost in the story the author did his homework the story was very believable and historical accurate i loved the plot line and all of the characters","840":"this novel presents the everyday lives of german women living in berlin during world war ii i was really enticed by the theme since it seemed similar to the book thief which also showed the perspective of the suffering of the german people during world war ii but the city of women did not work for me the women were just so nasty so conerned with sex when food clothing personal safety and shelter were huge issues the author of the book thief relied on the actual experiences of his relatives did the author interview actual relatives of berliners because it was suspenseful with the gestapo everywhere i read to the end only to be cheated by an ambiquous ending","841":" i couldn't decide between 2 and 3 stars i settled on 2 stars because even though it was just exciting enough to keep me reading and i finished it in just a couple of days this book was a little too grim and dark with the main character a very cold and unlikable woman i also find it funny that the author would let us believe that a woman tied up in the extremely dangerous world of espionage in berlin would be able to switch on her sex drive any time being chased by gestapo sex soon after watching jews be rounded up and beaten in front of their children sex soon after seriously it was almost laughable","842":" i tried to read this book i really did i started over 2 times i scanned a few pages i opened it at random and i even read the ending which i never do i just couldn't get into it i've read several books about nazi germany and the war so i don't think it was that subject at all i knew from the book description that the main character was married to a soldier and would have a romance with another man a jewish man i was not put off by that it was the writing it was harsh and cold i just couldn't feel anything for the characters maybe at another time it would feel differently to me but this time even after recently reading so many books about women in germany during the war didn't draw me into the story at all","843":"it was definitely a compelling story i found two huge flaws one for a story so largely about women i didn't think the author wrote women well second i didn't get the relationship between sigrid and egon why did they fall in love they were rarely even civil with one another it confused me","844":"the city is berlin the year 1943 mostly bombed out whose residents had better remain loyal to hitler or else the women are sigrid a good german wife and ericha an enigmatic young woman harboring a big secret sigrid and ericha have pretty much nothing in common until they have everything in common there is much to engross the reader the plight of jews the contrasting and conflicting views emotions and actions of german citizens love stories betrayal backstabbing and backbiting heightened dangerous and deadly during wartime not to mention a whole lot of sex like a lot who can be trusted and who cannot a what would you do scenario like what would really do as opposed to what you'd like to think you'd do tedium and repetition do weigh city of women down i nearly quit 2 3 of the way in i thought i knew what would happen i so didn't the ending was among the most satisfying of many books i've read","845":"lisa recommended this to me and i'm so glad this was a page turner that kept me up late the characters are complex and the plot is twisty enough to make you want to go back and reread some parts i can see this being optioned for a movie in the future my only complaint is that the end wrapped up more quickly than i would have expected things appeared to get done within 24 hours that stretch my credulity somewhat still a good read","846":"excellent that's all i can say","847":"the ultimate moral question of what would you do haunting interesting that a man wrote this book about women worth the read and worth the self analysis","848":"excellent book if someone asked you for help what would you do and if one small decision turned into larger decisions and put your life at risk would you keep making those decisions for the greater good of others one must read this book to answer those and many questions one might have while reading this book","849":"the quote from this book that really sums it up would have to be i thank god that the human spirit is not dead that is what you will truly learn or perhaps remember would be a better word from this novel i have not read a whole lot of novels from the wwii period but if they are anything like this one i am going to have to rectify that situation i did receive a copy of this novel as part of the goodreads first reads program but it will be one that i purchase my own finished copy of for sure it is based on the story of sigrid where she is from where her husband is what her life is like now that the war has started it shows how she changes and becomes sometimes a person that she is not proud of however i think it is realistic in the way that none of us really know how or what we are going to do in the same kind of situation you know that she misses her husband and wants him to come home but sometimes as humans we need an outlet whether it be a good or bad decision she gets herself involved with hiding some people from the government and i think that when this happens it truly shows the strength of character that she has and what we are capable of when we let our human compassion take over i know that this is a work of fiction however i am sure that the situations that happened throughout the novel are ones that happened on a daily basis in berlin and beyond what i probably loved most about this story is that when the story keeps unfolding you really don't know who the good person is or who the bad person is and it keeps you guessing right up until the very end you also see the characters grow and push themselves farther than they thought they could possibly go i am not sure i could have been as brave and selfless in some of the situations with the intimidation that they would have endured from government officials the author has a true gift for writing emotions that i have not came across in a whole lot of novels it is brilliant i could feel myself right there with them and have all those feels like anxiousness happiness sadness etc at some points i felt more than one of those at the same time i loved it also the way that he described what the living conditions were like with regards to their lodging as well as what food rations were like working conditions and public transportation to even get to from work it really made me think of my own life and how privileged we really are for where we are now the conveniences that we have the lives that we are able to lead and we owe some of it to where this and other wars what i mean is not the war itself but for all the men and women who were able to hold it together mentally and physically and get themselves through and to the ones that took the chances on people they did not know but helped them anyways to get to a safer spot for themselves and their families needless to say this novel both broke my heart and inspired me at the same time i could not put it down and i know that i will read it again and again this is absolutely a 5 5 for me and i highly recommend it to everyone maybe not some of the younger crowd as there is some adult material","850":"good good depiction of life in berlin during wwii never really connected to characters never felt their love for each other","851":" this is the third book in a row i've read about berlin in the late 1930s early 1940s before this kino and before that all that i am a novel with every one details accumulate to make this era more personal more human somehow realer to me this book has some good sharp dialogue especially between sigrid and ericha and when sigrid meets brigitte and carin the plot is enthralling although it ties up too quickly in the end maybe that's just because i want more of the story and the characters there's melodrama but there's more just drama that makes reading it worthwhile i read it quickly and i liked it a lot berlin is a character i wish i knew it better so i could see better the streets that are named and the areas where the action takes place i learned that in bomb shelters crying was forbidden and signs were mounted to announce as much there's a paragraph on how the germans imagined life would be after they won the war with russian phrasebooks in the stores so citizens could learn how to address their new eastern servants not all germans are bad and always in the past when i thought about blackouts i thought only of people huddled in their apartments behind black curtains and not that people and some businesses still kept up at night and how the streets must've looked with pocket flashlights illuminating that kind of urban darkness a reader might be sacrilegious to say this but spending time with this story is like watching a really good escapist black and white movie in the afternoon it's time well spent away from real life only imagine what real life was back then","852":" this book was published in august 2012 and mentioned by the new york times in a brief somewhat negative review dated september 7th i remembered seeing the times paragrpah was offered a very attractive purchase price by amazon kindle and had just read two other books covering the same time period those who save us by jenna blum and winter of the world by ken follett so it was an easy decision to spend a few dollars and give the author david r gillham a chance to reveal aspects of 1943 in germany and in berlin not explored fully by blum and follett i am glad that i did the primary character sigrid schroder is not a totally virtuous woman her husband is a soldier on the eastern front and she is living with her mother in law but she is also unfaithful like the central character of those who save us she has had an affair with a jew and later in the story will have an affair with a nazi ss officer in fact the ss officer has the same rank as the concentration camp commander in jenna blum's novel obersturmfuhrer but underneath her personal sexual failings sigrid is one of those rash thrill seeking individuals \"unbesonnen her mother in law says who will not ignore what is happening to the jews instead sigrid befriends a young woman in her apartment building who needs her help to conceal that she is hiding jews deserters and others on the run from the nazi police gradually this friendship leads to sigrid's own involvement in this highly dangerous work i enjoyed sigrid's passion for life and i liked the other major characters her jewish lover her ss lover and even her husband and her mother in law the following excerpts illustrate the tone of the book she only felt guilt for her infidelity after it had ended in the heat of egon's grip she was so boiling over that she sometimes transferred her passion to kaspar's body in sudden spasms of desire in the bed they shared at 11g sigrid feels herself close off fortress schroder it's her secrets she realizes the secrets of the pension unsagbar walk between them the secrets of auntie's guests in a narrow windowless room huddling under blankets peeing into a bucket every day separating sigrid not only from renate but from all who do not share that knowledge separating her by one more unspoken word one more degree of silence there was an invasion of berlin after the aufmarsch into russia an invasion by an army of mutilated and crippled young men i have lived my entire life thinking that i was viennese only to discover that actually i am a jewish parasite nobility is nothing more than an invention of the living to eulogize the dead the dead are not noble they are simply decaying in their graves and if you're not very careful sigrid that is what you will be doing the book perhaps underplays the horror of living in berlin in 1943 as the nightly bombing raids resume as the german armies suffer defeat at stalingrad and as the nazis accelerate their liquidation of the jewish population but this story of one woman's action is well worth the reading in spite of a woman's moral failings also the story has many twists and turns that keep the real nature of some characters concealed until the very end","853":"schindler's list for ladies","854":"everything you could hope for in a historical novel very refreshing to see a wwii perspective from the german side and the moral ambiguity that was pervasive in 1943 germany sigrid is a woman who you can both hate and admire you really can't know how you would act if faced with the decisions she was and that's what makes this book so terrifying","855":"it took me almost 1 4 of the book to really get into the story but once i did i could not put it down really i was up till 2 a m finishing this the depth of the characters the growth of the protagonist and the subject matter make for a striking touching novel","856":"this was really good an insight into what the people mostly women of germany went through during the war what life was like for them war is atrocious for both sides there is no good but for the need to squash the most heinous it brings out the monsters the liars the thieves the selfish and all evil things that can be conjured up but it also brings out the good in those who believe that everyone deserves love comfort compassion assistance and such at the risk of their own lives they do what needs to be done a real look inside berlin during hitler's reign i highly recommend this book","857":"this book is spellbinding it grabs you on the first page and never lets you go it makes you think how you would react when put in difficult circumstances it is set in berlin 1943 which is a city that is being bombed regularly and the gestapo are rounding up the jews by the 10's of thousands the story is based on some german women who decide to do something and are active in hiding and helping the jews escape and the risks that they themselves are subjected to in the process a must read","858":"a very interesting take on a group of people that seemed forgotten the women in germany during world war 2 the plot is a gem and even though there are many books about world war 2 this plot is unique enough to pull off something special that holds it apart from all those other books i won't give away the plot but this book is a keeper one of those books you take off the bookshelves every few months and read","859":"how did i miss this one when it came out it's perfect for book clubs with lots of flawed characters and ethical decisions the look into wartime berlin and the women on that homefront is also fascinating","860":"wanted to really like this book excellent premise but awful characters i so disliked sigrid and egon ending not believable","861":" when you believe you have read every historical fictional book about the holocaust think again the main characters in this book are not the jews whom the reich have waged war against but the berliners who are trying to go about their everyday lives and believe the war propaganda that germany is winning this war this book was engrossing full of memorable characters and thought provoking what would you do if at every turn if your neighbors were able to whisper to party officials that you were doing right or wrong or not following party lines highly recommended read","862":"yes i finally broke down and read a nazi novel or as close to that genre as i'll ever get i found the story tedious and somewhat unbelievable a young woman left at home with her mother in law while her husband is at war she gets herself involved with other german women who are trying to smuggle jews out of berlin at the same time she seems to go to bed with everyone she meets and she has no guilt possibly this is a more realistic depiction of women in wartime than i realize or care to know halfway through the book the pace picks up and the stakes get higher but it was too late for me some of you might like this book so try a sample and see if it's for you","863":"what would i do in that place at that time i would take care of my own keep a low profile and hate myself however if i were alone without dependents as was the protagonist i think i would have the will and the resolution to act i must confess though i would be selfish and keep the cyanide pill for myself","864":" i struggled with this book at the start and again in the middle trimming it down would have helped but i'm glad i finished it it's very well written the characters are really good and the main plot which takes a while to get going is interesting i suppose you could say the novel is 'about' a woman becoming more fully human and stepping outside the limits of her social role to do something truly good or at least attempting to make up for what she couldn't prevent sigrid is a brave character and admirable but it feels very much like her choices aren't intentional i got the feeling that gillham wants us to see her as a woman coming into her own and doing something stupendous but it felt to me all along as though she did what she was told whoever told her there was never a moment where she thinks or says i'm making this decision she falls into a dangerous situation with very little thought i e no justification which i thought was a major fault of the book and i was a little surprised in this day and age and how much it was a book about women from a male point of view i've read some fantastic books with female characters from male authors but this particular book spends a lot of time on the predictable a city full of women on their own what could they possibly do with their time and attention except have affairs with every man who asks i could be naive but i didn't find this believable in a society where the narrative makes clear every move you make is public and accountable and the housewife loyal to her husband and country is not an option not that many people would be so rash however there are some wonderful perceptive passages that express sigrid's awareness of her situation as a woman in berlin during wwii and the vulnerability of all women but these all seem to be saved for the end so if you start it do finish on the surface this novel is about how people are functioning in berlin during the war including those who are trying to leave the city in secret the drama and thriller aspects of the city of women are really good and the feeling for berlin a city that still vividly remembers how things used to be is spot on and heartbreaking people suffer with almost no relief from lack of food and clothing being herded into cellars during nightly bombardments neighbours with their own individual aggressions and political agendas watching in horror as fellow citizens are hauled away by the truckload gillham is at his best here and this part of the story is riveting overall a really good book","865":" interesting story of a german woman during world war ii her husband is at the russian front she lives with her mother in law and she gets involved with the protection and transport of jews out of germany as the noose gets tighter she is a complicated woman involving herself with a german soldier who has lost his leg in the war and a jewish businessman who is evading the gestapo very intense book that makes you think i expected more about after germany lost the war when the women were left alone in berlin and suffered w under the russians but this was a different story hard decisions for people to make to keep their humanity","866":" very well written this novel contained a good picture of history during wwii this woman who is a soldier's wife gets her self wrapped up in an affair with a jew on the run and becomes a helper in hiding and transporting other jews all under the nose of her mother in law and husband i found it rather intriguing how her apartment neighbor and sister were of big nazi names spouses were also helping too this book covered thrills love lust happy times and tears the only thing i found that didn't fit was the way sigrid talked to her mother in law at times since they despised each other during that era i just don't see women using some of the language that was used that is not to say that it didn't happen though","867":"well written on what would have been your stand in nazi germany","868":"3 5 stars do you feel this then you know what it's for set in berlin during the holocaust sigrid lives with her negative controlling mother in law while her husband is a soldier in the war what i loved about this book was sigrid's transformation from an uninvolved and ambiguous woman to slowly becoming a confident high risk player in an underground network that hides jewish people the ability to trust people becomes a dangerous game and while sigrid may have started out vulnerable she learns to take matters into her own hands there are still some lingering questions i have about the book so it would be a good pick for a book club this was a subtle well written thriller but i still wished it had packed a bigger punch","869":"i received this book through a goodreads giveaway i didn't know much about this book prior to reading it but as i began i was intrigued by a narrative about berlin during world war ii from the point of view of an average german woman i have read many books detailing the atrocities of the holocaust and one of the questions those books always left me with was why didn't anybody stop this and didn't anybody notice from this story it would appear that the answer was yes people did notice but in order to do anything about the deportation of jewish people to concentration camps it was necessary to have a great deal of courage this courage was not only in the actual act of helping jewish people to hide but even the courage simply to step outside of what was expected and required of you as a good german in this story at the beginning sigrid is a good german who works as a typist at the patent office and lives with her mother in law while her husband is off fighting in the east i really enjoyed following her awakening of consciousness as she first forces herself to take notice of the horrors going on around her and then to take action to combat those horrors i also found it interesting that sigrid takes some not completely moral actions in her personal life that are stark contrasts to the actions she is taking to help others the reason that i only gave this book a three star rating rather than higher despite really enjoying many parts of the story was that at times i feel like the book suffered a bit from forrest gump syndrome it seems that the author in his urgency to ensure that many parts of the germans' experience during this time period is explored causes things to happen to sigrid and those around her that seem too unbelievable i would however recommend that anyone interested in the ww ii time period read this book","870":"this book was really good depressing topic for sure since it is about nazi germany but the characters were great the only problem i had with it is that i found it really hard to believe that in such a depressing environment that people were as interested in sex as they were in this book but it was written by a man so i think that pretty much explains it","871":"in 1943 british bombers besieged berlin german soldiers are pommeled by the russians and most of the women left in the city are cowed by illegalities and propaganda most but not all sigrid responds to sex outside her marriage the first daring thing her unleashed passion envelopes","872":"great book with as many layers as an onion","873":"wow what a page turner especially after the first 100 pages lots of mystery intrigue fear and romance only downside for me was having to look up meaning of numerous german words and phrases wish i would have read this one on my ipad still a super exciting read","874":"i received this advance reader's copy arc from a goodread's giveaway the book takes place in the city of berlin during the 2nd world war and is about a woman sigird and the lives of the women and men she comes in contact the story shows how the war affected the lives of the citizens of berlin and the choices they had to make in their life as a result of the policies and law implemented by germany for example do you turn in your neighbour of 20 years do you buy their belongings when they are put up for auction do you help them escape although i did not always agree with the main characters choices i could relate to her emotions i found the author built believable multi dimensional characters especially in the women depicted in the story it gave me a great perspective into the other side of the fence i have only read one other story showing how the war affected the average citizen in berlin and i felt this book did a really good job of showing that the story flows and sometimes i could not turn the pages fast enough i needed to know how a situation turned out there is also an element of mystery to the book if you are the kind f reader who like to predict who did it i think that the book would be a great book club choice as there are a lot of moral dilemmas presented to the reader which would make for great discussion","875":"city of women was an amazing read i was reminded of the best of leon uris david gillham did a great job writing from the woman's point of view the book is a page turner i highly recommend this book","876":"the last third absolutely captivated me at first i thought just another view of the horrors of wwi and the camps etc i was so wrong this view through sigrid's eyes a german woman in berlin at the end of the war is masterfully written","877":"very good with its share of suspense after reading this book i am glad i live in a peaceful environment and do not have to worry where my next meal will come from worry about someone turning me in because of my religion or being careful of what i say for fear i will be turned in to the gestapo i liked sygrid even though she had her weaknesses but at the end of the books developed courage to defy her government","878":"a vivid depiction of life in wartime berlin a city of women with all the men but the elderly and the gestapo at the front bombs are falling nightly informers are everywhere and everyone has secrets sigrid a young woman whose husband is fighting on the eastern front and who lives with her meddling mother in law has fallen in love with a jew and soon must make choices in a world where nothing is what it seems","879":" i'm so mad that i didn't enjoy this book because it seemed like something i would absolutely enjoy the sexy and dangerous with a main character who is torn between marriage with a german soldier in berlin where she lives with the mother in law and the possibilities of some kind of excitement or adventure from a closed up woman there are other characters who are involved including ericha who has been helping move jews and men like egon a jewish man who becomes sigrid's lover i think for me the descriptions left something to be desired even for being a bit long winded i've seen desperate or forlorn women lusting and wanting a change in their lives done so much better so maybe there was a bar there already that this one didn't meet points for a great concept for a story and a beautiful title and cover but there was a little something lost for me to enjoy it as much as others might have","880":" my favorite part of this book was how intimate a look we get into the daily lives of the average german during wwii the reader gets an in depth look at the long lines for food the ever looming threat of the gestapo and watching what one says the dank fear of the bomb shelters and the struggle to keep u hope in such a gray drudge filled world i liked how this book showed that not every german was a hard toed nazi some were just trying to survive in a country gone mad i really liked sigrid's character she shows incredible character development and change as the story progressed starting out as a simple pushover of a girl she blossoms into a strong courageous and intelligent woman facing all the circumstances that come her way with aplomb i liked that she found herself in staying others and conducting her own form of resistance against the nazis i also have to give a shout out to the other characters too i adored the fact that most of the people portrayed are not what they appear to be allies are betrayers neighbors are hidden people soldiers are purveyors of assistance and those whom one thought would be the biggest threat actually provide the best of help the author does a great job in layering his characters to create three dimensional models in which to explore this world through this book deserves all the hype it got with a great setting balance portrayal of germany at war and intense characters with an intriguing story this book stands out in the wwii historical fiction genre i'd highly recommend this book to those who enjoy the genre i heartily hope the author writes something else as the world would benefit by more than his pen","881":"this just a fabulous story it has mystery sex adventure and intrigue all set in berlin during ww2 the book raises the questions how long can we look the other way when ugliness is happening to other human beings what would i do in that situation what could i do it is a scary proposition deciding just what we can live with and still live with ourselves","882":"like many of the women in 1943 berlin sigrid's husband has been conscripted and is serving on the russian front the city of berlin is full of women like sigrid who are just trying to survive on the limited rations available on the surface sigrid is the model soldier's wife but she has a secret a jewish lover","883":"i started this book expecting it to be good but it was confusing and hard to follow finally i just got bored and moved on to another book","884":" another wwii woman's point of view novel but if you're looking for the intensity of the nightingale or life after life you will be sadly disappointed it's defeated by a choppy narrative and poorly developed characters along with dialogue and thought processes of women that didn't ring true it seems as if it's written by a well meaning man who just doesn't get women kasper the husband is the only one who doesn't read as if written read this if you've nothing else to do on a cold winter day and looking to avoid a constitutional","885":"perfect book to read on your bvg commute","886":" i'm not sure how to rate this book on one hand berlin in 1943 is a great setting more than a setting really but rather a character in its own right i don't think i've read a novel from the perspective of the ordinary german just as it starts to become clear that germany will not win wwii the story pulls you in to sigrid's life and decisions till it becomes a page turner loved this part of the book on the other hand sigrid's romantic sexual entanglements seem to come out of the blue sigrid meets egon and falls for him why i truly don't know he's not at all nice to her on top of that she knows next to nothing about him so the love bit seems strange then she meets wolfram and so on every time the plot strays into this territory i got a bit annoyed just because sigrid's actions seem so arbitrary i decided on three stars because of the unique setting and the hard to step away from it action would love to rate it higher but i just can't","887":" this collected dust on my bookcase for almost 2 years and now i can only think of all that time i wasted without having read this book this is a novel about the german women who are left behind in berlin when the men are off fighting on the eastern front in world war 2 and of course the jews in hiding sometimes in plain sight all over the city it pulls off that rare feat of being both historically accurate and a page turner it also addresses the question of what an average apolitical person might do when faced with the mass persecution of an entire category of people but manages to do this with such nuance that it is not always easy to understand who is actually doing the morally right thing or even what the morally right thing always is","888":"a historical novel about ordinary people - especially women - in berlin during world war ii with an intricate twisting plot it's fast paced and suspenseful full of twists and turns that you never see coming but also thought provoking read my full review at http bookbybook blogspot com 2013 1","889":"excellent book one i hated finishing i enjoyed reading it so much gave me a lot to think of several days after i'd read the last page a sure sign of a classic the movie version will be an excellent companion to roman pulaski's pianist","890":"okay so there are nazis i love the main character the writing is often lyrical what else does a reader need","891":" the atmosphere and the history is great 1942 in berlin with most of the men off fighting leaving the city full of woman the fear and paranoia the food shortages the lack of almost everything leave the women feeling frustrated and lonely well written and very readable i just wish i could g have connected with the main character i found many of the things she does in this book questionable many time i found myself wanting to throttle her her air of unhappiness martyrdom feeling sorry for herself just grated on me this book would have been fantastic if i had been able to relate to this character more","892":" i liked this book it was pretty dark heavy stuff as most books about wwii are what i really liked about it was that it is told from the point of view of a good german gnadige frau who is the wife of a nazi soldier who has a jewish lover and begins to help her new friend try to save the u boats as the people in hiding from the nazis were called it was so interesting to think of what choices the various characters made and why it was about the frailty of the morals of some and the strength of others all set in the context of who they were does a jewish man choose to save himself or his family how does he go about it also interesting to me is the fact that the author is a man but the main character is a woman a good read for anyone who reads wwii fiction","893":"an interesting look at an unexplored aspect of wwii the women who remained behind in germany while their husbands were at the front they not only had to deal with the deprivation and the continuous bombings but also with the party fanatics insisting on their belief in germany victory even when their loss is imminent while the setting was interesting the actual writing was only average i still enjoyed the book yet i wish the complexity and contradictions of their situation was more deeply explored","894":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here my pet peeve when reading is married people cheating the male author of this book has no issues with that at all maybe he doesn't have a problem with his female lead being an adulterating whore throughout his story but i didn't care for it or her i really disliked that almost

serving at the front sleeping with a married man not buying it at all glad this book is done i must also admit that his writing set a very quick action filled pace a quick read if you enjoy cheating spouses i don't which is why it took me a month to read it a friend of mine finished this in three days more","895":"city of women evokes emotions from both ends of the spectrum emotions that most women face in a lifetime these women faced on a daily basis fear love trust hate we don't truly know how we would react in the face of difficult situations until we are put in their shoes in city of women you feel as if you are in their shoes trying to avoid the ss stealing food or cigarettes to be used as bribes hearing the bombs explode helping friends and strangers this is well written by mr

movie it is on a par with casablanca","897":"this book asks the age old question what would you do","898":"the dialogue in this one is pitch perfect you really will be wondering where did the time go and do i have time to read just one more chapter the term page turner is not used loosely","899":" wow there are very few historical fiction novels that i find can successfully transport you back to another place in time this novel follows the story of one woman living in war time berlin who finds herself questioning what exactly it means to be a good german rife with historical depth and plot twists that kept me reading late into the night this book surprised me and has become one of the better books i've devoured this summer on a side note i was totally amazed to realize when i finished the book that it was written by a man i think gillham does a wonderful job of capturing his female protagonist's emotions and pov","900":"this was quite a page turner for me with very interesting characters it has been a long time since i have read anything this compelling","901":" for sigrid schroder her life in 1943 berlin is one of grinding tedium working days as a stenographer and spending

mysterious man with whom she embarks on a dangerous affair for egon is a jew for months they meet in a small shabby apartment and he provides the only source of life in her tedious existence but even

sex not for me this book made no sense i had to read this for book club otherwise i never would have finished it","903":" it fell short of 5 for the fact that the beginning was slow and the chronicling of the protag's life was monotonous at times but now i get it the lead character grows so much in this novel and i love that the author shows us instead of tells us he exposed the complex inner workings of a woman and i think he did it quite well we may not agree with the lead but we will certainly understand her and isn't that what any author wants i also marveled that i too had lived in the location of the story and i could hear and see the scenes","904":"great book","905":"city of women was recommended to me by my daughters and my reaction was yet another book about nazi germany i should have known from their recommendation that it would be one of the best products of historical fiction that has been written a person is never too old to learn and to remember that this period in the world's history must never been forgotten","906":" marked as currently reading05 27 page 6 i enjoyed this book it wasn't exactly what i suspected but it was still good i liked that this was the story of ordinary women left behind by the soldiers and how they cope with the war while it encroaches their homefront sometimes i thought the sexual encounters were superfluous to the story but i also think it set the mood for sigrid's mood and imperfections heroes aren't always pure of heart but that makes them no less heroic reading progress05 03t marked as t currently reading05 27t page 6tt

first half of the book i thought it was a story of daily life in berlin during ww2 family squabbles unhappy marriages blind allegiance to the mother land illicit affairs with dangerous men and i was quite content with this because it was a different perspective from the majority of the ww2 holocaust books that i've read and then the book offered more with political intrigue dangerous love secret identities and women risking their lives to save others even at the cost of one's own life or love the plot has all the elements of a big budget film but it's written in an understated manner which adds drama and flair that provides a keen emotional connection instead of a titillating experience","908":"in many parts this was an exceptional book i'm only giving it three stars because of the feud ex machina nature of several plot points including the movie theater scenes that read like a cliched romance novel","909":"had a hard time putting this one down ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances this was an interesting take on historical fiction set in berlin in 1943 more fiction than history the characters were very real in a gritty way i liked that the story was portrayed from the perspective of the women that wartime left behind in berlin","910":"great read i highly recommend it","911":"it was pretty good seeing berlin through the women's eyes in wwii was interesting","912":"bold courageous main character not entirely likable though i found her a bit undeveloped","913":"i received this book through goodreads first reads i found this book a little confusing somethings weren't explained all that well and i felt the book ended 'unfinished' overall i enjoed this story","914":"a step above the usual world war ii thriller really gave the reader a sense of what it might have been like to be an ordinary german not only forced to endure extraordinary hardships but also coerced by one's neighbors into celebrating them refreshing to have the main protagonists be female too although i found sigrid's early and easy sexual conquest by her jewish lover implausible","915":"it took me about 80 pages to really become attached then i had to know before those 80 pages i almost put it down for good several times i'm glad that i didn't i love how thought provoking the story is and how strong and developed the characters become","916":"this is a difficult book but also an important one it's thought provoking inspiring and heartbreaking but in a good way definitely a good one for book clubs","917":" the author says in the afterward that he wanted to write about ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances and certainly germany during wwii provides a perfect setting for such a conflict the novel is set in berlin in early 1943 while things have started to turn badly ordinary life hasn't yet reached the desperation that is just a few months away sigrid schroder is a married to a german soldier stationed on the front lines she works in the patent office as a typist and through a series of circumstances she is drawn into helping hide and move jews escaping the nazis there are no simple characters in this story no one is completely good everyone makes difficult moral and ethical choices but all are sympathetic and the plot is totally engaging","918":"in 1943 berlin has essentially become a city of women sigrid is the

finished this book with a real sense of what berlin as a city was like during wwii i owe that to the writing","920":"i really enjoyed this book i agree with judy that it took a while to get into in

on the front she is having an affair with a jew in hiding and while going to a movie she is grabbed on the arm by a woman in the theater and as the gestapo soldiers are approaching them the woman says please say that we came here together her answer to this question changes her life good story interesting characters and worth the tedious beginning","921":"4 5 stars wow wow wow the only reason i am not giving this 5 stars is because i almost quit this book about an hour into listening and i am not crazy about the ending not a bad ending i just needed more closure when i first began this book i thought what the heck am i listening to one too many sex scenes but then i read raving reviews and decided to power through thank goodness i later understood that the sex scenes were purposeful to the story not just random sex scenes you have to understand too when you listen to a book you cannot skip sections so i had to turn down the volume on my phone a few times just in case my kids could hear but the scenes are essential to building the story of the main character by the end of this book you feel like you know her personally its probably why i hated the ending because i didn't want it to end i wanted to know more the story is set in germany during wwii and is a thriller i could not stop listening to this book it really annoyed my husband the book is about unsung heroes it makes me wonder about the research the author had to do for this book i feel like there are so so many stories out there about wwii at this point i have read a lot of wwii books and none have been the same can you imagine all the stories we don't know about all of the unsung heroes the reader of this book was excellent i loved her voice and her accents she was able to change her voice just enough for each character where i could actually picture them how this hasn't been a movie i don't know this is a must read listen to just be warned you will stay up late because its hard to put this one down","922":"this book was a very good story about the women in berlin during wwii and what they had to do to get buy with all the men at war the petty bickerings those who helped the jews those who were faithful party members and were on the look out to turn anyone else in it was slow to start but did pick up and was very good at the end","923":"excellent book would give it 4 5 stars if i could do half stars to me a 5 star book is something that i would recommend to everyone or a book that i just couldn't put down while this was a great book i don't know that everyone would like it as much as i did takes place in berlin during wwii and centers on a berlin housewife who ends up helping jews and others who are evading the nazis","924":"i have mixed emotions about this book at times i enjoyed the experience and found the plot twists interesting and unexpected at other times the pace slowed to a slog and i could not have cared less and still other times the characters played their roles like b movie types not credible or truly moving but there for the drama to play out in a predictable way","925":"it was good certainly not the typical wwii germany story makes you think about what you would do under those circumstances","926":"very good i don't usually read novels involving murders etc but this was well written well done and intelligent interesting literature","927":"i was surprised by how much i liked this book i had no idea what kind of story it would be it ended up being captivating like a thrilling adventure novel plus nuanced and complex characters i sympathised with them i got frustrated with them and i cheered for them so so good this was also the kind of book that just got better the more i discussed it a great book club book","928":"since i'm into wwii fiction with female main characters this was a perfect read for me set in berlin it explores a viewpoint i had seldom considered what were the folks at home doing hearing seeing while all their men were off soldiering it's well written storyline has enough heart racing suspense to keep readers on edge the intrigue is believable and realistic a first book the writer is one to watch","929":"3 5 stars this novel has somewhat of a dark feel to it it takes place in berlin during the 2nd world war centering primarily around the character of sigrid who is living with her mother in law while her husband is off fighting in russia while there are air raid sirens going off periodically the majority of this story centers more on sigrid's emerging awakening to what is really going on around her re the jewish relocation it was well written but a very depressing novel and one which makes a powerful statement about the sign of the times i typically enjoy wwii novels for the most part and this was one written from a different angle which was refreshing","930":"i think this is one of those books that's going to end up on must read lists i think i liked it most for the character development it was a fascinating journey and i had a hard time putting it down","931":"sometimes intriguing sometimes slow quite interesting elements about women in wartime berlin with a flawed heroine","932":" sigrid a cynical berliner with husband fighting in russia is living a lock step gray life apolitical struggling to remain oblivious to the atrocities of the nazis living with her critical mother in law she escapes to the balcony of a nearby movie theater whenever possible there in the darkness allegorical to her existence life assails her first she is picked up by a handsome stranger who turns out to be jewish next she agrees to serve as an alibi for a young woman who works in her apartment building as sigrid is drawn into these two lives she has to confront her passivity and make difficult decisions a thoughtful yet well paced book well worth reading","933":" i give david gillham credit for a mostly good outing in telling this story of a german woman's growing resistance to nazism from that woman's perspective in many ways he did a good job i liked the development of the relationship between the anti nazi activist ericha and the main character kriegsfrau sigrid loved the gobs and gobs of german in speak atmosphere and war trivia other reviewers have mentioned this stellar aspect of the book historical fiction that is very well researched is such a pleasure to read as others have noted you could smell and taste the airless berlin of 1943 loved the half jewish nazis next door the pregnant frau obersturmfuhrer and her lesbian sister carin in fact carin was one of the best realized characters in the book she was both sarcastic and warm wise cracking and deep funny and sad i'm usually quite critical of male authors' depictions of lesbian women so this characterization was a treat there were few other minor characters as well imagined frau weiss and her children were somewhat believable though idealized but all the other u boats were complete stereotypes as were the building superintendent u0026amp wife other residents sigrid's boss etc bellicose nazis right down to their grey teeth i was disappointed that sigrid's mother in law was so entirely one dimensional it made her completely predictable i hoped that the evolving circumstances of the novel would somehow impact her witless bitchiness and relentless pro nazi attitudes but the author missed the opportunity to develop this character at all no matter that her son was essentially destroyed by his part in the war even confronted with that and his suicidal return to the eastern front nope sorry she was the same at the end of the book as at the beginning there's no way i can buy that an unemployed nosy woman at home in the berlin apartment day and night could miss sigrid's activities completely she found sigrid's love letters after all so we know she was prying but her occasional suspicions essentially are couched in her dislike of sigrid rather than any apprehension of her anti nazi activism in many ways i found caspar sigrid's soldier husband the most coherent character in the book he was an earnest civil servant kind of guy who is drafted is completely unfit as a soldier but does his best with a bad situation his identity and character are destroyed by the chaotic violence of the eastern front after being wounded caspar tries to return to his life realizes the impossibility of that and returns to die he was exceedingly well drawn and sadly all too comprehensible sigrid herself was difficult to understand and identify with at first in the turmoil of living in war torn berlin she is consumed with thoughts of her love affair with egon and focuses on memories of her emotional sexual tie with him to remove her from her brutal day to day existence i could imagine such thoughts as a good escape valve however as the book goes on i often felt that i didn't know her or understand her motivations even though we read her first person account i was left feeling that while sigrid tells us her actions she never really thinks very much aside from obsessive musing on her sexual encounters with men for example sigrid never says to herself egon is a good and upright person who doesn't deserve the treatment that he receives from the nazi government i believe this to the extent that i will endanger myself to save unfairly targeted jews or my beloved nurse was a jew or my best friend in elementary school was a jew her motivation for endangering herself is unclear and unconvincing although we are probably supposed to extrapolate it from the relationship with egon i'm sorry mr gillham almost every woman that i know obsesses on her relationship with her beloved one and its meaning not on her sex acts with that person i still would have given this book 5 stars despite all the titillating sex scenes except for view spoiler the rape when egon rapes sigrid out of rage shoving her against a wall and telling her to take this back to her marital bed i almost closed the book this in my view is where the author really failed to comprehend his main character as a woman being violently raped by a loved one is the ultimate betrayal in which you as a person are reduced to a receptacle for another's rage well it would be something that at the very least sigrid would dwell on for the remainder of the book and it would certainly color perhaps destroy her love for egon instead sigrid relates the incident matter of factly and continues to worship egon scan the streets for a glimpse of him review their other sexual encounters etc etc etc hide spoiler without this incident i thought the complexity of egon's character was well depicted as a targeted minority pushed to the wall to try and survive as a man deeply injured by grief loss and societal wrongs with other reviewers i failed to understand the meaning of sigrid's affair with wolfram the war injured brother of her neighbors if i were cynical i'd say it was an opportunity for many more sexy bodice ripping scenes in sleazy hotels it's hard to believe that we're supposed to imagine that sigrid was planning for the denouement way back in that relatively early section of the book when she'd barely become involved with the anti nazi underground i suppose we're intended to think that wolfram is a consolation prize since egon is unavailable i don't know as a lesbian if heterosexual women are usually enticed by strangers presenting their hard ons to them in stairwells but i find it hard to believe that they are what i think that the author was probably attempting to do was to debunk the common stereotypes of virgin whore and depict sigrid as a passionate woman who doesn't shrink from seeking solace in her sexual relationships with men it was a good attempt and sigrid was a woman who did develop a sense of her own authority and acted on it in the climactic final scenes fast paced and suspenseful her actions were believable and admirable it's just her inner life and emotions that didn't persuade oh yeah minor but distracting point gillham thanks his editor in the acknowledgments and she really did not deserve the praise there were half a dozen or more lapses of continuity and flat out mistakes in the book that were so glaring that i started keeping track at one point sigrid finds a dirty playing card that depicts someone she knows later on it's termed a postcard very different just one of too many such errors glad you liked your editor mr gillham but in future i'd find someone with actual skills so that you don't torment your readers to this extent again","934":"he book wo this is a strange novel it is not a bad novel it is just strange the first thing that is strange about is that the characters are not particularly likable sigrid the heroine lives in berlin during the second war world while she is not a party member her mother in law is and sigrid's husband is serving on the front sigrid's life changes in two ways one is before her husband leaves and the second occurs when a young girl asks her for a favor slowly sigrid wakes up to life tthe book works because it is not concerned with the fall of berlin and focuses on those in the nazi regime who fought against it in a variety of ways the book is strange because as in any times of war morality because conflicted it is hard to not only do the right thing but harder to know what the right thing is which is what this book looks at at times you want to smack sigrid for being so stupid or obsessed with her body yet she is basically good in many ways the reader takes on the role of one of the supporting characters strange but good worth reading if interested in world war ii","935":"this is an intelligently written look at german civilian life during the war although not a thriller it has a suspenseful plot","936":"great story couldn't put it down loved the way that sigrids life changed and the decisions that she had to make","937":"complex with a plot that took a lot of effort to follow this very much generating the feeling of life in berlin during the middle of the war for someone who was not the least impressed with the nazis and their gestapo apes one of the most interesting historical fiction books i've ever read wish it came with cliffs notes","938":"i saw that my friend debi could not put this down so i picked it up wow amazing story beautiful writing and completely absorbing i can't believe a man wrote this definitely reminds me of wally lamb it was truly gripping","939":"i listened to this book and about half way through i skipped to the last disc and felt i lost nothing by doing so obviously this book gave insight to german women in wwii but the lead character was not one i wanted to continue","940":"interesting plotgood character descriptionsseems almost realethical decisionsreally puts you with the charactersreminding me a lot of foyles war and the way the stories have so many plots and subplots and you are wondering how it will end","941":"3 5 5 stars took a bit to get into and felt the story was somewhat predictible and contrived interesting to see life in berlin during 1943","942":"such a good read and i'm impressed in many ways most notably that this is the author's first book it's a male author writing very well from a female perspective and every part of the story is very believable no 'stretches' of the imagination view spoiler i thought that was happening in one aspect of the story egon's family but was very happy when i found out i was mistaken hide spoiler i've read a few books with wwii as the backdrop but this was different because it was written about 'ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances' the author's words in berlin 1943 i grew to love and respect one of the primary characters sigrid and quite a few other characters that played a major role in the story i also grew to immensely dislike quite a few characters as well it was full of intrigue with many tense moments a real page turner certainly a world i can't imagine always having to watch your back not knowing who you can trust a world of air raids basement shelters and curfews and all these scenes written as if you were right there with the chactersnot to be overlooked this is a book that should leave you asking yourself what would i have done under the circumstances i was left thinking what a mark someone can leave in the world even when it would be easier safer to turn away along the same thought one of my favorite quotes in the book page 301 is possibly their chances are not very good there are certainly plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong but one hopes otherwise one must believe otherwise what else can be done","943":"powerful and makes you reflect on what you would do if you found yourself in the same situation the characters are strong and come to life an excellent read","944":"set in berlin toward the end of the world war ii i read city of women with some trepidation i'm cautious about reading books about good germans and this is about sigrid who on the surface is a perfect wife of a soldier at the eastern front in russia i am leery amid the nazi destruction to grant that there certainly must have been a few good germans who opened their eyes and saw the pain and destruction and what i liked about this novel beyond the terrific pacing and the twists and turns of the plot was that the main character opened her eyes and saw what was happening the jews being rounded up the lies and the propaganda of the nazi war effort truly caroline author of lie and the upcoming before my eyes","945":" this will be brief given i finished this three weeks ago and shockingly didn't love it i still gave it 4 stars because of the sweep of it the narrative of women in berlin and the journey of sigrid herself but i was pretty darn bored for the whole first half to two thirds of the book after chapters and chapters of nothing much happening but steamy sex scenes which did not advance the story or characters at all it was pleasantly surprising to find oneself in the middle of actual plot movement the last chase scene through the city is incredibly well done once again i eye rolled myself through a series of graphic sex scenes that did nothing for the plot or characters is this a male author what a shocker yes don't be that guy actually i take it back the sex scenes do nothing for sigrid or her jewish paramour whose name i've forgotten because i find him just that fascinating i thought the plot around the half jewish nazi wolfram is that his name including the sex scenes much less physically graphic yet somehow leaving more of an impression of both his and sigrid's characters did more for both his and sigrid's characters and a bit for the plot you knew that was going somewhere by the time we found out more about the paramour i really didn't care who cares how sigrid felt about him and why really what's to love about him as a person all we heard about was how good he was in the sack and how much he complimented sigrid's physical attributes super duper that's what happens when your husband is cold and absent even when he's present sex is all it takes to make you think you love someone i give sigrid more credit than that it didn't make sense by then you care far more about frau weiss and her daughters about wolfram about the rest of the safe house people the writing was quite good i just didn't care for most of the story because boring which takes some doing for a wwii book for me last half to third though all well done","946":" had a hard time with beginning of this book but kept plugging along as this is the place and era that i'm most interested in and its good ratings kept me reading to find why others liked it i wasn't disappointed the second half of the book well made up for the rather dull beginning the story became one of emotional twists and turns intrigue and danger one well worth being told it's the story of resistance by ordinary germans to the nazi regime while not being described as true one can imagine it happening just as described after world war ii there was an understandable uproar at the unbelievably horrific treatment of human beings mostly jews by the nazi's the german people as a nation were indicted for complicity it was asked how could they not know what was going on and knowing why didn't they do something to stop the madness this book helps show the culture of fear that kept people in line and it shows how some overcame their own fears and the will to live to help others i was sad when it ended","947":"well written prose hence the 4th star i struggled a bit with the story itself i would not have made the same interpersonal relationship choices but that's my personal preference and not a fault of the plot edited to add dropped the star rating down feel like i've been over rating it's a good promising first read but i struggled with the characters","948":"well written novel but for some reason i just didn't care about what happened to these characters enough to finish up the last third of the book","949":" city of women by david r gilham i really wanted to like this book i love to read novels when the setting and time is character but unfortunately this novel was not my cup of tea everyone else seems to like it if i was not truthful my readers of my blog would not trust me everyone has their own likes and dislikes i could tell you which is true i just finished a novel pretty long could that have been the reason not sure i had other distractions that is true the novel's cover took my breath away i wanted to read this novel because it was not about jews in germany during ww2 it was about all the women left as most of the men went to war the story gave a historical perspective of what it was like to live in berlin during the war the bombs going off who do you trust and can speak to will someone rat you out because they want a piece of cheese hearing the bombs going off and everyone hiding in the basement to be safe sigrid husband is off to war she is left behind living with her mother in law she has a dull job and a dull life working in the patent office she has a jewish lover and then meets erika erika is hiding jews it took me 100 pages to finally get into the novel then it read like a espionage movie with trench coat and fog in berlin i could feel and smell berlin and the bombs but then the last 100 pages it lost me somewhere there was too many places and names i became totally confused i did like the author using german on every page that you did not loose the tone or the mood i don't know what happened it may have been me i would like to try reading again another time because i feel so bad i did not like this novel i was totally confused and from the beginning of the book i found myself flipping back and forth trying to figure it out i just could not comprehend the novel i was hoping it would get better but it didn't i could tell the last 50 pages it felt suspenseful but i just did not get it one part she told her lover the truth i got so mad why would she tell anyone what she was doing you can't trust anyone german is she crazy if someone could explain to me after her husband decides he is going back to serve i seem to have lost it and not make sense the author would flip in characters one minute he was talking about one person the next someone else i promise in the next few months i am going to try to re read for the second time maybe i was rushing it to review i don't read novels that have sex scenes i am yes a prude but i do understand it i got over the use of crude language and the sex scenes i understand the reason because war is cruel and raw sex had to be in the scenes to make the scenes raw and real and crude if you are shy i would not recommend reading","950":"i would give this 3 5 stars if i could i really enjoyed this book the story is complex and page turning and it tells a side of wwii we don't usually see sigrid transforms over the course of the novel into a woman with courage and heart a true hero i wasn't as enamored with her lover and i'm not sure why she was and one angle to this story is a bit pat too much for my tastes but overall i really enjoyed this read and i would recommend it to anyone looking for compelling fiction mixed with history and suspense","951":"brilliant really got the ambience of the place during the war and you can see the process of brainwashing","952":"while the horror of war and the difficult decisions people had to make in wartime berlin is fascinating and engaging for the reader the writing itself is a bit clunky particularly in the first half of the book the dialogue in particular seems to improve as the story progresses","953":"in this powerful debut david gillham gives voice to the remarkable women left to defend the home front in war torn berlin he masterfully juxtaposes their courage and determination in the face of opposition with fear loneliness and despair impeccably told city of women is a sensual suspenseful read filled with extraordinary characters and exceptional moments of resilience humanity and grace","954":"the whole time i was reading the book i didn't like it very much i could not care very much for any of the characters however in the end the premise is one that makes you think and that is something i very much appreciate in a book worthwhile","955":" i've read so many books on the holocaust and on world war ii in general both non fiction and novels but this one is for me unique gillham gives us a glimpse into what life was like for the average german in berlin during the war and it turns out that it wasn't all that easy food was rationed clothes were rationed and everything you did or said could call the gestapo to your door while the nazi regime was evil incarnate this book makes it easier to understand why more everyday germans may not have had the courage to stand up against that evil they may have wanted to but they simply were trying to keep themselves alive i do have some quibbles with this book there are a few inconsistencies with timing sigrid learns her husband has been wounded four days before she got the official letter but when she arrives at work the next day the office has already heard that she's received a letter and the overuse of italics was a bit grating and while gillham wanted to write a book full of strong courageous women i am not sure that they would necessarily have been expressing their strength through adultery and multiple bed partners that said this is a gripping read that gives a unique perspective on the war in germany and how frightening it must have been for any of its citizens not simply the jews though they were obviously in the most danger it's also refreshing to see that even in nazi germany there were people who wanted to do the right thing and protect the weak and dispossessed as gillham asks in the afterword what would you do when faced with the prospect of putting yourself in grave danger by helping others i have been thinking about that during this entire book but even now i'm not sure what choice i would have made if ericha had grabbed my arm in the cinema and asked me to cover for her","956":"i really enjoyed reading this book it was a sad book during the 2nd ww in germany it was about the german people and what they went through during the war i have this thing for this type of book i don't know why it reminded me a bit of those who save us","957":"i received this book as a first reads giveaway from good reads berlin and its women are made tangible as allied bombs tear the city and its citizens asunder the story focuses on sigrid a soldier's wife who finds passion empathy and fortitude among the chaos and horrors of the nazi regime david gillham's debut novel makes us ask what would i do and the answer for sigrid at least is neither black nor white but somewhere in the grey war torn city of women","958":" a quick paced thriller set in wwii berlin where the allied bombs fall nightly and nothing can be trusted sigrid is a young woman with an absent husband and a vile mother in law who finds herself thrust into an entanglement with a secret lover and a mysterious young woman that could easily get her killed all sorts of twists and turns and a few surprises while some of it is predictable i was so involved in the story that i could forgive this flaw worth the time to find and four stars overall for the longer review please go here http www epinions com review david_","959":" outstanding transporting such good writing and such insightful handling of both the themes and material the settings are alive for me now and the characters within them i do a heap of reading in this time period this book brought me there and its atmosphere will stay with me so strongly i may have to be careful not to be overly influenced by it in my own writing first and foremost a powerfully good story and then so many lovely layers of meaning embedded and arising through absolutely irresistible writing surprises satisfaction and beautiful developments so happy i made time for this and once i started i relished the way it drew me through","960":"reading this book after having read in the garden of beasts this story is told from an entirely different perspective but is the same setting berlin during ww ii once i finish this book i will compare and contrast the two stories","961":" it is 1943--the height of the second world war with the men away at the front berlin has become a city of women on the surface sigrid schroder is the model german soldier's wife she goes to work every day does as much with her rations as she can and dutifully cares for her meddling mother in law all the while ignoring the horrific immoralities of the regime but behind this facade is an entirely different sigrid a woman of passion who dreams of her former jewish lover now lost in the chaos of the war but sigrid is not the only one with secrets--she soon finds herself caught between what is right and what is wrong and what falls somewhere in the shadows between the two the first few pages of city of women were slow and confusing but after that the book quickly got interesting i love world war ii fiction and this one was very good the fact that it was written in the present tense was unusual historical fiction usually isn't considering that it's historical of course the use of present tense has the effect of making the book and the story feel much more immediate as if it's actually unfolding right in front of your eyes as if the events could perhaps be changed if everything is told in the past one kind of knows that it's already finished and one is powerless to change anything of course it's really the same in present tense it's just an illusion this book is all about appearances and what lies beneath them sigrid seems so dutiful doing what she's supposed to do but like the girl who she helps at the beginning of the book she has secrets that she's hasn't shared with anyone it's also about hidden desires of which sigrid has many her friend renate openly cavorts about with men but sigrid hides her past and the fact that she's lonely i must say that i didn't like the secret romance at all the man seemed like a jerk and he didn't seem to respect or even love sigrid very much at all city of women was way more steamy than i expected it to be sex is basically what the entire first half focuses on it doesn't have a huge amount of historical detail but just enough that the book doesn't feel flat city of women focuses as you might expect on the women left in berlin and how they're coping with the war and with loneliness each in their different ways the descriptions of the rationing and the wounded were really compelling the phrase books vanished from the shops along with such items as soap tooth powder sewing needles eggs and wool socks and though many boys did return home they did so missing limbs pg 54 there's not much food at all sigrid living with her mother in law subsists mostly on soup city of women is a great blend of history and fiction there are perhaps too many novels set during world war ii and city of women attempts to offer a fresh perspective i don't know if it entirely succeeded but i enjoyed reading about the war from a german perspective albeit a german who is not fond of hitler and his regime although the book thief also does that and is a better book i really enjoyed the whole plot with fraulein kohl or ericha just like sigrid she has a lot of secrets and she causes a lot of trouble for sigrid too at one point she steals some winter clothes that sigrid and her mother in law were donating to for soldiers at the front i was annoyed at her for that ericha seemed kind of clueless that she was jeopardizing so many people's lives besides her own sigrid eventually becomes involved in the underground movement and that for me was where the book really picked up that was the best part of the book i didn't care to read about sigrid's affair city of women is certainly a work of historical fiction for adults but it's worth reading and i enjoyed it thanks to berkley trade for sending me a review copy of the paperback edition www novareviews blogspot com","962":"this book didn't add anything new to the countless fictionalized wwii narratives i've read over the years a good read but nothing extrordinary","963":"loved this book it is exactly the sort of book i have been wanting to read one that gives real details about daily life during the second world war this one includes the challenges between good and evil who do you trust who not how would you feel if asked to harbour a jew could you turn your back on jewish children knowing they would be sent to death if you didn't help the book also seems to be realistic by not including a great many male characters since during the war this was the real way of life the main character sigrid seems to be stuck living with a mother in law she hates waiting for a husband she's luke warm about to return from the war whilst trying to keep doing her job and coping with the lack of food and the constant request to give more of yourself your money your clothes etc for the war effort the book sometimes surprises you with how cheap life is and you have to remind yourself how recently most of these actions took place definitely one to put on a school exam syllabus for perhaps a levels or gcse's look forward to reading other books by david gillham","964":"phenomenal when i got to the last page my jaw was hanging open and i had to catch my breath the author does a masterful job creating a suspenseful moving and sensual story the novel follows the awakening of sigrid it's heroine from powerless and indifferent witness to a brave and passionate rescuer of some of histories most vulnerable victims this book is an absolute must read for those who enjoy reading about the holocaust and world war ii in the authors' own words what would any of us do","965":"while i admit i could not stop reading this one i also found it both unbelievable and a bit overly dramatic at times","966":" if you have wondered as i have what life was like for ordinary women in nazi germany you will be fascinated by city of women this engrossing novel considers both the internal and external lives of everyday people during a time of moral challenge and physical deprivation good and evil are sometimes entwined life changing choices are sometimes made in the flash of a moment first time novelist gillham does a remarkable job of capturing the thoughts and feelings of a woman who wakens to her own morality","967":"i really loved this book it at times reminded me of casablanca i loved the authors writing syle i highly recommend it to all historical fiction fans particularly those interested in the wwii years and especially those who enjoy reading books with strong female characters","968":" set in berlin in 1943 this is a novel that shows how the civilians left on the home front during wwii mostly women coped with the bombings shortages and psychological weight of evidence that despite official assurances they are losing the war the main character sigrid lives a monotonous and constricted life working at a patent office and coming home each night to a hateful mother in law even before her husband left for the war she had been having an affair with a jewish man a young woman assigned to be a mother's helper to sigrid's neighbor gradually draws sigrid into her clandestine work hiding fugitives the tension builds as it increasingly impossible to know who to trust and where betrayal may come from especially with the stakes so high for the first half of the book i found myself less than enchanted with the attitude of many of the female characters' attitudes towards sexual encounters it felt very much like the author a man assumed women think about sex the same way men do but in the second half of the book there was more of an emphasis on the intricate and dangerous attempts to help the fugitives and overall it captured the weight and devastation of war in every aspect of people's lives i was particularly fascinated with sigrid's relationship with her husband when he is wounded and returns home a changed man","969":"loved it lots of twists","970":"just finished this for book club tonight historical fiction a little raw but a very strong story hard to imagine living life they way these people had to during war time","971":"great book just finished it u0026amp it's lingering like a good book will giving you that woke up from a slumber feeling","972":"i thought this book was fantastic with the imperfect characters and the impossible choices they are facing and amazing research as well i am sort of an expert on berlin so i can confidently say that the level of historical work is also very impressive","973":"i wanted to bail on this book because i struggled to connect with the main character for a while but i stuck with it because a friend raved about it although main character sigrid felt distant throughout the story had me turning pages needing to know what happened next don't quit on this one surprise surprise i ended up really liking it","974":"3 5 5 starsi have to be honest it took me about 100 pages to get into this book i liked the writing of the book but the storyline honestly left me cold focused with a lot of sex and typical characters i wasn't thrilled with the book and kept pushing it aside then after that one hundred pages it clicked and the book took off i still feel that the characters were somewhat predictable and stereotypish but i loved the storyline","975":"a book group choice that i was quite excited to read i have read plenty of books about the second world war but they have always been from a male perspective this book is about the women left behind in berlin while the males are away fighting for the fuhrer it started off really well and i could not put it down the writing style flowed really well and it had just the correct amount of jumping between timelines to improve the story without leaving you confused the characters were interesting and just the right amount were introduced to keep your attention without confusing you with too many expecially with german names that could have been difficult to follow after reading about a third of the novel i did anticipate that the story would go in a certain direction so i was pleasantly surprised to find it moving a completely different way which changed the whole feel of the book it is difficult to read and to write i guess about the crimes that were committed in the name of war at that time but the author got the balance right for me there was just enough detail to let you feel what was happening but he also managed to get across the difficulty the women of berlin had to do anything about it even if they wanted to the natural urge to survive and protect yourself while ignoring what is going on around you must have been a hard decision for a lot of people to make the author made it all believable for me i have dropped one star as i thought the last third of the book got slightly frantic and the plot a bit too complicated and slightly unbelievable it became a struggle to keep up with who was who and for whom each person was actually working i still am not sure who was actually double crossing the rest at the end and whether sigrid or ericha was actually the leader this did not spoil the book as a whole but i just felt it could have been handled slightly better and i would then have rushed to give it 5 out of 5 an interesting and enjoyable read and one which will make for a great discussion 4 out of 5 posted by saucy at 9 42 am","976":"i'm always surprised when a male author can capture the heart of a woman a good story though a bit spotty in places","977":"this was an excellent work of historical fiction centering around wartime berlin at the beginning of the holocaust well written and thought provoking and i found it interesting that all of the main characters in this book were women the men were kind of an afterthought","978":"i loved this book i don't know if its because i have an affinity for the language the twists u0026amp turns the scenery it was all astounding it has a very tragic backstory...finished it in 1 5 days","979":"the twists and turns make this quite an interesting book that got even better in the second half of the book i would give it four and a half stars","980":"a simply stunning novel set in germany during world war ii how unique to read a historical fiction book set during world war ii that shows the life of a german wife at home sigrid is a unique woman but she herself does not see it every day she gets up and goes to work and comes home to an overbearing mother in law who she does not care for and the feeling is mutual her husband a soldier is away but it is clear that she is not missing him very much sigrid becomes involved in the business of helping jewish men women and children out of germany very dangerous business indeed not only will the consequences affect her but those closest to her all the while sigrid wonders what became of her jewish lover and dreams of him constantly i found the writing to completely gripping from the synopsis i knew this was going to be a good one but i don't think i was prepared for how good the writing reflected the story suspenseful not knowing what's around the corner not knowing if you're being followed the story was not so much action packed but the writing felt like it was i would zip through pages and pages before i even realized how much time had gone by i was completely absorbed in the story holding my breath the ending was to my liking it was the perfect ending for a story taking place during a war the story was a mix suspense mystery thriller all in the middle of a very intense time and place how very suffocating i felt while reading something that i'm sure i would have felt if i had actually been experiencing the events in the book a definite winner i would be surprised if city of women didn't become a bestseller","981":"enjoyed this novel well written","982":"intense storytelling that explores a side of wwii that i haven't encountered often in literature","983":"i loved this book i tend to go into these books with a not another ww2 book attitude and yet i was quickly won over powerful honest a unique perspective of the war as well it is truly a book about women","984":"an excellent read showing another dimension of wwii i felt it portrayed what it must have been like in berlin during the war it makes the reader wonder what decisions they would make in the same position","985":"fascinating historical novel about berlin during wwii","986":"an eye opening book about the many sacrifices that people make when wartime challenges their humanity and morals well written","987":"pretty good novel not sure if it is entirely historically accurate but interesting and well written nonetheless","988":"this is the story of berlin during wwii i will tell you that there are many players in this book and there is a lot that is going on throughout the book but that is what makes it so dang good sigrid schroeder is the wife of a german soldier and lives with her mother in law in an apartment in berlin before she knows it she is involved in hiding and moving jews out of berlin throughout the entire book you are never sure who you can trust and who you can't just when you think that you have it all figured out and the latest group of jews are going to be moved to safety the rug is ripped out from under you what you thought you knew is garbage this book is full of suspense and i thought that it was so well done and absolutely totally believable i found myself transported to 1940's germany and many times hyperventilating or holding my breath with the situations that we find sigrid getting herself into are you interested in suspense stories are you interested in wwii then i would say that this is the book for you give it a try and you will not be disappointed","989":" so meh this is not the book for me i was lent this book on recommendation and while the plot sounded intriguing it failed to deliver sigrid the main character is a lonely woman living in berlin during the second world war i was expecting a novel that centered on her relationship with other women in the story but instead this story focuses on her relationships with various male characters from what i can tell she has an insatiable sexual appetite and regards almost every other female in the story with some level of disdain i was hoping for an exploration of heightened female solidarity and the ways in which wartime affects women distinctly from men but this just read like the adventures of internalized misogyny is it still internalized when the book is written by a dude anyway i don't have time for this kind of crap plus gillham's writing style is kind of obnoxious","990":"i enjoyed it but at times it moved slowly","991":" what would you do if you lived in berlin in 1943 you are not a supporter of hitler you are silent and living on rations going to the shelter to avoid bombs that are being dropped on the city nightly you start to see atrocities taking place all around you would you be willing to go outside your comfort zone put your life on the line by helping jews if your husband is away fighting for the ss in russia would you consider taking on a lover what would you do thank goodness i never had to make these kinds of decisions this book would be excellent for a book club discussion","992":"what would you do if you were sigrid i can't get that question out of my mind read this and see if you can answer the question i would recommend this book highly","993":" after weeks of re reading an array of alan furst and david downing wwii era espionage novels i wasn't yet ready to leave that historical period but found myself looking for something i hadn't read before this book nicely filled the bill though in certain basic ways it's different than the others to begin with the main character is an unlikely heroine sigrid schroeder is a childless hausfrau in 1943 berlin she works as a typist stenographer for a legal patent firm her husband is serving on the russian front and she lives with her rather sour and meddling mother in law to all appearances she's a model aryan wife and citizen when the book begins sigrid's life has become mired in dull and oppressive routine she goes to work comes home tries to make do with increasingly more sparse and miserable rations she endures her mother in laws harsh critical comments but it turns out there's way more to the younger 'frau schroeder' than she allows the world and even herself to see because of a series of small events and spur of the moment decisions the 'real' sigrid slowly emerges and she begins to surprise herself first she shields a neighbor's service girl from the police which eventually leads to sigrid working with a disperate group of individuals who are hiding jews and smuggling them out of germany though the books starts out a bit slowly it quickly picks up speed i especially appreciated the various plot twists that kept the surprises coming even as they helped tighten the suspense it may seem odd to say this but in its way this is a coming of age novel though the heroine is around 30 when the story begins but her awakening is nonetheless profound","994":"i brought this book to my friend's cottage to read if i had a moment once i started i couldn't put it down the intertwined lives of these german women who are a part of a war that was not their choosing and the choices they made to be true to themselves was inspiring it constantly has me thinking what would i do how far would i go","995":"the book was fast paced and fascinating portrait of wwii berlin as someone who has read a lot of these books i found that gillihan introduced a new and interesting perspective on that time his protagonist and her inner circle are all nuanced highly complex characters i found myself invested in all of them in different ways i highly recommend this book even if or perhaps especially if you think you've already read it all when it comes to the holocaust and wwii","996":"loved loved loved this book it kept me guessing right until the end i read a lot of wwii novels set in france or england had never read one set in germany i also thought the author did a good job on character development and look forward to a second book from him","997":"this one started a little slow for me especially since hf is one of my favorite genre's although once she started getting more involved it really picked up pace this one put another spin on ww2 that i haven't read and i really enjoyed it it really picked up pace 3 4 through but it was still a great read the whole way for anyone that enjoys hf i would highly recommend it","998":"3 and 1 2 a very unique perspective on germans trying to survive during wwii makes you think if you you would be willing to risk everything for what is right interesting women characters","999":"one woman's journey to do what's right suspenseful heroic and romantic everything you would hope for in berlin during wwii","1000":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here if you are a student of the holocaust you may find this novel more educational than much nonfiction of course you know there were judenrats who sometimes with the best of intentions worked with the nazis to send other jews to their deaths but did you know there were jewish catchers who worked with the gestapo to uncover jews who were passing or hidden the situations depicted in this book are mirrored in israel today there is the elderly jewish holocaust survivor who remembered when germa if you are a student of the holocaust you may find this novel more educational than much nonfiction of course you know there were judenrats who sometimes with the best of intentions worked with the nazis to send other jews to their deaths but did you know there were jewish catchers who worked with the gestapo to uncover jews who were passing or hidden the situations depicted in this book are mirrored in israel today there is the elderly jewish holocaust survivor who remembered when germans wouldn't rent to jews and swore that he would never be like that so he rented rooms to arab students only to be forced to evict them when his neighbors denounced him as an arab lover and he received death threats there is the jewish holocaust survivor who has risked her life to join humanitarian aid flotillas to gaza there are jews who risk being shot when trying to defend palestinian homes from being demolished by the israeli army there are jewish women who illegally take palestinian women on day trips out of besieged gaza so that they can visit the beach and museums there are jewish israeli teachers who work in a school where jewish and palestinian students study together and learn mutual respect but these few are people who openly stand for human rights can they be the only ones what if there are israeli jews who in the same way that sigrid ericha and old auntie pretended to be loyal to hitler while secretly helping jews are pretending to be loyal arab hating and black hating israelis while secretly smuggling food and medicine to palestinians or hiding black refugees so that they won't be deported or attacked by lynch mobs is it possible that these decent people exist but cannot show themselves i have to hope so but only history will eventually reveal the truth many readers have mentioned that gillham's book made them think but how much have they thought i'm still thinking and i'm almost sorry i didn't give city of women five stars instead of four but i too have my prejudices and i favor nonfiction therefore the fault is mine not the author's more","1001":"good story great narration not a feel good book and not really about war except for what had to happen while the men were away","1002":"gorgeous writing with vivid biting descriptions of inner dialogue and the emotional development of the complex interesting characters this author took an old story nazi germany and created an addicting tale of love friendship desperation and bravery i could not put this book down i highly recommend it","1003":"do you see this it's for you yuck bad soft porn dialogue written by another misguided male the third time i read this insipid refrain i had to give up","1004":"actually i give this three and a half stars while i have read many books that are set during world war ii this one was different as it was told from the viewpoint of a german woman and gives a look at what life was like for german citizens during this time the story started out slow but soon picked up with mnay twists and turnes so many near the end that i reached a point where it all got confusing","1005":"terribly sad and scary as women try to save just a few individuals during wwii often ending unsuccessfully but unbelievable strength and believable faith in what they were actually doing was amazing beware there is foul language i listened on tape","1006":"amy einhorn has done it again a powerful novel that finds an untold story in a well known part of history and tells it with rich complicated characters flawed and heroic both main protagonists and supporting characters are confused and confusing with the kind of ambiguities and conflicted loyalties that each of us experience in our ordinary lives and that must have been all the more intensified in wwii era germany the book opens quietly and builds excitement until you're ripping through the last pages then settles with an ending of quiet beauty that will linger in your mind","1007":"this is good historical fiction and development of a character from one who is self absorbed whiney needy etc to one who thinks outside of herself and takes on a cause believable and a good writing style with enough build up and pace of the story arc to keep one turning the pages","1008":" war relationships sex gender roles all complicated complicated stuff i think that sometimes it's tempting to read a book and judge the characters to take the moral high ground to think i would never do that but i think that sometimes the world isn't so very black and white we like to think that we know what we would do in certain circumstances but when faced with the uphevel of war i imagine the boundaries of life shift i was hesitant to pick up this book and i am most ww ii stories but this story was told from what was for me a brand new and fresh perspective that made me question what would i do","1009":" wwii germany the deprivation and horrors of war from a german woman's perspective sigrid lives in a dismal 4th floor walk up with her miserable hateful mother in law while her husband is soldiering through a chance encounter sigrid is drawn into a disorganized group helping jews escape the country a very dark story while reading this book i never pictured anything other than in black and white about 3 4 of the way through i thought i could not stand the misery for one more moment but i stayed with it and i'm glad the ending was unexpected and gripping and satisfying the reader is of course left with the question what would i have done","1010":"set in berlin towards the end of ww2 the lives of berliners - from fanatical hitler supporters to those who conform to those who secretly actively or passively oppose and whether they support the nuremberg laws or abhor them - are depicted vividly the vital questions who do you trust who do you love who can be saved - form the basis for an engrossing story based around an ordinary german housewife living with her bitter mother in law as her husband is at the front she becomes involved with a group who help escaping jews and there is tension around the fear of discovery the secret messages and the near moments of entrapment or discovery as well as the old torments of how much her lover is committed to her the writer is perceptive about the various motives for people's actions and their frequent inability to explain their choices","1011":" what would you do the question any book set in wwii germany will ask our heroine sigrid lives in berlin in 1943 and germany is losing the war being bombed constantly by the british but the state tells the inhabitants everything is fine they are winning even though the bbc broadcasts a different story the author does a really fine job of transporting the reader into that time into that city you can feel the drabness and fear of what life was to exist in the city there is high suspense along with some pretty steamy sex just enough to keep you reading at a quick pace","1012":"one word for this book meh","1013":"a really intersting book about german women during world war 2 berlin this is a new point of view for me","1014":"beautiful writing and intriguing story but almost too painful in parts for me to read i had to put this book down several times so it too me several months to read that's probably more my fault than the author's but i don't know what to do with that the older i get the more sensitive i am to reading about pain and fear","1015":"despite a slow beginning and a fairly predictable ending the book engages the reader with twists turns and constantly changing character relationships which draws in and holds the reader's attention","1016":"full of historical details about the city the time period and how to exist and behave in such historical times i loved the combination a book i went through quickly worth reading","1017":" gillham does a terrific job of taking us back in time to 1943 in war torn berlin this is a time when cracks were beginning to appear in the german people's faith in the nazi regime they had been told that the war in russia was all but won but this dream was shattered by the fall of stalingrad and the total annihilation of a german army not only that but after a year's absence the raf were again bombing berlin on a nightly basis the nazi's response to this in a desperate effort to distract the german people from their plight was to declare total war and speed up the evacuation of the jews to the death camps in poland young boys and older men were being subscripted into the army and sent to the frontline berlin was indeed a city of women amputees children and old men however there were still plenty of people who stood behind hitler and willing to denounce anyone who criticized him against this background we are introduced to our main character sigrid schroder she is a young woman who taken at face value is a typical soldier's wife her husband is fighting on the eastern front while she lives with and looks after her mother in law but sigrid has her secrets in her quiet moments she dreams of a past affair with a jewish lover who now appears to have disappeared she tries to get on with her life without making too many waves going to work and living off her rations then one day while she is sitting in a cinema a young neighbour ericha kohl grabs her arm and asked for her help in deceiving the gestapo from that moment sigrid is drawn into the german resistant helping jews homosexuals and deserters to evade the clutches of the nazi regime everything about this book is excellent there is a real depth to the literary style of this author plus a range of interesting characters as well as a number of surprising twists and turns to the book which sweeps you along and keeps you turning the pages this is the author's first novel i can't wait for the next one","1018":"this book tells a tell of ordinary german women who do extraordinary things during ww ii the characters are well written with humanness to them that you were able to relate to","1019":"interesting topic and learned a lot but didn't find the main character totally believable and some things wrapped up too well","1020":"city of women depicts life in berlin during the war a city with intrigue and double dealing left mostly to the women who were at home while their men fought in the battlefields this book is written beautifully i listen to the audio book which was very well read i was captured end enraptured","1021":"in 1943 berlin sigrid schroder has fallen into a mind numbing routine repetitive steno work and then home to an emotionally distant husband and a mother in law who has never wanted her for her son life begins to change when a woman asks for her help in a movie theater and she is approached by a very charming man with whom she becomes intimately involved both incidents awaken her to the reality of the nazi regime and slowly she begins to weigh what's right and wrong what's moral or not and what determines the differences not everyone is who they seem to be but then who is it's a page turner the characters are well drawn the story is intricately interwoven as the suspense builds to the end which is really a beginning","1022":"city of women is david gillham first novel it is about the second world war every word is beautifully wrote in every sentence i recommend this book to readers who like reading novels about the second world war there are lots of topic's for book clubs open for a discussion david gillham is new author to keep a look out for in the future i reckon david gillham could be up for awards with this first novel","1023":"the setting of berlin in world war ii has been used often and i have read a lot of fiction set during that awful time but this one is unique because of its characters i kept changing my mind about how i felt about sigrid ericha egon kaspar the author has created such complex characters with complicated motivations i never knew who to trust for sure and i guess that's the point who could anybody trust in wwii germany great book","1024":" excellent well written well developed characters and a plot that kept me on the edge of my seat what will sigrid do sigrid is transformed from a bored blonde hausfrau wasting her considerable intelligence in a stenographic pool and lukewarm marriage to a fiery revolutionary risking herself to save the lives of others she goes from isolated silent self contained to out spoken passionate and part of an underground web of individuals linked by their desire to save lives i've read plenty of wwii fiction but this might be the first from a german point of view and i enjoyed the change","1025":" this novel is dark and well written for me the strongest aspect of the book is the way gillham evokes the ambiance of 1943 berlin the descriptions are vivid yet numbing and really make the reader feel the oppression and anxiety that permeate daily life the downside and reason for the lower rating is that i didn't care enough about the characters i found myself somewhat indifferent to their fates and found them a bit boring i guess i'm not sure if it was worth the emotional investment of reading something so dark without the emotional pay off of getting to know more interesting and or sympathetic characters check out my qu0026amp a with the author http www washingtonindependentrevie","1026":"as i write the overall goodreads ranking is 3 8 exactly what i'd give it if i could seeing alan furst's outstanding quote on the cover i optimistically expected a perfect five but the book fell short i'm a huge fan of books set during wwll so combining that with alan furst's approval mr gillham should have had an easy time of getting me onboard and keeping me there on the plus side city of women is a page turner it vividly portrays the atmosphere of daily life in berlin during wwll where danger and prying eyes lurk everywhere and being jewish means being never more than one step from capture and a concentration camp gillham did a great job of creating his characters giving them enough texture and individuality to make them seem real the minuses too many pat encounters too many well trained polizei following too many untrained suspects and either losing their trail or failing to take them into custody but what almost ruined the book for me was the same dumb reaction by every character in the book to every obvious question where do i work in response to where do you work i need to find a place to hide you need what this echo approach which may seem relatively minor really grated after the umpteenth occurrence finally the copy editing david gillham was effusive in his praise for his editors but at least one of them dropped the ball on more than one occasion leaving sloppy mistakes behind","1027":" it is 1943--the height of the second world war with the men away at the front berlin has become a city of women on the surface sigrid schroder is the model german soldier's wife she goes to work every day does as much with her rations as she can and dutifully cares for her meddling mother in law all the while ignoring the horrific immoralities of the regime but behind this facade is an entirely different sigrid a woman of passion who dreams of her former jewish lover now lost in the chaos of the war but sigrid is not the only one with secrets--she soon finds herself caught between what is right and what is wrong and what falls somewhere in the shadows between the two","1028":"berlin in 1943 was a city where able bodied men had to be outside the city serving in the armed forces the city then consisted of the injured and women although we often hear of germans who upon seeing the mistreatment of jews would celebrate there were many others who would silently object but who felt powerless to do anything about it sigrid was a woman whose husband was at the russian front because she had miscarried both she and husband had felt distant from each other before he left once he was gone as happened with many women in berlin she took a lover who she later found out was a jew at the same time there was a young girl in sigrid's building who saw sigrid in a movie theatre and quickly sat down next to her pleading with her to say that they were together right after sigrid does just that and ends up befriending the young girl ericha ericha is living in sigrid's building as a mother's helper assigned by the reich because she did not sing pro nazi songs over time sigrid sees that ericha keeps disappearing and as she gets more involved with ericha to try to help her it finally comes out that ericha is helping those who are being hunted by the nazis for being jews or political prisoners although sigrid is reluctant to help at first she slowly enters ericha's world and transforms from one who watches the events around her take place to one who is unafraid to stand up for what it right even at the risk of her own life there are multiple side stories within and secrets held by those around her which slowly come out so that what at first appeared one way on the surface takes on a completely different appearance as you approach the end of the book very absorbing and a different look at berlin through the eyes of germans who opposed the nazi regime","1029":"good book on berlin during wwii different twist as it follows a soldier's wife through her struggles of living under the nazi's regime definite twists and turns","1030":"couldn't be bothered finishing it it was terribly cliched u0026amp u0026amp didn't evoke the mood of the time","1031":"3 75 lots of intrigue betrayal certainly interesting viewing the war from a german housewife albeit not your normal housewife point of view odd reading this on the heels of rules of civility similar characteristics to the male protagonists","1032":" wow this was a great read for me totally unexpected i believe this was a kindle deal and i'm so glad i got it fast paced and exciting i literally was reading while standing any chance i got set in berlin at the height of ww11 this is a story of the women who are left in a city where the able men are off fighting hitler's war this story is about choices some of them made and the consequences of those choices at first i didn't really like any of the characters even while i was completely immersed in their story by the end i came to feel much differently about them and their choices this is the kind of book where you think what would i do normally i wouldn't give such a high rating to a book where i didn't love the characters but this one pulled me in within the first few pages and just never let go i had to see what sigrid would do next whether i agreed with her decisions or not of course this book is still filled with all of the nastiness and atrocities of this time in history it is hard to judge too harshly when it is almost unbelievable to imagine being faced with such a dilemma a difficult choice which must be made between undesirable alternatives great reading i highly recommend","1033":"a hard book to read because of the subject matter ww2 germany and the women left with the difficulties of keeping themselves alive it's not easy to put yourself in the place of these characters in such difficult times and as the author says what would you do what would any of us do under such horrible circumstances","1034":"there are so many reviews about this book that it is quite impossible to find more adjective or superlatives to describe it so i'll just say that it was an extraordinary read and i'm looking forward to reading mr gillhams novels for many more years","1035":"war is hell and this book does a great job showing how that hell manifests itself on a city block in berlin in the middle of wwii there were times i struggled to fill in the gaps that gillham left in fairness the gaps were deliberate but that ultimately reinforced the feeling that in times of war little is certain motives are suspect and people aren't necessarily predictable or rational","1036":" city of women asks the question if a young women you barely knew asked you for help in 1943 berlin what would you do the answer isn't an easy one i have read many books about the nazi catastrophe since i first read the diary of anne frank in hs perhaps to understsnd how such atrocities ould occur in a civilized world perhaps to understand my own responsibility as a human being to others perhaps to constantly keep myself aware that these occurances were not unique ones very like them are happening today but mostly i think to try to ask deep within myself what would i do this book is a constant question what next will the gestopo find them will the heroines manage to escape who are the people around them friend or enemy the characters are deep the situation is life or death and like life nothing is as expected i will recommend'city of women to any reader who likes to think about what they read","1037":"i think this could be one of my all time favourites powerful inspirational and emotional i was excited yet terrified and the gradual development and portrayal of the characters made me feel quite attached with them enabling me to empathise with situations i couldn't ever imagine being in the multiple twists and scenes of betrayal were surprising and kept me thoroughly captivated and the book depicted the truly courageous acts often forgotten numerous germans undertook to save the lives of many and their bravery in standing against the gestapo the best read in a long time","1038":"fave of last year great historical fiction from the perspective of many women in berlin at the end of the war","1039":"city of women is a gripping novel of german life during wwii the choices people faced to survive the alliances they made the people they betrayed it is a riveting study of female relationships of loyalty in the midst of disloyalty of what one person can do to save another or kill another if you seek a page turner city of women will suck you in and keep you breathless until the very end","1040":"interesting historical fiction set in berlin during wwii","1041":"if i wasn't reading this book for the reading cove book club i would have ditched this book before my 50 page rule however i'm glad i didn't and i'm glad i stuck it out and finished the writing style was very difficult to adjust to and i felt as if the writer was deliberately trying to confuse the reader by telling the story in the manner in which the novel started it wasn't straight forward at all in addition the characters weren't exactly lovable so the whole novel started off very rocky for me as the story progressed i began to feel for sigrid and began to understand why she behaved as she did and then i was engrossed in the story and could not put it down the way each of the characters developed was well thought out and wrapped up very well a very good story you just have to stick with it a bit at first","1042":"the choices sigrid makes can replay in your for days after you have finished the book","1043":" left in war torn berlin populated mostly with lonely women sigrid gets drawn into an underground effort to save jews her marriage is loveless her mother in law is hateful her friends are few her lover is not who he says he is and sex seems to be a commodity the one thing not rationed matching the wasteland that the war is making of berlin and relationships sigrid finds strength and courage in the midst of her own emotional wasteland the plot has a few extra twists too the book was well written but does anyone proofread any more","1044":" this is a fabulous read this is not typical \"women's fiction\" nor is it what i feared i'd find in \"wwii fiction\" a story filled with war strategy what it is is a beautifully written drama that gives the reader a tangible feel for what aspects of living on the home front in berlin emptied of most men may have been like the characters and their moral quandaries are complex and will appeal to readers not only of historical fiction but of mysteries the focus is on women the dynamics of their relations with one another but there are several important male characters and a romance so really this is the sort of book that should have broad readership highly recommended advance readers copy provided by penguin http libraryshelfblog wordpress com","1045":"i highly recommend this book a completely different perspective of wwii germany told by women","1046":" city of women is a book about a women named sigrid who is the wife of a

by the injustice that she sees happening around her and is slowly drawn into the underground world that exists to protect the ones who are being persecuted this book does a good job of bringing you into the suspense of the story this would make a good movie if you like reading stories about this time in history add this one to your list","1047":"this was interesting i think i need a break from historical novels about ww2","1048":"intimate story of war time germany when most men are at the russian front the women are left to help the old and the very young to survive how easily it is to tempt fate to become involved in the underground movement to help jews escape their terrible fates at the hands of the german ss and a time when morality means little only appetites survive well written with clear characterizations an opportunity to follow the fears desires and thoughts of germans in their german state at the end of wwii","1049":"very informative","1050":"what would you do the nagging question that swam around in my head throughout this book there were certainly some slow spots but the moral question was enough to keep me engaged in the story to the end","1051":"the characters in this book are strong and bold during a horrible place in time the book has a good twist towards the end","1052":"i tried to like this book because i usually like historical fiction but i did not like the way it was written or any of the characters however it was thought provoking what would you do","1053":"i found this narration of the behavior of the common person in berlin during ww ii to be very interesting interpretation of societal morals played by the government leads the common man to behave in ways that have an intertwining of personal and political needs the jeopardy of those out of favor with the government plays out insidiously in the community with the gotcha mentality having no boundaries","1054":"this book was written from the perspective of the women remaining in berlin during ww2 and most of the book was interesting unfortunately i thought it just dragged on a bit too long","1055":"this has been my year for reading books about germany during world war ii and the effect of the war on ordinary german citizens in this case sigrid schroder is a young married woman living with her husband and mother in law and working as a typist in a patent office in berlin she is a classic aryan german hausfrau hard working reliable and lovely to look at however she has suffered a miscarriage is only half in love with her husband and has to cope with a bitter negative mother in law who is angry at her for just about everything like so many germans sigrid is just trying to survive the war do her job find enough food to eat and hope that a bomb doesn't drop on her apartment building then one day a young woman who is working for her neighbor as a nanny approaches her in a movie theatre and asks for her help this encounter is the beginning of sigrid's transformation from a good citizen to a champion of those at risk from the gestapo it's a complicated multi layered story but quite engrossing i'm not sure it was entirely believable especially at the end when all the pieces seemed to come together a little too quickly","1056":"the book is a bit slow but it has a great twist at the end","1057":"an embarrassing overuse of italics","1058":"wow what a story this will stay with me for quite some time that's for sure","1059":"i struggled with this at the beginning but grew to really like it u0026amp was sorry when it was finished it was quite a story","1060":"the setting is really well done but i didn't connect with any of the characters","1061":"this book presents many moral dilemmas and reveals how life is full of gray areas there are many themes that would be interesting to talk about historically i found it fascinating","1062":"possible book discussion title 2013","1063":"quite well written but i must say that i really couldn't enjoy it as it was very depressing some interesting parts and i assume it was historically accurate but no humor or other light touches to keep it in balance","1064":"i enjoyed this well written page turner a whole new set of morals is in effect during war","1065":"i loved this book would give it 4 5 stars if i could couldn't put it down wondering what was going to happen to sigrid next in what was a somber topic the relationship between sigrid and her mother in law had me laughing out loud at times great read","1066":"i felt there was a bit of trickery at the end when the main character did quite a bit off stage and the reader was left out also it wasn't remotely about a city full of women with all the men gone there were men everywhere mostly shooting and stabbing each other","1067":"fabulous story","1068":"i had a hard time with this book i think it was a well told story i was certainly immersed in the dreariness of germany during wwii intrigued by the characters and was interested to find out what would happen i think the problem was that while interested i didn't really care i didn't really like the main character i felt like i understood where she was coming from husband gone to war miserable mother in law nosy neighbors disappointing mundane life i could see why she would look for excitement from other sources but her relationships with the other people she encountered in the story didn't ring true it was all so self centered i couldn't rally for her even when i found myself admiring a move it was quickly doused by the reminder that she never really did anything just for someone else's sake it still ended up being about how she could reconcile her actions it was always just about segrid and that bothered me","1069":"powerful and mind blowing","1070":" it is surprising when readers note that a title is an author's first when in fact these days most writers have written multiple novels or nonfiction and survived scores of rejections from 20 something publishing interns who are surfing the slush but i digress this novel is commendable first for its spare prose style however the verbiage is so spare that it is almost an affectation someone in the author's writing factory courses must have said that spare means bleak here the effect is to distance the reader one occasionally longs for an extra modifier or sensory detail others have discussed whether there is too much sex the sex is bold but not overly explicit one can translate the sex as a means of interpersonal control during wartime chaos or a means of asserting one's existence ultimately one of the characters has a pregnancy which gives the story a ray of hope also as another reviewer notes clandestine sex in a movie theater would be more awkward than depicted most of the focus is on sigrid the main character and that becomes somewhat claustrophobic however one can be thankful this was not written in first person the male author did a good job of portraying a woman at close range might have given it 3 5 if the system allowed for that the convoluted plot saves this novel from being too precious or studied","1071":"a profound book of women trying to survive during wwii in berlin while the german soldiers were fighting on the front the city indured bombing rades to keep safe they gathered in shelters in their basements women were doing jobs besides their paid jobs helpling jews flee out of berlin right and wrong was a balancing act an exciting read the author held the readers interest","1072":" this novel is my bookclub's selection this month it probably is better than my rating i am just a little world war ii weary lately in fact amazon gave it 4 1 2 stars but i'm not always in sync with other people's ratings this book takes place during the blitz from the perspective of people in berlin i recently read a book about the blitz from the london perspective i guess none of us know what we would do in these situations when witnessing the horrors of war but it seems to me many of these characters take extreme risks maybe after bookclub discussion later this week i will see and appreciate different views","1073":" sigrid is a young woman married to a german soldier in 1943 berlin sigrid's life is dull and lifeless while her husband is away her mother in law does not like her and makes sure sigrid knows that she is not good enough for her son kaspar and that sigrid is to blame for all that is wrong in her life including that her son was called up to be in the army as berlin is bombed by british forces sigrid finds her only respite is to attend the theater there she learns there are many people with secrets and she becomes one of them she starts an affair with a jew and then through a neighbor learns of the need for help to get jews out through the underground called u boat she becomes involved in these rescue missions all the while learning that sex with the remaining men in berlin is sometimes the only way to get extra ration cards or illegal papers for those who need to get out she finds that the women in berlin use sex for many reasons relief from boredom food decent housing and it works for her too as she sees how many jews need help somewhere along the way she learns that she is being used too but she does not give up and becomes an integral part of the u boat organization","1074":"story premise was fascinating yet i lost interesas i read further a little comedic levity could have helped balance the depressed tone","1075":"this book is a disturbing and intense thriller but it was one that i felt i had to stay with until the story was told glad i did as the ending was good","1076":"this is the story of a housewife sigrid schroder in 1943 berlin for a long time she is numb to the realities of the suffering of the jews and other persecuted people in nazi germany eventually she is drawn out of her cocoon and into the war fascinating story with fascinating characters","1077":" i picked this book from the bottom of my reading list for the 2015 pop sugar reading challenge it's overwritten crowded and unsatisfactory the conversation is generally good but the descriptions need paring they are full of extraneous and distracting detail 'good ' he said again yanking out the tail of his shirt then peeling it still buttoned over his head okay i don't mind subordinate clauses but there's too many especially in the first fifty pages where i struggled to be interested sigrid is about 30 but seemed older the passage of time since her meetings with egon which she keeps remembering is unclear what do these characters sigrid ericha egon wolfram renate kaspar really want after spending almost four hundred pages with them i expect to know them a little better sadly sigrid does not seem to understand them better either her unlikely friend her unsuitable lover the one legged officer the profligate best friend the stony husband is the mother in law right about sigrid at the end of the book sigrid and i would both like to know are you crying frau schorder sigrid wipes her eyes i can't she whispers i can't play this game with you n please just do what you're going to do perhaps the reader is meant to feel that he she is passing by these hopeless desperate people and has only their passing acquaintance because their pain makes it necessary to construct the facade that the author declines for the most part to shatter one of the most mystifying aspects of the book was the double standards and imaginary moral high grounds of the different women having multiple affairs why the casual sex of a younger woman is worse than the casual and adulterous sex of a slightly older woman makes no sense one woman chews out another for not using condoms sigrid puzzles over why other women embark on their tawdry and emotionless affairs without examining her own motives or needs what i did like the atmosphere and the characters' names i think that was one of the reasons this went onto my to read list almost three years ago the main character's name is sigrid of course if i knew there would be a german office named wolfram i might have been in more of a hurry to read it the historical portrayal of berlin was captivating and in some ways gave me the world war ii novel that i've been wanting to read a grown up novel rather than the excellent yet adolescent memoirs by anne frank or livia bitton jackson among other writers this is not dear america history this is unbarred bleakness and contains significant sexual content in parts i was reminded of the film version of the end of the affair with ralph fiennes and julianne moore tasteful is not the word for it adultery is never tasteful and when one of the adulterers is cold almost cruel and motivated by something that is definitely not love the actions become much less tasteful regardless of presentation without revealing any spoilers chapter twelve was the section that really made the book for me it's not quite halfway through and covers one of sigrid's most significant flashbacks the memories she had of her mother were telling but did not resolve at any point perhaps they are part of the puzzle of sigrid's ambivalence toward motherhood the unsympathetic doctor the loud mother on the subway the smashed piano the conversation with wolfram about her husband these encounters are drawn to perfection other parts of the book however do not stand up to this chapter between moments of clarity the reader is wandering around the streets of berlin confused and directionless but in the end a few words that i felt should have been said were not and one of the characters dies without knowing the truth i could understand at first why sigrid kept the information to herself but when somebody is dying they can hardly use that knowledge to catch a few more jews","1078":"this book provokes the same question as the help why should we believe that the heroine almost uniquely in her society has the strength and moral authority to work against injustice the question is answered more satisfactorily in this novel because the plot revolves around exploring the question from different angles in the civil rights era south of the help skeeter is portrayed as being simply more morally developed than her peers in the 1943 berlin of city of women sigrid's motives for helping underground jews escape ebb and flow sometimes honorable sometimes selfish or fearful i found the novel compelling largely because it portrays a setting that has often been taboo the german homefront when we follow sigrid through her day ration cards bickering with her mother in law about the wireless shabbily dressed half crowds of women and old men on the subway late night huddles in the basement bomb shelter we may as well be in london but it does not do to be too sympathetic lest we fall into the error of post war german apologists who tried to equate homefront suffering with the crimes inflicted by the state and its citizens the reason the novel is able to work is that sigrid does not congratulate herself or ask for our sympathy lying in bed she replays in her mind the sight of the ss herding jews into the rear of their lorry and she feels a greasy shame fill her belly but that feeling of shame isn't what gives her commitment instead her commitment comes from action jump first then decide to swim as with in the garden of beasts i have a few quibbles with the author's german but fewer of them and lots of details in this book felt spot on especially the theatrical attempts of the neighbors to outdo each other in their patriotic fervor the awful ersatz foods and sigrid's boring job in the typing pool on that point the author deserves his blurb from alan furst","1079":"i'm on the fence about this novel on the one hand almost any story about the holocaust feels fresh because that kind of horror never feels old or overplayed it always seems there is a new angle and this one focusing on how everyday germans both jewish and non jewish act or react to the evidence of such unspeakable crimes is a good one on the other hand i found the main character sigrid to be unlikeable and shrill gillham wrote the men in the novel her husband and lovers much more convincingly than the women and i wonder why he chose to write the book from a female perspective","1080":"i thought it was unbelievable the end was amazing","1081":"4 5 stars this book and all its characters haunted me it transferred me back in time and place to 1943 berlin dodging air raids a heartbreaking controversial story of characters whom you can so easily judge their moral choices except you have no idea what would you have done if it was you in the same situation faced with the same moral dilemma another book that shows the ugly face of wartime and how it extends its vicious fingers contaminating every single life it touchesthe book is excellent written describing the everyday life with vivid details as if you are there trying to struggle your way for simple basic needs like food and clothing escalating right through fighting for survival whether hiding in a dark cellar praying a bomb would miss you or returning home a corpse from frontline or even a hollow remains of the person you used to be or even uttering the wrong word in the presence of the wrong ear again all what you would be thinking of after finishing what would i have done if it was me","1082":"so scary but i couldn't stop had to know what happened next","1083":"very good novel about several women in berlin during world war ii choices they make how choices affect others makes for compelling reading","1084":"the plot of this book specially the set piece near the end is exciting and pulls you along the characterisation though is a bit thin the main character not being particularly believable which is a bit of a problem i enjoyed it but i don't think i'll be seeking out other books by this author","1085":"i approached this book carefully at first as i wondered just how much suspense about wartime berlin i could handle however it turned out to be more of a love story with some timely twists i really liked the book and was taken off guard when the truth about egon was revealed i loved the heart racing final chapters","1086":"i thought this was a terrific perspective on those living in berlin during world war ii but i did not like the main character very good writing","1087":"interesting book which i did enjoy many ins and outs within the story but a good book to read","1088":"this was a good read but i like other readers had some mixed feelings","1089":"ww11 book from the perspective of german women interesting and thought provoking the author david gillham asks us what what you do i am moved by this question it is good to remember this question as you read this book","1090":"this is a book that will continue to ask the question what would i have done under the circumstances of berlin during the reign of terror you will also question how you might judge a person not knowing the circumstances i found this book a very good read the author obviously researched the history of berlin during the war he gives depth to the characters it is up to the reader to add empathy to their lives and decisions","1091":"i loved this book what a treat to read deep meaningful and rich at the end i found myself wanting more and hoping for the best for the characters","1092":"this was a book hard to put down yet hard to read you are asked constantly what you would do in certain cases and this book subscribes to the reality of living in a war situation where germans and jews exist together but not in harmony the characters are well portrayed and the many twists and turns keep you wondering did i really know this character the chance to put kindness caring and compassion to its fullness is shown with chances being taken consistently it is a thriller regarding the action but a morally challenging book to the core love friendship hate deceit and every emotion you can imagine is developed in this novel and david gillham does it with aplomb i recommend it as a serious read","1093":" why did it take so long to finish this book because i was pregnant and then became a mother and had no time energy to read until my daughter became 10 months old this was an interesting story and it was intriguing to see wwii through the women's eyes humans react very differently than they think they might when faced with danger scarcity lack of trust etc some rise to the occasion others do not and you can't really know how you'd react until you're in the situation i learned a lot from the book and thought it was an interesting read a bit slow to get going perhaps the first half was not difficult to put down then the ending captivated me to keep reading until i was finished","1094":"a very dark novel about sigrid who helps hide people from the gestapo in 1943 berlin i enjoyed it","1095":"i loved the characters in this book i didn't want it to end i wanted to find out what was going to happen next in sigrid's life","1096":" i absolutely loved this book it was so layered the characters beautiful flawed believable the scenes unfolding like a brilliant movie not surprising since the author is an actor and screenwriter i stayed up until 5 a m reading this book which doesn't happen often but it is the reason why i read i love books like this sigrid is a great heroine i rooted for her ericha not so much sigrid's lover egon i just kept picturing an awesome michael fassbender ruthless magnetic and endearing all in one this book although a historical fiction is definitely sexy i can't think of any other word the twists in this book were well conceived they don't just come out of nowhere after finishing this book i immediately started reading it again i needed to go back and look at the details especially about egon's family great tactic in withholding information both from the reader's point of view and the characters' i wish i knew some german the book has tons of german words weaved in but it was necessary this debut author is someone to watch out for amazing review copy provided by penguin debut author program","1097":"couldn't put it down the characters and the situations in berlin during the war are so real after a chance encounter sigrid goes from safe german housefrau to helping to hide and transport jews one of those books which place you in a time in history when terrible things were happening and make you consider what you would have done in the same circumstances","1098":" i adore just about any wwii historical fiction but this one stood out to me as grittier and more real than most though clearly i do not have an accurate perception of a real 1943 berlin gillham's writing is incredible particularly in his pacing and storytelling while i did not initially connect with sigrid as the story unfolded i began to understand her motives i felt like i was getting to know her the supporting cast were written in naturally and eventually all contributed to the story in significant and often unpredictable ways the final few chapters read to me like a thriller and i began to understand how the earlier chapters had been expertly woven to set up the conclusion i am left trying to decide how to judge the characters' decisions knowing their secrets and their histories and wondering what i might have done in any of their places the dialogue was sometimes stilted and cheesy but i am willing to forgive that because of the book's overall quality","1099":"i love historical fiction that gives me insight to a time and place and helps me to understand the how and why especially war epics this was well written and i loved the development of the main characters in the story and how the war affects them from both sides","1100":"the new york times book review was quite unfavorable to this novel last sunday i totally disagree with the reviewer i am very well read in this historical period and i agree with one of my favorite authors of the genre alan furst when he says the novel is built on one of the most extraordinary and faithful re creations of a time in history berlin during world war ii i particularly praised the author's heroine sigrid who is not the sugar coated aryan who helps to save jews during the holocaust rather she gets involved quite by accident and her own curiosity and freely admits it she meets a stranger in the balcony of a movie house who becomes her lover even though he is a jew on the run from the nazis she helps a young woman hide jews from the ss while living with her acidic mother in law who is a member of the nazi party her passions and depression from a low end typing job at the patent department combust when she meets egon who has a tainted past and a wife and children caught up by the persecution i highly recommend this suspenseful sensual and gripping novel","1101":"i liked this book it was not a fun read but what kept me turning pages was the suspense and the hope that our protagonist would do the right thing a gripping story about germans during ww2 and their lives in berlin where any sign of sympathy toward the jews could land you in jail","1102":" this is a really great book in my opinion made all the more amazing as it was written by a first time novelist david r gillham the book traces the story of a german woman in berlin during world war 2 her husband is fighting in the war and she must adapt to the savage nature of society in nazi germany she eventually becomes active in attempting to save jewish lives but there are many plot twists right up till the final page the character are well developed and i really care what happens to them which many times i can't say in books i read this book would adapt very well into a major motion picture i can not wait to see what mr gillham writes next the book is dark but so is germany during this period i also think the book would be a great choice for book clubs the characters make many interesting and thought provoking choices so there is plenty of grist for the discussion mill do yourself a favor and read this book","1103":" i've got somewhat mixed feelings about this novel on the one hand it was certainly a page turner and i enjoyed reading it it was one of those novels i couldn't wait to get back to at the day's end it was exciting and i felt the characters were very nicely drawn three dimensional with growth by book's end the author did a great job of describing the atmosphere in berlin the complex personalities of his characters and their shifting allegiances it was exciting and cinematic in parts on the other hand know how some male authors can write a female point of view convincingly well this author not quite sure how to put this seems to be writing about how he thinks women think particularly about sex and this book does have quite a lot of sex in it it didn't bother me enough to say i didn't like the book but i did find it oddly dissonant","1104":"i really did not care for this book it was quite graphic multiple sexual scenes etc i read it for historical fiction and generally shy away from romance novels for that reason it was hard to follow i listened to the audio book and maybe since i've read a lot of ww 2 historical fiction books recently such as nightingale by kristin hannah this one just didn't stand up","1105":"loved this book has a little bit of everything drama love intrigue u0026amp mystery loved the characters fast paced","1106":"compelling story of a woman living in berlin during wwii sigrid appears to be an average german woman trying to make ends meet while her husband is away serving in the military however beneath the surface is a fascinating and complex woman i found this to be an engaging work of historical fiction it really made me think about what i would do if i were in her situation","1107":"i'm torn about this book i've always been drawn to reading about this time period and the feeling i get about berlin seems authentic to the time but the characters just don't feel quite believable to me i can sympathize with sigrid and believe that she was disconnected from her husband and that her affair is part of the catalyst that changes the course of her routine existence but the multiple sexual escapades and the situations in which they occur seem less authentic ericha's character also fell flat in addition i grow tired of vulgarity and crudity of which there was plenty in this book however the redeeming quality was the sacrifice and transformation revealed at the end","1108":"this is a very interesting premise for a thriller mystery and a great if bleak location berlin in 1943 the protagonist is somewhat remote but i warmed to her well written","1109":"tight plotting excellent writing complex characters this one is a winner","1110":" most of the males in berlin have gone to war leaving a city of women one of the most notorious is sigrid shoenfield who finds herself living a double life as a dutiful and somewhat dull wife of a soldier and a woman who gets pulled into the jewish conflict as a screen writer this story reads much like a screen play and throughout i found myself thinking of the novel in terms of scene setting i could imagine a young meryl streep playing sigrid frustrated by her life of a domicile and yearning for excitement and passion gillham paints the city effectively and conveys the stress of war on the inhabitants he also successfully portrays the schizophrenic character of a city possessed with ultimate hatred for the jewish people and loyalty towards the hitler regime the story is full of intrigue and deception and the plot has several twists and turns that sustain suspense my only criticism is the lack of motivation sigrid the reader needs to assume that very serious actions are taken without thought of moral implications or consequences sigrid seems entirely motivated by sex some of which is violent this appears in contradiction to her characterization she places herself and her family in danger for the sake of a man who treats her poorly this just doesn't run true overall this is a good summer read for those who enjoy historical fiction the characters are complex and the plot moves quickly","1111":"good book the book starts to get interesting about the middle first part has much graphic sex scenes human nature displayed at a terrible time in history","1112":" it is initially hard to empathize with sigrid a berlin hausfrau whose husband is fighting the russians on the eastern front it is hard because from the outset you know she is having an affair with a jewish man who has secrets and a wife u0026amp daughters she must hide this from her co workers u0026amp her mother in law who lives with her in 1943 the wireless tells of great victories u0026amp propaganda lying to berliners of german military successes not saying heil hitler to your neighbors creates suspicion of your loyalty to the fuhrer everyone has secrets though sigrid tries to befriend a young woman who has been assigned to look after one of her neighbor's small children ericka seems to be away a lot u0026amp not paying attention to her duties as a nanny sigrid gets caught up in ericka's secret mission and learns how to operate in a berlin where no one can be trusted gillham's story shows us berlin during the war from the perspective of those women u0026amp old men who stayed behind to hold the homefront the bomb shelters with signs telling people not to cry the u bahn where a man can be murdered by someone who gets off at the next stop the clerical jobs that women who are not supposed to work outside the home take to get out of their homes the ersatz coffee and powdered eggs that berliners eat so that their soldiers can have better nutrition to fight ivan u0026amp tommy and finally the bravery of a few souls who decide complicity is unacceptable","1113":"i've not read a book before about the lives of people in berlin during wwii the characters in this book seem a little less than real but i liked thinking about what it must have been like living in this place at this time","1114":"i listened to this one good reader and good story that takes place in wwii berlin","1115":"looking for a thought provoking page turner look no farther than david r gillham's city of women sigrid schroder seems to be the perfect berliner and wife to her german soldier husband while her relationship with her mother in law with whom she lives is sometimes difficult for the most part she is a dutiful and responsible person things change for sigrid however when she meets a man at the movies and suddenly finds herself having an affair with a jewish man who is not what he seems her simple life is thrown into further chaos when she befriends a young girl involved in the resistance movement before long sigrid is forced to examine her own actions and those of her fellow countrymen as is often the case not everything is clear cut and soon she is uncovering secrets that might have been safer left alone gillham has produced a novel that is cinematic and thrilling however he has also drawn very human characters full of contradictions and faults a city of women is also a provocative book for anyone who has ever wondered how the atrocities of wwii were allowed to happen a natural selection for book groups this novel will have readers thinking and talking long after the final page has been turned","1116":"i usually love historical fiction but i could not get into this one reading the reviews i feel a little sad i did not like it i found sigrid very self centered i know this is taking place during a war but i still felt she should have been more upstanding i think she took the easy route and stayed with the demanding mother in law because she had no one else","1117":"what an awesome read sigrid is a german soldier's wife living with her mother in law working in a patent office while her husband is called to fight in the front sigrid works and goes to movies to occupy her time a young girl comes up to her in the movie theater and begged please say that we came together what would you do what would any of us do it's a story of survival","1118":" i have read a lot of wwii novels but none about the women left behind the book really presents some moral questions that leave the reader wondering how do small choices turn into big choices where do you draw the line who do you trust the book shows many characters who were friends do terrible things and unexpected allies i can't say that i loved or even liked any of the characters sigrid the main character in the book does have one redeeming quality in that she begins to passionately believe in the cause of helping jews in a time where she is not proud of in her nation however she makes many moral choices that leave the reader not understanding her motivations she seems to fall into many of her decisions without understanding the consequences or even with any forethought an interesting read and would make for a great book club selection reader received a complimentary copy from the publisher from the library thing early reviewers program","1119":"having a hard time with this one i find sigrid one dimensional and i can't really tell if she has a personality also what is it with these men you want me to believe that she's in love with egon when the only interactions we know about for the longest time are him placing her hand on his erection sex in a movie theatre and sex in a damp room and now there's the neighbor who's in their second conversation ever says you should let me see you naked not convinced","1120":"loved the book i want to know what happened to sigrid is there a sequelcoming please","1121":"the author did his homework to establish the setting i can only imagine if berlin was like that i wondered if the sexual content was overdone","1122":"i have an enduring interest in thinking about how ordinary people moved through daily life in wartime germany this novel offers one version of the possibilities sobering to consider in all its implications a good read too","1123":"this book was awesomely crazy it twists and turns the plot ever weaving intricate webs and interesting how it all ties back together in the end it was very suspenseful and kept me wanting to read more i did get a little confused between some of the characters who was who but besides that it's an amazing story i can't imagine that people actually lived in this such was during the war in berlin nor had to act the way they did just to survive","1124":"i really enjoyed this book i am a lover of historical fiction and like many people am intrigued by germany in the 40s i really enjoyed this story of the life of a german housewife and how she finds herself involved in hiding jews during the war it was interesting to get a sneak peek of what life might have been like during that era the book starts out a bit slow but keeps picking up throughout until then end when i was on the edge of my chair i thoroughly recommend this book","1125":"interesting book on women left behind in germany during war","1126":"one of the best books i have read recently historical fiction that completely ensconces you into the fear and chaos of 1943 berlin from a german woman's voice excellent","1127":"eh just okay 448 pgs later i didn't really care about the characters and or how the story ended","1128":" i have read many books about the holocaust but i have never done muchthinking about the absence of men in the cities and about how the women were forced to do what they could to survive the book forms a vivid picture of the neighbors racing to bomb shelters and the relationships they formed while waiting for the bombs to stop falling staying alive took wits and extreme hard work some people resorted toactions which it is doubtful they thought they would ever do i can't read a book such as this without asking myself where i would draw the line if indeed i would when it became apparent that human beings were being tortured and shipped off to death camps the character sigrid fell under the spell of a jewish man named egon sigrid was tempted to compromise everything for this man and egon seemed mainly interested in himself even though his wife and 2 daughters were in hiding","1129":" taken from my blog at www takemeawayreading comity of women tells the story of the women left behind in the city of berlin in 1943 when the majority of the men are off to join the war efforts sigrid schroder lives with her meddling and critical mother in law while her husband kaspar has gone off to war but even before he left sigrid had been having an affair with a man who she now thinks about more than her husband this is scandalous enough as it is but her illicit lover also happens to be jewish sigrid is a good german citizen though she isn't always quite sure what is true and not regarding germany's place in the war but then when she's at the cinema one day her favorite place to spend time she is thrown into a scandalous situation by the young girl who nannies the children downstairs from sigrid the mysterious antics of this young girl irritate and anger the fairly proper sigrid but ultimately leads her to the biggest realizations she has about what is really happening in the world sigrid later becomes faced with the decision to shelter jews and others who need to hide she's horrified at the thought of defying the rules as well as the missions of the city's men but also horrified at what she slowly realizes is happening to these people when they are found by the gestapo especially when it becomes personal and she believes she may be hiding the family of her secret lover i loved this book the writing was beautiful and engaging and really created a sensuous atmosphere that i immersed myself in every time i opened the book it was about community friendships betrayals daily life and its sensualities moral arguments from personal and political viewpoints and danger it demonstrated the strength and courage of some of these women but also the cattiness of many of the women it's about women living in a really difficult time and place and having to make some very difficult decisions city of women is up there with one of the best of the year for me so far","1130":" city of women is set in 1943 in berlin the main character sigrid schroder is essentially an unfulfilled lonely woman who lives with her crabby mother in law in an apartment house in berlin during the height of ww2 sigrid's husband who she had a pleasant but rather boring relationship with is stationed at the eastern front while she works part time as a stenographer for a government organization the days are filled with dreariness standing in line for rationed food bomb alerts and subsequent hours hovered in a basement bunker crouched together with the varying characters that make up her neighbors and the tense relation in close quarters with her husband's mother she often escapes to the darkness of the movie theater where one day she encounters and begins a love affair with a jewish man and on another occasion befriends a girl who is involved in clandestine activities a rather apolitical person until then she now has to grapple with her conscience and trade off the pros and cons of silently letting horrible things happen or acting on her newly awakened morals the novel shows the complexity of the situation well nothing is as it appears or is made out to appear and at its core has the age old question what would we the readers do in similar circumstances i recommend this title for a book club","1131":"depressing all the way through","1132":" if you're a fan of stories set in wwii this is a book for you david gillham examines life in berlin as it is run by women while the men of the city are fighting the war sigrid had been a model soldier's wife who turned a blind eye to the injustices happening in her own city but when she becomes involved with a jewish man sigrid is tested beyond her wildest imagination and finds herself risking everything to hide a woman and her two daughters from the gestapo full of complications and tense moments this book is a page turner that you won't want to put down rachel geertsema online marketing coordinator","1133":"a real eye opener but a bit too graphic for my preference","1134":" i loved this book the suspense gripped me and i couldn't wait to continue reading the characters were interesting and multi layered although i was leery about reading another book dealing with wwii and the nazis i found this one to be different well of course they are all different but i did love this one even though it definitely put the horrendous nazi philosophy on display i think the plot and theme really centered more on the characters and how those characters interacted with each other under the pressures exerted by the existence of the nazi regime betrayal and trust were central issues in the book and those themes set up the extreme tension that made it exciting the setting is berlin in 1943 having read esi edugyan's half blood blues which took place in the early 40's in berlin i found it interesting to see that city from a different perspective no matter what the perspective it's no wonder everyone was trying to escape lit lovers' discussion questionshttp tinyurl com b9dmy3x","1135":" a postulation mood the singularly most important element in art a few bars of duke ellington heard while changing stations a glimpse of a frank lloyd wright from the tour bus window a painted blurr of a francis bacon figure walking by the gallery window the first middle or last line of melville's moby dick a great work art is synthesized with an entrapping power evident in the microcosm experienced only more so through the whole composition in david r gillham's city of women such atmospheric horror of trembling berlin 1944 arises off the first page or any sentence and never relinquishes the reader who may as well be termed the viewer as one digests this novel with ears nose and the minds eye one could not have imagined a fresh perspective on the horrors thrust upon europe by the nazis mr gillham has done it filmmakers authors and poets have tumbled the subject like no other in modern times yet here is an unexplored angle women left to tend to berlin as its bombed by the allies the author proceeds with a journalists eye a historians truth and an artist heart he crafts a hapless group of fraulines some critically others sympathetically always plausibly ultimately a complex group portrait with a single common thread women in endgame its fair to say we who search out fiction seek an escape to an interesting place populated with intriguing characters well you are there problem is the cost of admission to the theater where lust and luftwaffe un spool is treachery betrayal and death you may find your self reading 50 pages and simply putting it down breathing deep and wincing it is important to do so as this is not entertainment and not particularly pleasurable there is a worthy plot with a credible heroine who you are pulling for as her motives slowly come into focus her journey begins on page one and vanishes into the last sentence the plethora of women left behind were driven by the basic tenants of human condition and this is not exclusively a story of victimization the author managed to convey they were not all monsters because they were german in the mix were jews who's conduct was not entirely excusable either the players in the story have interiors fear desire memory hope one comes to realize they were just so many pawns on the chessboard of a continent thrown into chaos by a madman and a hypnotized citizenry mr gilham plausibly describes their precious crumbling citadel he explores the illusion of utopian arian future through the misguided muse whom embraced it my idea of a review is not to describe the plot as in the monday sports section informs you about the game you missed sunday afternoon rather what i would offer my fellow reader a sense of what he she is getting himself into city of women has an empathy for women not unlike d h lawrence the historical integrity of ken follet and the measured hopelessness of dostoyevsky","1136":"http booksbytheweek blogspot com 20","1137":"this was an interesting read i can't say that i found the characters likable which is why i went with three stars but it was close to a four","1138":"i really enjoyed this book it kept me up at night however i was not crazy about the end but all in all this book was well written exciting and historically invigorating i would recommend anyone to read this","1139":"this is a well written book if a bit slow but too depressing for me to deal with at the moment set in war time berlin the deprevation and savagery i'm not in the mood for","1140":"a fascinating perspective on berlin during wwii","1141":"david gillham's absorbing historical suspense tale pitches the reader right into the heart of berlin 1943 and the moral dilemmas confronting sigrid schroder whose husband is away on the eastern front how far should she involve herself in the life of ericha a young upstairs neighbour who she rescues from an uncomfortable encounter with the gestapo in a cinema driven by restlessness a desire to escape from her confined apartment life with her mother in law and dreaming of egon her jewish lover who vanished months ago sigrid starts to make some tough choices this is a very impressive gripping read gillham is terrific on the details the smells sights and sounds of life in wartime and i was particularly taken with how well he handles 'two hander' scenes sigrid and ericha sigrid and her mother in law sigrid and egon there are a couple of well staged 'pull the rug from under the readers' feet' moments a chess match in chapter sixteen is beautifully done the novel also as the title indicates passes the bechdel test with ease if stanley tucci ever gets his mooted tv adaptation off the ground i'll be watching it","1142":"good book told a good story with a different sort of twist from many other wwii books i've read it felt a bit less realistic than other books written about this era but maybe because it plays off a different side of the story that i hadn't heard before i feel the same way when i read books see movies about spies and the cia always guessing who is good and who is the traitor overall i really liked it and would recommend","1143":" i really enjoyed this story of the everyday heroes and heroines who helped jews and others in need during world war ii even some of the villains particularly one catcher a jew working for the gestapo who lures and traps other jews are colorful and multi layered as their horrific stories unfold no one is 100% perfect and good or 100% horrible and bad the main question isn't what's right or wrong but a statement of what good people chose to do during an impossible time to help others and sometimes that help comes at the price of betraying other people","1144":"i loved this book the characters were rich and multifaceted the plot evolves along with the main character sigrid sigrid is a strong woman who initially drifts along in life until she finds a purpose to ground her this is a must read","1145":"a lot to think about here what would you do this is both a thriller and moral story set in berlin as germany is falling apart and losing the war sigrid lives with her bitter mother in law and works as a typist the cinema is her refuge and there the story begins","1146":" building on the reader's previous knowledge and fear of the gestapo and secret police operating in berlin during the third reich david r gillham brings an intensity and foreboding to his story of women living in berlin in city of women gillham expertly details the harrowing time period for the women left behind by war sigrid is living alone with her peevish mother in law and working taking each day at a time sigrid is at once plagued and comforted by memories of her affair with a jewish man a new friendship will push sigrid to make dangerous choices and take actions that may threaten her own safety yet she feels she must help hide her lover's family gillham writes a masterful historical fiction novel full of intrigue danger and love the characters are conflicted and complex and through the twists and turns of plot it is difficult to know who to trust hard to put down city of women will get inside your head for days however for a city of women there are plenty of men and lots of sex too much sex","1147":"brings wwii era berlin to vivid life with all its complexities","1148":"what an amazing story that draws the reader in and leaves you questioning yourself how you would make these decisions during an extraordinary time in history as someone who has seen the leftover destruction from wwii in germany left permanently as a way for the german people to remember berlin and it's inhabitants came alive for me in this book","1149":"i did like this book but i think the characters lacked development i didn't feel like i got to know them all that well though maybe that was intentional since it highlighted the come and go of the people at any rate this was a nerve wracking book to read it is not a book i would recommend reading if you are already down it does have people in it who are good and who do the right thing despite the risks but ultimately there is a whole lot of bad too that is life for me though reading is a form of escape from life and this is not the kind of book one reads to escape","1150":" i read this book for one of my book clubs and that is the only reason i finished it the reviews were good and the since i like books from this time period i did look forward to reading it the author certainly had a good premise for the book - he just didn't deliver i wanted to understand sigrid i wanted to know how she and other women coped in the atmosphere of war i found the characters to be one dimensional each character represented a certain type of personality or a certain attitude and that was just it i didn't like sigrid there's no passion behind what she does even when she is helping others there's no emotion in the affairs she has no relevant conversation just sex i don't think sigrid had any idea of the true meaning of love and sacrifice i know men can and do write from the perspective of women i just don't think author succeeds in doing so i do not recommend this book","1151":" this book is brilliant if it weren't for the sexual relationships of the main character i would have given it a 6 the relationships to me just didn't gel with sigrid's personality affairs yes wanton disregard hmmm seemed to be written from a man's perspective not a woman's other than that the book was absolutely captivating i was on the edge of my proverbial seat the whole way through i couldn't wait to see what was going to happen and was almost nail biting in some scenes it was a beautiful amalgam of history morality and the highs lows and oddities of the human psyche great too to have an insight into the pressures placed on the average german during wwii","1152":" in the midst of nazi germany berlin is a city is left to those who cannot enlist or those who are in hiding sigrid plays her part a dutiful wife a subordinate daughter in law a diligent worker but when left alone her mind wanders back to her jewish lover lost to her during the war during one of these moments of reflection in the theatre house she runs into a neighbour's duty year girl ericha who begs her to say they are together as a nazi officer heads in their direction soon sigrid is wrapped up in the dangerous world of trafficking jews and deserters while the chance of being caught rise around her i found this to be a beautifully written novel at certain points when i was admiring how well thought out plans for smuggling people around were i really needed to pull myself out of the moment and remind myself that events just like this had happened in real life before and it was quite sobering the characters were very interesting only because i didn't particularly like any of them i thought sigrid was very cold i'm not sure if it's a cultural thing or gillham's interpretation of strong women but i couldn't identify with her and her actions frankly after being introduced to her i felt her selflessness of saving jews from the nazis didn't seem 'like her' oh boy and i hated egon he has no redeeming factors in my eyes that being said i have to take that with a grain of salt and remind myself that he was acting to save himself but i still feel if circumstances had been different he would still be a dick the story was well written but it must be noted that i'm sad that there didn't appear to be much of a real threat of discovery because everything kept turning up roses that isn't to say that this is a feel good book on the contrary through most of the book i never felt particular relief either city of women is definitely a beautiful portrayal of such a hard time in history but i really needed a few days to digest it and decide whether i really did think it deserved four stars or three","1153":"david gillham writes with stunning clarity evoking images that haunt as the story unfolds","1154":"the author has placed a challenge to the reader what would you do in wwii 1943 berlin the characters are written for all readers to place themselves in each role excellent job of writing to capture a war torn city and embattled citizenry i have placed myself in each of his characters predictiments and walked away not knowing what i would do in times of war and destruction","1155":"i didn't like all the affairs in this book but other than that it was a great read it was fascinating reading a wwii book that is set from the german perspective and the writing was quite good","1156":" when i was stationed in germany in 1980 i was surprised to see old women riding old bicycles in the snow with groceries in a basket and once when driving i came close to nudging with my bumper an old woman who was crossing the street i thought oh great a lawsuit instead she took her handbag wound up and clobbered the hood of my car then walked away a colleague told me these old german women ran the country during wwii they're a tough breed this novel city of women is about those german women who took charge at a time when the only males around were children retirees or casualties of war the characters are well drawn and there's not a false moment in the narrative it's a real page turner that i will undoubtedly read again someday","1157":" i was curious to see what a man would have to say about women's experience of war i was not impressed the book's protagonist seemed utterly passive while her husband's at war she goes to the movies to try to lose herself for a couple of hours a cute guy meets her there flirts with her and they have a cup of coffee next time they meet they have sex right there in the movie theater seats why not what woman wouldn't do that right most of the older women in the book are mean old hags with no redeeming characteristics not much nuance or character development for anybody i didn't get much further than that so i don't know if the plot took off but i didn't believe in any of the characters as authentic so don't think i missed much","1158":"i loved this novel of berlin during world war ii david gillham does a great job portraying the lives of women in 1943 berlin the main character sigrid schroder is the wife of german soldier who works an office job and lives with her mother in law in an apartment building around her are various personalities from a young woman who helps jews and other targeted people escape germany a jew in hiding and another who is half jewish pretending he is not bombs are falling from the skies but even your neighbors can be dangerous this novel is full of twists and turns and makes for a wonderful thriller it is also thought provoking what would you have done in sigrid's place excellent read","1159":"i kept waiting for it to get good or to actually like or relate to any of the characters about 3 4ths of the way through the action finally started picking up and the decisions made by the primary character finally started feeling somewhat real but that is about the best i can say for it too little too late for me to recommend this book to anyone a pity because the subject matter was good and the storyline should have been really interesting","1160":"relevant historical fiction that asks the big question of what would you do in wwii berlin sigrid finds herself pulled into choices in the grey area between good and evil this book became more engaging as every page passed","1161":" in a world torn apart by war where husbands sons and fathers march off tothe front line in the service of the nation sometimes to return woundedand sometimes never to return at all what is a woman to do that is thecentral question that david gillham addresses in his book city of women sigrid is just a regular hausfrau a housewife whose husband has beencalled to the front to fight a war that the german broadcasts claim isalmost won cooped up in an apartment with a mother in law who constantlybickers and blames sigrid for just about everything the only solace sigridfinds are in the hours spent as a typist at work or when she spends hertime at the theatre not really paying attention to the film being screenedbut instead having an extra marital affair and all the excitement inentails in the back row of the theatre it is on one such day when sigrid is by herself in the theatre that ayoung girl suddenly seats herself beside sigrid and begs her to say thatthe she has been with sigrid in the theatre since the beginning of theshow and when men from the

arefound in the company of the best of friends and lovers while friendship andrescue comes from the most unexpected places she is after all in a city ofwomen a place left with little to look forward if you aren't fightingback there were a number of moments that i liked in the book while it wasn'twholly unpredictable given its setting the narrative is strong and makesthe book a fast read at times i didn't like sigrid or erica the younggirl sigrid takes to mothering but given that i like the premise of thestory and to see holocaust from the pov of a german it made for a 4 starread recommended to those looking for some world war ii or holocaust fiction","1162":"the title refers to berlin during wwii with the majority of men gone fighting the war beautiful writing with complex characters and a story that you can't put down and will haunt you loved it","1163":" this book was part historical fiction and part thriller i loved sigrid's character and those around her they felt so alive and so real to me and were put in very hard situations during world war ii this book would be amazing for a discussion as it raises a lot of good questions of how human we really are and what would we do in hard situations and how the history can easily be repeated if we just keep our mouth shut it raises questions of what it means to be a good citizen to your country and what it means to be a good person by helping others in need even though your country might not be agreeing with it it also talks about what it means to be a wife married to a soldier and to be married to the wrong man that does not belong in the woman's heart very interesting book i could talk about it and discuss it for days definitely check it out if you love stories about world war ii and secrets around it","1164":"one of the best books i read in 2012 highly recommended an average german citizen takes a stand and joins an underground rescue organization while falling in love with a jewish man hiding in plain sight all goes according to plan until her husband returns unexpectedly from the front","1165":"historical fiction in a complicated time i like that sigrid is entangled in her morals who wouldn't be what would anyone do","1166":"one of the best wwii books i've ever read it takes place in berlin and it is about the german citizens who hid the jews secretly and got them out of berlin so many things to think about what would i do in so many situations would you risk your own life to save strangers it has the jews who ratted out other jews the german soldiers coming home without limbs and lots about the women who were left while their husbands were away fighting lots of affairs and some wacky love stories for once a wwii book that isn't about the holocaust which is worth learning about of course but it was so unique and different","1167":" a really good read a great story which kept twisting and turning and kept me guessing to the end set in berlin during the second world war we are immediately immersed in the world of sigrid a normal german woman whose husband is away at war living with her acerbic mother in law and working as a stenographer her life suddenly changes sigrid is drawn into a world of which she was totally unaware the hiding and moving of jews to safety her involvement deepens and we follow her growing awareness of what has been happening around her it left me pondering once again the terrible dilemmas that faced the ordinary german citizen who neither wanted or looked for war","1168":"i read this once before but somehow this past month reread it and found it excellent profound and highly recommend it","1169":"2nd book club book i didn't get to participate in the discussions but i was mostly disappointed by this book it was clearly written by a man who did not portray the lead female character accurately i needed more character development and more insight into the thoughts and motivations of all characters an interesting story but more fact than fiction needed here","1170":"this book was so much more than i thought it was going to be i thought it was a story of forbidden love during hitler's reign it really became a moral issue centered on the question so many of us have asked ourselves about this period in history what would you have done","1171":"i really wanted to like this book the moral dilemmas for a german woman in the time of the holocaust seemed like a fascinating starting point and a storyline i was sure to enjoy there were moments that i did enjoy it and it did keep me reading however i found the main character generally annoying the plot continuously convenient to what she the author needed and far too much time devoted to her sex escapades with her lovers the moral dilemmas seemed more like forced decisions or reactions to events the main character couldn't ignore perhaps i would have enjoyed it more if my expectations hadn't started so high","1172":"loved this book it was hard to put down","1173":"really liked the concept of the book some of it a bit contrived but good get you thinking book","1174":" i like historical fiction but this book was boring i was hoping it would focus on the women left behind all women from all sides but it focuses on sigrid she is a good german but has a simple boring life with a horrible mother in law and a husband away at war she has affairs boring it finally gets somewhat interesting when she meets erica who is hiding jews and talks sigrid into helping her but then it gets boring again when one lover reappears and she sleeps with yet another man boring this book would have been so much more interesting if all the awkwardly written sex was toned down after awhile it became too predictable that i had a hard time finishing book came highly recommended and i was highly disappointed","1175":"set in 1943 berlin sigrid schroder the unfulfilled wife of a german soldier at the russian front becomes involved in the underground resistance smuggling jews out of the country spies and informants abound and danger lurks everywhere amidst bombing raids round ups and deportations the characters found quite a lot of time for sex maybe when you are living on the edge you need to take comfort wherever you can find it","1176":"very similar to the good german however sigrid is actually a good german","1177":"good mystery interesting complex characters moral dilemmas i would have given it five stars if it hadn't been quite so disjointed","1178":"a moving dark novel very thought provoking thankful not to live in a world where i am scared all the time","1179":"review originally posted on ratherbereadingblog combeautifully written and completely heart wrenching city of women is one of those books you are going to have trouble putting down transporting you back to 1943 in the middle of world war ii sigrid is a woman haunted by memories of her jewish lover as she gets up goes to work and eats an unfortunate meal with her mother in law everyday while her husband is away fighting in the war due to circumstances beyond her control sigrid falls into a friendship with ericha the caretaker of the children living on the floor below her ericha is part of a secret operation that is housing escaped jews and hopefully moving them closer and closer to safety always drawn to reckless behavior sigrid agrees to be an accomplice and she is soon positive she is helping to care for the family of her lover ericha morphs into an intriguing sidekick for sigrid and in their own way help one another out in unexpected ways i love how passionate ericha was about their cause and what their mission was accomplishing while she proved to be little irresponsible and immature during the novel she was alarmingly and surprisingly wise beyond her years when it came to coming to the aid of others she was willing to go above and beyond and take excruciating chances gillham does an impressive job of creating such tangible imagery with words but cloaking the story with a gray and stormy feeling for the novel's entirety sigrid is easy to care for and connect with - from her passionless marriage and her difficulty with conceiving she's extremely sensual in fact the whole book is yet at the same time completely maternal and lives to care for people who deserve to be cared for during such an intense period of time when people are not sure if their families will ever be the same or if their country will ever feel like their own again gillham has presented a unique perspective of the female experience it was common practice for women to find comfort with other men and for others to tattle on those with lack of love for hitler it was not an easy time to trust anyone and therefore it was a lonely time for all you never knew who was going to turn their back on you or put you in jeopardy somehow for someone who hasn't read a historical fiction novel in quite some time i was surprised at just how swept up i became in sigrid's story after the first 50 pages or so there were many twists and turns discoveries disappointments and tragedies during the short amount of time we get to spend with her and believe it or not 400 pages go by so quickly despite a few of the german names that stopped me in my tracks i would not let myself do anything else until i reached the final page even so once i was done my mind didn't drift too far from sigrid and her story for the rest of the evening and even until the next week city of women is a powerful story that forces women to be independent when their world is thrown so off balance and nothing is certain it's about love sex friendship flawed women discovering this untapped strength and bravery and doing the right thing even if it means taking a risk gillham has presented a more than impressive debut the product of obvious extensive research and one that reminds us of the compassionate people that roam our world even when in the most hopeless of situations","1180":"exciting entertaining and heartbreaking","1181":"i received an earc of this from the publisher as part of the penguin first flights program i'm happy to be done with it so i can participate in the live author chat this coming week at first i wasn't certain i'd enjoy the book i've stayed away from most wartime literature particularly ww2 particularly anything having to do with the holocaust this is simply because i was inundated with this kind of lit when i was younger and while i think it is important sometimes authors seem to use the worst historical periods as an easy way to get an emotional response from the reader that wasn't the case here people aren't all good or all bad and i appreciated the sense of reality that the blurry lines and flawed characters brought to the novel city of women is set in berlin where the only men around are either 'foreigners' or 'still in short pants ' sigrid the main character is living with her mother in law who is a party member since her husband is fighting on the eastern front the author does a good job of describing this very bleak setting where women are making do with very little while being asked to give up their warm clothing sigrid ends up falling in with a woman who is helping jewish people escape the country as well as other groups who are in trouble homosexuals deserters etc even this is a presented as a very complex issue with varying reasons for involvement and danger in every direction including the extra layer of jewish people who are in cahoots with the gestapo there is somewhat awkward sex in this book including a lot going on in movie theaters but it all makes sense when one scene at the beginning comes back around in an unexpected way","1182":"i read lisa's review of this book a month or two ago which made me immediately search for and request it on netgalley i'm big reader of world war fiction and this one sounded a little more unique plus the review made me think it would be well done it was an interesting subject i think we should really admire germans who harboured jews during hitler's reign it would be so easy just to ignore what was going on around you and stay safe at least relatively safe i quite liked how sigrid battled with wanting to be a 'good german' and not being able to ignore what was going on around her it showed that she wasn't some sort of saint but that this was the way she reacted to the situation in that sense it makes the idea rather hopeful that anyone could do something amazing for a fellow human being given the right circumstances in many ways she was just trying to get through the days waiting for the war to end and i can imagine it was that way for a lot of people the story was very sad but also hopeful i really felt for sigrid even if i didn't always like her again it just showed that she was human","1183":"very well written and good story","1184":"excellent amazing when characters find their strength","1185":" this novel was a real page turner i enjoy historical fiction and this story was told from the point of view of a married german woman whose husband is serving in the army in wwii she lives with her mother in law not a supportive relationship at home she works in a regimented stenographers pool they have a radio at home and access to the bbc this is a rich landscape i enjoyed the character development the twists and turns not always expected outcomes it gives a reader a sense of what it must have been like to live in those times","1186":" this book has a different twist on the standard and oft written stories of this time frame and subject matter world war ii germany it was a good read to me because it was different it takes place in berlin not in a concentration camp the camps and persecution of the jews are not the main focus of the novel so that horror is at a minimum i must say that even though sigred the protagonist turns out to be a heroine of sorts she is really not a likable person actually there are no likable persons in the story they are all flawed to one extreme or the other several events in this story were a little unbelievable starting with sigred's first encounter with egon you will have to read it but i can't see that happening in the 1930's i also wonder if women were so free with having sex with multiple partners especially married women really late 30's germany maybe i am naive","1187":"i enjoyed this book very much it was a very fast read and i was absorbed in the story right away only complaint a handful of copyediting errors some of which were significant enough to actually jar me out of the story","1188":" the most amazing and attention catching thing about this book for me is that is was written from the view point of the other side of the fence generally when you read historical fiction placed in the wwii 1940's era it is set from the viewpoint of a victim who has been uprooted from their home and the tragedy they endured what makes this so unique is that it is written from they eyes of a good german woman attempting and failing to live up to the expectations set for her by society at that time and her own family and friends throughout her journey she becomes a new person blindfold removed stronger and a survivor who learns that there is most certainly a grey area between right and wrong this is the first book i have read where the leading character is a german and i thoroughly enjoyed the change of pace it was very sexual but not in an explicit way rather what i believe is a more realistic way which was also a lot of fun and very refreshing","1189":"i really did not like this book until i was halfway through but then wow historical fiction set in wwii berlin an dark look at the machinations fear intrigue love death and on and on from the women's points of view many heroes and villains but mostly complex characters trying to survive","1190":"hard to follow and didn't hold my attention","1191":" it was really hard for me to finish this book sigrid is a typist in berlin toward the end of wwii living amidst the hints of german defeat ubiquitous propaganda heavy rationing and feverish paranoia her husband is on the eastern front and she takes a lover and a number of incredible risks in his absence throughout the book i didn't like any of the characters nor i did believe in their histories or motivations almost all the difficult choices in the book came out of unexplained certainties you will do this because you that is the type of person you are or this is how it will be because it must but the author doesn't explain the characters well enough nor set up the context for the story well enough to make me believe it the plot was entirely driven by the author's desires rather than flowing naturally from the world he created overall i wouldn't recommend","1192":" this book rocked the ratings and usually when a book creeps toward 4 stars or beyond i'm all in this was my book club's first book and unfortunately we all unanimously agreed it was not that great we had issues with the characters none of them are particularly memorable their interactions and general behavior that even in 1945 or i should say especially in 1945 would have been subject to serious judgment let alone the rather casual approach of serial infidelity it's unfortunate that this book didn't live up the expectations we all had we had some readers that normally would not have approached the ww2 genre and the lackluster finality of this book may have prevented them from choosing this genre again i always say give it it a try but don't force it if it's not your cup of tea i'm a ww2 buff and this was very far from being my cup of tea so that might be a decent gauge for you i will say this however the second half of the book does pick up and retain more of your interest","1193":"an interesting twist on wwii","1194":"i feel that this is a hard one to rate i loved the characters the story it was exciting thought provoking and clever historical fiction is my favorite genre and i felt this lived up to the truths of the time although the main character changes significantly throughout the book she still remained in her boundaries as a woman of the time but just barely my only complaint is that i wanted more closure this story wasn't finished to me i will be thinking about it long after its over which i suppose the author wants me to do yet it could have used a little less of a rushed ending and a few more explainations","1195":"i'm so glad i read those reviews audible sends out of books that have been highly praised by their listeners not sure if i'd have read this otherwise but i really loved this book thoroughly enjoyed it i read multiple books at one time normally but from the start this one was it everything else fell by the wayside it wasn't what i expected every time i thought i had it figured out there was a twist that surprised me some other reviewers have mentioned there was too much sex in the book there was a fair amount but it wasn't explicit and it wasn't even that prevalent i didn't think plus it was integral to the story which you'll understand when you read it i also learned a lot about wwii that i didn't know i was reminded of another favorite book the book thief by markus zusak but i think mainly because both books take place in nazi germany i thought gillham's writing was beautiful no cliches nothing trite always a fresh way to describe the commonplace i was very impressed and will be looking for his other works i can also highly recommend the audiobook which is available at audible com and at my local library and may be at yours as well this one will stay with me for some time","1196":"this was just a standout work about berlin during wwii which was truly a city of women because most of the men were off at war it was not only a city of women but a city of strong brave women i haven't stopped thinking about this book and all the questions it posed since i finished it","1197":"i really wanted to like this book more than i did the story was interesting but i just didn't form any sort of attachment to the main character sigrid or many of the other characters for that matter i was left really conflicted at the end of the story i typically enjoy books set in this period in history especially books that give you a new perspective in what it might have been like to live through it great example all the light we cannot see","1198":"very good book terrific story of the women left behind in berlin during wwii a great debut novel","1199":"great historical novel about the homefront in berlin during wwii nuanced terrifying heartbreaking and a great read","1200":" in city of women we get a glimpse of berlin in the midst of world war two the effects of the war rationing air raids and fear mingle with the struggle to do what is right and expected of a good citizen for sigrid a german wife with a husband on the frontline the decision to do what is right takes on a personal urgency as she is confronted with the truth of what is happening to ordinary people often i was surprised at sigrid's reactions and decisions she is a wonderful example of a flawed imperfect character as are we all won in a first reads giveaway","1201":"good kind of a beachy read of a wwii novel","1202":" just finished the most gripping novel i have ever read city of women is a novel based upon the life of a nazi soldier's wife as she comes to the realization of all the brutality she has blinded herself from seeing as she sheds her ignorance she embraces a life of danger this book could not be put down some of the vocabulary was a little difficult to understand as there was some german terminology but you figure it out as you go along truly mesmerized by the author's portrayal of how a holocaust happened a holocaust happened because of silence because people did not stand up to injustices as they happened figuring there was not much one person could do to be mindful of how the holocaust happened is to prevent it from ever happening again","1203":"i really enjoyed this book i love world war ii fiction and this one was not my favorite but pretty high up there i thought the story was fantastic but thought that some of the sexual details were unnecessary some realistic to the circumstances but some were just there to be there and i thought it took away from the story overall if you enjoy wwii historical fiction it is a good read","1204":" book review u0026amp arc giveaway when i saw the book cover and title for city of women by david r gillham i was intrigued when i read the publisher's brief description for it i knew i had to find a copy i've read a lot of novels about world war ii most of which center around men who went to war or around the atrocities some center around those left behind in britain or the u s but i don't believe i've ever read a book about women left behind in berlin read the rest of my review

felt i was involved in the story but not knowing who to trust if i had a chance to speak with the author i would have many questions to ask i know i will have to re read the book to learn more about the characters and to be able follow sigrid as she risked her life it's a story i will not soon forget and i know i will have more questions for a long time","1206":" i won a free copy of this book from goodreads i thought this book was great i have to admit that i picked this book up a few times before i could really get into it once i read another 20 30 pages of the book i was sucked into it sigrid is a typical german woman whose husband is off fighting in wwii and she is stuck living with her mother in law during this time this reminding me of a soap opera only it takes place in the 1940's it was often dark but the war definitely was sigrid is a flawed character but this is one of the reasons why this book was so good she tries to lead a normal life but gets caught up in an underground world by her jewish lover and a nanny in her building she is straddling a line between being a good german and fighting for a cause that gives meaning to her life she has many close calls with the german supporters but it seems to only make her more determined and sucks her even deeper in it made me more invested in her character and her outcome the end of the book was a little weak but it still held me to the end i definitely thought it was a worthwhile read","1207":"this was a goodreads com free giveaway i enjoyed this book very much the characters were excellent and the plot was exciting and constantly changing with new twists to keep me interested i also appreciated the historial details i would recommend this book to others","1208":"i finished this book this morning after telling two of my jewish friends not to read it i'm sorry i'm not sure now and i'm final rating is 4 stars i still have mixed feelings but i grew a deeper appreciation of this book by the time i finished it even a deeper understanding of why a male author might have written this book no question its a page turning novel it is fiction and sometimes its hard to 'remember' a book is fiction when history of ww11 and jewish people dying are involved for a long time while reading this book i found it hard to believe that the main female character's 'feel good' solution to her boring life would have been to jump into sex with a stranger as fast as she did her personal 'desire' just did not feel believable to me so then while reading a book which felt part 'erotic' part sad part jewish history part german history part berlin history part culture history more every day life of friendships between woman i was just feeling so many different emotions most of these emotions were when i was not reading the book when i set it down and would think about it but in the end truth 1 i liked it2 i grew to understand i think the authors intention for writing this book when we already have many other books about the holocaust the german army stories about deporting etc the author at the end of the book asked the question of us the reader what would any of us do great question what about the people not being arrested and deported but people still living in the city trying to feed their children etc well i'm still not sure woman might have done what 'sigrid' did in this book but its fiction and it made for interesting exciting reading here was a little sample writing which i want to share won't give anything away but it stayed with me during the entire reading of the book he is not a killer egon only a soldier well what do you think a soldier is frau schroder but a killer in uniform he was wounded in battle he did not murder jews and how in hell do you know have you asked him have you said excuse me husband dear but do you recall slaughtering any kikes while in russia the story goes on until sigrid finally says back to egon you are blaming me but this is not my fault for much of the book i thought about that last line you are blaming me was he hm how many times in our lives today every day do we blame others we blame people 'blame' is often distorted we blame i blame and you blame including ourselves our friends people we love this book was actually powerful on many levels and i told my friends 'not' to read it i'm sorry go ahead and read it","1209":"a powerful book that i did not enjoy reading lots if people write stories about the victims if wars but what about the women left behind to struggle through the war without their men berlin in ww ii has become a depressing and crushing city of women not my kind of book to demoralizing for my tastes but well written and well thought out i felt like i was obe if the gray women who had lost hope and joy","1210":"recommended by staffers andrea and connie read andrea's review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","1211":"this book was slow and somewhat expected i got bored in the middle and skipped about 100 pages didn't stop my understanding of what was going on i'll admit i like the ending one of the main characters died and for a good reason there was also a surprise in that character but the situation berlin during wwii even though it was told from the viewpoint of germans who are discovering that they are losing the war it just never connected for me i much preferred the book thief which had images and characters i'll not forget this was an okay read and it might be right up some one else's alley just not mine","1212":"enjoyed this book and finished it very quickly sigrid's change of character on many occasions frustrated excited and gripped me throughout the book a new perspective of ww2 for me i generally enjoy this type of book with women's stories through different cultures societies and times well worth a read by all i normally like biographies of such topics but would definitely recommend this taking away the 5th star because there is quite a few editing errors in the book","1213":"this was intriguing book very cat and mouse i loved it","1214":"i thought this was a great book i got through it very quickly as i couldn't put it down it was interesting to read a world war 2 story from such a different perspective i only wish there could have been an epilogue at the end i hate not knowing what happens to the characters after the ending especially because the war is far from over","1215":"loved this haunting compelling book it read like a movie script and reminded me of the girl with the dragon tattoo what a terrible time in history and author takes you there with the women of berlin read this january 2013","1216":" this was an amazing book with the telling of a little known part of history that took place during wwii the conditions with which the german people had to live under hitler's regime were horrible the fact that you as a german citizen did not know if any little thing that could be considered a misstep against the german authority could be reported to the proper authorities and you could be jailed or worse yet put up to the firing squad right away this could be for as little as talking to someone just to ask a question of a stranger who was being watched as a tratior or someone who is late for work because of a slow moving train which was not their fault could get them arrested or killed the fact that women who were wives of german officers in the german army would hide jewish women men and children right under their noses they would move them from safe house to safe house and then put them on trains to a country that would be safe for them they would have contacts in the government that would sympathize with them and get the proper documents for them many jewish people changed their names to avoid detection i had a father who was on the front lines during wwii as a medic and he does not talk about it much he is slowly opening up since he is in a nursing home with other veterans of wwii and they discuss it together i have seen pictures of the buildings that were left in berlin where this takes place from pictures my father took i could not imagine living every day and night with the air raid sirens going off and having to run to the basement to sit with all the other tenants until the siren told them they would be safe sometimes part of their building was hit by a bomb and if your apartment was left partially intact or not touched at all they stayed in the bombed building this is when the sympathizer movement would move the jewish people from one place to another because berlin was in the dark to avoid detection by the us and english bombers so under the cover of dark they could be moved this is a storyr that everyone should read because this is a story that is not taught in the schools amazing facts","1217":"i found this story of the day to day comings and goings of germans during the hitler years exceptionally well done and engaging i read it as an audio book and the narrator was phenomenal the people that populated this novel were complex cowardly courageous rarely were actions or motivations stereotyped characters surprised angered and pleased me it never bored me one of my all time favorites","1218":"excellent book i love reading about wwii but i think this is the first book i've read written from a berliners perspective still hits the mark on how did the german people let the jewish genocide by the nazis occur and how incredibly domineering the party was the struggle between doing the right thing and survival was a battle for everyone","1219":"really great read but there are a lot of characters with extremely long germany last names so keeping track of the characters is a little tricky read in 4 hours on a flight and was a page turner","1220":"over the past year i have read several books about the holocaust each book has provided a slightly different angle from which to view the atrocity city of women was no exception the book tells the story of women in berlin during the time of world war ii the country is at war and under attack by the british forces women have been left behind as most men have been called to serve the nazis country loyalty is paramount and turning your neighbors in for speaking out against the fatherland was common sigrid has had an affair and fallen in love with a jewish man an action which can get her killed she also has befriended a young woman who forces sigrid to make a difficult choice that may get her killed the central question raised in this book is what would you do how much do you sacrifice in the face of injustice and what lengths do you go through for your own survival i found this book compelling and provocative it drew me in and i found myself searching my soul for an answer to how i would act or not in the face of survival","1221":"me likey the characters were complicated and diverse it was like a mystery and i was always trying to figure out who was lying and what their motivations were there were some editing glitches which the previous library patron was happy to correct much to my amusement and i was pleased at the ending even though on second thought it is a bit too clean despite being called city of women the men in this novel are very present even in their absence","1222":"3 1 2 stars i enjoyed the beginning of this story and i found the characters interesting and finely drawn though i found it hard to really connect with them the problem with this book for me was that the story slowed in the middle and i got bogged down in detail that i felt i had heard before or that didn't really help me to understand the characters or the story better i like historical fiction and i did feel that the author managed to give me some sense of what berlin was like during the second world war but there were times when i felt that i was watching everything happen through a window that distanced me from what was going on however the narrative tightened up towards the end and the tension built so that i became more involved with the characters as their stories played out this was a take it or leave it book for me","1223":" this book should be read in schools i studied nazi germany and ww2 every single year for 6 years at school i learned all about the holocaust and hitler's rise to power and nazi propaganda and on the other side of things i learned about the blitz and the battle of britain now having read this book i realise i knew absolutely nothing about what life was like for the ordinary german during the war gillham's book brings wartime berlin to life in a very human way introducing us to so many different characters all trying to get on with their lives jews german soldiers their wives and so many more the thing that really brings it all home is that almost no one in this book is innocent by the end of it and that is what is so very haunting about it almost everyone is forced to make awful choices to do despicable things and we are constantly having to change our minds about what is right and what is wrong at the end gillham addresses his reader and asks 'what would you do ' and i honestly hope i never have to make that choice","1224":"book #54 read in 2013city of women by david gillhamthis historical fiction book is set during the time of the holocaust sigrid is a german woman who ends up having an affair with a jewish man and helping jews escape the nazis sigrid is a hard character to like at first but i ended up liking her by the end of the book she took control of her destiny the horrors of the war and the hatred were detailed well in this book the writing style was sophisticated all of the characters were flawed in their own way which made them very realistic overall a good read http melissasbookpicks blogspot com","1225":"a different prospective of berliners during wwi than i have read in the past no black white but shades of gray regarding those living in berlin during the round up and genocide of the jewish people i found it interesting and troubling as most books i have read regarding the topic but it made me look at some aspects differently than before uh","1226":" set in 1943 berlin germany many of the men have gone to war leaving \"a city of women\" behind these women anxiously try to keep up the appearance of being \"good germans\" - there are pictures of the fuhrer in every apartment and heil hitler is a routine greeting in the street already in 1943 germany has begun to lose the war being soundly defeated by russia at every turn but the head officials don't want to give off that impression rather than betray signs of defeat the regime is even more vigilant in its efforts to wipe out jews homosexuals and other outsiders the gestapo is a fearsome force rooting out jews - thousands of them per day - as well as dishonorable germans and routinely there are air raids forcing apartment tenants down into cellars hoping the bombs bypass them this time as nothing more than a scare the tension is high because the stakes are high every single day into this dramatic atmosphere insert a 19 year old girl who believes in morality and cannot abide what the germans are doing a childless women whose husband is soldier at the front and a gaggle of jews in hiding you guessed it the 19 yr old ericha and the childless woman sigrid team up to help those in hiding joining a clandestine operation that's very very dangerous the book starts out slow picks up speed slows down again and speeds it's a swinging pendulum of momentum upon which the reader cannot afford to get comfortable the dramatic parts are full of high strung tension so that the reading is fast paced but full of unease i continually expected the gestapo to jump out of the shadows sigrid and ericha's \"friends\" to be imposters for the whole mission to be revealed and for every player involved to be killed it wasn't an enjoyable reading experience but i wasn't supposed to enjoy myself i was supposed to enter into the world of 1943 germany a bleak dark and dismal place where nothing was sacred and no one was safe do i recommend you pick up this book voluntarily i'm inclined to say no if you do read the author's note at the end first because it actually sets up the moral basis for the book quite nicely and it's nice to have as a prelude going in but for me something was missing from this we all know of the stories of the selfless righteous gentiles who helped save jews during the holocaust their stories may have been romanticized or maybe not there was certainly no poeticism in this book no true heroism that made you believe in the greater good ericha may have been working with a moral imperative in mind but with sigrid...you're not really sure what her motives are she's never empowered by what she is doing only deathly afraid you get the sense she's been made cold and bitter by the whole thing - she didn't choose this she was roped into it and now her life is threatened sigrid and perhaps all of the characters lack soul lack heart lack that element that's so important in novels that makes you root for their success as a reader you're not rooting for anyone really you just want the whole thing to be over - much like the characters themselves maybe the problem lies with gilliham's characterization then maybe he needed to imbue sigrid and ericha with more humanity weird that i felt that absence right when the women characters set out to do precisely that the humanitarian thing in the author's note gilliham says he wrote the book to place ordinary women in extraordinary times and make the reader consider what they might do in a similar situation but i'm not sure he painted his characters with the right brushstrokes - because we don't feel that they are ordinary humble people - only people out to save themselves even as they purport to be saving others ~kelly massrywww

wait to see what this author does next","1228":"this book takes place in 1943 berlin and tells the tale of one woman 's struggle just to live her daily life with the mother in law from he'll and a job that is not much better as her husband fights for the fatherland there are plot twists galore to hold your interest and fascinating characters it is a great read and i highly recommend it","1229":"a haunting piece of historical fiction set in wwii berlin which forces the reader to ask the question what would i have done it's easy to look back with the benefit of knowing what we know now about the nazi regime but what if you were in the middle of it just an ordinary german citizen trying to survive","1230":"very beautiful read i loved the female characters and the frustrating and complex story it moves me every time i read about sacrifices people made during times of war especially when they had so much at stake and nothing to gain i would have loved to see what happened to some of our key characters but maybe we're meant to draw our own conclusion","1231":"this was a wonderful read","1232":"amazing could not put it down so i read the whole thing in two days","1233":" this book is historical fiction set in wwii germany normally i enjoy these types of books but this book hit some wrong notes the premise was supposed to be that since all the men were off fighting berlin became a city of women unfortunately the author david gillham tried to turn this premise into 50 shades meets wwii he made his main character sigrid a sex obsessed hausfrau who hooks up with borderline su0026amp m lovers somewhere in between all her assignations she manages to join a group that helps saves jews in berlin that is supposed to be that main plot of the book but his over sexualization of sigrid really spoils the story after a while i would just roll my eyes as she stopped to hump a lover supposedly she just couldn't help herself she was so overcome with lust but that's another issue and no i haven't read 50 shades and don't want to this was close enough if the author is going to write about women then he might first want to get a clue some of his ideas about women's sexuality are just laughable and frankly sad many of the sex scenes and there were way too many were probably male fantasies of what men want women to want it was obvious that they weren't written by a woman it eventually became painfully obvious that the whole book wasn't written by a woman given all the stereotypic female characters if it had been it might have been much improved","1234":"had a lot of unexpected twists and turns couldn't put it down","1235":" i'm having a hard time reviewing this novel it was well paced and written from a perspective i haven't read before on wwii the author creates moments of such gripping tension it was certainly a page turner but i'm thinking it was all the sexiness that threw me off and also the title i'm sure this can't be right but i'm left with the impression that there were more central male characters than females which is exactly the opposite of the author's original intentions my expectations were misled with this one","1236":"wwii berlin lots of moral questions fast paced lots of twists and turns","1237":" german wife sigrid's controlled and ordered world is turned upside down when she finds herself in charge of hiding a jewish mother

book down and the suspense held right up the end","1239":" if you have ever eaten at hooter's which i haven't you might pause between fries and think about how that orange spandexy burger franchise reflects male desire and how weird that desire can be or you might remember how staff at the baltimore hooter's got tuberculosis back in 2013 well this book is like the hooter's of david gillham's mind and the main character sigrid is like rosie the riveter only she is in nazi germany and she is a stenographer sigrid sleeps with men with little provocation she is great in the sack and doesn't burst out laughing when her lovers say things like you feel that then you know what it's for sigrid rescues infants from bombed out buildings sigrid smuggles jewish families out of germany on her lunch break sigrid always has a cool quip to hurl at her mother in law when followed by the gestapo she doesn't lose her cool she wears hose with orange hot pants and brings you your burger in 5 minutes oh wait i think this book was striving for high minded kantian ethics what do ordinary women do in extraordinary circumstances what if they did more what if they were like sigrid mr gillham please cue the porn music","1240":"an uncomfortable yet uplifting look at the reality of life in berlin in 1943 great characters used effectively to tell an important story","1241":"it was a good read i would recommend it to anyone interested in that time period","1242":"i read this book over a year ago as i was planning to study abroad in berlin it was very interesting and i will probably read it again now that i have returned from berlin","1243":"had mixed emotions when i first started listening to this on audio but with the great performance of narrator suzanne bertish ended up really

a real feel for berlin during ww2","1246":"outstanding my favorite book this year","1247":"this book is beyond ridiculous","1248":"beautifully written","1249":"compelling but disturbing","1250":"the author questions what ordinary people would do under extraordinary circumstances would we respond humanely in a time of inhumanity today an incredible novel debut by gillham","1251":" i started reading the book having read other wwii holocaust novels with the thought that there would be few surprises however sigrid's daily dilemmas and emerging confidence courage kept me turning pages she as well as the other characters her family friends co workers dealt with the stress of war by keeping secrets the secrets were often connected to betrayals most of which were self serving but some secrets were for more noble reasons while i did not always understand the motivation for the betrayals secrets for most of the characters seeing the choices that were made in the different circumstances kept me asking what would i do","1252":"very compelling gritty and realistic felt like i learned something about the impact of war","1253":"i found city of women to be a worthwhile read though due to the topic it was hard i always find it difficult to read about how cruel we humans can be","1254":"love books about this era and just when you think you have heard it all you learn something new who really knows what you would do to survive this horror there is certainly much to talk about in relation to all the sex going on talk about hooking up today i feel as though sex was a main character in this book and was profoundly symbolic with all the chaos cruelty and humiliation defining this time in history suspenseful twists and turns a good read","1255":"the plots twist and turn but the characters are interesting the characters evolve and do things both in keeping with their character and out just like in real life got this book via the goodreads giveaway","1256":" i listened to the audio of this but i really wish i read an actual hard copy i had a difficult time keeping track of names while listening to it some of the prose was so beautiful i would have preferred to see it with my own eyes i'm giving this four stars because the end felt a little sloppy the author wraps it up a little too quickly and it was a little predictable at the very end overall i thoroughly enjoyed it i am sure it's a fast read if you actually read it but i wouldn't call it a beach read the subject matter is too heavy for me to consider it a beach read","1257":"historical fiction setting is berlin in 1940's different in that it is from the perspective of a german housewife who is dissatisfied with her life the war and the conditions that have befallen all of berlin due to the war full of interesting characters and a few twists in the plot","1258":"good read about berlin in 1943 the author captures the mood and the setting of berlin at the time full of twists and turns and mystery i really enjoyed the book","1259":"a good read with an interesting and catching story the characters seem about cold at times but i suppose i wouldn't expect anything other i can't imagine living through it and i'd probably be haunted for the rest of my life as i believe most of them were","1260":"one of my top 5 for the year the characters really came alive for me the themes of love betrayal and family all set in a time where desperation was the norm are thought provoking and at times heart wrenching","1261":"ordinary people extraordinary times so well plotted fully developed characters and the story so bitter condemning and ultimately redeeming living in berlin at the height of the war summarized in a line from the novel you avert your eyes enough times and finally you go blind an extraordinary read","1262":"haunted me","1263":"this was a hard read for me it wasn't the setting or the writing that was left lacking i struggled with the characters through the entire first half of the book eventually i enjoyed the story but i don't think i would recommend this one","1264":" berlin 1943 not a pleasant place to be ordinary citizens live in fear of the police people are denounced and arrested if they dare so much as to speak out against authority or complain about the deprivations they suffer sigrid is the wife of a soldier on the eastern front working as a typist at the patent office and trying to survive her dreary world while living on her memories of her jewish lover her trouble really begins when she befriends the young woman working for her downstairs neighbor and gets drawn into her secret world of hiding those trying to escape the horror having recently read some books about french citizens living in occupied france i was quite interested to read a book told from the perspective of german citizens the author has done a brilliant job of making this time come alive and letting us get to know so many different characters and how they adapted to their world in turmoil as he states at the end of the book in his note the question that dominates the whole book the question he continually asked himself while writing it is what would you do what would any of us do","1265":"enjoyed this book lots of twist and turns in the story line","1266":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the story lines are brilliant it's the language that troubled me at first i thought it's originally written in german and translated into english the language was rickety it was standing precariously between archaic manners of speech and informal language there is of course a chance that this was intentional to accentuate the foreignness of the text then again if the author wanted me to feel detached or less german in a manner of speaking why didn't he choose an english voice to tell the story lines are brilliant it's the language that troubled me at first i thought it's originally

intentional to accentuate the foreignness of the text then again if the author wanted me to feel detached or less german in a manner of speaking why didn't he choose an english voice to tell the story like for example an english native could have discovered a journal written by sigrid in german and he she translated it to english the story itself is good somehow the war and its toll on all involved those who benefited and those who suffered the totalitarian iron fist all well imagined and portrayed sigrid is a cheating bitch and there is no way in hell she would be the champion of all things moral the woman freely gave herself to a man in a movie theater while her husband was at home then had a mindless affair with yet another man she despised but oh wait she is deprived of children and she is helping the resistance so she is nobel after all i wanted to suffocate her i even liked her mother in law because she gave her a hard time more","1267":"just couldn't put this one down","1268":" this novel begins very slowly but gradually develops a large degree of tension the novel portrays war time berlin effectively and the lives of some of its characters i thought the book suffered from the faults of many a first novel it is overly ambitious cluttered and not fully realized there are too many characters a tangled plot and some dry sections which result in a slow tedious read in places with a lack of focus in spite of these reservations city of women is a serious difficult novel it captured the poisonous environment and showed the rare character of moral courage through much of the novel sigrid is not exactly a sympathetic character especially as she imagines denouncing her lover's jewish family to the gestapo so that she can have him all to herself but throughout the story she is an interesting figure complicated and morally shaky she is judgmental and unfaithful and her initial interest in the work of the underground may be part curiosity and part selfishness but over time her feelings shift her ideology becomes more sophisticated and the risks she takes on behalf of others are greater city of women is a lovely book despite its dark and unsettling subject matter while gillham's prose verges on dreamy the berlin he recreates is a nightmarish city of falling bombs maimed soldiers hunted jews and suspicious neighbors there is violence raw sexuality sadness and terror all of which sigrid embodies however the dialogue is often stilted formal and forced and sigrid is in the habit of dully repeating back everything the person she is speaking with says making conversations in the novel slow and sometimes frustrating my one nerve grated every time sigrid called the 19 year old ericha child and several times the author had a character breath in breath out just awkward readers perhaps will be shocked both by sigrid's actions and motivations but gillham writes in his afterword that his intention is to get us to contemplate the kind of decisions sigrid was faced with so that we may ask ourselves what we would do in similar dire circumstances i think we would all most certainly waver on the fence of hero or coward three and a half stars so will upgrade to four i would definitely read this author again i think he will get better and better","1269":"i did not like this book i usually like books based in wwii but this one talked mostly about a german woman who had an affair with a jewish man it was much too sexually explicit i only made it through a few chapters before putting it down not worth it","1270":"i enjoyed thr arc of the story and the journey she takes from house frau to somrthing do much more frankly i could have done with a little less of the details of the sexual exploits","1271":"city of women has been on my list to read for a while i finally got to it and discovered a literary gem city of women takes place in berlin in 1943 a german woman named sigrid lives two lives one of a wife waiting for the return of her husband from the russian front and living a german war time day to day life another of a passionate woman who has an affair with a jewish man and gets involved with helping those who are wronged by this horrifying war david r gillham delivers a book that is raw at its core and does not spare you the hideous details of inhuman actions the characters are honest in their delivery and communicates their feelings effectively this book is also a story of courage and hope and a story of good prevailing over evil a must read","1272":" this book held my attention but it is a dark tale the story is set in ww2 berlin and follows the activities of a young married woman named sigrid it took me a long while into the book to like her character at all but she finally starts showing some redeemable qualities the book was more sexually graphic than what i normally read and that made it slightly uncomfortable the reality of berlin and the fear hatred betrayals and pure evil all felt authentic and well written you can realky imagine the bomb shelter basements and being stuck in there with people you cant trust i will probably read more from tbis author the narrator of the audio book was excellent","1273":"i gave up on this book although i'll probably read the last couple of pages just to see how parts of the story play out i did not like how the author wrote the main character sigrid her life is full of conflict and is equally lonely but i didn't get any hint of how she felt about any of it nor was there any explanation for why it took just a glance from a man to have her out of her clothes and in bed 2 men actually at the point where i gave up there is a lot to like about this book but i felt like the sigrid character was poorly developed as a person","1274":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it's always interesting to see different points of view for large events such as world war ii sigrid's journey was one that everyone would do looking back but i am sure if the chance were to come not many of us would be as courageous as sigrid or ericha and actually act to save those whom their government was fighting i enjoyed the characters for the most part though i was not too thrilled with egon i found him very unlikable and wondered why sigrid would stay by his side i would have l it's

found him very unlikable and wondered why sigrid would stay by his side i would have liked to see sigrid move on to a better life for herself but i suppose that is not always possible i very much recommend this book and hope that many people get the chance to read it more","1275":"well constructed and keeps you guessing until the end this would make a great movie","1276":"very good plot lots of german names and places to remember but worth remembering sigrid is a very gutsy and interesting participant in hiding the jews once you are in to this book it is hard to put it down","1277":"loved this book and very sorry i didn't get a chance to discuss it at book club","1278":"a solid 3 1 2 stars and at times a 4 thought provoking as in what would you do under the same circumstances","1279":"whoa i couldn't put","1280":"this could have been my mothers story she also helped in the underground of berlin during the war i remember many of the sites mentioned the massive destruction especially the skeleton of the bahnhoff railway station the book was pure nostalgia for me and brought back many memories and the story was wonderful","1281":"4 starsi'm struggling because

something down though when everything is fairly fresh in my mind because i loved this book i read this as a buddy read with my goodreads friend diane and also read it for my real world book club i've been wanting to read this for ages and i'm so glad i got to this no later than i did i even liked the love story and i'm not a romance fan many of the characters are so memorable i love how the people are complicated and the relationships are complicated they felt very real i appreciate that a male author could write such an authentic seeming female character telling the story in third person but mostly from her point of view i developed such strong feelings for the characters ranging from love and admiration to hatred and until the end of the book at times i felt confused by some of them with some characters i enjoyed getting to know them layer by layer it's how people generally do get to know each other there is also such a rich plot with many twists a few of which i guessed ahead of the reveal most of which i didn't guess and a couple that i didn't at all see coming i loved how at one point in the story i had to suspend disbelief in a major way but then because of a twist that part of the story made total sense that really something else was going on that was a much more sensible thing to have happened everything about people's motivations and personalities and what happens in the story they all ended up making sense to me even though some were emotionally disturbing in some chapters so much action is packed into so few pages i learned some things too i had no idea that there were that many jews left in berlin in 1943 i got such a feel for wwii berlin the atmosphere came through so well both of the city and of sigrid's internal experience at the beginning in particular the oppressiveness was so well drawn sigrid's life as it was the experiences in the bomb shelters just everything had me captivated i loved the writing style i relished the suspense and there was a lot of it i got completely engrossed in the book and it was really hard to put down when i did keep reading the pages chapters just flew by i was trying to keep in sync with my buddy which we basically were able to do and at one point the narrative was so gripping that even though i was keeping careful track i hadn't realized i'd read from one chapter into the next like many jews i've always wondered about what if i was in the holocaust would i have been shot drowned gassed starved beaten to death or would i have gotten out of occupied europe in time or gone into hiding etc and then i wonder what if it was here and now and another group of people a group of which i was not a part would i risk my life to help them directly indirectly would i help in ways with less risk to myself would i try to ignore the situation and do nothing i'd like to think i would help but i've never felt all that brave i love these kinds of books fiction and non fiction because they do make you think as well as entertain you this is a perfect book to get me again thinking of these questions and there is a lovely 4 page long author's note at the end that addresses some of the \"what would you do\" question this is a great book i highly recommend it to all historical fiction fans particularly those interested in the wwii years and especially those who enjoy reading books with strong female characters more","1282":"set in germany during ww2 focuses on the life of sigrid a good german secretary who joins a group of people to hide and transport jews the book shows how much courage and rush regular germans had to take to do anything not prescribed by the reach a heavy book","1283":"this was an enormously powerful book and it had my crying at the end jeez louise but for me the story took too long to get there so i had to drop my rating down i love how caring nourtouring and strong women can be more of a review to be posted on the blog stand by","1284":"quick read soap opera page turner","1285":" wartime berlin 1943 sigrid schroder's husband is away from home a soldier in the war on the surface her life appears to be routine she goes to work takes in an occasional movie for entertainment and comes home each night to the apartment she shares with her mother in law but the reality is much different segrid has secrets everyone has secrets segrid helps ericha a young woman who she has seen in her apartment building avoid being picked up by the german authorities she later discovers that ericha is involved in an underground group which provides assistance to those being sought by the government mostly jewish families needing relocation soon segrid herself becomes involved in the frightening world of the underground resistance possibly risking her own life this is not a story about war or soldiers but instead is about the people left behind and the choices they make we experience what it was like for the german citizens that didn't agree with the actions of their government and how the underground worked to help the oppressed do they turn their heads mind their own business and survive as best they can or do they take a stand against what they feel is wrong segrid had some tough choices to make she was not perfect she had taken a lover while her husband was away a jewish lover who was now missing should she join ericha and help the underground or should she be a good party member like her mother in law and her soldier husband food is becoming scarce bombings of the city are routine and most people live in constant fear of their government and for their lives people do what they must to survive now segrid must make some difficult decisions and determine who she can trust the audio was narrated by suzanne bertish a former member of the royal shakespeare company her tone and pacing was good fit for subject and at 13 hours the audio was just the right length this was not an easy book to read but the story was compelling and held my interest in spite of the often dark subject matter desperation and sadness of the tale readers listeners will enjoy this book for it's richness of detail and excellent character development world war ii historical fiction fans will definitely want to add this one to their collection","1286":"it was ok i really liked the first 3 4 of the book but was ready for it to wrap up and be over seemed like the author felt the same way when writing it because the ending was quite abrupt","1287":"lots of twists whom can one trust and what would you do in that situation","1288":"it really was a page turner i enjoyed reading it and as always learned a few things that the history books never touched","1289":"it's 1943 in berlin and sigrid begins to defy authority a lot of tension and anxiety in this book and sigrid was not entirely appealing but a powerful narrative of hope compassion and complexity","1290":"i didn't think i would like this book as it's not my usual genre i enjoy but i loved it every single world it is thrilling suspenseful sexy and emotional it will linger with me for days to come it has turned me on to a new genre and i find myself now actively seeking out books written from berliners during this time period highly highly recommend i even had it up on our books a million employee recommends display for awhile","1291":"if you're looking for a great gritty historical fiction this is it was so not expecting the story to go the way it did but i loved every minute of this audio book","1292":" gillham's debut novel provides an incredible depiction of berlin during the second world war he makes you feel the dismal and weary atmosphere of the city a place full of dread and deception the main character sigrid schroder is representative of many german women in berlin alone once her husband is sent to the frontlines she works as a patent clerk and when away from her job she is caught up in an affair and eventually in the machinations to assist families trying to escape the nazis the narrative is layered with detail yet the descriptions read with great fluidity for a tale clearly meant to be a page turner the suspense keeps you riveted with twists about what will happen to sigrid and those she has become entangled with everything is believable and my only minor criticism is in regard to the dialogue some of the conversations felt a little too sophisticated and elusive their precision overdone this does not deter from an overall impressive historical thriller gillham plants a fast paced story within the impeccable recreation of war torn berlin","1293":"i enjoyed this story it is a different genre than i am used to i found a deeper appreciation for this story because i felt that i was learning a little about history while being entertained there are so many characters to connect with i was particularly impressed with a male author being able to capture some aspects of a woman so accurately that i could really connect the scenes and dialogue were detailed enough to take me away which is what i look for in a good book","1294":" city of women may take place in 1943 berlin but it is not your typical wwii holocaust book there are no concentration camp horror stories in this book city of women focuses on the german women left behind in berlin their german husbands off fighting on the front lines sigrid and kaspar schroder lived in a small apartment which they shared with kaspar's mother each morning sigrid would ride the bus to the patent office where she worked as a stenographer after work whenever possible she would avoid going straight home to the unpleasantness of her mother in law and escape to the movie theater it was at the movie theater that she met egon a jewish man who was to become her lover it was in the theater mezzanine that they shared their first kiss it was also at the movie theater that sigrid became involved with ericha a young girl who was working for the underground an organization helping jews to escape to safety we watch as sigrid begins to see clearly for the first time what is happening around her and struggles as to what to do about it city of women gives you a very different perspective on this horrific time in our history there is no black and white not all germans are evil not all jews are innocent it gives you a better understanding of why people did the things they did why some people became heroes and others traitors it makes you question what you would do if put in the impossible position too many found themselves in i listened to the audio book narrated by suzanne bertish and found it to be a thoroughly thought provoking 4 omelet book www fridaymorningbookclub com","1295":" as with most stories involving people breaking unjust laws with potentially dire consequences i felt an uneasiness and anxiety while reading the book yet the book was powerful and well worth the read gillham took an unusual approach of writing with sensitivity to what happens when the demographics of a city change while most military aged men are no longer there how women's relationships with each other and men change and how women become the courageous actors in ways that are traditionally given to male roles thanks to charlene for the recommendation","1296":"set during wwii in berlin about a german officer's wife who ends up helping people escape interesting","1297":" close your eyes and imagine it is 1943 you live in berlin your husband is a nazis soldier off at war out of nowhere a chance to make a difference to a few lands on your lap but it is illegal and very very dangerous what do you do well if your like sigrid in david r gillham's city of women you make a difference you help in whatever way you can you choose not to look the other way i admire sigrid and i can sit here and say that i would do the same but one never really knows until they are actually thrust into that position one thing i do not like about sigrid is that she compulsively cheats on her husband sigrid is a hoe again i could say one never really knows until they are actually thrust into that position well i was married to a marine for 8 years and he was never home always somewhere in the middle east and i never once ever even thought about it let alone did it but that is really the only fault i can find with sigrid i also can commiserate with her on the topic of mother in laws and the fact that she lives with her's should put her in line for sainthood in mybook okay enough of my mindless banter read it if you like historical fiction read it twice i did the character's are well developed you will love the one's your suppose to and hate the one's that you should but simply you will fall in love with this wonderfully spun story because it explores the human condition and what would an average person do when faced with such evil so evade the gestapo with sigrid and read city of women","1298":"great book such an interesting perspective that i had never considered before i was so engrossed in the book that even after i dropped it in the rushing river with less then one page left to read sending it far away from me that i immediately went and bought another copy loved this story","1299":" i loved this book having read some memoirs of people who lived in berlin during this time it seemed very realistic as to what life was like during that time period at first it is hard to like sigrid she seems a bit distant and cold but as the story progresses you learn more about her strengh of character and the very real danger she is facing if caught this is a time period i really like to read about and especially from the point of view of a german she like many others is caught in a world full of danger and uncertainty she lives life for the moment and has an affair with egon despite the fact that she is married her husband is on the eastern front near stalingrad sigrid doesn't know if she will see him again or what will happen so each day is lived on the edge i thought the book was very truthful in the depiction of life in berlin in 1943","1300":"what a great book to start the new year totally torn between 41 2 stars and 5 but i was so captivated by it that i rounded it to a 5 star book i absolutely loved this book and cannot believe i waited so long to pick it up way better than the paris architect with a strong love story and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing beautifully written and loved the unpredictable ending the title didn't quite connect with the story in my opinion but i love the idea of ordinary people becoming capable of doing extraordinary things in the worst of circumstances also the idea of likable characters turning out to be so very flawed and human in the worst way it had me in a way that very few books get me it was right up there with all the light we cannot see for me do not miss this book","1301":" i bought this on impulse without much research i'm wary of debut novels usually and what a find it turned out to be this had me glued to my seat throughout beautifully narrated it is a moving and compelling story of mostly women in berlin during wwii the story revolves mainly around women helping jews escape capture by the gestapo the range of characters includes nazis resistance heros and heroines soldiers and ordinary women and various mixtures thereof it puts you face to face with moral complexity and ethical dilemmas it's a moving love story and an even more moving story of an unlikely friendship it is all shades of grey no black and white no right and wrong good guys behaving badly and bad guys behaving heroically fallible individuals facing extreme situations in different ways it's well written psychologically insightful and atmospheric i can't wait to see if david gillham has further novels in the pipeline only one quibble correct me if i'm wrong but wasn't the gedachtniskirche so named after wwii if so it's an anachronism that the characters in the book call it that","1302":"meh reads like a bad tv movie save your time for a better book see other reviews for recap","1303":"a riveting historical read rooted in true events the afterward is as compelling as the story itself the novel takes place in berlin during wwii a city of women whose men are off fighting the war sigrid is our protagonist and she gets caught up in a web of illegal activities as well as involved with a jewish lover she lives on the edge which only gets narrower as life begins to complicate further with underground safe houses illicit lovers the danger of party members in every facet of life and the allied bombings becoming more intense the women in this novel embody strength of character and determination of human spirit i was engrossed in the story and held rapt by the writing which is sharp tight and poetic gillham has a gift i hope he will continue to use in nurturing his readers i highly recommend this novel it isn't easy to read but it is important","1304":" every time i read a book about a heroic citizen during wwii i always ask myself what would i do in that situation the main character of this book starts out ignoring the acts against jews in berlin during the war she doesn't like them but she doesn't do anything about them either as the story goes on and she makes decisions that make her question her own sanity i kept thinking i wonder if i would have done something like that the story makes you see that war and the people caught in the middle of it is never black and white but many many shades of gray excellent book","1305":"berlin as russia began winning the war no romanticized spy novel but one depicting real humans thrashing through everyday life amidst the violence and sickness of the nazis and one women's matter of fact choices","1306":"i have been reading a lot of ww2 books this rates low on the past ones i read","1307":"berlin in 1943 the year i was born not a happy read but an excellent picture of life in war torn germany","1308":"i liked this historical fiction about a woman living in berlin in 1943 it gives a fairly graphic depiction of what life was like then the terror of bombing the drudgery of rationing the hypocrisy of people trying to find something to believe in it was not a light read but very interesting and thought provoking","1309":"in 1943 sigrid works as a civil servant in berlin and lives with her mother in law while her husband is serving on the russian front one incident in a cinema leads to her becoming part of something which changes her life but also puts her in great danger i really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons the setting in wartime berlin mainly among the community of left behind women was not something i've come across in many books i've read the depiction of rationing and patriotic fervour is not something i've read about from the german point of view very often which gave it an exoticism that a novel set during the same period in the uk wouldn't have the subterfuge of many of the characters is also interesting everyone seems to have a public and a private face and these can be poles apart the characters feel like real people with real concerns and not the idealised heroes of some wartime set novels at a basic level the book could be seen to be a wartime thriller but there's much more to it than that a must read for anyone interested in the second word war and in particular in the place of women in the society of the time","1310":"another view of berlin during wwii this time from a woman's point of view intriguing characters and situations","1311":" a 3 75 rating for me as this book really picked up steam as it moved along a bit crude at points but that is how the world worked during war time i know a few people did not like some of the language but some characters were rude and crude others were earthy and i felt the entire book really got that ww2 feeling of being in berlin down pat the war was winding down yet nazi propaganda continued to let its citizens think all was well the persecution of the jews had gotten worse and this was a really fine effort by the author to see how ordinary people reacting in extraordinary times all in all for me this was a good effort by the author and i hope he has a new book coming out soon","1312":"a fascinating portrayl of life in berlin during wwii how the german people heled the jews amazing way of life","1313":"i had a hard time relating to the characters in this book although i found the story fascinating i can't imagine having to make the decisions these women were faced with the book was verythought provoking and well written","1314":"this was a particularly intriguing story of wwii good vs evil with plenty of sex thrown in since i read it just before hurricane sandy i really understood the feeling of impending doom and the anticipation of danger as well as the stress of waiting for the axe to fall this would be a great book club book","1315":" i can't use the word enjoy to describe how i felt about this book but it was definitely compelling and the character of sigrid is strong enough to carry the whole story i liked the fact that she was a bit of a loner more stoic and cooler in her demeanor than many women and although she is a sexual being she's almost afraid of the intimate bonds that result her emotions are never quite on display and that serves her well in a berlin with so many facades her journey that of figuring out her moral compass in the face of such horrible circumstances is enlightening she's never the easiest character to root on but there's also never a doubt that the reader wants needs her to succeed gillham is quite effective in adjusting sigrid's interactions with those around her her mother in law her lovers her co worker and her evolution of feeling toward each of those is almost as interesting as the plot her characterization added to an incredibly detailed setting in terms of both time and place and a subtle increase in tension results in a novel with resonance","1316":"the city of women the title alone elicits images of back biting snarling jealous gossipy women who would betray each other at the drop of the hat that's not too far off berlin during wwii has been emptied of its men who are mostly at the front left behind is a city of women who have been turned against each other by the authorities trust is a luxury no one can afford betrayal means more than hurt feelings betrayal in berlin means death yet the novel is teeming with people who are willing to lose everything in order to help those persecuted by the nazis i won this novel through first reads","1317":"i absolutely loved this book i felt like i had been dropped down right in the middle of nazi germany the cover is what first drew me in i think it is beautiful and it made me curious about the book this has so many interesting characters in it and all of them are flawed in some way which really just makes the story feel all the more real very layered wonderfully written novel and i recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in this time period","1318":"i love the title it explains so much yet it so simple wwii in berlin very well written","1319":"started slowly and i didn't care for sigrid the main character but the author developed her character gradually and the reader experienced all her fear and reluctance to get involved finally sigrid finds in herself the courage and integrity we all would like to think we would have had in her place","1320":" i really don't even know where to begin i just loved this book so much i don't know if my love sourced from the fact that i felt many similarities between myself and sigrid on the romance front anyways or if it was that she was so brave and did all the things i only wish i could do or if it was simply that the read just always kept me on my toes view spoiler i admit i desperately wanted sigrid to run away with egon in the end i hated that he was killed but i did find solace in the fact that she at least intended to go with him hide spoiler i definitely believe that i will read this book many many more times and i can only hope to find more books that capture my interest and attention even half as well as this one did","1321":"this book takes place in berlin during wwii where it follows two women who did not stand idly by and watch the persecution of jews one of these women did not plan to get involved but was pulled in by an acquaintance and then by her conscience the book asks the question what would you do the book was written from an interesting perspective there are better books in this genre but i did like this one as well","1322":"unbelievably good book to call it a page turner is no exaggeration when i wasn't reading it i couldn't stop thinking or talking about the characters and what they were doing i changed my opinion about most of them several times constantly had me thinking about what i would do if i found my self in their position","1323":"this is a well constructed thriller set in world war ii berlin in which a german woman whose husband is fighting at the eastern front is reluctantly drawn into helping jews hide and escape from germany the problem is that the author a male doesn't do the best job making his protagonist a credible character a dutiful daughter in law and part time employee of a stenographer pool sigrid succumbs to the advances of a strange man in a darkened movie theater and begins an affair suddenly turning into a sex starved risk taker who also succumbs to the advances of a german officer who has temporarily moved in across the hall giving sigrid the benefit of the doubt wartime makes people do crazy stuff and concentrating on the setting and the action readers will be pulled along by the intrigue and plot twists to the exciting conclusion you read this novel for the storytelling not the character development note i found similarities in this book and simon mawer's trapeze whose female spy protagonist is also somewhat unbelievable and maria duenas's the time in between whose main character is much more believable i don't want to conclude that it's necessarily a male female author issue because we know of countless male authors who do great female characters but it's an interesting thing to think about","1324":"it didn't seem realistic at all compared to other wwii books like life after life or nightingale","1325":"apart from a few illuminating historical details i found this book a very dull read in fact i abandoned it it boiled down to the fact that i simply didn't care about the characters and their mechanical trysts given their situation i really ought to have cared but i didn't i hate abandoning books but this one simply wasn't worth the time","1326":"loved this book one of the best i've read this year","1327":"i think i prefer period pieces set in this era to be written by women this book although compelling feels like a blunt battleaxe rather than a subtle katana and i don't like to be bludgeoned","1328":" set in 1943 when hitler's plans are finally beginning to unravel city of women is the story of sigrid a middle aged woman whose husband is fighting on the the eastern front and who stumbles into helping to hide jews it's a tense tightly plotted and intelligent thriller and gillham superbly conveys the claustrophobic atmosphere of a city in which everyone is trying to outdo everyone else in patriotism conscious always of the gestapo men lurking on the corner and the casual but limitless violence they are prepared to meet out as with most thrillers there's some heavy duty plot engineering but the complexity of gillham's characters their divided loyalties and the authenticity of their dialogue raises this beyond the conventions of the genre it's also a very cinematic novel i particularly enjoyed the set piece climax that is played out against the backdrop of berlin's anhalter bahnhof outside the station a brass band of middle aged brownshirts has assembled in the open plaza with air raid sandbags as a backdrop the brassy clash as they tune up echoes in the vaulted ceilings of the bahnhof 's main portal inside the grandly appointed booking house built for empire has taken on a grimy patched up wartime face sand!bags boarded up windows chips and cracks in the masonry an immense swastika banner edged with grime hangs above the heads of the hordes of drab travelers who grumble as they are herded by the loudspeakers a convincing portrait of a city being relentlessly ground down in the nightmare of nazism - i couldn't put it down","1329":"suspenseful great character development","1330":" this is the 2nd book i've read his summer that focuses on ordinary german people under hitler's rule and poses the question what would you do at first i had a hard time getting into this story but suddenly it turned and i was engaged in the story a lot of if not all of the characters were hard to like but i feel they needed to be and because life was hard during the war with little food rations constant bombings and the ss soldiers everywhere the main character is faced with the decision of what is she going to do now that she can't ignore what is going on help or ignore the problem it's her story that makes this book worth read despite it's flaws","1331":"this could be 3 5 stars quick read with actual depth and i thought most of the characters were really well drawn the author carried the setting with skill and he managed to depict the harrowing lives of berliners during the war without becoming overly sentimental or simplistic the sex scenes were heavy handed and at times reeked of this is how a male author thinks a female character would think about sex but that was basically my only problem with the book","1332":"i loved this book it was exciting suspenseful and held your interest there is always something new happening and situations never develop the way you suspect they will although a fiction story the writer gives a wonderful insight into what life was like in berlin during wwii this book will stay with me for a long time i highly recommend it","1333":" original review http alexandrampatterson com 2012 0 summary city of women is set in germany during the second world war and tells the story of a young woman whose circumstances suddenly make it impossible to ignore hitler's mission sigrid appears to be the perfect aryan woman working for the cause and attending party meetings but when she begins an affair with an undercover jew and meets a reckless girl with a death wish she becomes a link in the chain to move jews out of the country bechdel test the title couldn't be more appropriate filled with anecdotes of powerful women there are many opportunities for them to discuss politics religion family life and their innermost thoughts my favorite scenes were when gillham showed us the ways that the \"city of women\" learned to function independent of men -- developing a new currency language and way of doing things rating 4 5i positively adored this book sorry if i seem to be gushing but i was so pleasantly surprised by this novel war novels even when they leave out a great deal of the combat have never been my thing i find long descriptions of battle tedious however this portrayal of life on the ground of what happens for everyone not on the front lines was exactly what i wanted","1334":"i downloaded this audio book with a couple of others last summer the other two although i vaguely remember the stories were not as complex and compelling as this one if you enjoy historical fiction with touches of altruism and lusty german war sex wrapped up in a nazi thriller then this book is for you","1335":"great story quick read i am often skeptical when a male author writes about a woman's perspective but this author did a good job of developing the characters and presenting the progression of one woman's moral u0026amp ethical behavior during wwii interesting to see things from the german point of view and how war changes people","1336":"i flew through the first half of this book only to find myself bored and annoyed with it by the end the characters are all so selfish and it was hard for me to keep up with secondary characters the final moment between the two lovers had very little impact on me by the time i got around to it one thing i notice about audio books is that i am more attuned to overused and or awkward phrasing than i would be if i were reading the printed text in this particular novel every other page seems to reference a german glance or state sigrid stares why does sigrid stare so much","1337":"i really enjoy historical fiction of world war ii this book was unique in that it was set in berlin which has become a city of women i gained a new perspective on the war through the character of sigrid","1338":" the setting for city of women is 1943 berlin they are at the height of the second world war and most of the men have gone to serve including the main character's husband sigrid schroder is left behind to battle a war of her own a war of her own desires of moral conscience and of verbal insults from her vindictive mother in law she is drawn into a world of secrets by a happenchance friendship with a girl named ericha kohl ericha has been hiding jews from the germans and leads sigrid a german to help her the novel twists and turns with sigrid making mysterious deliveries meeting shadowy people who affect her life and threaten her safety and taking on lovers all while dodging air raids and the meddling frau schroder i enjoyed this debut novel by david r gillham he did many great things like establishing a believable sense of place i could almost see war torn berlin i could see sigrid hiding in a basement with her neighbors as the bombs exploded overhead i felt her fear and frustration as she dealt with her mother in law with whom she lived the things the author did with which i did not agree however were how quickly sigrid took on a lover chapter 1 and how easily she fell into a friendship with ericha who was hiding jews sigrid protects ericha from the \"sipo\" in a darkened movie theater by telling him that they had come together when they did not afterwards sigrid becomes obsessed with her as she interrogates ericha after the gestapo leaves and then follows her i found this hard to believe sigrid also takes on a second lover with whom she is disgusted this didn't make sense either but then i've never found myself without a husband and threatened by bombs nor have i ever lived with a cantankerous in law maybe those things alone would make me risk my life fall into bed with strangers and take the occasional drug but i kind of doubt it overall i really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense an ever changing plot line and reading about little guys and gals who outsmart the bullies if this is you then city of women is worth a look","1339":" this title is a little misleading since there are plenty of men still in berlin in 1943 mostly wounded veterans old men and those with reason to evade the authorities sigrid finds plenty of men and adrenaline to relieve the monotony of a very gray wartime city miserable bomb shelters stenographer's job meals of boiled cabbage living with your mother in law and characters who are a parade of dysfunctional life histories although there is lots of melodrama i appreciate the growing feeling of danger as sigrid becomes involved in very dangerous work with u boats mainly jews who are being sheltered by an underground network of risk takers this is a sharp portrayal of the homefront under nazism and a tribute to those who gave up any semblance of a comfortable life to do the right thing","1340":"excellent novel i love the historical fiction genre strong female characters and the wwii time period this book has it all very thrilling climax","1341":"once i started this novel i found it hard to put it down most compelling is how sigrid schroeder an average if a little sharp tongued and rebellious married woman with a gloomy job lackluster marriage and a quarrelsome live in mother in law becomes transformed by circumstances she once thought were beyond her control this isn't a story about idealistic people working against evil for a better world it is about people thrown into difficult even impossible situations and making choices some of which will have a positive result some that will lead to failure as sigrid is caught up in helping jews and others move undetected through and out of wartime berlin she learns who she can trust who she can buy and who she must avoid she also finds passion her husband was never able to give her and in this she is able to escape the world around her passion also leads her into a deeper berlin where the truth is often a painful thing to uncover the story reads like a thriller sigrid is in constant danger and it's important that she watch her back at all times a fascinating part of the story is the city of berlin itself the rail stations ethnic neighborhoods cemeteries the zoo even the weather the city is war tired drained of goods the author takes you around this city with sigrid and the desolation and weariness of the people and buildings are palpable","1342":"wonderful story about a group of people we don't often talk about the women in berlin during ww2","1343":"riveting storyline of wives children left in berlin when the men went to war the incredible courage of some to hide jews the despicable propaganda fed about the enemy it was a very good read and very sobering","1344":" i read this book at the recommendation of a friend who gives me great books to read i found it slow going and almost quit about midway through something i never do maybe with about one book in 400 if i start it i finish it however i found the central character sigrid so cold and distant from everyone around her that i just couldn't get into the story she didn't care about anybody and i didn't care about her since she was such an unsympathetic character finally about midway the action heats up and she begins to engage emotionally with others acquaintances become colleagues who becomes friends or objects of true concern at that point the book became more interesting and the dilemma of living in an occupied city took on more meaning sigrid knew she'd never be a collaborator but whether she'd live as an ostrich or a hostile had to be determined","1345":"good plot line i hadn't read a wwii that was as illict provacative as this one could be at times however i did not like the writing style i felt like the book jumped around a lot especially in the beginning and i often found myself having to revert back a few lines because the scenery setting had switched so suddenly it was also a little difficult to follow the various names and unfamiliar german terms otherwise a good read and i enjoyed some of the suspense","1346":" city of women by david gillham was another three star book for me it is a second world war book but set rather unusually in 1943 berlin the title comes from the fact that most men of military age were away serving in the armed forces mostly out east in the soviet union despite this there seem to be enough men around to provide the main character a woman who works as a typist in a minor government agency with plentiful bed partners the return from the eastern front of her wounded husband does little to interfere with her sex life since their marriage was already in a precarious state when war broke out nobody seems especially bothered or even surprised by the state of affairs i found the book immensely dreary i'm afraid i suspect that in part this was a deliberate stylistic choice of the author to convey to the reader how dreary wartime life in berlin was if so it was all too successful on top of the daily grind of boring work inadequate food and regular bombings with only a cinema to provide official entertainment - and sporadic and rather mechanical sex as a diversion - there is a steadily developing plot of helping jews to escape the city and the country it is hard to decide if this is really an act of courage or just one more way to escape boredom for a few of the people involved the actions are part of a moral stand but for many there is no real basis other than a rather unfocused sense of anger personally i didn't find that this theme integrated very well with the personality of the central woman though perhaps the author feels that once again this is the point he is trying to make - in such a situation unlikely responses are drawn out of ordinary people the slightly dreamlike lack of volition of just following along to see what would happen next pervades the book for me this mix did not work i found the combination of dull routine and improbable coincidence unconvincing and was filled with a sense of unreality as i persevered through the book i cannot give this book more than three stars - perhaps some people will find it more engaging than i but other than the feeling of dogged endurance i have not come away from the book with any deeper insight into this period of history or the human condition in general on a purely technical note the kindle version does not make proper use of the kindle navigation features and there were a number of editorial and proof reading slips since this is a penguin book and not self published or small press this highlights the issue that finding a major publisher does not at all guarantee a quality finished product","1347":"i really liked the story the writing was worthy of 3 stars the story could have earned 4","1348":"captured the plodding dullness of life in berlin during wwii as well as the story of one woman who is inevitably sucked into underground activities a leisurely paced but compelling and thought provoking read","1349":"if you like books concerning wwii you will love this one good story line little twist at the end","1350":"it was a good book told from a different viewpoint of the war","1351":"heartrendering story and you can only ask yourself what would i do if this happened to me very tough question","1352":"gripping did not want to put it down cannot even begin to image what life would have been like for a typical frau in war torn berlin","1353":" city of women is a compelling and gloomy story set in wwii berlin it is a well written historical fiction and the author managed to give life to his characters with realism although there is something off in a few of the relationship between some of the protagonists sigrid's personnality reminds me vaguely of offred in the handmaid's tale from margaret atwood which only makes me appreciate it more i found it hard to put it down and it left me thinking about human nature through difficult times i won this arc thanks to firstreads giveway for giving me the opportunity to discover this book","1354":" this was a very interesting concept basically what was happening in berlin with the german women when wwii was in full swing and what did they think about the way that the jewish people were being treated the story was about frau shroder who was married to a soldier in the nazi party she meets a young woman who is helping to hide jewish people and begins to help her with her cause we find out that frau shroder has a reason to help her with underground movement i am not really sure that this happened you don't hear a lot of stories of people helping the jewish people during this time but it does make you think about what the common person knew and why they were not willing to help i can't think that everyone thought the jewish people should be destroyed this book really got me thinking","1355":"recommended by ginny i've read so many books about world war ii that it was hard to imagine being pulled in the way city of women pulled me big switcheroo it's set in berlin and is about how some average german people reacted to the horrors happening around them sigrid our main character is a functionary in the patent office her husband is a soldier sigrid lives with and detests her mother in law a devoted member of the nazi party sigrid gets slowly almost accidentally drawn into action to do some small amount of good in the midst of the bullying and paranoia of city life the plot is pretty exciting more full of intrigue than most books i read i will really thank my friend for recommending this one","1356":"sigrid is a german wife in berlin with a husband fighting on the eastern front and a jewish lover living nearby it's 1943 and the choices she has to make regarding her lover's family and indeed regarding her own conscience carries the book at an interesting rate the mood of the citizens at that worrying time is well covered with all the excitement of escape for the jewish contingent reaching its climax i wasa little disappointed that i didn't feel the chill of fear for the characters as the gestapostepped in but it's a worthy read nonetheless","1357":"i loved this book the story takes place in berlin in 1943 sigrid's husband is fighting somewhere in russia and she shares an apartment with his difficult mother like all berliners sigrid turns her head away when she sees jews being mistreated she holds a job as a typist food is in short supply and suffering is constant being late to work can get you reported acting suspiciously can get you reported her apartment building is managed by a couple who don't hesitate to report their tenants for transgressions such as expressing concerns that the war is not going to be won by the germans everyone is required to donate warm clothing for the war effort not donating can get you reported not showing up in the air raid shelter can get you reported fear and tension are everywhere sigrid spends some of her spare time watching movies she meets a man there and he's jewish in hiding sigrid lives two lives one that is public as a loyal married woman waiting for her husband working diligently and never expressing her real thoughts the other life is the one that is meaningful to her she feels strong connections with the people she meets and she risks her life many times to do what she knows is right i tried to give this 5 stars but goodreads won't save my rating","1358":"great historical fiction novel the characters are conflicted and complex and the plot is full of twists and turns gilham expertly details the harrowing time period for the women left behind in berlin during wwii masterfully done","1359":"wow an incredible read i've read many holocaust stories but not from the angle of the germans that are on the other side the characters of sigrid and ericha are complex and moving they are heroines that you end up really caring for the book is historical fiction which i love but also a suspenseful thriller the combination really works the last 50 pages had me shocked so many times the writer does an excellent job of making you feel like you are in berlin during the war and struggle and frequent air raids the love affairs of sigrid adds another layer altogether highly recommend this one","1360":"the book was great but the ending could have been stronger","1361":"the subtle beginning of this book lays the groundwork for an engaging conclusion and is a reflection of the protagonist's dynamic character the author masterfully pulls the reader into the inertia of sigrid's life such that her decision to act feels as much as compulsive as it does impulsive this book portrays nazi germany from the perspective of ordinary people in extraordinary times confronted with the question of at what point to what extent and at what risk to themselves and their family does an individual take to make a moral commitment","1362":"i wanted to like this book but i kept falling asleep yes fast paced but only in spots where it skips over a lot nice twist at the end i think it was a tell me not show me narrative the protagonist really feels for ericha but no real emotion can be swelled by me as a reader until ericha has her own challenge just not feeling it","1363":" sigrid was an interesting character she wasn't that likeable and i found some of her decisions puzzling i wondered how realistic her behavior was for a woman in the 1940s i wouldn't think that people were having sex in movie theaters in that era but i actually have nothing to base that assumption on so who knows despite sigrid's many flaws i wanted her to be successful and have a good life the first two thirds of this book dragged a bit for me and then things really picked up in the last third i had some trouble keeping some of the characters straight there was a lot of intrigue and sneaking around and i couldn't always follow what the plan was or understand how the characters had managed to coordinate it i will say that i often have this problem when i watch any kind of action adventure or spy type movie so it may not be the book's fault i found this book to be just okay however it has gotten a lot of great reviews so you may want to seek out some reviews other than mine before you decide whether or not to pick this book up","1364":"average story telling moves quickly presents the question as to what would you do it seemed like a little too little very late in the game","1365":"there are few points in history more depressing than 1943 berlin but gillham does a good job of explaining how a model german citizen reaches the point where she will no longer be part of the crime of complicity","1366":"i probably didn't give this a fair shot but i just couldn't get into it","1367":"this book was not something light to read or uplifting but it was an excellent story with strong characters it made me think it made me care and it made me cry and it made me so grateful that the questions and choices sigrid faced are nothing that i will ever have to know you wonder how a person finds the courage to go on in such times and then the book gives you the answer such a cold answer so much tougher than you were but sigrid only shakes her head no not tougher just numb","1368":"good historical story with some twists in it good read i will recommend this book to anyone","1369":"this is definitely one of those books you don't want to put down all the intrigue of berlin during ww2 well developed characters and life changing decisions to be made you find yourself wondering time after time what you would have done really liked it","1370":" author david gillham's debut novel city of women has an interesting premise in wwii berlin the city is filled mainly with women as the men are off to war i found the thought intriguing a city where the women went to work kept the home fires burning but also actively supported the cause of war or did they sigrid works at a factory and lives with her miserable mother in law while her husband is fighting at the front she is unhappy and one day attends an afternoon movie and begins a torrid sexual relationship with a jewish man hiding in the movie theatre balcony sigrid grows tired of pretending to be the supportive wife the good german who believes that what her country is doing is right she becomes curious about ericha the young mother's helper in the downstairs apartment and when she discovers that the girl is helping to hide jews sigrid reluctantly becomes involved after ericha tells her compromise is the lesson of the day it's easy to do a pregnant woman with a yellow star must walk in the freezing rain because jews are barred from public transport just don't look a man is beaten by the police in front of his children don't look the ss march a column of skeletons in filthy striped rags down the middle of the goddamned street but don't look she whispers roughly you avert your eyes enough times and finally you go blind you don't actually see anything any longer we've all heard about the french resistance but i have heard little about the germans who were covertly working against their country there certainly were people there who followed their conscience at their own peril when sigrid's lover disappears she is distraught she becomes involved with her neighbor's brother a brutish soldier who uses his connections take advantage of others she hopes to use him to find her lost lover her jewish lover reappears and asks her to help him with something illicit sigrid doesn't know whom to trust meanwhile sigrid has become more involved in hiding jews she becomes attached to a mother and her two young daughters believing them to be her jewish lover's family who disappeared the author gives us a real look at what it's like to live in a war zone some of the strongest scenes take place as the residents of the apartment hide from bombs being dropped you can actually feel the claustrophobia of all those people locked in a small space there are many tense scenes in the novel several times i felt myself gritting my teeth waiting to see what would happen gillham wrote some brilliant characters and placed them in situations that had me questioning if i would have the courage that sigrid and ericha showed this is the kind of novel that has you racing through the pages to finish and yet once you did you wanted to sit back and contemplate what you had just read for a long while i loved the complicated journey that sigrid finds herself on i think it would be a fabulous film with many great roles for female actresses i would love to see that movie","1371":"read this after a mention in someone's review for the nightingale definitely better writing","1372":"great historical fiction of germany's berlin in wwii","1373":" i was happy to receive the arc of this novel from the publisher finished it this morning and very much enjoyed it no it's not a feel good book and that's due to the subject matter wwii berlin trying to survive in a world turned upside down and gillham captures it all very powerfully from a women's point of view not all readers might agree with the main character and her choices but it was easy for me to relate to such a horrific time in our history and fully understand that everybody does what is right for them i read the book with an open mind and no judgement with all of this said i thought it was very well written about a very difficult time and subject gillham did a wonderful job in capturing this dark time and unlike some reviewers on amazon i didn't find the novel depressing it's realistic and to quote a sentence from the book it is what it is","1374":" i could not could not could not finish this book page 299 was enough for me there wasn't a single character i cared enough about to continue reading i despised sigrid in ways that curdled my stomach her multi partner adultery conquests and crass language and condescending two faced self righteousness and vulgarity especially in the movie theatre made me want to parboil my brain and eradicate this book from my memory that's not to say gillham's writing skills aren't noteworthy he writes tightly and his prose sans obscenities is hauntingly beautiful and poignant and the cover is captivatingly beautiful it's my opinion though his depictions of sigrid's sexual trysts - at great length in vulgar detail cheapened what could have been a powerful and respectable page turner - regardless of whether or not the key characters were deplorable and obviously gillham and i have different thoughts about what constitutes \"ordinary \" he states \"this book came about from my desire to write about history and about ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances \" well then if sigrid and egon and renate are \"ordinary people\" count me happily among the abnormal for those who enjoyed \"city of women\" i mean no disrespect everybody has different tastes and that's what makes life so grand as for me this just wasn't my cup of tea one parboiled star","1375":"this was a kindle deal of the day and it sounded interesting so i thought i'd give it a try ended up really enjoying it in fact i'm a bit tired right now after staying up too late to finish it there were many plot twists that kept me on my toes","1376":"slow start but after the first 100 pages or so i couldn't put this book down another well written story on the lives left behind during wwii and the choices they faced","1377":"this was an intense book the afterward was didactic of course we all wonder how we as individuals would have reacted to ericha's plea however the story itself was filled with mystery and the horror of wwii and a real page turner occasionally i felt the protagonist acted more like an man than a woman somewhat like in smilla's sense of snow but still this book is very well done thanks for recommending it jill","1378":" i'd like to give my thanks to goodreads and their first reads program for selecting me to read and review this advanced copy of david gillham's city of women set in berlin during ww2 city of women tells the story of sigrid schroeder an average german housewife biding her time until the end of the war and the return of her husband kaspar from the front line in an effort to escape her mother in law and the monotony of day to day life sigrid makes frequent outings to the cinema where one afternoon she becomes complicit in protecting a young woman ericha kohl from suspicious gestapo soon after this sigrid becomes involved in ericha's secret work which happens to be the business of hiding jews in berlin as the war escalates sigrid lives in constant fear of discovery and is forced to make difficult sacrifices in order to continue her work i really enjoyed city of women because it offered a different side to the story so many films and books on the holocaust only give the perspective of the jewish survivor or the allied victors but city of women is delivered from the point of view of a woman working with an underground group in berlin the very heart of germany in what i can only describe as exceptional character development we see sigrid schroeder evolve from a dissatisfied aryan housewife to an active member of the resistance who feels burdened by a moral guilt so strong that she risks her very existence in order to help jews to safety overall this is a very compelling debut novel for mr gillham and i wish him all the best in his future writing career","1379":" generally historical fiction novels with a romance plot tend to annoy me but not this novel it was not cheesy but rather deeply emotional and heart wrenching not only because of the brilliant story telling but also because it is the story of i'm sure many real people who suffered the same fate if not worse the story itself was enthralling emphasizing the bravery of some people in nazi germany who stood up agains the crimes agains humanity that were being committed as a smithie i'm slightly biased because the novel was centered around a self empowered woman who was in control of both her body and mind in a time when women were expected to live docile and submissive lifestyles this is a novel about the bravery possessed by all those who made valiant and sometimes fatal efforts to combat the heinous crimes of the nazis","1380":" i was really excited to read this book because i have a fascination with reading books that take place during the wwii time period this was much different from most other books that i've read because it was set in berlin and barely had any mention of any battles or fighting apart from the occasional bombing coming from english planes overhead instead most of the action is fixated on those who have been left behind in the city as every able man has been sent to fight most are in russia either never coming back to their families or returning as broken men physically and or mentally citizens are starving the gestapo is everywhere sigrid learns repeatedly that there is nothing else more important in this version of berlin than being a good german woman the book's characters are those apart from the war the women and children mostly as well as men either too old or injured to fight and worse than those left behind are those that are hunted any jewish person as well as anyone who fights to protect them or who speaks against germany or the gestapo sigrid in the very beginning of the novel is only concerned with herself her life is very boring she doesn't seem to even mildly like her husband and now she's forced to live alone with his cranky elderly mother still i always felt detached from her never very sympathetic perhaps it was because i never got an explanation as to why she decided to marry her husband social pressure real love i had no inkling of what her true feelings were like throughout most of this book that was made even more complex when she constantly dreams for the passion and love she holds for the lover she had taken years before who is jewish and has disappeared from her life the things he does and says makes him everything but romantic to me i felt pity for sigrid because of her romantic options there were no good options but she kept pining after this man who was more terrible to her than her actual husband was i feel like this book had some interesting concepts but the meandering way in which it was told made it seem much longer than it is and it's already a huge book there were some very interesting details about how people would smuggle their friends or even strangers who were on the run and trying to get out of germany i liked the intrigue there the danger but there was little build up to the conclusion of this book which seemed to come out of nowhere all of a sudden sigrid was a completely different character whereas in the hundreds of pages beforehand her character development had been much slower i feel like fans of historical fiction will like this book particularly if you like the historical period like me i know this is a book that some others will enjoy much more than i did but for me it wasn't good enough","1381":"this is one of those reads where you just want to be able to stop reading it but you are compelled forward very uncomfortable but engaging and compelling","1382":"the books easy descriptions gave me the ability to let me close me eyes and see a picture of what was happening i connected with characters both liking them and disliking them at the same time it's a different point view of a time in history left me thinking why didn't more people do more and knowing the answer sometimes it's not that easy my 1st review also not so easy","1383":"thoughtful perspective of berliner trying to exist despite the war then coming face to face with her own humanity","1384":"this book was a mess the story was interesting but characters were unbelievable with no depth and the writing was clunky","1385":"intriguing story line the writing was just average sigrid had to grow on me she was hard for me to empathize with or understand well i will say it does leave me wondering what i would have done in that time and place","1386":" city of women caught my eye because i've been reading a great deal of non fiction titles around this period of history and i was interested to see how a fictional account of world war ii told from a german woman's perspective squared up to the facts in city of women sigrid schroeder is more than just a german woman she is the wife of a nazi soldier and lives with his mother who is staunchly patriotic or rather is willing to be staunchly patriotic if she thinks she'll benefit in some way by treachery or betrayal therefore sigrid is taking an immense risk when she does two things the first is that she has an affair the second is that she agrees to help people who are hiding from the nazis both require sigrid to take immense risks with no gain to her own life and with the very real risk of losing everything city of women was a very good read for three reasons first of all it is well written not overly sentimental nor overly gritty but balanced and steady it draws you in then pushes you back a little over and over you feel the distance from sigrid that those around her must feel and that she herself feels next the author portrays very well the dilemmas of many germans during the second world war the fear of speaking up lest they be killed however the steps beyond that - where looking away becomes looking at becomes encouraging - remain a grim reality that this book does not shy away from that said this is not a witch hunt nor an anti german rant it is just honest finally gillham cleverly captures the atmosphere of fear suspicion antagonism within a city in turmoil there are no scenes within the concentration camps or outside of the city but the book still has a huge impact the oppression fear confusion guilt anger and bitterness is felt with every page sometimes a book is less about the story than the characters sometimes it's less about the characters than the setting in city of women gillham has drawn together a dark time a troubled soul a beautiful city and the tragedy of millions through one woman's tale he gives us a glimpse of the suffering and tragedy of those who lost their lives or freedom and the sickening day to day angst of those who retained theirs - but at what cost","1387":"set in berlin during world war ii this book is the tale of women making hard decisions to do the right thing with wrong being the easier route it is a war story a love story and a story of finding one's true self all in in one beautiful tale and captivating drama","1388":"set in berlin during wwii this story considers how ordinary people react to extraordinary circumstances the sense of impending doom is pervasive as the protagonist becomes more deeply imbroiled in clandestine activities","1389":"gripping haunting novel about difficult choices one woman makes in berlin in 1943","1390":" set in berlin during world war ii it's so easy to have a stereotyped view of germans of this era nazi thugs citizens with blinders on noble jewish victims the few noble germans who try to help them etc but the characters in this novel are complex with either nobility or evil being transitional and evil acts being sometimes understandable even forgivable there but for the grace of god the plot takes a while to develop but becomes quite gripping as the danger increases and the characters' and our ability to distinguish friend from foe diminishes altogether a good read especially for world war ii buffs","1391":"i received a free copy of this book in exchange for a review my copy was a review copy from the publisher and editing changes may have occurred from my copy to the final in store version this book followed the perspective of sigrid a woman living in germany during wwii sigrid lives in berlin during a time of shortages air raids and fear jewish men women and children are being rounded up and carted off to death camps sigrid's husband as well as almost all of the other men are off to war she lives in an apartment with her mother in law and works as a typist during the book we live in sigrid's head as she remembers an affair that she had with a jewish man prior to her husband leaving for war in gillham's story sigrid gets pulled into a group who is assisting jewish people in hiding from the nazi's until they can leave the country during the course of these activities she comes to believe that the family that she is assisting are the wife and daughters of her lover i don't want to give away too many of the surprises but this novel contains many twists and turns before the conclusion i thought this was a dark raw style of novel i don't generally enjoy books as dark as this one but it works well with this subject matter a book about nazi germany would be ridiculous if it was light and romantic despite having some of the elements of a love story this is not a romance novel sigrid has no illusions about the men around her she is not a hopelessly romantic and emotional woman personally i liked that about her character gillham's characters are also not fully brought to light upon first meeting them in fact you get the feeling upon finishing the book that you truly never understood many of them they are very complex people it also seems that they don't reveal themselves to sigrid until she reveals some of her secrets to them and she is a very secretive woman as she confesses elements of herself to the people around her her relationships with them change and those relationships help to propel the story forward if i had any criticism it was what others have mentioned in their reviews which is that it is difficult to keep track of what is going on during the last chapters i think it is because the pace increases so suddenly in the final part of the book overall i enjoyed this book gillham is very talented and i would recommend it to others","1392":"this was a difficult read for me so many hardships judgements fear and even rebellion i spent a lot of time in germany and got to know my neighbors well and most were hausfraus i also got to know many others not just the germans i think this experience has helped me to understand the people in this book even better war wreaks tragedy on the lives of all those who are touched by it the women in this book even the men were all forced into making decisions they would have never made if war hadn't turned their lives upside down this book was slow to take off for me but the people sounded like people i knew so i stayed with it i'm glad i did it got better especially as the characters bloomed","1393":"i didn't find the moral choices to be compelling at all and i got lost in parts of the story i didn't feel hopeful or even connect with the moral choice of the heroine even though it was courageous the callous attitudes of an obedient law abiding majority were very believable i probably wouldn't have fnished reading it if it wasn't for a book club","1394":"this was a wonderful novel although fictional it was a great portrayal of those in the midst of hitler's berlin and the choice to either close your eyes to the atrocities around you or help","1395":"thorougly engrossing and thought provoking tale","1396":"i knew reading about wartime germany would not be a picnic but this was alittle more real than i anticipated a tough read but i'm glad i finished it","1397":"3 5 stars i really enjoyed it but something kept me from loving it i didn't understand what was so appealing about the ericha character and the end felt rushed and had some plot holes","1398":" city of women is a disturbing look at germany at home during world war ii berlin is being bombed most of the able bodied men are at war at stalingrad or on other german fronts and jewish people are being persecuted the serious question this book asks is what would you have done would you have helped jewish people being persecuted by the government and each other would you have looked the other way would you have had the courage to risk your life for strangers these are the questions sigrid schroder must ask herself as she lives with her mother in law and holds down a job to her surprise she falls in love with a jewish man and at the same time waits for the time when her husband returns from the war the emotions and the times are complicated the books asks serious questions and examines issues of marriage bonds what holds people together in times of terror and separation what drives people to risk their lives in a moral battle and what makes them turn away how would those who wished to help the persecuted go about saving them sigrid is confronted by all these questions and her decisions reveal what kind of person she is when her strengths and weaknesses are tested","1399":"good story but the main character was not very appealing or sympathetic","1400":"outstanding historical fiction everything i could ask for in a wwii novel","1401":"this is one book that i have to say i am happy to have finished it was disturbing by nature of its subject matter berlin during the war interesting but brutal","1402":"is this what it was really like during the war i found this book captivating because it posed that question it seemed a bit far fetched as the women easily slip into the spy role with no real hesitation that the jews held positions that saved them and let them move around the country and that there was that much sex going on in a city of women i thought the reader of the audiobook suzanne berths have did a fabulous job which did add to my enjoyment i would recommend this book to book clubs","1403":"creates a believeable and probable picture of berlin during wwii and gillham has created several memorable characters the main story line however is jumpy and there was at least for me no strong driving pulse to the action","1404":"excellent book very interesting read","1405":"fantastic perspective of nazi germany from the citizen's view gillham combines historical facts with a close up depiction of ordinary citizens mostly women as the men were fighting in wwii who were brainwashed and bullied into compliance with the most outrageous violations of human rights to say anything against hitler and his regime was literally suicidal but some people couldn't turn their heads and risked everything to save the lives of strangers the heroine sigrid is in love with a jew something unthinkable in her community she also becomes involved with a group of people harboring jews illegally which is both dangerous and heart wrenching sigrid's stories and the personal stories of those around her kept the pages flying and even if you think you know the history the political portrait of berlin in 1943 is still shocking","1406":"interesting book about a woman in berlin during the end of ww ii she has several affairs and works to move jews out of germany they all get a bit mixed up this book gives a good understanding of what it was like for those women in berlin during the war","1407":"it is 1943the height of the second world warand berlin has essentially become a city of women sigrid schrder is for all intents and purposes the model german soldiers wife she goes to work every day does as much with her rations as she can and dutifully cares for her meddling mother in law all the while ignoring the horrific immoralities of the regime but behind this faade is an entirely different sigrid a woman who dreams of her former lover now lost in the chaos of the war her lover is a jew but sigrid is not the only one with secrets a high ranking ss officer and his family move down the hall and sigrid finds herself pulled into their orbit a young woman doing her duty year is out of excuses before sigrid can even ask her any questions and then theres t he blind man selling pencils on the corner whose eyes sigrid can feel following her from behind the darkness of his goggles soon sigrid is embroiled in a world she knew nothing about and as her eyes open to the reality around her the carefully constructed fortress of solitude she has built over the years begins to collapse she must choose to act on what is right and what is wrong and what falls somewhere in the shadows between the two","1408":"i don't think i have much to contribute that the positive reviews don't already cover","1409":"i loved this book it's a brilliant beautifully written debut novel set in berlin during wwii there is so much depth and history to this story from the rich complex characters to the surprising plot twists and turns all of which kept me fully engrossed i look forward to reading future novels from this talented author","1410":"i listened to the audio book and thought it wonderfully done by the reader","1411":"great book i pulled it from the shelves because i recognized a blurb from alana furst and i love his series on wwii if alan recommends it i thought i should try it in this book the protagonist frau sigrid schroeder answers the author's question what would you do in answering she shows her humanity however sigrid is just one of many women some i like and some i was not meant to hence the title city of women","1412":"this book grabs a hold of you from the first page and you are interested until the last it was a great read","1413":"story of double crosses and betrayals mixed with heroic actions all against the background of nazi berlin lots of twists and turns quite suspenseful really admire sigrid the novel's heroine","1414":"i enjoyed it but it reads too much like a screenplay or movie treatment the plot development felt a little forced at times and things get wrapped up too neatly i would loan this to someone but wouldn't recommend they go out and buy it","1415":"you like to think you know you will act admirably or honestly or humanely but until you know the costs you can't really say a good book with rich characters","1416":"read for a book group folks really liked it and there was an unusual amount of discussion written by a guy it's the story of women in berlin during wwii and therefore a different take on wwii stories","1417":"once i got into it i couldn't put it down very enjoyable novel about the lives and tribulations of 1943 berlin","1418":"good story but hard to get into at first","1419":"i loved the historical accuracy of this book and the intensity of each character i couldn't put this book down and was sad when it was over excellent read","1420":"i wasn't sure about another wwii book but this was very good it didn't focus on the war but on the everyday germans during that time i liked the realism of the main character and all of her issues she evolved in the movement and her passion of transporting jews germans very much varied in their feelings all across the board it was even written in the non emotional german style which is why i gave it four stars that is kind of a turn off for me","1421":"i thought it was excellent i had a hard time getting into it as i had did not connect with the main character but later i realised that i did for as she came into her own and came alive i connected with her more and more it was wonderful to turn the usual table we have all read so much about wwii from the british and french points of view but this is the first time i have truly confronted what it must have been like to suffer through the war in berlin","1422":"excellent book the characters were so well written and the setting berlin during wwii came alive","1423":"excellent read set in berlin germany during wwii centers around one german woman and what she encounters in every day life how it changes her and the decisions she chooses to make","1424":"this was a book club read otherwise i wouldn't have picked it up and i'm glad i did it was very well written clever but it wasn't a story i couldn't wait to get back to","1425":"basically a good story even exciting at times i found the narration at bit monotone sometimes i had to really concentrate to find out which charactor was speaking even when it was two diffrent sexes having a conversation","1426":" i stayed up late to finish this novel which hardly ever happens anymore i think it was a combination of fast paced events and missing germany i really enjoyed the author's use of german terms and street and place names his depiction of berlin during wwii was hauntingly realistic while i was reading her story i never felt that i understood the protagonist fully that feeling of disconnect disturbed me because there was a lot of inner dialog and memories which should have helped me relate to sigrid and understand her however while i was thinking about it afterwards it seemed fitting we are being told a story about a woman who is struggling to find her place in a new society she herself feels disconnected from the events around her and haunted by her own emotions and desires who can explain herself fully under normal circumstances also the book is titled city of women but all the women's lives were still controlled by men a fact which sigrid acknowledges toward the end of the book i still can't decided if she came into her own at the end or if circumstances forced her final decision","1427":"at first i was appalled at the constant adultery that seemed to be taking place this is berlin germany in wwii era the interweaving story is what got me staying up until 3 00 in the morning to finish this book","1428":" this book is well written i think i'm not entirely sure because i spent the entire time wanting the british to bomb the ever living crap out of everyone and for every character to die in a painful fiery blaze it was kinda distracting not one character was likable except for the super blonde nazi neighbor she at least did not seem absolutely horrible except for the nazism which it's pretty bad when the nazi is the most likable character in a story it's been a while since i read this book so i can't remember the main character's name but i just know i hated her and her affair with the jewish guy who was really just an asshole i could not for the life of me understand why she was so attracted to him couldn't she had an affair with a likable guy who was at the very least moderately nice to her like even the tiniest bit of niceness and she in no way redeemed herself in the end view spoiler when she helped the jewish people escaped hide spoiler by that point it was a little to late for me i would recommend this only for people who like depressing books with flawed characters with no little to no redeeming qualities","1429":" i'm giving this book 3 stars not because i enjoyed it but because the author got across what he says in the postscript he was trying to do which is to ask the question of what any of us would do if faced with the same life or death circumstances these characters faced i've often wondered the same thing when reading about this time in history to the reviewers who complain because it was depressing dark unhappy etc if they have ever read anything about germany in ww2 or have seen any movies about the whole jewish problem they should have been well aware of what they were going to read it is not a fun book by any means and i do think the way he wrote it was very confusing i kept forgetting which character was which mostly due i think to the fact that the names were difficult some reviewers seemed to think because women was in the title it would be a nice possibly romantic book it wasn't oh there was sex but it certainly wasn't romantic and not a pleasant read i don't believe there was ever any real love between any of the characters they were just trying to survive in an horrifying world he did a very good job of setting the atmosphere it was very real and made me nervous as i read when the book ends not a minute too soon he does give us enough information that much of what was confusing in the novel finally makes sense this was a library book club pick and i am anxious to see what others in the club think","1430":"engrossing wwii fiction about life in germany during the war ran a little long but reasonably good","1431":"it was so interesting to read an account though fictional about what it must have been like for the ordinary citizens in germany during world war ii i've always wondered how they felt what they were thinking the author did a pretty good job accomplishing the setting etc in today's world of publishing writers are pounded about show don't tell publishers have broken into writer's offices and stolen tools from the writers's toolboxes the much maligned adverb has virtually disappeared from writing in today's world because of this theft it's all so ridiculous i've even heard poor gerunds attacked why do i bring this up because i believe the main character sigrid would have been much more real and vibrant if we could sneak into her thoughts a little more often i enjoyed the plot i liked the ending some didn't i will be careful who i recommend this book to due to the sex scenes overall i liked the book and will look seriously at the next book mr gillham writes","1432":"a good read a litle dark at times a good snapshot of berlin during world war ii and the jewish population how the common german felt about the situation and what some did about it","1433":"taking place in berlin beginning in 1943 the story revolves around sigrid a german soldier's wife and other women their daily lives and the secrets a number of them keep throughout the book there are many twists and turns it's definitely a page turner","1434":"mixed feelings about this book i suppose all that sex etc was a part of life then but it was too prevalent i thought a man wrote it and maybe he thought if men were scarce any time one came along women would thrown themselves at him the suspicion and fears about the war they were losing by now were mentioned no one trusted anyone an atmosphere of high anxiety in addition to scarce food and bombs etc at times very interesting but","1435":" this is another book where i seem to have the opposite opinion of pretty much everyone and maybe i'm crazy for hating this book but hate it i do okay first a disclaimer i in no way believe that a male author can not write brilliant female characters or vice versa that said in the case of this specific book i don't think the male author can write a realistic female character the whole time i was reading it i was reminded that the author was male and the primary female characters read like manifestation's of the author's sexual fantasies with none of the nuances of character to make them interesting or three dimensional there is the gorgeous voluptuous main character who is so driven by her sexual urges that she seems to think with her d oh wait that's right she doesn't have one because she's supposed to be a woman i keep forgetting and uh oh i think it's time for another disclaimer i'm not saying women can't be sexual beings and obsessed with sex above all other aspects of life i'm not even saying that sigrid and her friend at work can't both fit that description and carry on purely sexual affairs with barely a second thought although that would be a bit more rare in the 1940's and probably taken more seriously than they do i accept that the character can feel no guilt over cheating on her wounded husband with more than one partner feel no guilt about desiring her jewish lover to let his wife and children be sent to a concentration camp so that they can truly be together yes people that selfish do exist and yes some of them are female what i do not accept is that i am supposed to then believe that she has enough empathy to risk her own life helping ericha also known as male fantasy number three a fierce sexually free dark haired young beauty who of course at one point poses naked and sleeps with people to help the cause hide jewish men and women from the gestapo the characters are un even unrealistic and for the most part unlikable don't even get me started on egon the main love interest which is quite an achievement actually the two main characters risk their lives saving people from the gestapo you would think making women like that unlikable would be a lot harder more unlikely than writing female characters who are believable and yet","1436":" i loved this book because i was so impressed by the beautiful writing style and depth of characterization there are no villains nor heroes in city of women and the novel is like an ethical mirror that invites us to ask ourselves what we would do in egon and sigrid's situations making us realize that in the darkest times we have to reevaluate morality which seems a luxury when one is constantly surrounded by death and destruction this novel also forces us to define for ourselves the difference between law and justice other great things about this book were its surprising plot twists and hot sex scenes i really can't say anything bad about city of women brilliant book i look forward to reading more by david gillham","1437":"stayed with me for a long time powerful read","1438":"enjoyed the book great book club read can't wait to discuss this with my girls","1439":"first reads book that i finally got in here to rate enjoyable not my 'favorite' but will definitely watch for this author at thrift stores","1440":" sigrid schroder is a modest german hausfrau living in war torn berlin awaiting the return of her soldier husband from the eastern front but she has spent her entire life suppressing her unexpressed passionate nature and in 1943 the suppression ends she takes a lover and her entire life begins to change she breaks free of her culturally restricted life and begins to make dangerous decisions and perform acts that are not only precarious but death defying and discovers a world that she never knew existed this exciting and extraordinary novel places the reader in a mind set where the question \"what would i do \" becomes compelling an excellent fast paced and intriguing story","1441":" looking for a vivid picture of berlin in 1943 this book is for you looking for a vivid picture of berlin in 1943 populated by compelling characters and described with gorgeous prose keep looking i enjoyed the setting more than the story which certainly kept me turning pages but didn't really make me think beyond them i've spent time in berlin and am a student of german so these factors made the book a little more rounded for me than it may be for others i certainly don't agree with _slate_ that this book was well written it wasn't terrible but wasn't anything to crow about either if you like me bristle at overly dramatic sentence fragments steer clear","1442":" in berlin world war ii is heating up sigrid a bored housewife has a monotonous routine go to work pass some time at the movies come home to her flat with her obnoxious mother in law and repeat her husband kaspar is serving on the front lines but she finds that she doesn't miss him on an ordinary day to escape boredom she's at the movies but meets egon the two start a passionate affair adding some color to a black and white life but the danger increases the day that ericha comes into her life begging her to claim that they came to the movies together from then on sigrid will never know another black and white day one of the most fascinating things about this well written book is the surprisingly different facets in the characters' personalities many are not who they initially seem to be and it breaks the ingrained feeling that every nazi is a soulless monster as well as the idea that every jew is truly good an excellent read with many surprising turns","1443":"i had higher hopes for this book it could have been a lot better in my opinion historical novels based on the holocaust don't need as many sex scenes as this book had it took away from the value of the novel to me","1444":" i was so excited to have won a copy of this book from the goodreads first reads giveaways when i entered it definitely seemed like the type of book that is right up my alley the cover art drew my interest the title captured my attention and the fact that it was a historical fiction about women piqued my curiosity after receiving the book and starting to read it i thought maybe i wasn't going to like it i had a really hard time with all of the german words that were used in just the first few pages alone it's a good thing that my husband knows german so i could ask him how to say some of the words or what they meant and yes sometimes i did have to look words up online for this fact i really wish i were reading it on my kindle app on my ipad so that it would have been easier quicker to look up some of the words however the farther i got into the book the more i either learned the words or just didn't care anymore it seemed as though the book jumped around in a lot of spots which made it hard to follow at times but i was already involved in the storyline of sigrid and would just press on as i wanted to know what happened next there was hardly a dull moment in the book which is probably the biggest reason that kept me reading i finished the book in just a week's time which is quite the accomplishment for me these days overall i really liked this book and have already started telling some of my friends about it","1445":"one of the first editions from the alabama bookseller the city is berlin and and the time is world war ii i like this guy's writing the story was depression but what book about the nazis and their hate of the jews isn't made me a bit maudlin but that means it was a good book well written and kept my interest choose carefully","1446":"very interesting perspective on wwii and reasonably well written i would recommend it for sure","1447":" this book is perfect for those readers who want an intelligent thought provoking book filled with action form the first page to the last it is filled with twists and turns and dead ends what you think you understand well you probably don't you will by the end if you love the ride of such an adventure i highly recommend this book the central theme other than simply figuring out what was going on is what role would you have played if you were a german during ww2 would you have the guts to work in the resistance that is not an easy question who do you sacrifice don't think valor is loaded all on one side whom do you hurt i listened to the audiobook narrated by suzanne bertish her reading was forceful and given the tempo and style of the book this is perfect i was a bit annoyed as she insisted on pronouncing the words patent office ad pay tent office so why only three stars i found annoying incongruities that made no sense to me a man's belt is not large enough tie up a suitcase with i know this is petty but why write that secondly the main characters are all aberrant each in their own way the author has collected quite a group i cannot name one ordinary person among any of the central characters there is a pronounced fixation on strange sexual behavior supposedly all the men are gone from berlin but one woman still has three lovers where does she get all her energy food is rationed the cinema antics aren't all that believable but titillating for sure what occurs in the cinema could happen but what are the chances everything would play out in this manner to put it simply the characters are a bit hard to believe in maybe not one at a time but as a group another major complaint i have is that there is little to explain why the germans who were silent who obediently did as they were told acted as they did true if you don't you lose your job that is in the book but there is no history no discussion of the fact that after ww1 inflation was rampant in germany there were no jobs and that the common man just wanted some food and law and order and jobs so although i too despised those who did as they were told and followed the rules as all good germans should do i would have liked more depth something that illustrated why these people behaved as they did that none of this is pointed out makes them look worse than they really were and i don't like that this book is an exciting mystery story one thing follows another so you have to hold on tight characters surprise you there is sex but heck any adult can read this and you can stop and think what would you have done may i recommend too other books about german life during the war a woman in berlin eight weeks in the conquered city a diary andon hitler's mountain overcoming the legacy of a nazi childhood","1448":"4 1 2 stars loved it","1449":" this book begs for a book club discussion because it is fraught with moral dilemmas as well as world war ii history from a woman's perspective the book takes place in world war ii berlin which has become a city of women the gestapo is everywhere and berliners are constantly looking over their shoulders the berlin glance besides a storyline filled with action intrigue romance family relationships and history the moral dilemmas posed make for compelling reading as in how brave would i have been could i have made a difference i was left with a lot to ponder","1450":" one of the classes that i took in ireland during my study abroad was about nazi germany our professor assigned us a woman in berlin an anonymous diary of a woman in berlin during the time of the russian invasion it really stuck with me that the women were so resourceful so tired and yet so resilient to be able to survive their enemies ruling berlin while the men were out fighting and dying when city of women was returned the summary made me think of that class and i knew i had to take it home i realized pretty quickly that frau schroeder is living in berlin before it falls to the russians but nonetheless she is living in a city mostly devoid of men the few that stay around either work for the nazi party or are so old crippled that they are of no use to the army frau schroeder sigrid gets caught up in the schemes of a young woman who works in her apartment building shuttling jews to hiding places and eventually out of germany meanwhile sigrid lives with her spiteful mother in law and struggles with the memory of her husband and what it means to be faithful that might seem like a very superficial summary but the action of hiding from the gestapo is secondary to the emotional rollercoaster that sigrid undertakes is she a good person or a good german there is also some pretty blatant sex in this book that i wasn't expecting it wouldn't stop me from recommending this book because it acts as a physical moor for sigrid as her world view changes everyday and helps create a contract between her absent husband and her various lovers however it might be upsetting to someone who is used to a more romantic sexuality than the almost technical crudeness that gillham uses the story was intriguing to me because of how modern some of the attitudes towards sex and adultery were i almost wondered if the author was adding too much of a modern lens on the personalities but then i remembered how the women of berlin used sex as a way to protect themselves and earn money food and extra presents from the new russian men in their lives those that were raped the first night used their bodies to keep themselves alive to the disgust and horror of berlin's men when they returned from the war world war ii is something people i know have lived through it makes stories about that time period all the more real to me this book might be a good choice for someone who wants that personal connection to the subject matter but its also a really moving story of a woman's struggle to claw her way out of the monotony misery and violence of the war sigrid could no longer turn a blind eye to the horrors she knew were all around her what would you do","1451":"gripped me right from the first page so far very well written","1452":"when i ran the first few chapters i was completely hooked it was detailed relatable and a little racy then by chapter 9 or 10 it became all about sex and not the bombing of berlin or smuggling jews from safe house to safe house it became sex i stopped reading when the sex took over and the story became so unrealistic if the gestapo were chasing me i would never be completely longing for my lovers 'package' i stopped at chapter 13 disappointed","1453":"interesting perspective of survival in the city of berlin of jewish people and in particular the women during hitler's attempt to rid the country of them the struggles are very believable and certainly based on what would have been true events it was well written and educational as a historical novel","1454":"mehhhh wouldn't recommend","1455":"can't go into it interesting subject but not interesting enough to turn the page gave up","1456":"there is nothing black or white in the war","1457":"city of women was wonderful i found it engrossing and fascinating with its seldom captured perspective on wwii at least in english anyway that of ordinary germans it especially appealed to me as a history buff but i think anyone wishing to examine the lives of ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances will tremendously enjoy this book come for the story stay for the rich characters exceptional writing and a time and place captured with haunting believability and detail writing this review has made me want to pick up the book again for a second read","1458":"gillham weaves a suspenseful tale with great characters in this read about berlin during ww2 and its city of women full of intrigue and clandestine adventure he offers fulyl delvloped characterizations and plots that keep you turning the page for more well researched and written gillham has this reader finding his work worthy of 5 stars","1459":"the heroine sigrid appears to be the typical german woman married to a nazi officer who works and cares for her spiteful meddling mother in law however she is less than satisfied with this arrangement through her eyes one get's a feel for the gritty angst filled nazi germany and how apathetic and fearful everyone is while their leaders carry out horrible atrocities she also describes the german people at that time in such a harsh light with so few exceptions but she herself is a kind woman who only gives off a hard front with her description of nazi germany and its people i found myself thinking of the german expressionist painter max beckmann and his hard but beautiful paintings of german people throughout the book she is carrying on an affair with a jewish lover and the more she get's to know him better the more she is drawn into a dangerous world of helping german jews leave germany","1460":"i liked this book very interesting and i kept turning the pages recommend it","1461":"i liked the actually plotline that had to do with wwii jews nazis etc but the fact that so much of the book was about the main character's sexual exploits with her lovers really turned me off and the back and forth time hopping wasn't done in a way i appreciated it either if this is a book you've had your eye on to read give it a shot but i wouldn't recommend it to someone who has never heard of it i received this book for free from a goodreads giveaway","1462":"i need a sequel the underground railroad backstory of hiding jews in berlin was compelling but trumped by sigrid's story which was a strong female character that went against stereotypes refreshing i was feeling a little frustrated with some of the tortured back and forth with ericha and egon but it really came together and sigrid became the heroine did not have a fairytale ending but that was not what sigrid was about satisfying read","1463":"i thought i liked it i went beyond my 100 page rule when confronted with library renewel i decided to just return it sorry","1464":"very gripping this book really does make you feel the horror of wartime and makes you question yourself what would you do in her situation","1465":"for those who devour the women centered wwii titles this book will deliver with the interesting spin of being set in berlin many of us have read about the brave fight put up by the british civilians who stoically kept calm and carried on so i was intrigued to learn more about the german civilian perspective how much did they know how did they justify what they did know what was it like to be an ordinary citizen on the other side this book answered those questions by painting a painful picture of the hardships and fears faced by german civilians where neighbor turned on neighbor sigrid is a dutiful if a bit boring hausfrau who lives at home with her mother in law while her husband is away fighting in the east gillham paints a detailed picture of wartime life right down to the powder used for brushing teeth or the difficult social aspects of air raids the details create an oppressive smothering environment which is exactly what the characters were living through well done there sigrid between bickering with her mother in law and reminiscing about the jewish lover of her past becomes accidentally involved in the effort to conceal and aid jews trying to escape berlin i say accidentally because it's not something she's drawn to out of moral obligation it's something she just lets happen to her almost without interest a sort of why not attitude to saving the world this is why i say she's boring while there is tons of sex in this book there is no passion physical or otherwise speaking of sex that's where this book really lost me while i don't doubt that there were numerous infidelities in the 1940s i do doubt that a women of sigrid's class and social standing never mind personality would engage in multiple out of wedlock affairs additionally i don't see how a woman of her time and place would have had the freedom to move around as she did to engage in her clandestine war efforts on top of her already grueling sexual exploits regular work schedule and demanding mother in law also totally written by a man aside from those flaws it was still an engaging exciting read there were moments when my heart was actually racing as sigrid attempts to evade the gestapo or as she's questioned by her mother in law i'm glad i read it but i didn't quite devour it a solid 3 stars i received this ebook as an arc via netgalley","1466":"this book pulled me in slowly i was skeptical but then it exploded at the end really good read","1467":"was ok for me i am not sure whether is was the characters or the writing style but i wasn't totally captured","1468":"an atmospheric immersion into underground wwii germany sexually charged exploration of the sexual politics of war and peace a most intriguing read and excellent future book club selection","1469":"one of the more interesting wwii novels i've read unique in depicting not only what a german citizen did know but what they should have known and the ambiguously moral motivations among many groups civilian soldier and persecuted alike sigrid's character is particularly well drawn but the secondary characters also have their own depths","1470":"i loved this book for the writing style as well as the content and characters a very good read","1471":"it's more like a 3 75 after reading so many stories about the plight of jews and those who tried to help them i still found myself getting anxious about these characters they have stayed with me because they have such unique traits but also because the book is read by a german woman with a good solid german accent","1472":"thx rita for the recommendation thank heavens for lots of work commuting to keep the story moving more quickly for me great story revolving around sigrid who steps into the murky and dangerous world of aiding jews who are trying to leave berlin in 1942 every time i got in the car and began to listen i found my fingers clenching the steering wheel","1473":"this is dark and unsettling story that provides an eye opening glimpse into what life may have been for women living in berlin during the hostilities of ww11 set in 1943 the city is void of men most have gone to fight on two fronts and berlin has become a city of women children and elderly this book was impossible to put down and even harder to forget although the ww11 germany may be familiar mr gillham has managed to make the story fresh and tells it through the eyes of sigrid schroder his fictional characters whose husband is off on the front lines and lives every day in a stale terror of english bombings food shortage and neighborly suspicion for all intents and purposes she is the model german wife but behind this facade she is an entirely different woman one that dreams of her lover a jewish lover... and she is not the only one with secrets... this is a page turner that explores what happens to people when they are faced with choices that can make the difference between life and death as the book progresses sigrid's life becomes riddled with danger and as a reader i experienced a multitude of emotions heard the bomb sirens the sound of flying aircraft felt her hunger and hardship and understood why she made the choices she did the characterization is outstanding the setting is an impressive imagery of the times and a unique perspective of the female experience this book is beautifully written the prose is lyrical and inviting and the dialogue quite sharp this was a good choice that kept me riveted till the end","1474":"the characters felt flat to me though i did enjoy the fast paced movie like ending","1475":"great book of that time period at first i had a hard time following all of the names and places associated with germany but the women of berlin were so intriguing it took me a while to really get into it but the when story started playing out i was hooked","1476":"this book is so full of tension and the fear of living with oppression and poverty and who can you trust that i had to flip to the end to ease the tension and then read bits and pieces to fill in the gaps it was a terrible time and place to live trapped is the feeling","1477":" excellent book exploring what happens to ordinary people thrust into extraordinary times author david gillham's quote set in wwii germany it's not a drama about the horrors of war or the nazis but a story of awakening adjusting our focus and reaching outto help others the main character sigrid evolves from being a good german wife oblivious to the changing world around her to a women discoveringthe reality surrounding her she must make a conscious decision to take action and determine good from bad propaganda fromtruth and friends from enemies seemingly a grim story it's not the reader is led along a path showing the human side of human nature and the positive choices we can make","1478":" i really liked this book this is the second wwii book i've read that's told from the german perspective it was impossible for me to drum up any sympathy but it definitely gave an insight as to the fear the germans not just the jews lived under not only from their enemies but from their own government the day to day dreariness the fake coffee cigarettes milk eggs etc was so depressing so different than the image the german regime wanted you to believe good looking blonde men and women well fed and smiling no german glance coming from them i was a little skeptical of all the movie theatre scenes i know it's dark in there but people can still hear","1479":"not a comfortable read but a very good story","1480":"loved the complexity of the character of sigrid","1481":"this was an exceptional book one i will never forget","1482":"this book made me feel that i was in berlin 1943 watching and observing sigrid i felt so much history in this book and really how the germans really just felt they couldn't see around them for fear loved the ending excellent read","1483":"a compelling read which takes place in wwii berlin historical fiction and a lot of action","1484":"stunning and very different angle on wwii from the pov of a lonely hausfrau who has a passionate affair with a german jew and then gradually gets involved in smuggling jews convincing evocation of the times well developed characters and an intricate plot make this first novel irresistible","1485":"it was a little confusing in the beginning but it got a lot better it was extremely interesting to read about germany during wwii since we mostly learn about the jewish community","1486":"couldn't put it down","1487":"the writing was slightly choppy and since the flashbacks were not distinguished by a different typeface or separated by a space sometimes i didn't realize i was in the midst of one and would have to back track other than that this was an engrossing and captivating story having never been a very good history student it was interesting how the lives of people in berlin were affected by wwii the fear and struggle for survival during every day life even for the good germans","1488":"loved reading this book characters seem so real and lots of twists and turns good description of war torn berlin","1489":" i received this book for free through good reads first reads i must say that the author has done a splendid job of writing a book through a woman's point of view there are parts in this novel where if the reader was unaware of the author's gender one would assume it had to be female the emotional charge the thought process and the reasoning behind the main character has been more than accurately described and portrayed as a woman this is indeed a war book however it tells of home life not the action i found this a pleasant change from traditional books the location of the book could be controversial for some readers as its set in germany during world war 2 some people will blame the german people for ww2 but you have to realize that the german people for the most part knew nothing of the horrific nature of the concentration camps some people believed that the prisoners were being used for labour with the men away who was there to do any physical labour it made sense to many people that the prisoners were a cheap form of labour but when the people found out about the slaughter they were outraged and disgusted just like the rest of the world i think this is a splendid book that does show the reader what did happen to the german people during the war what happens to people while their country is at war","1490":"finally a good book i was in a dry spell i have a fascination with nazi germany i've read several books about this time period and this one is a favorite there are many fifty shades of gray moments in this book which doesn't hurt either if you like this time period you'll love it it really shows a lot of the stuff people had to go through just to survive and how often the worlds of jews and germans could coexist whether the regime wanted them to or not love love this book","1491":"great writing so great the author put me right in the middle of the action which is heart wrenching really made me examine what i value which is one of my favorite pastimes the writing got a little sloppy towards the end perhaps this was intended to portray the tempo of the events","1492":"i loved this book i got it because it was one of amazon's daily deals or maybe one of the kindle 100 and once i started it i couldn't put it down i think it was the first book i've read about berlin wwii that is told from the viewpoint of the women left in the city","1493":"i have read a few fictional books about world war ii this book adds a complete different perspective than i have read in that it is set in berlin during the war it gives a unique perspective of the war from the german women left in the city to cope with the men being gone to war and coping with those men left in the city it also deals with the jewish situation and some people having to take sides the book was grim at times but then that is what it was like for them to live through that time period if you are interested in seeing the german women's side of the war you might enjoy this read","1494":"betrayal risk double crossing treachery violence hitler's 1943 berlin who would you trust not your friends not your neighbors sometimes not even your family and yet many ordinary berlin citizens still risked their lives over and over to help the jews in this case a german soldier's wife helps the underground hide jews all the while juggling her imperious mother in law her jewish lover her ss lover and various other complicated relationships this book does an excellent job showing the ethical dilemma faced by the german citizens i was completely taken in by the story and tense the entire time i read it","1495":"awesome read very moving felt real and could understand why the characters did what they did their motivation for their actions even the ones we would disagree with walk a mile in my shoes knowing what is morally right and acting on that great read","1496":"only for the most serious of world war two fiction the writer in an afterward asks the question what wouldyou have done i have often said that most people imaginethemselves more brave than they really are and would havebeen hiding anne frank in their attic in 1943 berlin segrid appears to what would be described as a goodgerman hausfrau her husband is fighting on the eastern front and she is home living withhis battle axe mother faithfully going to work at a government patentoffice everyday she has no friends except a woman from work thatshe sneaks an occasional cigarette with smoking for woman is frownedupon by the reich segrid is not so ideal a german woman because she met a man in thecinema previously and has been having an affair with him he is a jewavoiding the authorities he tells her one night while she has indulged in an escape from her mil she goesagain to the cinema suddenly the girl who is an au pair for the family upstairsin her building sits down next to her and requests a huge favor becauseas ericha says she can tell segrid will say yes she tells the gestapoman that ericha has been with her all along at the movies from thispoint on even though she fights it at first segrid is drawn into a circle ofgermans who are helping u boats jews are under the radar hiding from thegestapo there are many twists in turns in this story involving a cast of characterswith varied motives and who are not what they seem to be the author did a fantastic job of conveying the under the surface senseof darkness and gloom that penetrated the into the lives of the citizensof germany at this time on some subliminal level they all sense thatgermany has already lost the war regardless of the constant news to thecontrary the story does end on a hopeful note for some of the characters buthaving the benefit of hindsight we know there are two more bloody awfulyears of the war ahead so anything could happen","1497":"wwii germany other than stones from the river i don't think i have read a book from the german point of view from this time read the gr summary of this book and it explains the plot pretty well i thought the first half of the book was a little slow but it got better for me and i found i really enjoyed the story by the end it raises the questions of what would you do to help others under the nazi regime how much would you risk what is your true character","1498":"hmm i had a hard time keeping the characters of this book straight the story was actually quite good but i am not familiar with german names terms so i struggled a bit","1499":"entertaining but not great one thing stood out though you can definitely tell that a man wrote this book when you look at the way the sex was handled i'm sorry only a man would think dream that a bored housewife would jump into bed or any other convenient surface with every man she meets even one just sitting in the next seat in the theater a nazi officer coming out of the apartment across the hall give me a break","1500":"good story with historical setting that got much better more intense and fast paced towards the end a story about the struggles of war and humanity","1501":"makes us wonder what kind of person we would find under our skin in those circumstances","1502":" stephen king recommended this book from ew picks 2013 he said the city is berlin 1943 and the woman we care about is sigrid whose husband is fighting on the eastern front sigrid is seduced by two very different men the sex in this book is hot hot hot but the real seduction involves her reluctant participation in a scheme to ferry jews to safety you haven't experienced such gray skies since season 1 of the killing but the feel is all casablanca i can't wait for gillham's next novel--play it again sam 3 17 15 overall i thought this was a well written book with complex characters not necessarily likeable and unexpected suspense i agree with others that there did seem to be too many coincidences and that sigrid was overly lucky when she kept revealing to virtual strangers about her role in helping escaped jews view spoiler i knew something odd was up with egon and finding out he was a catcher wasn't too surprising but when he finally tells all to sigrid i couldn't help feeling sorry for him and the terrible position he found himself in it seemed poetic justice that he should die in the end i applaud sigrid for deciding to stay and help more people escape hide spoiler","1503":" i think i liked it if it weren't for that annoying distracting present tense and the repetitive use of the adjective thick i mean c'mon how can everything be thick and what does it eventually mean anyway i cannot however completely knock gillham's writing skills there were numerous bits of prose that i highlighted for its creativity but they were pretty much used up in the first chapter like bait then everything became thick and otherwise redundant in description that said the plot is excellent with parts that i sped read in excitement then reread or thought through to make sure i got its twists and implications i would've given it 4 stars if i liked the story better it was difficult for me to appreciate all the german terms and that period disturbs me but it was worth reading for the thought provoking portrayal of women which is the only reason i did read it what i appreciated most was the conflict between those berliners who believed in the party and those who had sense to know it was insane this story could've delved much deeper into those characters in order to truly be a better historical novel that's complicated tho and would've turned this book into a literary epic rather than the airport novel it is i noticed some readers complained about the necessity of all the sex perhaps not but it does not detract from the story i'd say it lends to a particularly well planned ironic twist on page 352 you'll see the 3rd act was gripping in which the growth of the heroine amidst various betrayals is inspiring if you like period stories with leading heroic women i recommend this story","1504":"not your typical wwii book the characters are interesting and the intrigue of who can and cannot be trusted is compelling i really enjoyed this novel and gillham's writing style highly recommend","1505":"this book was terrific a great book group selection because it would generate some interesting discussion about what courage really is and can we ever know how we would react in difficult circumstances sigrid is in my mind a reluctant but in the end true heroine ruled by her passions and appetites but rising to meet expectations she never even realized for herself the writing is brilliant and the characters wonderfully drawn","1506":"complex and provocative the characters got under my skin i'm still thinking about this book a couple weeks after finishing it","1507":"some flaws but otherwise i fully enjoyed this book what would you do what would you do if a woman sits next to you and asks for your help when you know the price you might pay would you help or continue following all the rules whether they are right or wrong","1508":"good story i just wish the author would have toned down the sex a little","1509":"story line had potential gratuitous sex was crude and unnecessary none of the characters were particularly likeable i liked the ending because it left the reader wondering what came next the story was an important one too bad the writer didn't convey it better","1510":"this book is set in nazi germany and i historical fiction the characters are believable and complex there is internal and external conflict revolving around risking your life to hide jews and help them out of the country i enjoyed the twists and turns in this novel","1511":"i ended up liking this book and the characters the author does a really good job with character development and the story itself in the beginning i could only think bleak but it was more to me by the end","1512":" novel set in 1943 berlin sigrid schroder is a good german wife living with her difficult mother in law her husband serving on the eastern front her true character comes out as she becomes involved in sheltering and transporting jews and also has an affair with a jewish man in addition a high ranking ss officer's wife and family moves down the hall in the apartment house british air raids are on going and many other women are loyal \"party\" bullies who give orders and threats of turning others over to the gestapo captivating","1513":"i got about 2 3 of the way through and this book no longer held my interest","1514":"i loved this book moving simple elegant made me think long and hard about who i'd be in a situation like this how brave i would be whether i'd stand up for what was right","1515":"it is lengthy but it is worth it world war ii berlin it's becoming apparent the war in the east will not be as easily conquered as the nazis want their people to believe the british are constantly bombing food is scarce winters are cold droves of jews are being arrested beaten taken away what will happen when you don't want to sit back and watch any more what happens when your conscience is ringing louder than that of being patriotic to the fuhrer u0026amp the fatherland","1516":"while this book like most ww ii books was very sad and had horrible scenes it was also different in that the characters were so realistic no one was all good no one all bad some of the main characters did terrible unforgivable things but also brave and heroic things","1517":" i choose this book because i was interested in the premise of the story i liked the idea the story was set in berlin 1943 and it was told from the point of view of a german woman sigrid she works in the patent office lives with her mother in law while her husband fights on the eastern front sigrid becomes entangled with a group that help jews escape germany the cause is good but sigrid helps for selfish reasons for me i lost interest in sigrid's character the more i read i found she was shallow and distant i did not like her i also felt the book became confusing near the end it seemed that all the characters became double agents and i could not figure out who was telling the truth for me the interesting premise could not overcome the two dimensional protagonist","1518":"i gave up on this one","1519":" 1940s berlin comes vividly to life in this war torn novel sigrid schroder who may appear to be the typical german housewife starts to break free from the daily routine of wartime life and begins to question the violence she sees around her she becomes embroiled with a group attempting to smuggle jews and other escapees out of germany a dangerous task that puts sigrid and many of those around her at risk a good novel highlighting a lesser known aspect of the second world war and a good piece of historical fiction","1520":" i really liked this story from a german point of view i read this with an open mind and not at all judgmental this was a most horrific time in history and as the author said as he was writing this story what would you do the characters were well developed and believable and the author really captured the mood of the time in berlin this was a slow intense build to a heart pounding end that brought tears to my eyes it was even made more real for me as i listened to this on audio and the reader had a good german dialect","1521":"one of those books that as i read i could hear the voice of the narrator her german accent feel the time really enjoyed it","1522":"the author paints an interesting picture of life in berlin in 1943 good facts i did think though that the writing was kind of choppy","1523":"city of women was a consuming book i could not put the story down few books grab me from beginning to end but this story certainly could not be left alone for long dealing with berlin and the war efforts during world war ii it chronicled sigrid and her mission do become increasing involved with what she saw of the injustices of the war effort","1524":"it took me a bit to get into this book but once i did i thoroughly enjoyed it the main character is sigrid wife of a german soldier in berlin during wwii at first she almost seems boring going to work coming home to her mil no kids takes a lover etc but as the cast of characters expands so does sigrid's appeal she becomes a german citizen dedicated to the jewish people hiding from the ss and to others who also need to escape and avoid detection we learn about the complex web of people involved and the lengths to which they will go in order to maintain their beliefs sigrid becomes a strong and independent free thinking and reliable woman","1525":"i certainly was intrigued when i read the overview for this book little did i know the story would become an obsession this was one of those book that i wanted to constantly be reading but did not want it to end sigrid has a simple albeit boring life she is a german wife who lives with her very mean mother in law she has an affair and falls in love with a secretive jewish man named egon weiss she meets a young girl named ericha who is involved with helping jews escape the horrors of 1943 germany ericha goads sigrid into helping with escapees called u boats because they are \"those in hiding 'submarines' because they are submerged and must run silently to avoid detection and destruction \" one family consists of a woman and her two daughters egon has told sigrid that he has a wife and two daughters that he believes are dead could this be them what should she do who can she ask for help when today's friend could be tomorrow's enemy one misstep one wrong word one wrong look and the whole process could come tumbling down i often put this book down with my stomach in knots from the suspense there were several twists and i often gasped when someone who seemed trustworthy turned out to be not so i am so often amazed at the art of storytelling this book is a perfect example of why a page turner from the very beginning i hope mr gillham has more tales to weave as i would definitely be interested in reading any other books that he may write thank you so much to penguin group usa and netgalley for allowing me to read this arc for an unbiased review publish date august 7 2012","1526":"gripping story of life in berlin during world war ii leaves me with the question what would i have done","1527":"it was recommended to me but i thought it was just ok","1528":"loved it this is the kind of book that makes you wish you were in a book club that has in depth discussions about the characters character development was superb it is really well written and i definately recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic of women living during in berlin in the 1940's","1529":"i put off reading this book because i have read so msny holicaust books this was good book for the genre because it wtitten to describe ordinary life and views of women living in berlin during wwii","1530":" i loved this book the characters are complex the plot is riddled with twists and turns and it's unlike any book i have ever read that is set during the second world war the moral questions this book raises regarding self preservation sacrifice and the mob mentality are just as relevant today as they were back then another thing that i particularly liked was i could identify women in my own life who fit the character descriptions of kasper's mother frau mundt renate etc the author nailed womens jealousy insecurities false friendships and cattiness that are so easily found when groups of women are together for extended periods of time my only complaint was that i didn't like how sigrid could not let egon go i wanted her to be stronger especially when the true circumstances surrounding his immediate family where revealed other than that i could not put it down and i highly recommend it","1531":"i liked this book very much well written unexpected plot turns an interesting and original main character what's not to like highly recommended for those who enjoy good historical fiction and also a well developed story","1532":"i absolutely love ww2 stories and this is one of the best i can not think of anything to criticize about this book except that the kindle version needed better proofreading gillham has created the mood and feel of berlin in 1943 to perfection with awesome authenticity he will cause your heart to pound when the story gets tense our heroine sigrid is also perfect an ordinary woman living a dreary life when suddenly she is called upon to make an important choice does she continue to live a 'safe' ordinary life or does she step up to the plate and take risks in order to save others along with sigrid all of the other main characters sparkle and come to life i was especially impressed by gillham's ability to write from sigrid's point of view in fact i was impressed by all of gillham's writing and storytelling skills he is an excellent writer i highly recommend this novel it is definitely up there with the glass room and the invisible bridge","1533":"really bewildered by the many star reviews by people and as far as stephen king describing the sex as hot hot hot no it is not not not not for anyone who is used to reading steamy sex scenes or erotica anyway unless you think it's hot to have a total stranger in a move theater strike up a conversation and a couple sentences into it grab your hand and put it on his erection because after that kind of foreplay wouldn't any woman say oh yeah baby climb on top of me and do me right now in a movie theater seat there are lots of sex scenes like that much tearing of clothing and rutting but just not much sexual tension building to said scenes or in them i waited the whole book thinking hoping there would be an explanation of why this seeming ordinary berlin hausfrau began an affair like that the first time but never found out i imagined perhaps a character like her might feel a kind of dull desperation like halle berry in monster's ball wanting to be made to feel something but there was nothing in the actual pages to either show that or perhaps another reason because it was tuesday because she was aroused by the other people getting busy a few rows away that sigrid would decide to bang a stranger in the cinema despite being written kind of from sigrid's point of view i never felt close to her or any of the characters they all felt stiff an unbelievable loving around like paper dolls i don't mind flawed characters but i wanted to like some of the people in it anybody but i came away not really liking anyone the author also made the odd choice to write in present tense except when in flashback mode and there were plenty of them and it's a style choice that is perhaps meant to give it more immediacy but i wasn't feeling it and the whole issue with the jewish mother and two girls who may or may not be the lover's wife and kids that was weird the plot itself was interesting and had lots of twist and turns and i thought the cover was gorgeous","1534":"this was a willbrook book club book i found the book interesting and education learning more about living in berlin during hitler's oppression the book told of the ways women survived during this madness especially the main character sigfried it's amazing what people will do to save themselves and their families unfortunately having to make decisions nobody ever wants to make","1535":"perfect summer read for me gillham treads the line between compulsive readability and literary grace and believe me there can be a real line there beautifully and i love how as with all really good historical fiction this one retreads ground you thought you

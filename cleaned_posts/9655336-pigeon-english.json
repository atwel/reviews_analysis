loved it this is a must read sometimes the words are hard to follow and jumpy jumpy but do you expect for a story from the eyes of an 11 year old","2":"i have to say i did not read this book but listened to it on audible the reader was amazing at getting the accent and voice just right i'm not sure reading it would have been as easy this is the story of a seventh grade boy coming to england from ghana the author gets the seventh grade boy part to a t very very genuine the book exposes the reader to an alternate persective that we don't normally get what is it like to be poor and new to a culture this is not however a depressing read as the boy embraces life with an openess and joy that are also genuine","3":" loved this harri has recently emigrated to london from ghana with one of his two sisters and his mom the father and sibling are coming later he's eleven and discovering the ins and outs of urban gangs middle school crushes sport it's a pretty rich ground in which to plant a good mystery harri and friend dean are not what you'd call typical detectives of course being guided by popular television but the unsolved stabbing of a neighborhood boy nags at their sense of justice as does the hope of reward but the larger mystery is this transplanted boy trying to figure out life it has emotional heft and a great drive this is the third book to make me cry in 2011

immigrant from ghana as he tries to make sense of his new surroundings and how he starts to play the detective on a recent murder on the housing estate this is a compelling read one which is far from a sad story","5":"i'm not always a fan of the use of child narrators but harri an 11 year old ghanaian boy living in london is a vivid and winning creation enthusiastic about friends superheroes and trainers and partially blind to the harshness of life around him he treats life as an adventure and the murder of a school boy as a detective case his comparisons between africa and the uk are wise and lyrical his humour and language english mixed with street slang and african idiom is witty and infectious but the portrayal of knife crime and london is moving and poignant","6":"it took a while to get used to the writing style as it is 'voiced' by an 11 year old ghanian boy harri who recently moved to the uk and lives on an inner city council estate he and his best friend decide to try and solve the murder of a local schoolboy after seeing his body after a stabbing thought provoking it seems to be partially based on the murder of damilola taylor so isn't the most cheerful subject matter but a good read","7":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here book at bedtime r4blurb this is the first novel by stephen kelman which tells the story of 11 year

a great little story told through the eyes a 11 year old ghanese boy growing up in london england note make sure you read the glossary at the back of the book before you start so you understand the terminology harrison uses throughout the narrative pg 249 the war was here it was real you just knew it there was smoke everywhere it was thick black and it filled up the whole sky you could feel the fire from miles away everybody went to watch the playground die dean 'i thought it was a plane crash at first i wish it was that'd be wicked 'somebody set the swings on fire that's where most of the smoke was coming from the rubber smell from the seats got in my nose i couldn't smell anything else you know when a smell is so big it even makes you laugh well that's what it felt like you only couldn't laugh because all the grown ups were watching the fire was a disaster and you had to be serious dean's mamma 'it's them bloody kids that done it i saw 'em in there when i come back from the chemist's they were trying to light it then 'lady with big arms 'when was that 'dean's mamma 'just now i was coming back from the chemist's i knew they were up to something 'manik's papa 'little bastards 'the climbing frame was on fire was well all the metal was gone black and the rope from the net was burned off and dying the fire was very hot when i got close it made me go proper itchy it felt lovely and sleepy it was the biggest fire i've ever seen some smaller kids were playing a game to see who could get the closest they all ran to the fire and the one who got closest before they ran away again was the winner it looked brutal i wanted to play but i had to show respect when you're year 7 you have to set an example everybody just watched the fire they didn't even want to talk anymore they just wanted to watch the couldn't help it they were stuck there they playground was dying but nobody was trying to save it they knew they couldn't do anything it was too hot and beautiful they knew the fire would always win it was brilliant and sad and hutious all at the same time i only wanted to snap a photo of the pirate ship before it sank forever i just wanted to be there for when the playground died so it knew i was there and that i loved it until the end","10":"enjoyed the perspective of the narrator young boy newly immigrated to england interesting to see the problems he faced trying to fit in with his peers looking at issues related to poverty and racism style reminded me of room which i also enjoyed","11":"brutal felt very real and harri is a character i won't forget","12":" i saw this when it first came out and was not impressed one bit when i read the blurb on the back i was like 'how is this getting all these good comments and how can it be short listed for the man booker prize it sounds total garbage ' then last week in the library i came across it again so i had a look and again concluded it was total toss but then i found a version with a different cover the blurb on the back made it sound lie a completely different story so i had a glance through the pages and i suddenly just knew i was going to really enjoy it it is so well written though it is from the perspective of an 11 year old boy yet it is not a child's book there are many many things that every single person can relate to the fact that he lives in a block of high rise flats and is becoming aware of the gang culture is captured incredibly well the tragic events involving damilola taylor are the inspiration behind this story and the author does justice to the memory of him and other knife crime victims admittedly i did get confused with the pigeon references from time to time but that didn't spoil it at all for me i think this should be given out as a 'must read' to all year 7 kids the topics that it covers are very real in many young peoples lives as well as in many adults however as it is not a child's book i think many might miss many of the meanings throughout the story but if it was studied as part of an english lesson i think a lot could be learnt from it so pleased they released a different version with a much better cover which actually caught the true essence of it without overwhelming the reader i think the author should be incredibly proud of this book i really really enjoyed it","13":"interesting to read because of the point of view and topic not sure that it is man booker prize shortlist material though and as for the talking pigeon","14":"its well bad","15":"warms up into a good read in the second half","16":" this is a must read written in first person and from the point of view of harry an eleven year old boy if my memory serves me well is the most intelligent and convincing narration i have come across the novel is funny yet disturbing and the reader is told of the young boys own world but through the innocence of a not quite mature enough to understand the world boy present tense with analepsis allows the reader into the distance between his old life and his new life kelman's terrific talent of show not tell and the young protagonists inexperience creates a sense of irony as the adult reader see's what the child is too young to notice himself i am not going to go into the plot as i feel that this is something i do not want to spoil but believe me kelman's characters are fully fleshed out and the world they live in as real as any run down council estate in the uk this novel surprised me made me laugh and brought me to tears and has left a tiny book shaped hole in my heart well done stephen kelman","17":"i found the narrator both endearing for his insights and perspective on the world and frustrating for the limitations inherent in viewing a story through the eyes of a fanciful preteen boy","18":"i loved harri's voice and cared about him as a character it's sad that the world he lives in makes a tragedy inevitable but i suppose that's the point","19":" this was an interesting one at the beginning i was really enjoying it it was a nice change to read from a childs perspective but like the case often is with children harri's voice soon became repetitive and almost annoying however kelman took on the role of harri perfectly and i was 100% convinced the point of view could well have come from an 11 year old boy it wasn't all bad it did have me laughing regularly and the ending caught me off guard but at one point i recall telling my roommate that i wish it'd just end already which is never a good sign maybe just one of those books for those with a very acquired taste can't win 'em all","20":"a thoroughly likable narrator with insight into the realities of the immigrant life in great britain","21":"sweet and poignant story part detective story part coming of age story naive cultural misunderstandings and immigrant english make this story clever and touching","22":"i'm rather surprised this book was published let alone impressed anyone how on earth did it make the shortlist for the booker","23":"should have been older to start reading it","24":"i did this book a severe injustice by reading it too quickly the young boy's voice annoyed me at the start so i sped up in order to finish it quickly by the time i had got used to the style of narration and started to enjoy and appreciate it it was too late worth a re read","25":"compelling story of a ghanain 11 year old boy like his inner city compadres in so many ways yet so different in his core of innocence surprised at the code of silence that seems to operate around the murder of another child he decides to try to piece the code together using his detective skills a vital story of the inhumanity of inner city life on ghettoised estates told beautifully by a pure voice experiencing the madness from within","26":" done and dusted heyyyy happy days many months since 4 stars have been given this book literally took me 2 weeks to read gr only because i was sidetracked nothing against this book at all in any way so first off let me just say i really did like this book and would probs recommend it to you guys reading this right now basically it is about a boy from ghana now in england and investigating a murder however you will be shocked from the way it is kinda written esp the dialogue which is in a unique style seriously though try it out it might be your thing the perspective of the 12 year old is refreshing and the language is colloquial and interesting i simply laughed at the sexual jokes made dont worry they were in moderation good great character buildingbad plot line dodgy let me point out that the ending was beautiful and kinda heart wrenching just read this but don't expect mind blowing stuff like i expected you might be disappointed huh","27":" i'm afraid i really can't say that i overall enjoyed this novel it was well written and i finished it quickly helped by two long public transit rides in one week the main character harrison opoku is a fun and interesting narrator to provide a window into the world of his neighbourhood and the book does have it's moments but i'm afraid that this book fits to a t the stereotype about canadian literature with a capital l if my alphabetical explanation makes any sense it's a depressing book on a depressing subject with only a few moments of levity for relief other authors have proven that it's possible to write about serious subjects without making your book a drag but unfortunately it doesn't appear to be something canadian novelists have learned yet or at least such is my extremely generalized biased and unfair i know view of canadian writers","28":"i both loved laughed out loud and found myself struggling with this book i couldn't finish it bc i peeked at the ending think i will be very hapy to hear it on tape","29":"combination sweet funny and sad coming of age story told from the point of view of a young boy from ghana trying to find his way after moving to london with his mother and sister","30":"painful to read if you ask what with all the weird expressions the annoying voice of the pigeon and the whole story really was not impressed and i think that giving one star is already too much","31":" my paperback edition advertises this book as if you liked the curious incident of the dog in the night time and room then you'll like this i liked both those books though i had some issues with the 5 year old narrative voice of 'room' but it meant i found this book utterly unremarkable the voice had been done before the situation and life it was describing had too i got a bit bored to be honest my teenage son liked it so i'm looking forward to discussing it with him particularly his thoughts on the ending but i can't believe this book got shortlisted for the booker prize","32":" i remember hearing a lot about this when it came out but i never got around to reading it then a few people in one of my book groups were talking about it and one of them very kindly e mailed me a kindle copy pigeon english is narrated by a young recently arrived immigrant from ghana to inner city london harrison he talks about his day to day life after a local teenager is murdered on his estate harrison and his friends try to find out who the killer was which is a game to them and mess about like year 7 kids do playing with local dogs winding up old people throwing stones at buses teasing his older sister and trying to avoid getting beaten up by the local gangs i loved harrison's narration a quirky mix of london and ghanaian slang and so sweet innocent and funny he is really sympathetic character and you are really rooting for him throughout not a lot happens but as an adult reader you can see between the lines as to the problems his family have had coming over to britain and the violence and poverty that surrounds him i would have said it's truly uplifting but spoiler alert there is a shocking sudden ending i think this is an important book telling a very realistic story of life for many children and teenagers in britain today but told with humour","33":"harrison is a sweet little kid from ghana recently moved to a rough part of london most of the book is about how much he loves his family and the simple pleasures of goofing around with his basically good kid friends gently teases his older sister intensely misses his baby sister still in ghana at school he has the fun of jokes and winning a sports day race and his first girlfriend harri's voice is funny and unique when someone's mad they go \"red eyes \" when he's pouting at his mother she tells him not to make \"squeeze eyes \" his favorite amplifier is \"asweh\" \"i swear\" i was completely charmed by harri all around harri is casual violence a high school gang torments the neighborhood vandalising whatever they can knocking over old men to rob them stabbing young men who make them lose face harri and his friends make the kind of crime solving efforts you'd expect 11 year olds to make not very effective but the gang reacts ferociously the pigeon is the philosopher observer of harri's life where harri is naive and cheerful the pigeon sadly shakes his head about humans in general we can't give up violence because we are not \"something greater than just another invention of a spiteful god \" we should be more humble \" y ou all want to be the sea but you're not the sea you're just a raindrop say it with me i am a drop in the ocean i am neighbor nation north and nowhere i am one among many and we all fall together \" as he prepares himself to guide the next victim from life to death the pigeon observes \"they're just meat loosely wrapped around a blazing star we don't mourn the wrapping once it's discarded we celebrate the freeing of the star \"beautiful writing and a darker book than the child's voice would lead you to believe","34":"a perfect book of our times where the borders between worlds is diminishing so rapidly the innocence of harri as he maneuvers his new country is beautifully told","35":" man booker prize 2011 shortlistedstephen kelman's debut book about the world told through the innocent eyes of 11 year old ghana immigrant harri opoku is a great read pigeon english is a colorful humorous and captivating novel harri lives in urban london in a flat in a block adjacent a bunch of other blocks of flats on finding out about the knifing of one of his schoolmates he dreams of solving the murder in his quest as detective harri stumbles on grave material only an older person could understand this is why the story works we as older readers feel for the boy and his desire to piece the story together we care about the character and want to protect him aileen donegan","36":"at first glance this book reminded me of the curious incident of the dog in the night time there is a murder at the start of each book and the stories are narrated by barely teenage boys but actually i think that's where the similarities end pigeon english centres around harrison opoku an eleven year old boy from ghana who has immigrated to london with his mother and sister the other half of his family is still back in ghana where his dad is saving up money so they can all be together in london the familial aspect is definitely one of my favourite parts of this book the intensity of love and sacrifice in these relationships really made this book worth reading writing wise the language took some getting used to but it was worth it because i felt immersed in harrison's world his distinctive voice lots of slang was full of personality and i seeing the world through his curious eyes gave me a lot of laughs of course the story has an underlying darkness due to the murder as well as the hardships that the characters experience the author is definitely not afraid to get into the grittiness of life in the urban environment for once i had no idea where the story was going and i'm glad i didn't know because it's kind of heart breaking in the best way","37":" wow what an ending seriously what an ending i was getting a bit bored with harri's narrative his english though cute started to get to me in the end and the way he jumped from one topic to another like a real 11 year old would do i guess started to annoy me to until that is i reached those last 2 pages i was so caught by surprise with this ending that i had to stop reading take a deep breath and read the passages again just to make sure i'd understood it was then that i realised that harri had been my friend all along superb","38":"a beautiful story about an immigrant coming of age in london written from adolescent point of view i found it a refreshing change from other books i've read this year","39":"someone said it compares favourably with the sense of an ending by julian barnes which imho is the best book this century absolute rubbish there is no comparison this book is dreadful the lingua franca of the 'streets' is forced ridiculous and very boring the ending is a huge trick very poor this is not the 'lovely bones ' i found the whole book boring sentimental and those pigeons poisoning would have been too good for them sorry but that's it","40":"following the story of a boy's life in the uk after leaving ghana and how he tries to fit in with the local crowd in a rough neighbourhood","41":"can you give no stars hated this book","42":"i really liked this book great perspective from an 11 yr old ghanian immigrant in the projects in england named harri great lingo so touching harri is trying to figure out his new school girls how to avoid gangs","43":"found the whole notion of harrison struggling to adapt to an alien culture totally convincing particularly the way he uses language combining street slang with the more formal aspects of english there is a very good moral dilemma in the way he is drawn to the violence of his school mates yet still manages to retain an innate goodness as does his sister a very clever balance of humour and tragedy highly recommended","44":" pigeon english is a book that you eventually cannot put down and will stay with you for a while after you've finished it based on real life events that happened in 2000 stephen kelman writes a powerful story he knows the world of boys of people who arrive in england from other countries and whose first language is not english who must adapt to estate living gangs and the language of gangs the story deals with serious topics and much like in room telling the story from a child's perspective which delivers a hard punch i think some reviewers might not understand the double meaning of pigeon english...they read and refer to it as if is just the pigeon talking to harri but it also refers to pidgin english which is a non specific name used to refer to any of the many pidgin languages derived from english... in the beginning of the book harri's friend ask him have you got happiness to which he answered yes understanding that he must be happy until another child explained to him what the underlying meaning actually was","45":" this was a book that i'd heard good things about so when i saw it on the recommended shelf at the library i had to read it harrison was likeable from the very start the author did a great job at making him believable and he had the perfect mix of the 'streetwise' of someone living in london with the naivete of having just moved from ghana plus he sounded his age i've found that sometimes writing from the perspective of a child can seem forced and contrived but this doesn't at all i like books that are written in dialect because providing the author does it well it provides an extra layer of authenticity to the story this is one book that really does require that dialect there were points where i had to read it a couple of times before i understood it but it worked the plot was clearly based on the murder of damilola taylor and that also added another layer to the book because it brought to life the emotion that must have been felt by those around him it moved at a good pace and the ending was for me completely unexpected the story evoked a mixture of emotions in me and i came to really like harrison i liked his curiosity and his boldness considering he was in a new place with a completely different culture something he kept referring to by explaining how things were different in his country i enjoyed that glimpse into another totally different way of life the one part i didn't like was the pigeon and the random chapters from its point of view it did serve its purpose as a plot device by the end of the story but to be honest it just annoyed me aside from the pigeon though i thought this was a well written debut and i'll be looking out for more from kelman","46":"an ok book reasonably well written although i felt that the use of the main character to tell the story in his own words detracted from could have been a more powerful novel some goods ideas but didn't seem to quite get there especially the end which was a bit obvious and could have been so much more given the number of story lines running throughout the book","47":"can see why popular not really my style of writing ending just to sudden","48":"obviously events like this happen they shouldn't a grim sense of inevitability to the story which frustrated me as harrison is a marvellous creation inventive language main gripe was the inclusion of the pigeon really think i must have missed something","49":"the narrative voice really shines in this book characters feel real the environment and new immigrant experiences feel real the manic style takes a little getting used to but it works given that the storyteller is an 11 year old boy italicized text representing the pigeon's thoughts however isn't especially necessary and takes away from the overall feel of the narrative a very disappointing predictable ending","50":" moving shockingas an ex pat british national every time i go back to london i am more shocked than the last time at its decay physical and moral when i was growing up i knew there were one or two limited areas in which i wouldn't want to be late at night now there are whole swathes where i know i am not safe to travel in a bus in broad daylight eleven year old harrison opoku is the foil to london's underbelly his newness freshness and above all his innocence highlight londoners' modern immunity to violence of the most inhumane and primitive type in short to that city's destitution in every sense of that word he is the beautiful bird that is destroyed by the raptors the laughing optimistic naive oh how movingly naive child that is thrown into the adult developed world the innocent abroad that the story is based fairly closely on a true series of events surrounding the death of damilola taylor in 2000 adds to the emotion as well as to the sad commentary of a modern western city it is told in a patois version of english and uses in what most people see as the book's flaw a talking pigeon who provides a commentary on the action hence the pun in the title i think the language adds to the value of the book because it adds to the boy's foreignness and is in places very funny i was hugely moved by this book and impressed by how it appeals both to teenagers and adults but oh what has happened to london","51":" it took me a long while to get into this book mainly because of the style of writing i think it is written in the eyes of an 11 year old boy who had recently moved from ghana to london and while it was incredibly realistic and cleverly written perhaps i just wasn't in the right mood to read it now but it had to go back to the library as it has a huge waiting list so i ploughed on it was kind of difficult to follow as his mind leapt from one thing to another as a child's mind probably does and it tackles a difficult subject that of violence and gang culture on our streets seen through incredibly innocent eyes and i became transfixed as it moved towards its ultimately tragic conclusion an important book to read i think to understand our world funny in places and very bittersweet i'm glad i read it","52":"kelman gets totally inside the hyperactive head of 11 year old harrison opoku as he negotiates the vagaries of london's inner city streetlife and tries his hand as a murder detective the result is an exuberant technicolor riot and a sobering education about contemporary urban childhood utterly magical and utterly hazardous as harrison might put it asweh it's brutal","53":"this was the 2nd book in a row that read where the narrative was of human violence narrated by a small boy in this harri 11 recently immigrated from ghana narrates life on his london estate crucially the recent murder of a boy from his school he and his friend set out to identify the killer using their own makeshift versions of techniques picked up from tv shows like csi the thing that really stood out for me was how innocent this little boy is but how simultaneously he's had to grow up very fast the narrative isn't consistent or fluid and i know other reviewers found this annoying but i think it just reflects that the mind of a 11 year old is rarely static and also that all the events on the estate murder gangs sex robbery school fires and so on are somewhat jumbled up in his head it means that despite it being fairly clear who the murderer was from the outset it's never entirely sure because harri isn't sure you get the impression that deep down he knows who it was but is too innocent to admit it to himself there are interspersed narratives from a pigeon whom harri attempts to befriend again other reviewers have said these seemed unnecessary and they weren't sure what they meant but it seemed pretty clear to me that the pigeon represents harri's idea of god he is clearly a little boy who's grown up in a religious family and who is surrounded by it there is some discussion of which of his local churches are real owing to various christian denominations and this confusion is reflected in the fact that for him nature is where god seems to be he is very detailed in his descriptions of trees and birds and grass and so on so the pigeon as an ideal of god makes a lot of sense especially as in london pigeons are omnipresent others have said the ending was too abrupt but without wishing to spoiler too much that's exactly how it was meant to be it was the point i think and the culmination of everything i think the suggestion made in another review that it would've been interesting to hear the voices of the gang or lydia harri's sister or miquita her friend was a good one but i think keeping one narrative albeit the somewhat jumbled and confused one of a small boy worked just as well i also think that by keeping those characters slightly peripheral along with auntie sonia worked well as a device to say that although this little boy is innocent and has a mother who looks out for him the bulk of his family is still in ghana he's separate from the life he's always known and is ultimately completely surrounded by violence almost everybody in his life is violent and even those that he is friends with have dark undertones he sees it on a daily basis and that's why his innocence is really key to the whole thing i really really liked this book it was highly readable funny and engaging but also dark with a pretty nasty undercurrent the ending was definitely abrupt but it worked that way i thought i'd definitely recommend it","54":"i really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it the voice put you at ease while the story kept you tense and nervous","55":"this book was ok the british council estate ghanaian child accented narrator bugged me at times not the character itself but the dialect a couple of very well written passages but inconsistent","56":"ok pigeon was a little irritating provided decent insights into inner city life for those not familiar with a life on a tough council estate narrator was endearing but plot was thin nevertheless an enjoyable read","57":"too try hard and completely over rated the charrming mis use of language just got annoying","58":" pigeon english written by stephen kelman is a book based on the death of ten year old schoolboy damilola taylor the main character is a boy named harrison opoku whose classmate was found dead harrison proceeds to attempt to find out the reason behind the boy's death with his best friend dean life is tough for him as he lives on a council estate in london separated from several members of his family the book is told in an innocent childlike voice and i personally found it very authentic reading about his day to day life on the council estate was something that interested me a lot and i was moved by how he was so grateful for all he had even though compared to most of us he has nothing all in all i found pigeon english a good read the reason i gave it only three stars is because i've forgotten most of the plot and the characters and that is not a good sign i think a book is really great when scenes stick on your head and you find yourself reading it over and over again nonetheless i would recommend this to any one of my friends pigeon english left me feeling happy and grateful for things i never thought to be grateful for","59":"i reallyliked this book good characters good pacing not the run of the mill coming of age story","60":"a good portrayal of growing up in england these days shocking ending that will bring you to tears","61":"i quite enjoyed this a tale of innocence peer pressure and conflicting influences","62":"a christmas present from my niece in dublin looked good but wasn't my sort of book so abandoned it and will release through bookcrossing for someone who might enjoy it more","63":" an utterly believable voice in the main character it was easy to feel sympathetic towards his innocence and acceptance of his environment but it was difficult not to feel disappointed at the ending which felt tragic and unjust i guess it was intended to leave the reader feeling upset and perhaps comparing to similar incidents in real life didn't like the strange paragraphs that were written from the point of view of the pigeon i don't feel like this added anything to the story and each time i stumbled upon one it jolted me from a state of being absorbed in the story to being reminded that it was a work of fiction however a fun quick read which is of the moment","64":" this book explores the issue of gangs in the poorer regions of england i thought that it was well written and i found it a fairly easy read to me its purpose was to adress the issue of gangs and i think it did a very good job of that because i have never really been in contact with gangs etc it was hard for me to connect with the book and i found it pretty boring i don't think that i would recommend this book to anyone above about the age of 11 overall a well written book but i dont think this book was targeted to me","65":"like most modern novels this was almost too easy to read the main character is beautifully presented and the pigeon's interjections add a whole new and grown up angle to the novel the full meaning of which is revealed at the end","66":"painful story beautifully written","67":"the narration from a naive child's point of view was interesting and novel but some parts did become boring","68":"didn't expect that ending","69":"i did not find it convincing and had difficulty finishing the book just finished reading it a second time better the second time around","70":"sometimes i like to read books nobody is talking about so i can champion them and find them new readers and sometimes i just want to read the book everybody else is talking about pigeon english was one of those books it's the story of 11 year old harrison opuku an immigrant from ghana living in a london housing project it's a first person narrative and i had the distinct sense i was watching the world through harri's eyes he has very clear ideas about the world and how it works though of course being a young person and being an immigrant some of the things he feels sure of are not quite right it was a charming story but wrapped around the edgy subjects of gangs and violence the overall affect was of being immersed in the life of an innocent boy while retaining my own view of the dangerousness of the world the tension was great and on top of it all i loved the slang for harri things that are cool are called \"bo styles \" frightening things are \"hutious\" and if something's going to take a long time it's going to be \"donkey hours \" i loved it and recommend it for adults and teens alike","71":"amazing omg i loved this book so much it was absolutely incredible although it took me a little while to get into it was definitely worth reading and it definitely got better very worth reading","72":" i really do not rate this book how it can be compared to room is beyond me the blurb on the back almost seems misleading as they dead boy isnt even his friend and there certainly wasnt any humour i really did not like how it jumped all over the place and actually felt like it was missing the point of the story all the way through and don't even get me started on the pigeons voice ridiculous i found it very hard to get through this book as there was nothing to hold interest or any actual development of the plot a real shame as i had high hopes","73":"review coming shortly","74":"inside the head of an 11 year old boy from ghana now living in london where part of his family waits out the separation until the rest of the family can make it to england terrible and beautiful little story just a few days in the life of harri","75":"this was not a light fluffy read but neither was it arduous or generally emotionally hard to read the book is written from the perspective of a boy from ghana who has recently moved to england the naive way he tells the story makes it a lot more readable if it were written through an adults eyes it would have been very depressing and hard to read being a child the main character often doesn't understand the situation fully which leaves the reader to work it out i think this gives the book another level of depth the only thing i found hard was the language the boy would use ghanian phrases hutious for example and it took me a chapter or 2 to work out what they meant","76":" this was the story of the adventures or more aptly the misadventures of harrison okupo a ghanan emigrate who finds himself navigating the seventh grade in a perceivably rough london neighborhood while he is still learning the cultural nuances of western life harri is a justifiable riot and he traverses the world with an innocence and a comedy that is both off putting and endearing from page one harri's world is intrigued by the murder of an upper school mate and as he stands watching the cops do their fingerprinting and dusting he contemplates playing in and touching the blood the first sign that this will be no ordinary read so what worked the characterization and the life breathed into harri's character was memorable if not genius harri alone will stay in the sphere of my literary thoughts longer than any faulkner or steinbeck character ever has though at times being in his head was uncomfortable and unreliable just the carefree nature in which he approached threat and tragedy makes him sing in ways few ever have or will this same energy was translated into the sibling rivalry between harri and his older sister lydia and reading them play the dozens was downright hilarious unfortunately almost every other character was just a name with no backstory and the cast of friends and bullies indecipherably blurred into forgettable realms but what i love most about this book and what i will include forevermore in my reel of catchphrases until my non reading friends will ascribe it as my own forgive me kelman you are about to be orally plagiarized is the taunt the comeback the retort of advise yourself i can just see it now someone is rising up against me waving their finger in my face and snapping their neck back and forth gesticulating on a point of contention like someone rabid and in midsentence i just cut all that out with a well timed \"advise yourself \" when my wife to be starts nagging about bills and about me getting out of my peter pan videogame and graphic t shirt wearing phase i can just imagine the look of triumph on me and the look of stilted revulsion on her as i hit her with a conversation halting advise yourself advise yourself advise yourself advise yourself it just doesn't get old so what didn't work just about everything else as much as i have praised harri and his voice there comes a point in time when even the best characterizations can be overwrought multiple times i had to stop reading to revisit the blurb on the novel's back to make sure i didn't miss that i was reading a book about a kid with a disability his comedy came at the expense of his intelligence and because i didn't know if this was author intention or simply a misalignment of him knowing what it means to be a seventh grader i couldn't help but feel that somehow kelman missed the mark and even more unsettling was the unreliability of harri as narrator he speaks to pigeons he thinks he can best anyone and everyone he places himself in danger he taunts bullies and he thinks he is a detective who will solve the murder of his schoolmate all these breaks with the norm make for compelling reading but more often than not i yearned for some clarity to be mixed with the comedy the story purports itself to surround the murder and the subsequent attempt by harri and his friend to solve it however their detective work operates as a mere afterthought and instead of the unusual murder mystery i imagined this became more of three months in the life of a displaced ghanan youth and while this is not such an undesirable premise it was not what i signed up for and hence the inevitable dissatisfaction worse still is how after 250 pages of jesting and joking when finally the conclusion of the mystery of said murder should be picking up pace the book ends with a whimper instead of a roar i do not believe in providing spoilers in a review so i won't describe why the ending was a whimper but i will say that the best part of a murder mystery is the reveal the sherlockian explanation of the how and the why and that was a component that was awkwardly missing here of course i understand that the murder was more fuel than engine as the real story was harri and watching him breathe and move but i can't ignore the fact that i wanted more sense of resolution overall this book was an experience i see the brilliance that has gained this book some notoriety but i can't help but feel that the sensible reader will not be so taken with this one i rank this one a 2 with firm apologies to harri because he was pretty boss but i can't forgive the slow plot which left me snoozing more often than reading the writing style that was driven by harri's hit or miss thoughts and the ending which had me close the book with frustrated disgust i wouldn't dissuade anyone from giving this one a go but i would issue a caution to advise yourself pun intended though weakly construed that you might in short order be disenchanted","77":"sweet funny and clever","78":"the most likeable narrator in a long time asweh","79":" this is a tough book to rate as the writing was very good and the author did a very believable job for me of capturing the voice of the first person narrator harri a young boy who recently moved to a london housing project from his native ghana as a result of that however i was left wanting more from the story itself which loosely follows harri's investigation of the murder of another boy but is really more a collection of scenes from harri's life i think i could have used a more focused narrative that said i think the ending worked against the flow of the rest of the book and the specific decision that the author made did not feel natural despite sufficient foreshadowing so 3 stars i liked it","80":"awsome book 1 of the most coolest books ever","81":"really a good book interesting voice of the child","82":"dude from a childs perspective with some major adult topics very unique read","83":"i'm a little sad today because i just finished pigeon english the voice of the story harrison opuku is one of my new favorite protagonists his 7th grade voice is so perfectly captured he considers the big picture and relishes the details that make it up his naivete is both charming and overestimated by the reader and his friends and family the language is brilliant and if you are patient and enjoy it like a character you'll find more love for the book","84":"one of the best novels i have read with gentle humour and deft writing kelman creates a young black boy living on an estate with great surety and truthfulness the thoughts of the young boy his emerging sexuality and coming to terms with life and characters around him is terrific the first person pov is well handled and the details read so authentically everyone should read it not for the content which is interesting but the writing of it which is just so good brilliant sentences enviable","85":"this book was stunning funny and had a tremendous emotional connection you come to really love the main character and identify with his world","86":" i wasn't convinced by all the exchanges between the young people in pigeon english probably because i attended a north london comprehensive the others just grated on me particularly anything to do with miquita i didn't get the pigeon aspect either i only realised that the italic text was supposed to be the pigeon after reading these book reviews the aspect i did enjoy was harri's relationship with his family particularly his sister lydia and the subtle indications as to what happened to aunt sonia ghanaian slang like asweh and advise yourself stuck in the mind too unfortunately the book is very thin on plot and you end up skimming paragraphs to get to the end the ending briefly wakes you up again as it is quite well written but overall there are better novels on the gang or immigrant experience","87":"i have to be honest that this took me around 60 pages to get used to the writing style and some of the words i had to sound aloud to understand but then i got the hang of it it's true that the voice of harri does become infectious he's young naive normal boy who seems to have found himself in an area of england that has some gang activities he and his friend have just seen another friend stabbed laying on the street with a police investigation happening they decide that they are going to find out who killed him by practicing the techniques seen on csi an american tv show it's all a game something to pass the time and making friends the language used in the book is mostly slang the style of writing is very interesting and did take me some time to get used to at first i felt a little a d d not knowing what was going on and had a little trouble following the story sounding out the words and keep reading was the key to finally getting a grip on it and starting to enjoy it more i have to say i learned a lot of new words that asweah i will probably not use in my daily conversations my favorite parts of the story were his banter with his sister and sometimes his friends that made me laugh out loud i thought it was cute that he made friends with the pigeons and like any normal kid had a high curiosity of the things that were happening in his neighborhood there are good things that happen and bad things that happen but all the while harri takes things in stride like an 11 year old does sucks in all of the information he can gather processes it and spits it back out this book for me was highly reminiscent of pay it forward with an african twist pigeon english","88":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was read for a book group i didn't enjoy the story at all and when harri is killed at the end just said 'oh well i suppose that was coming to him' it is set in an inner city estate and gives no hope of ever being able to change anything about gang culture or these estates what future lies ahead for these youths and mankind","89":"wow a brutal beautiful funny tragic book up there with room and the book thief just do it","90":"interesting snapshot of immigrant life through the eyes and language of a young boy but not to my taste","91":"the fact that i read this last year and barely remember it now is telling","92":" there is so much about stephen kelman's pigeon english that i really really liked and so much that i really didn't harri the eleven year old narrator is a gem and his sweetly sociopathic preteen voice is spot on in retrospect most of the kid characters are well drawn from dean harri's faithful school sidekick to jordan his fre enemy from the council estate where harri and his family live but there's also the pigeon the talking one the talking one who sounds like god dude i can't abide","93":"i loved this book every step of the way told through the stream of consiousness style voice of an 11 year old ghanian immigrant to londn the book tells harri's story but also the story of council estates and 11 year olds it's funny if you're an anglophile it's like immersion through the whole book i was wanting to write down funny passages and thinking about how teenagers would also really like this book but then the ending i read this in e book form which is honestly the only reason i think i did not cry as i still find the electronic book less emotionally resonant because a few days later i saw this book in the bookstore and read the last pages and totally wept man does a person who likes the shittiness of the human condition love this book that person is me","94":"harri's life has changed when he moves to a violent and new neighborhood where a boy gets killed harri and his friend are determined to find the murder can harri handle the violence in his surroundings will they find out who killed the boy will he solve the mystery i starred to read this book because mr gould recommended a good book that i liked so i started to read the books he recommended i finshed this book because i wanted to know how they solved the mystery and who killed the boy","95":"re in it you will find it hard to put down its a very tragic story based on the real life of a little boy who arrives from ghana with his mum and sister to live in a london tower block although its tragic it is funny i love the language and the style it might not be to everyones taste it might shock you in places you will love the central character for ever it takes a while to get into but once you're in it you will find it hard to put down it's a very tragic story based on the real life of a little boy who arrives from ghana with his mum and sister to live in a london tower block although it's tragic it is funny i love the language and the style it might not be to everyone's taste it might shock you in places you will love the central character for ever","96":"this is the story of harri an eleven year old boy new to england growing up in an inner city council estate his story told very much in his language is full of wonder joy and many laugh out loud moments he is an honest and loveable character set against a horrific background of gang killings and urban crime this juxtaposition gives the book an unsettling yet deeply moving edge i really felt for this kid one for every politician to read","97":" i absolutely loved pigeon english i was heartbroken when i realized the last page was in fact the last page i wanted to spend all summer with harri i enjoyed deciphering his terms even though i am not as familiar with his words as others may be i didn't find it difficult to read i think kelman did a wonderful job capturing the voice of a little boy for example harri doesn't give backstory to explain that lydia finally got the phone he just launches in to her taking pictures on it and the reader eventually figures out what happened between the end of the last chapter and the action he's describing now this is just how my little sister talks to me she just assumes that i know everything that has happened to her since the last time we talked although harri doesn't understand everything he observes the adult reader is able to piece together his innocent descriptions to better understand his history and situation and even though harri is a boy in modern london and i was a girl growing in 1990's alabama all of our games and rhymes and attitudes toward school or grownups or bullies are all the same so the novel had a wonderful nostalgic aspect to it and then there's the pigeon i realize the play on words with pidgin and the actual bird that harri befriends but while kelman aptly captures harri's voice i think he falls flat with the pigeon's italicized narration i like harri's dialogue and interaction with the bird within chapters but not the bird's narration at the beginning and end of the chapters","98":"so cleverly written in such a distinctive voice this deserves to win the booker prize","99":"this book was really good my only gripe is that it took awhile for me to get into it it was hard to catch a rhythm in the beginning it picked up a little less than midway and continued to do so until the brilliant ending bravo mr kelman","100":"i read this for august's bookplate read and i'm not sure whether it was what i was expecting or not i felt like a lot of the characters were very stereotyped and though that may have been the intention i'm not sure i really felt like i had anything to relate to hmm i'm going to come back to this review once i've had a bit more of a think","101":"will do a full review at the end of the month for www loveabook co uk book group started reading this before all the riots started it resonated so much with how disaffected certain sectors of our young people are made for very difficult reading at times but i think that gives credit to how well it was written to be honest i feel a little broken hearted after reading this","102":"definitely one you want to read in a single sitting rather than drawn out","103":" books narrated from a child's point of view can be really good or really not i think this one was good but not great told from the perspective of an 11 year old i think boy recently emigrated from ghana to london it's an easy read and i quickly liked this boy once you get used to his slang and his overall speech patterns it flows well aside from the talking pigeon parts his perspective on his life lived basically in low income urban london filled with gang violence gives a funny viewpoint on things that you know as an adult reading are actually tragic but because it is written in this child's voice there's some kind of separation or distance somehow maybe because his view is so innocent that there's no deeper analysis into what is going on i'm not sure i guess i just felt there was something missing and seriously what is the deal with the talking pigeon those parts just seemed out of place to me however it did seem very timely to be reading this book while all the riots were going on in london there is a lot here about youth culture in low income areas of uk cities","104":"really disappointed with this book the back cover sounded great but it didn't live up to any of my expectations dull and slow the pigeon was the most interesting character","105":"not much to say about it the storyline itself isn't bad and i like the fact that it touches current issues but the style could have been more exciting","106":"advise yourself you're in for a shock such a sweet boy harrison so adorable and innocent loved reading his thoughts and ideas about the world the author did great","107":"apparently this is going to become a classic to be read in every school as a textbook my answer is just too cynical","108":" i might have gone for a better rating if the ending hadn't been so very sad the pigeon of the title refers to the city pigeons that the main character harry admires and chooses as a pet from afar it might also allude to pid'gin english since harry has immigrated to london and is finding it a challenge to find his place as a good boy in a gang ridden neighborhood his english is an interesting mix of his native language and that of thelondon streets i read some skipped to the ending but then had to backtrack some to get it all","109":"it took me a couple of re reads at the beginning to place all of his friends at times i think he acts much younger than an eleven year old judging from my discussions with my nieces i enjoyed the book though i had forgotten what a tough and dangerous time adolescence is with all of the popularity contests the rivalry clicks gangs and constantly trying to prove yourself this book will stick with me for awhile","110":"kelman has a real feel for the voices of this characters especially his main one harrison the boy's innocence and optimism make him so appealing his perspectives are sweet and funny and the lens through which he views his world makes terrible events seem mundane which in a way makes them even more horrifying to the reader as a mother i found this book heartbreaking i can't imagine children dealing with such fear and violence on a daily basis and yet i know there are plenty who really do","111":"some lovely characterisation but i was disappointed with the ending","112":"became redundant and a little boring at times though the author painted a clear picture of ghetto life and the optimistic oblivion of youth harri is a terribly endearing character though and while the ending wasn't really a shock and would've bored me officially without it it was still somehow disappointing and so saddened me that i wanted to rescue harri myself and keep him with me","113":"i think that it was brickwall the great my favorite 'great ' who continually said i'm a willing victim of circumstance brickwall then authored the following novel a renter's guide to modern asphalt concrete immediately after i purchased my copy of the novel i was handed a complimentary slingshot which was very much appreciated thanks target","114":" okay here's the thing i haven't met a first person slang stream of consciousness that i've liked yet of cloud atlas's five parts the one that did this was my very least favorite in an otherwise incredible book yes child narrator yes realistic look into life in london's ghettos yes child endangerment death yes bildungsroman yes immigrant life yes nonconventional writing style that is all book critic bait and the booker shortlisted this but i couldn't get into this book or its characters and that absolutely killed it for me oh yeah and there's a secondary narrator who is a pigeon i just why","115":"highly recommended a book that will make you smile from page one and will stay with you after the last page","116":" i borrowed this book from a friend at work and was interested to learn that it had been shortlisted for the man booker prize 2011 along with five others the sense of an ending by julian barnes the winning novel jamrach's menagerie by carol birch the sisters brothers by patrick de witt half blood blues by esi edugyn and snowdrops by a d miller a shortlisting for this highly prestigious prize is in itself a massive achievement and i therefore had high expectations of this novel harrison the main character a young boy who has recently moved to england from ghana is utterly adorable and has a unique perspective on things i enjoy reading books written from a child's perspective if the author is able to capture the wonder that children have about the world and how they see things it makes for a very interesting read have you heard of youtube it's a place on the internet just for films of things eating each other dean showed me a snake eating a boy when people speak a language that isn't their mother tongue they quite often say things differently to native speakers kelman has thought up some interesting ways to define harrison's use of language i got a remote control car even if it wasn't my birthday asweh it was dope fine me 'stop snapping me you're making me crash 'lydia 'stop crashing you're making me snap you ' harrison is in an unfamiliar place a place far more dangerous than he is used to and he is too young to understand what is going on around him this lands him in trouble his sister is friends with girls who have links to an extremely nasty crowd his aunt is living with a man who deals with violence every day when harrison along with his best friend dean start looking for clues to find the killer of their friend they bite off way more than they can chew i followed the word with my fingers to feel for a clue it was only pretend i knew already who did it and who it was meant for jordan's always writing warnings with his war knife it shows the enemy he means business and freaks them out this is a very powerful novel about youth displacement and trying to survive in an ever changing world full of people you love but also full of people you can't trust highly recommended","117":"a book about harrison okupu an 11 year old boy who is trying to figure out his live in south london the style of writing is very descriptive and he manages to depict the actual way an 11 year old emigrant would speak and act an elaborate and good book","118":"loved it awesome authentic and well told story very sad ending though would have worked as well without the pigeon","119":"after one day i finished reading the novel i just realised what asweh means i swear","120":" told from the perspective of harri an eleven year old who recently moved from ghana to an inner city council estate this novel perfectly depicts the horrifying reality of gangs and knife crime in london when a boy is murdered outside a fast food restaurant harri and his csi obsessed friend dean take it upon themselves to investigate the crime themselves however in an estate which is run by the dell farm crew and where the police can't be trusted harri's innocent investigations lead him into dangerous territory with devastating consequences this book fascinated me not just because of the realistic portrayal of gangs but also because of harri's descriptions of his day to day life and how radically different his life in the uk is in comparison to his old life in ghana kelman did a stellar job setting up the differences between harri's culture especially when describing his mother's beliefs that he picked up and his father's situation back in ghana and the culture he is plunged into while in london where most of his friends are also from different countries and are going through similar things as harri london is now a complete cultural melting pot and kelman perfectly depicted this with humourous and sometimes shocking consequences it is harri's wide eyed innocence that makes this book so endearing and a riveting fascinating read harri is definitley one of the best and most authentic narrators i have read for a while he is intelligent loveable always funny and has a great way of observing his surroundings that create even if his language is simplistic and sometimes misused a perfect picture in your mind i have read a few reviews that have said people were initially put off by the fact that book was narrated by an eleven year old but trust me harri will win you over there are some real laugh out loud moments especially when he is talking to his friends at school and his sister lydia considering every time i turn the news on there is a new report of a gang killing not just in london 'pigeon english' was a frighteningly real portrayal of urban crime and the innocent people who get caught in the crossfire","121":"shortlisted in 2011 for the man booker award this coming of age story is about harrison harri opoku an eleven year old boy who moves from ghana to a london housing project a young boy who was very skilled at basketball is killed in the neighborhood so harri and his friends decide to play csi detectives and solve the murder their naivete unwittingly solves the crime but leads to deeper trouble the story captures youth unblemished views of life teen romance and hormones and gang violence","122":"not an entirely enjoyable read language style was a bit annoying and it did not flow well throughout the middle of the book was a little slow however it is a novel and topical story which gives a little insight into the minds of some of the marginalised in our society it's an important book and a good debut","123":"harrison opoku is in level 7 at school in london england he is a recent emigrant from ghana and is learning about life in one of the housing projects he and his friend decide to play detective to discover the murderer of a a schoolmate in order to get the reward the story is full of his observations memories of home tips about life and so on the book jacket described it as being in the same category as room and the curious incident of the dog in the night time perhaps it is the same genre of the naive narrator but this narrator was not so naive perhaps all the crusty language put me off but i enjoyed the above mentioned novels and had to push myself to finish this one","124":"the book came with praise from emma donoghue on the cover and like her book room this story is told through the eyes and in the language of a kid pigeon english also has the same cringe effect when the reader understand the awful reality that escapes a kid like harri","125":"i really liked this book told through the eyes of a young boy his innocence and ignorance to the real danger around him is striking tells the story of rough neighbourhoods and immigrants in the first person also has a touch of fantasy spirituality that i'm normally not a big fan of but it is done in such a different and gentle way that it touches even me","126":"an amazing and sadly true to life story with a heart wrenching ending","127":"horrible i couldn't finish it just the same dialog over and over","128":"really enjoyed this a fresh authentic voice but one that that never substitutes substance for style in many ways a desperately sad story but with heart warming moments of hope bravery and decency there have certainly been worse booker prize winners","129":"i've come to the conclusion that i don't enjoy novels told in the voice of a child","130":"when you start reading this book you become immediately frustrated by the child narrative two things in particular make it a difficult read the use of 'pigeon english' childish slang interspersed with the occasional ghanaian term leaves you reaching for the internet every other page my first edition didn't have a glossary then there's the skittish nature of it all short chapters that suddenly switch subject or location with no more warning than a carriage return in fact it's so annoying that you loose count of the number of page turns you've committed and get through forty pages almost immediately kelman challenges you to accept the difficult narrative because in the end this book is all the more rewarding for it and if the book itself isn't rewarding enough for your troubles then the poetic ramblings of the book's other narrator provide plenty syntactic and comic relief harrison opoku's life experiences may provide only vicarious interest for most readers but this is just the wrapping on a character who deep down has an innocent childish intrigue that most should relate to","131":"told from the perspective of harri a child who has moved from ghana to the uk i found this book touching hilarious in places due to some of the literal language translations and innocence of harri and incredibly sad you can almost see how the story unfolds as harri learns what it is to be an immigrant placed in a hard estate somewhere in london well worth a read","132":" the build up was anticipated and the ending anti climatic i understand that this book is supposed to be a revealing look at the struggles facing the youth of london's impoverished and crime ridden council estates however this book offers no insight into the trappings and misses the bigger stories that float in and out of the main plot namely why the protagonists family left ghana in the first place what is the involvement of the gangster julius understandably these more juicy tidbits are left out because the novel is driven narratively by an 11 year old boy for whom these factors are not relevant for him to dwell on a better story would have been told from the sister's pov to truly explore the trappings and hellish conditions an older voice must be heard a childish perspective reduced the severity of the situation for me the sense of detachment these children had from the real meaning of life and death while still chilling only enhanced my apathy towards and dangers that any of them faced whereas the sister lydia knowingly felt the true conflict of morals vs acceptance simple harri floats along and foolishly respects and shares the viewpoints of his older tormentors","133":" sometimes all you need to pull you into a book to take you to places that maybe you wouldn't usually choose to go is a voice a voice that makes you believe and care pigeon english stephen kelman's debut novel speaks with one of those voices it belongs to eleven year old harri he his mother and his elder sister have come to london leaving his father grandmother and another sister behind in ghana until they can find the means to join them harri's new life begins high in a tower block in the middle of a deprived council estate he's at that at that age when he can see hear and feel so much in the world but he doesn't have the knowledge or the maturity or the experience to fully understand and of course he doesn't know that many stories have been told from this point in life but harri's story is distinctive and his voice is clear and engaging as he moves through his new world the opening chapters were rich with thoughts abservations ideas harri races through his new world in charity shop trainers that he has painted trying to imitate a much more desirable pair and his thoughts race too from subject to subject from the mystery of girls to the delights of the shopping centre to the rules of survival at school to the wonders of chelsea fc there are so many wonderfully observed details illuminated beautifully by a selection of lists and diagrams there were a few wrong notes a few details felt gratuitous an encounter with a girl felt wrong but the worst thing was the pigeon that harry watched and fed who became his guardian angel a touch of magical realism that didn't belong in this story set in a terribly real world a world where violence drugs and poverty as seen as the norm a world where kids played suicide bombers in the playground where the police are seen as the enemy where violent gangs seemed so glamorous it wasn't a world i really wanted to visit but i cared and so i had to follow harri and the trouble was that while harri was basically a good kid he was just that a kid a kid nobody to look out for him nobody to steer him in the right direction his father was back in ghana his mother was working all the hours she can to support the family and understood little of the people her son was mixing with harri made mistakes misjudgements and it was painful to watch but i couldn't look away and maybe his worst mistake was setting out to investigate the death of a boy a boy he had liked who was stabbed and bleed to death in the street i'm afraid that as the story advanced it became more confused and it became difficult to pick out the important things from the more mundane it may not of helped that i was turning the pages so quickly i had to i cared and i wanted to find out what happened but i feared the worst and so i really didn't care to linger i was relieved when it was all over my final report has to be mixed there were flaws in the plotting and in the balancing of the elements and a few details were just plain wrong but harri's voice rang true his story was horribly believable and that could just make pigeon english a book that stands the test of time to speak for the darker side of life in england's cities in the early years of the 21st century","134":"didn't finish couldn't get into the lingo was a popular choice in our book club","135":"this is quite an upsetting book but it's written really well i love harri he's hilarious it's got very strong messages in it and gives you lots of incite into an immigrant's life on a rough estate","136":"the phonetically written dialect in this book i found a bit of a struggle but i eventually managed to get my head and ear around it this was an interesting and thought provoking narrative showing a different side to a shocking story which has been in the british consciousness for many years a clever approach","137":"a ghanian boy moves to the u k he's just a kid but he wants to solve a murder and piss in bleached toilets it's perfect","138":"fantastic book read it","139":"i found the storyline rather weak and slow and to be honest i was looking forward just to finishing the book so i could start something else however the last 20% or so of the book suddenly picked up and i found myself really interested in what was happening overall a disappointing book but a very moving ending","140":"3 5 stars imho better a short story than a novel","141":"this was great partly funny partly sad totally engrossing the narrator is an 11 year old boy from ghana living in the projects in london who believes he can solve a local murder while since his friend has seen csi while arguing with his sister and trying to be the fastest boy in class so you can see it's a unique perspective and he is so engaging you will love him this book really stayed with me a long time after i closed it and the last pages are still in my head","142":" i picked this book up recently in amazon's spring sale interested a the story of two worlds coming together pigeon english is narrated by harrison opoku an eleven year old who has recently moved from ghana to a high rise flat in inner city london when a boy is stabbed near his home harri teams up with csi fan and friend dean to try and solve the murder he's also busy trying to fit in and learn the street smarts necessary to survive while showing a more innocent side caring for a pigeon that appears on his family's balcony harri is fond of showing that he's learning the rules creating lists to demonstrate he knows what's what and desperately wants to be part of the in crowd turning his cheap trainers into adidas lookalikes with a marker pen and talking the talk the vocab he uses is spot on reading the book was like listening to my teen step daughter however while he is fully aware of the gang activity going on around him and the dangers it presents he is still quite naive and too willing to believe everything he is told this really is a book of contrasts while he has is being pulled into a very grown up world he is still a child a couple of phrases that appear repeatedly are that something was the funniest thing he ever saw or that he'd bet a million pounds on x or y it comes across as typical childish exaggeration while he is doing tasks to be accepted into the dell farm crew the local gang he is also concerned for the pigeon he adopts and joins in superstitions like avoiding the cracks on the pavement to make sure something good happens harri's family has been split with his mother bringing him and his older sister lydia to the uk while his father and grandmother remain in ghana with his baby sister harri dotes on his baby sister and is looking forward to them all being reunited while his mother apparently brought her family over on a legitimate visa auntie sonia lives in whatever country takes her fancy coming and going with no apparent regard for the legalities required her boyfriend is a thug but while harri seems aware of what use he puts his baseball bat to it doesn't look to bother him unfortunately while harri has plenty of hope he doesn't have enough fear and his forays into the bad wide world are threatening the safe home his mother has tried to establish for the family hearing some stories about life back in ghana serves to further highlight the differences in the places and the communities i found harri a very sweet character a good kid who has been dropped into a threatening environment but still trying mostly to do the right thing i was rooting for him and lydia who has found herself a poor example of a best friend to get a happy ending the parts narrated by the pigeon made for an interesting diversion and its pieces were both funny sweet and thoughtful although in some places i did have to work to see how it fitted into the plot it makes for a good picture of how life might be for a recent immigrant in a big and initially completely alien city i had to have a good think about whether to award this 3 or 4 stars but on reflection while it was a decent read i didn't feel it was quite a 4 book maybe because a naive 11 year old's grasp of the world he's living in wasn't clear enough to enforce the messages in the book as well an older narrator might have and because as much as i liked the pigeon i wasn't sure what its narrative added","143":"interesting writing style and a compelling story but an unsatisfying conclusion","144":"i started off enjoying this book the way it was narrated with the voice of an 11 year old boy who had recently come to england from ghana was clever however during the second half of the book i found that same style start to grate a bit i liked the characters and found the innocence of the boy very moving as he wasn't aware of the situation he was getting involved in or the danger he was in i would have rated this a 4 star book apart from the fact i did find the writing style not the story tedious towards the end although saying that i'm not sure how the author could have solved that problem for me also i'm not quite sure about the pigeon's input","145":"amusing and depressing in equal measures","146":"sweet book asweh an easy read that rather felt like a long short story instead of a novel and a conclusion i didn't see coming","147":"a fantastic book which made me both laugh and cry the main character is wonderfully written and i loved the use of dialect to place the reader into his world and see it from his point of view","148":"best book i read last year wonderful story great characters loved every minute and was a bit sad when i finished it","149":"read as part of waterstone's book reading group","150":"i'm quitting at the 40 page mark i just can't get into this one nothing about the novel is working for me shortlisted for the 2011 man booker for reals","151":"this book has bo styles and it almost one of the funniest things i've ever seen harri is super awesome and is a superhero even if he hasn't acquire any superpowers the book took donkey hours to get into cause of the hutious language but it was totally worth it the ending was mad crazy and totally awful i love harri he is such a wonderful character and i enjoyed the stream of consciousness with a little bit of plot thrown in for interest probably the book from this years booker short list i'm going to remember most","152":"spoilers aheadincredibly torn by the experience of reading this book the dialog and character of harri were very well done the plot sort of just slowly got unveiled in a slightly dissatisfying way the pigeon element was weird and frustrating in this kind of contemporary fiction the ending was extremely unsatisfying it is 2 stars for most of the book but 4 stars for the dialog and main character hence a 3 star rating overall","153":"really really loved this book","154":"harri's point of view struck a chord with me pigeon english is a striking explanation of how living in poverty puts every child at a disadvantage regardless of the choices he makes written in harri's pidgin english a mixture of his upbringing in ghana and his transplant to england this book follows a boy through his day to day life from his first kiss to how the murder of a teen in his neighborhood affects him","155":"3 5 really mainly because it is good but too edgy to quite 'enjoy' certainly not a relaxing read though touching and emotional","156":"didn't grab my attention immediately which is what i would expect for a short read but once it did i began to enjoy it shame it was predictable and even more of a shame how real the story is","157":"i found the main plot harrison and dean trying to find the murderer a bit of a drag and relatively repetitive other subplots his baby sister in ghana his sister's struggles his aunt's issues much more interesting and i would rather have heard more about those aspects of the plot to be honest i think i would have liked the book more if it had been lydia's story i did like the abrupt ending","158":" harrison opoku harri for short is in year 7 at school just coming up to his twelfth birthday his sister lydia is a couple of years older their mother works in a hospital as a midwife their father and baby sister have stayed in ghana for the time being but it is hoped that they will soon follow the story is told as a first person narrative spoken by harri as if to a pigeon that occasionally visits the balcony of their ninth floor london flat this device means that confidences can be shared embarrassing things admitted and harri's innocence underlined when he thinks it necessary to explain slang and other terms that he has picked up but actually gets wrong understating their sleaziness or not appreciating the criminality implied we experience with harri the whole of the summer term at school there are other recent immigrants in the school of widely ranging national origins and the social problems he and lydia encounter seem not to be any greater than those of any child introduced part way through a school year indeed both quickly make friends however for all the children and for the adults of the neighborhood too the atmosphere is poisoned by petty theft vandalism and a recent fatal stabbing we delight in harri's early impressions of london of the flight to england and in his recollections of ghana we are less happy for him when we realize the awfulness of the tower flats of the neighborhood in which he lives that his aunt self harms and lives with a thug who beats her up and that lydia's best friend allows her boyfriend to burn her harri is deeply impressed by the stabbing which took place in the local shopping centre shortly after his arrival in london he believes he saw the boy's blood he attended the funeral and the police visit his school to appeal for information the crime remains unsolved though if anyone knows who the killer is they are not saying harri and a friend set themselves up as the most amateurish detectives that ever were whether they are ever really on to something we cannot be sure but they do manage to annoy some of the big boys and find a discarded wallet empty but for a picture of the dead boy the end of the story comes as a surprise both because we anticipate it will take at least one more chapter to draw the various threads together and because the concluding event itself is totally unexpected","159":"i think the most attractive feature of this book how simple plain down to earth this book is nothing is made prettier or uglier than it is it just is","160":"narrated by an 11 year old boy from ghana living in london a classmate is killed and he tries to solve the murder fairly well written if somewhat disturbing story about adjusting to england and school and negotiating the cliques and gangs there","161":" this book is written in the voice of an 11 year old boy who you can't help but love he is a very poor african immigrant living in a crime ridden section of london trying to navigate the dangers of his environment while maintaining a child's innocence a super fun read if only for the wonderful expressions the boy uses when something takes a long time it takes donkey hours and when something looks cool stylish it is bo styles the only problem i had were these few short extremely bizarre sections where we are supposedly hearing the voice of a pigeon that lives outside the boy's window they seem to be thrown in at random add nothing to the story and are fairly ridiculous not sure why the editor didn't tell the author to lose the pigeon but the rest was such a fun read that i was willing to overlook the pigeon dialogue","162":"i really enjoyed this original authentic novel i loved the unique tone and perspective was captivated by the characters and enthralled by the plot there is such a strong sense of reality in this book meaning that it impossible for readers not to be moved by what is going on i will definitely be re reading this as i know that there are so many levels and nuances left to be discovered an impressive novel","163":"an interesting narration which i struggled with but also enjoyed the ending shocked me but only because despite expecting it i didn't want it to happen i probably wouldn't recommend it but can definitely see the story being told happening up and down our inner cities its shocking and scary emotional and enthralling all wrapped up in 263 pages","164":"asweh i spent hell of donkey hours reading this got ants in my pant getting through the pigeon parts hutious made me go red eyes proper wore out my bo stylez trainers diadoras walking back and forth laughing full stop and getting all stomachy over the mad crazy adventures of harri and his sister chlamydia for real advise yourself totally fine good book better than x men innit but for realz for real a very impressive first novel by stephen kelman pigeon english's obvious to me point of comparison would be mark haddon's the curious incident of the dog in the night time but only on the surface for what it's worth i think this is a little better than curious incident which i liked just fine for our narrator is the eleven year old year seven student and recent ghana emigre harri opoku a good natured kid who just wants to fit in with his friends in one of the impoverished slums of london he keeps busy playing crazy made up games with his chums like suicide bomber zombie and one that involves throwing rocks at buses for hella points barely staying out of trouble and kinda half way dreaming of being able to front with the local bad ass gang from the get go though harri and his friends nearly witness one of their classmates get chooked stabbed to death outside of chicken joe's restaurant their mission when not messing around playing suicide bomber zombie or bugging the crap out of their sisters is to solve the murder mystery and get reward money harri's voice totally annoying and nearly undecipherable at first sticks to a cadence that ultimately becomes infectious and totally believable despite its pidgin y qualities as the novel exposes its gritty street life realities it helps to realize as mr kelman reveals in the end acknowledgements that the story is based on a real life kid growing up in the projects i really enjoyed this book despite the gritty backdrop the gutter england english and the intense subject matter there were many genuinely funny lines and it nearly always rang true i share though the prevailing opinion of many of my fellow goodreads critics that mr kelman makes a big misstep by interspersing the thoughts of a pigeon along with harri's narrative trying too hard to give extra dual meaninged significance to the title and draw allusion maybe to jonathan livingston seagull lose the pigeon not pidgin speak and this book is terrific bo stylez even","165":" this book kept reminding me of paddy clarke ha ha ha by roddy doyle in the breathless way it is told with the child narrator jumping between topics quickly and showing equal fascination for big disturbing and small everyday things however i found pigeon english far less annoying to read than paddy clarke a book i haven't managed to finish after having it lying around for over a year half read what i liked is that it shows in a credible way the narrator kept reminding me of an 11 year old boy i used to babysit and how he saw the world how easily things are accepted as normal for children when you come to a new country and there knives and gang culture and violence are a part of everyday life then you will adapt not because you're inherently evil or morally inferior but because you will try to fit in and get through unharmed","166":"loved the voice of the first person narrator harri loved everything except the ending would have a hard time recommending this to someone and then having them be angry at me for the ending finished it right before going to bed and was too upset to sleep will have to wait awhile so i have time to think some more about the book but the writing was lovely i will read his next book although with some trepidation","167":"a beautifully written book that captures the dichotomy of an innocent child who is caught by a world he is both drawn to and confused by highly recommended","168":"harri the narrator is an 11 year old boy recently immigrated from ghana to the projects of london the world he shares with us is filled with the exuberance of a happy kid who still sees the beauty in things yet darkened by the realities of poverty and crime humorous heartbreaking compelling blurbs on the back of the book describe it as a blend of lord of the flies and curious incident of the dog in the night time and in this case that description is pretty close","169":"i have to say i don't really understand why this was booker longlisted maybe i need to read more from the prize to understand it was essentially another version of marc haddon's 'the incident with the dog in the night time' which is no bad thing child's perspective drawings throughout etc but i'm not entirely sure the author nailed a convincing narrative for the central character there were moments of real humour and pathos in here but i found it struggle to engage with","170":" child's eye view of london life after ghanathis is a wonderful read offering harri's 11 year old perspective on the world he's moved into the strongest feature here is the voice harri's version of multi ethnic youth dialect combined with his natural innocence provides us with an endearing optimistic take on what is often grim reality there are many features of harri's narrative which flavour the story my favourites include 'hutious' 'asweh' and 'advise yourself' alongside more familiar features of kids' language like the prolific use of 'even' but i'm pretty sure that this is a great read even if you don't happen to teach english language harri is sweet and charming he knows that the gang on the estate could be a force for good if someone just explained to them about how to help others and some of the uglier facts in his life are clear to us but seemingly less so to him stephen kelman's use of the naive child narrator is executed with precision and charm providing an upbeat often funny and enjoyable read even as deeply unsavoury truths about life in the uk are explored harri's guardian pigeon is also a nice touch showing harri's natural sympathy for other creatures and providing an occasional broader view of events although this was a bit strange a first the brief pigeon's eye sections are illuminating in their own way the plot revolves around 'the dead boy' whose identity we never fully know he was stabbed 'chooked' shortly before the novel opens and the football boots on the cover are part of the community's display of grief for him harri and a friend decide to turn detective and investigate the murder after all harri's friend watches all the csi programmes so they're clearly experts their enthusiasm for this task is another sweet touch as well as an effective mechanism to have the boys run around the neighbourhood blissfully unaware of the chaos in their wake as well as harri the book is peopled with fabulous supporting characters harri's sister lydia other kids both bad and good but all seen as potentially good by harri and various adults just trying to survive overall i can see why this was nominated for the booker and why it's now being promoted to a ya audience i'd love to see lots of teens reading it as it raises so many questions i'll certainly be recommending it to many of my students","171":"a greta book about a boy from ghana who moves to london with his mum and sister and makes 'friends' with a pigeon a great book about gangs etc in london","172":"stephen kelman's pigeon english is about harry opoku an 11 year old boy living on a housing estate in london harri his mother and sister have emigrated from ghana leaving behind his father baby sister agnes and grandmother harri misses them and befriends an itinerant pigeon talking to him as he might write in a journal harri has more than a typical 11 year old's problems to write or talk about an older boy is murdered near harri's house and he caught a glimpse of the hooded murderer narrating his own story with \"it felt crazy\" or \"it was hutious\" and \"it's brutal \" harri in one breath talks about the murder outside chicken joe's and then moves on to describing where he lives poppy - the girl he likes how fast his tennis shoes make him run then flitting back to the murder he and his best friend dean start hunting for the killer using sellotape to get fingerprints and digging in the mud near the river for the murder weapon dean tells harri he saw how to investigate crime on law u0026amp order these boys though aren't playing 'cops and robbers' the estate is full of questionable characters - terry takeaway the alcoholic vagrant walking his pit bull asbo and x fire and killa both gang members gang activity is common and is a very real threat to any young man on the estate and these criminals are hell bent on staying out of jail harri in his innocence crosses them too many times what i didn't love and what i thought was a really odd choice in terms of the writing were the moments when the pigeon had a paragraph at the beginning of the chapter talking back to harri it brought the action of the novel to a halt and imposed an unnatural and to me unnecessary voice to the book in fact it felt similarly to little bee preachy and i don't like that what i loved harri enchanted me - 100% i loved his voice i loved his innocence and his gritty depiction of his reality and how he didn't always understand how the two collided in fact i'd say spelman has done an excellent job of writing in an 11 year old disadvantaged boy's voice without making a sentimental novel harri's observations were often hilarious - he likes to \"see the chief\" after his mom cleans the toilet with bleach so he can \"piss on a cloud \" isn't that so 11 year old boy ish yes there is harshness and death and fear in this story but it never overwhelmed the truth and fun in harri's telling","173":"really persevered with this book started 3 times and finally got to the end but it was a slog wasnt put off by subject just didnt like ut or anybody in it","174":"the style of the book was great and i loved the overall plotline -- but the ending was a disappointment","175":" \"pigeon english\" is written from the perspective of 11 year old harrison \"harri\" opoku who recently immigrated from ghana to london it is his voice that grabbed me from the very first page and drew me in it is a refreshing writing style that sounds very authentic for a young boy it gives me his hopes and fears his feelings and thoughts this can be quite humorous at times when his language includes funny made up words like \"hutious\" or when his understanding of the world does not quite match the knowledge an adult reader would bring to this it seems to be marketed to an adult audience but is also an easy language for young adults to read and the topic is certainly one they experience i like how the story is written chronicling the day to day experiences of young harri but also giving us flashbacks to his life with his family in ghana his yearning for his father and baby sister who are still waiting for their ticket to england is very moving it is not a complicated plot a simple but very moving story narrated through the eyes of a child it makes for very compelling reading sometimes very funny sometimes very sad for harri this is a cruel crazy and beautiful world","176":" pigeon english is a novel of powerful themes and exposes the hidden violent underbelly of urban poor and immigrant communities within a first world nation but the novel has some large flaws and has probably attracted more acclaim than it deserves pigeon english the first novel from author stephen kelman is narrated by harrison 'harri' opoku an eleven year old boy who has emigrated to south london from ghana with his mother and sister and who gives us an insight into his life it is a world of knife violence within school gangs housing estates populated by the poor immigrants and addicts of absent fathers and violent role models of early sexual experiences delivered with aggression rather than love lust or just curiosity even harri's aunt lives with a thug who supplies forged visas for illegal immigrants at exorbitant prices while she burns off her fingerprints to avoid identification these are some pretty powerful themes but are they delivered within a story that does them justice has regard for the themes elevated the esteem for this novel above other considerations http rants n raves com 2013 07 22 b what is the story here the novel begins with harri telling us of the senseless murder of a schoolmate who was stabbed in the street harri and his friend dean decide they are going to investigate the murder themselves role playing themselves as the buddy detectives of tv shows they've seen this is the closest the novel comes to telling a story generating an instant comparison to the curious incident of the dog in the night time it was my main reason to keep reading but it is a small aspect of the book much of this novel is filled not with plot or dialogue but instead with harri's childish observations assertions and beliefs from comments the author has made in interviews authenticity was something he was especially striving for in this novel and in the voice of his narrator harri he has drawn from his own experiences of growing up in estate housing and news coverage of youth violence and immigrant experience in particular he appears to be drawing from the famous case of damilola taylor a 10 year old nigerian immigrant who was killed by a couple of 12 year olds in 2000 to my mind it has failed to deliver the sought authenticity i do not find harri believable as an eleven year old this is something that annoyed me all the way through the book with the exception of harri's growing interest in girls and a sexuality on the verge of emerging much of his narration seems immature for his age for the most part harri comes across as a bit slow a bit simple for an eleven year old and sounds more like an eight year old the waffle also does not make for good storytelling especially for an adult reader it comes across like the superfluous material a good writer or a good editor would omit the author's concerns for authenticity have come at the expense of good storytelling there are some skilfully achieved elements of authenticity in the novel but it comes not from the waffle that is left in but rather from what has been omitted chief among these are the moral questions harri has not yet thought to ask himself harri has a sense of morality that we would expect from a child - in simple black and white terms referring to what he has been taught indoctrinated in rightly or wrongly and from good or bad sources but harri has not yet realised the contradiction between the violent illegal immoral activities of the gangs he is eager to join and his sense of moral right when the contradiction does present itself he reacts naturally emotionally and does not think to question nor does he notice the contradiction between his aspiration of being respected by the gangs and his detective role playing and is naive to the nature of julius the passport forger who lives with his aunt and wields a bat he calls 'the persuader' julius is his only male role model and if anything harri looks up to him these dilemmas that the reader notices but harri does not achieve the best sense of harri's stage in the development of his conscience the 'pigeon english' of the title refers to the vernacular of the estate occupants and also to the pigeon harri believes is watching over him like a guardian angel to the dismay of a reader who may want to give this novel a fair go the pigeon talks back although only the reader perceives this not harri it only adds to the flaws of the novel that we have to listen to the commentary of a pretentious flying rodent even fans of the novel would have to agree it was not a good idea and does not work the journey of the novel is itself a rags to riches story reportedly picked up from an agent's slush pile it subsequently became the subject of a bidding war between publishers and achieved as high an acclaim as being shortlisted for the 2011 booker prize and the guardian first book award but as it ascended it attracted more criticism is the voice of the novel really authentic or does it just seem that way to a middle class audience is it really ground breaking aren't there many writers including african immigrants who have also written more genuinely and with greater skill of the uk underclass struggles and immigrant communities but have not received nearly the same recognition 'recognition' is the key word 2011 was the infamous 'readability' year for the booker prize where the judges were accused of 'dumbing down' the prize and of selecting accessibility over excellence pigeon english in particular was singled out for not being worthy of a shortlisting especially over the fancied the stranger's child by alan hollinghurst stephen kelman admitted to feeling he has 'gatecrashed' the prize i am inclined to agree overall i found pigeon english to be a mediocre first novel there are some promising elements some skill on show but also some glaring flaws one cannot help but feel that its themes and its misplaced recognition have elevated the novel above an honest appreciation of the quality of the work","177":"i really didn't get the pigeon parts of this book they seemed really out of place i was expecting a detective story along the lines of 'the curious incident ' but that isn't what we got instead it was page after page of rambling yeah i understand that the narrator is an 11 year old boy but there still needs to be some short of flow to the book i didn't click with any of the characters so the ending probably didn't have the intended effect on me there were a few slang words that i have no idea what they mean i don't expect to be told what they mean but they should be used in a context that will let me work it out myself","178":"the voice of the protagonist comes through with so much character the ending is breathtakingly sad and the revelation of the real story reference is heart breakingly shocking","179":"interesting heart rending book that is possibly overshadowed by its style until the denouement","180":"love the exuberant voice of the young narrator this story is going to stay with me upsetting revealing the pigeon narratives didn't work for me at all but harri's voice certainly did","181":"loved this book easy to read from the child's perspective so it was funny and sad and sweet at the same time highly recommend","182":"what a great debut novel i'm more than happy to see this perched upon the list of 2011 man booker nominations that said i did get a bit weary of the child narration on some occasions but it was just the right length to make sure this didn't spoil the book overall a great story although inspired by tragic events well done mr kelman","183":"brilliant funny sad and exceptionally sweet it was so sweet in fact that in the beginning i didn't like it so much i mistook sweet for daft which in the end blew me away","184":"excellent loved the ending i was so happy the author ended it that way it seemed very fitting now i need to go read up on the kid this tragedy was based on reminded me of growing up in england and the similarities and differences to how i grew up in a rich surrey girls school compared to an innercity london state school full of drugs and crime i loved this book and read it in 2 days i hope more books from this author will be just as good","185":"i kind of feel like i should have liked this book more than i actually did the narrator is likeable and in many respects it's quite a sweet and humourous story but somehow it just didn't hold my attention quite enough you can see where it's going and it kind of plods inexorably towards the inevitable conclusion good but not great liked it but didn't love it","186":" i liked the boy narrative initially but that soon wore thin the book dabbles in many themes that are very high on the consciousness of inner city london kids today maybe too many i guess in taking the eyes of a child hard issues that such situations result in can be glossed over and conveyed in a child like way with humour being substituted for sadness and pity the writing in the style of the young boy narrating also was hard to follow at times maybe due to his quite gittery way of speaking the ending was quite a shame i wanted to be left with a sense of hope for the residents hopeless","187":"i just couldn't get into this one despite being trapped on a plane i let my library loan on it expire and i won't be checking it out again","188":"read this while visiting in england and could imagine the feelings of an immigrant boy in a big city i could hope this one wins the man booker prize for 2011 fiction","189":"fantastic funny charming and heartbreaking best novel i've read in a long time","190":"stephen kelman attempts to weave an enigmatic story that in the process failed to sustain interest in me","191":"great really different written from the prospective of a 11 year old very good","192":"harri's voice came through loud and clear and echoed the problems caused by living in a culture you don't fully understand whether this is due to inexperience youthful naivete or false assumptions abouth other people the book felt true to life and was inspired by the murder of damilola taylor it wouldn't be accurate to say it was an enjoyable read because of the subject matter but i was caught up in the narrative and despaired at the inveitable ending","193":" apparently kelman has been heavily lauded as the next great uk writer and this book is already on its way to being made into a film a lot of hype most of which i knew nothing about until after having read the book i should thank my local bookshop bryan prince bookseller for the recommendation so the standard response for a book or any work of art that is heavily hyped is a certain amount of skepticism besides which this is the second book written first person narrative from the perspective of a child that i have read in the last few months room being the other so i can't help but compare the two room comes up the winner in that comparison writing a novel from the perspective of a child is a tricky thing too much innocence and it quickly gets trite too much savvy and it is not quite believable kelman makes his character harrison opoku not only believable but also loveable harrison is a new immigrant from ghana arriving in a project housing area of london with his sister and mother his dad baby sister and grandmother are still back in ghana the world harrison inhabits is ugly and dangerous and it is painful to see him navigating it in all his 11year old innocence there are many things that harri experiences that he does not fully understand when a local boy is knifed on the street near his home harri and his friend dean with dean's detective skills garnered from watching episodes of csi decide to solve the murder and catch the bad guy they go about collecting dna samples fingerprint evidence and sussing out suspects based on behaviour the metaphor with the pigeon well that didn't really work for me too heavy handed which is not to say that as a metaphor it isn't thoughtful or even perhaps powerful but the shifts from pigeon narrative to harri narrative are very jarring","194":" for the narrator of pigeon english harrison is acting as an informal interpreter for the reader explaining all the various wars signs and words so that we can understand what he is saying to us but it also seems at times as is he is providing an explanation for himself as a boy from ghana he is having to work at living in england and understanding the ways of the people around him not always successful he provides enough information so that the reader knows enough of what is going on and we discover the murderer through harrison's eyes sometimes a little slow i find myself willing harrison to notice what's really going on a similar feeling i had when reading room where i just wanted jack to realise the truth of his situation but i think that is what makes child narrator's so special to novels that are dealing with violent topics they can see but to a degree not interpret what they are seeing which makes them amazingly resilient to the outside world particularly shown through jack who manages to adapt with surprising quickness as a result of his innocent view of the world with a few chapters left of pigeon english i am struggling to get along with harrison as much as i did with jack in donoghue's room but i think the effect is very similar the resilience of these fictional children at such a young age contrasts their innocence with the brutalities they are presented with i can see why pigeon english is on the waterstone's eleven and has already made such a splash definitely one to watch when it is released on the 7th march this year","195":" the rating system is really failing my on this one there were some great things about this book harri is a delightful 11 year old narrator and i loved him so it was really a bummer when the story abruptly turned tragic which was exactly the point and yet i wasn't completely convinced by how that particular turn came about so i have mixed feelings about that the point he's making however awkwardly is an important one though that violence is always senseless and never leaves you with a feeling of justice having been done so well done but then there's the second narrator a philosophizing pigeon are you kidding me why did nobody tell him that was a horrible idea it's too bad because this was almost an amazing book i wonder if it could have been better executed in someone else's hands","196":"a very funny book and sad at the same time read it on a plane just because i had nothing else to read and i don't regret it i think it's a bit overrated but it's not a waste of money","197":"this book broke my heart","198":" 9 28 2011 i loved harri opuku the 11 year old narrator of pigeon english his voice is adorable his naivete and open earnestness are endearing and his observations and insights are both hilarious and poignant and through harri's story i also came to know and love his family especially his baby sister agnes still back in ghana his girlfriend poppy and his often sketchy friends and neighbors but the story his story isn't strong enough to carry the novel not that the story isn't believable it unfortunately is i think it's that kelman is trying too hard to prove his case so the contrasts between good and evil ignorance and knowledge innocence and guilt are too sharp too dramatic they don't ring true the characters and the story and the pigeon don't forget the pigeon do battle they don't add up they end up as only vehicles in kelman's effort to express his righteous rage at the unfairness of harri's situation and of life in general so not booker worthy i'm sad to say but maybe worth reading at least for harri's priceless lines he is learning about the space station in science class he decides on the space station they have to s in a special tube that sucks it out into space that's why the shuttle has windscreen wipers everybody agrees","199":"loved most of this book vacillated on how i felt about the parts narrated by the pigeon i was surprised when i turned the page and saw the acknowledgements i didn't think that could really be the end overall a good read even though it took me donkey years to finish","200":"a haunting yet often funny novel that offers a unique glimpse into the frightening world of knife crime a first person narrative told from the viewpoint of a young immigrant boy from ghana that both makes you laugh and makes you cry i found it a slow start it took me a couple of chapters to fully engage with the mix of 'broken english' and cockney slang yet it was certainly worth bearing with the unusual style as this merely added to the beauty of the story i loved the main character and found the use of the ever present pigeon a fantastic touch suggesting very spiritual and warming connotations that i desperately needed by the end of the novel which i had to reread several times i thoroughly recommend this book","201":"i really enjoyed this as a light holiday read it is funny as its written from an 11 year olds prospective and tackles some adult issues funny with a serious message i would recommend reading this book","202":"harrison opoku has moved to london england with his mother and sister they live in an inner city housing estate through harrison's eyes this book explores the casual violence of the area violence that is so commonplace it is almost acceptable","203":"meh read the first 33 pages and it didn't suck me in goodbye","204":"wonderful book harri's narrative voice makes this tale of doom fresh and funny i loved it","205":" disappointing aside from sometimes humorous use of language--i was particularly fond of gowayou--this book offers little no doubt some will treat this book as making profound comments about contemporary class and violence or praise the very tired technique of having a bright eyed child as the narrator it's a little too on the nose either 'oh look at the precious child he thinks he's people' or 'look he's just like us ' i think where the story really falls apart in kelman's attempt at authenticity everything feels staged contrived and unreal the children and the adults both feel like cardboard cutouts the worst part of a poor book is the pretentious parts involving a talking omniscient pigeon really dire i wouldn't recommend this to anyone it isn't an enjoyable book edit found this comment on the guardian website i rather agree with it's influenced not primarily by the truth behind its story but by the perceptions and perspectives often false and misinformed of a tediously middle class audience the characters act in a way that makes them seem like parodies of themselves a sort of little britain 'yeah but no' farce","206":"do not waste your time on this book i found it a real struggle to finish","207":" this is the third of the booker shortlist for 2011 that i have read pigeon english is a quick read the narrative voice of an eleven year old boy from ghana is instantly engaging and carries the reader effortlessly into his world a world of council estate high rises gangs trainers and the aftermath of a senseless death there is a pigeon in the story who narrates a few passages this i didn't feel added anything to the story at all i'm not even sure what the reader is supposed to take from these passages i understand that the author has used the real life story of the death of damiloataylor as an inspiration for this story there have been plenty of successful novels that are told in a child's voice last year's booker shortlisted 'room' in my opinion one of the best i am not sure if this device isn't already becoming a bit tired i'm not sure why this should be so as every other plot device in fiction is used and used again however such works as 'the boy in the striped pyjamas' 'the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime' 'what was lost' and the aforementioned 'room' all of which are brilliant may have diluted slightly the power of the child narrator's voice the voice of harri in pigeon english is authentic urban and poignant his fate feels inevitable i did enjoy this novel but it lacked something for me the story which is told should be more of a punch to the solar plexus than i found it i am trying to figure out why i felt slightly disconnected from the characters and events i am looking forward to the booker announcement this year as i have read some of the shortlist and will be starting another one later","208":" it took a while for me to get into the groove of stephen kelman's man booker prize nominated pigeon english kelman turns vocabulary and syntax completely upside down in order to capture the mixed up world of young african immigrant harri opuku i put my alligator tooth down the rubbish pipe i heard it fall down to the bottom and disappear it was an offering for the volcano god it was a present for god himself if i gave him my best good luck then he'd save us from all the bad things the sickness and chooking and dead babies he'd bring us all back together again he'd have to or it wouldn't be fair it was a good swap nobody could say it wasn't harri is trapped in poverty and violence especially considering the dead body that opens the book but he is an innocent he finds beauty in the rubbish of his life once i caught the rhythm and lyricism in his broken language i was a goner \"if agnes dies i'll just swap places with her she can have my life i'll give it to her and i'll die instead i wouldn't mind because i've already lived for a long time agnes has only lived for one year and some i hope god lets me i don't mind going to heaven early if he wants me to swap places i will \"i love harri for his courage his uncomplicated bargains and his pure heart reading this book reminded me of how much i love novels told through a first person child's voice more of my opinion on that topic at http alenaslife wordpress com 2012","209":"snooze and a pigeon as some kind of angel headdesk","210":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really loved this book the way it ended especially harri died but it was written so beautifully that i wasn't even that sad it felt like it was just a goodbye i actually held a lot of sympathy for jermaine killa he was never really happy in the book at times i felt kelman made harri sound a bit too childish how he believed everything his friends told him but she was trying to capture his newness to england so that was ok","211":"i cannot understand why this novel was shortlisted for the booker prize i found it so tedious and am wondering what i have missed when i read the other reviews it was not popular with my reading group only one member enjoyed it","212":"pigeon english is a first novel that follows all the rules of contemporary first novels that mean to see publication 1 a strong first line and opening gambit you could see the blood and a boy is murdered 2 a strong distinctive narrative voice 3 a high concept element the pigeon the boy talks to seems to work for god 4 a plot twist almost at the very end of the book i won't spoil it for you and i enjoyed all this except the ending seemed like a cop out it was too easy of a way to end the story and for the last 30 pages or so it was exactly how i expected the story to end the story covers a lot of ground and was an enjoyable read nonetheless the narrative voice was interesting and even though it was highly repetitive it never became irritating and the plot that ties together the hundreds of thoughts and little episodes that make up this boy's daily life was an exciting murder mystery through which the reader experiences some tension building dramatic irony as we know what's going on but the main character naively misses it's a good book trying some interesting storytelling methods out with notable skill though while not really breaking current convention","213":"loving it so far brillantly written the language really brings you into the world of the characters and the fact that its told from a childs prospective is very interesting","214":" this is the story about harrison opoku who recently moved from ghana to the uk the story is told in the voice of young harri and what a voice it is he is quick talking quick running young man who often had me smiling and laughing at the banter between him and his friends alothough he is telling us the story a lot of what he sees is heartbreaking and touching but told through the experience and conversation of a young person and the conversations young people have among themselves children see things differently to adults i sometimes forget that but in this story it was really shown well it was very enjoyable reading this book i had never read anything quite like it before and the title was perfect discription of the type of english that harri used here great book","215":"a delightful narrative voice gives heart to a novel that charmed and horrified me in equal measure too close to home for me to 'enjoy' but a wonderful book nevertheless","216":"well written but i didn't really enjoy the story set in urban britain a tough environment to grow up in this made a hard story to swallow although probably reflects the truth for many in uk","217":"brutal funny tragic a believable depiction of violence in tower block britain i liked the voice of the child narrator and the dialogues he has with his sister and friends i found the 'pigeon' narrator jarred although it was an interesting technique the ending was sadly predictable shocking but expected i only gave it three stars because the book had its merits but i found it easy to put down and leave for a few days","218":"hated it","219":"very satisfyingly handled fictionalisation of a pre teenager's life in a tough part of town the great achievement of kelman is his cloaking of the dark and the dangerous in the unconquerable optimism of its narrator who becomes very easy to love and very easy to miss by the end","220":"story is good but narrative slang prevents it from being an easy read unexpected ending","221":"interesting storytelling but difficult to read because the author was trying to use language that an 11 year old boy from ghana would use","222":" i really really liked this book and that was despite the ending being pretty depressing to me i guess i sort of saw it coming but at the same time yeah no but i loved that it's a mystery framed by an 11 year old immigrant boy i loved his perspective on england and how different he found it and i loved how the author was very sensitive to how this boy was growing up making trying to make friends with the 'wrong' people unable to get in with the violent kids thus keeping himself safe from petty crime finding good people to be friends and just generally trying to navigate a strange world as an 11 year old","223":" a charming novel about a very sad subject pigeon english is written by 11 year old narrator harri a newly arrived immigrant to inner city london from ghana it is loosely based on the true events that occured when ten year old nigerian immigrant daminola taylor was stabbed and bled to death in a stairwell in 2000 harri serves as a fresh and innocent voice observing and at times takes part in the gang violence and school yard bullying happening around him whilst his mother appears mostly absent dealing with her own racial issues whilst working nights at a hospital the technique of using a child narrator free from society's prejudices although beginning to discover them has long been popularly employed by writers the obvious example is scout finch from 'to kill a mockingbird' hence other reviewers will be quick to compare such characters i read several of them regarding harri and pigeon english and i don't think this modern and at times cheesy novel compares with the classic so i won't go down that path i will note that sometimes i think for an author to tackle difficult issues to do some from a child can be if not the easy way out then certainly a method to make the book easy for audiences to read pigeon english was certainly heart warming and humourous harri was a delightful narrator and seeing the world through his eyes even when we had to interpret his mixture of ghanaian broken english slang was enjoyable sometimes this enforced the particularly sad subject matter illegal immigrants gang warfare suicide bombers domestic violence toward women etc as harri's descriptions were so innocent that when the adult audience read between the lines the brutality of harri's world really seemd to hit home two criticisms firstly the ending which i'll not spoil here seemed too convinient and left a bad taste in my mouth after enjoying the first 90% of the book so much and secondly what was with the pigeon made no sense and i thought this gobbledy gook aspect of the novel could've been cut after the first draft","224":" to be honest i found this book pretty hard to get into i think the terminology apart from making me feel ancient at the age of 27 may have been a slight barrier i also totally missed the fact that the soliloquies that turned up occasionally in a different font were the thoughts and interactions of a pigeon for a good chunk of the book but that was me being slow really and then the realisation that the pigeon is somehow equated to the boys guardian angel it just got a bit weird for me si think the blurb on the book comparing pigeon english to the curious incident of the dog in the night time is actually quite misleading though the story is told from the boy's and sometimes a pigeon's point of view i don't think there's really much similarity with the curious incident there was the obvious hook of the narrator's autism whereas in this book there's the vastly different aspect of racial issues mixed in with the difficulties of being a young teenager i didn't realise that the book's author wrote it in some way linking to the damilola taylor case until reading the blurb at the end of the story i guess if i'd been aware of that from the start i may have engaged better or even reacted differently i may have underestimated the story and the book and done it a dis service by reading it alongside other books which i found more engaging it was an ok read but it's certainly not a book that i will read again","225":"i really enjoyed reading this young man's innocent account of living in a bad situation it is similar to curious incident and in that respect as an american i also have to figure out the slang terms and brittishisms it does make it more interesting but may make it harder for inexperienced readers to understand a little the story does kind of go over the place which is similar to how kids think i like how the reader is not outright told things it has dark overtones and makes you feel a bit sad about people who have to live in these situations","226":"i think this book is annoying asweh i couldn't stand the weird slangs sometimes but then the story sort of pulled you in i started liking harri for his enthusiasm in life and i also wanted to know the killer might be the ending was a huge blow though","227":"a vivid picture of today's youth culture softly told through the eyes of a young immigrant","228":"i know it was shortlisted for the booker prize but i couldn't get into the book i've realised that these alternate or is it artsy fartsy books just aren't for me it's about a young ghanaian boy trying to survive in one of london's high rise council estates i was intrigued in the beginning the child's voice is charming but the disjointed skit like scenes didn't hold my attention and i didn't make it to the end","229":" this book was miserable set on a bad council estate in london it graphically portrays the most unpleasant bits of life there i suppose it draws attention to that for those who don't believe that they're so bad and i suppose it exposes how hard life can really be for some including immigrants just trying to get by so it serves some social functions however i've never had any trouble comprehending these issues so for me it was just depressing i did like the philosophical nature of the pigeon and was bemused at my bookclub's universal distates for the bird they argued that he belabored points that would have occurred naturally to the reader but i disagree and think that most people don't have the depth of thought necessary for that overall this book seems like a social statement rather than a novel meant for pleasure reading","230":"this book was wonderfully written and i loved the surprise i got when i realized the protagonist was from ghana he kept referencing words i learned on a recent trip there but then end very disappointing finish to such a great book","231":"the story is told through harrison opoku who is eleven and just arrived in a rough housing estate from ghana you just love this young lad and his thinking especially when he personalizes his trainers it is funny happy tragic and well thought out all the characters came alive for me a very good read and well written i loved this book but you can't read this story and not think about damilola taylor","232":"asweh it was hutious but only till a few pages towards the end i hated the end the story is told in the colloquial voice of a 11 year old boy who lives in a dangerous locality and is exposed to gang violence and prejudices he lives with his mother and elder sister after emigrating to london his father and younger sister left behind in ghana the book starts with a boy being murdered and our boy harrison along with his friend dean tries to solve the crime dean a fan of csi is a great help in mapping out the path to solve the crime but nothing comes easy they are exposed to lots of things eleven year olds should not be exposed to finally they sneak upon the murderer but with what results lots of words which i don't understand events which are slightly hazy and a pigeon who talks or is it the boy's imagination still i enjoyed reading the book","233":"maybe i've read too many booker shortlists this year but for me this was the least satisfying beautifully written and a great idea but not a patch on the other 4 i have read","234":"it takes a lot to pull off a child voice narrator and pigeon english just didn't pull it off for me the combination of almost shock fiction slang and child narration just didn't mesh i spent more time being annoyed by how the book was written than paying any attention to what was written","235":"there's something really refreshing in reading a book like this the narrator of this story is innocent and amazingly portrayed by the author sweet and cruel a great read","236":"very similar to curious incident adorable inner voice a narrator that's difficult not to love an ending that will rip your heart out","237":"well worth the read","238":"this is very good and i want many people to read it harri's voice is excellent my heart hurt when i finished this","239":"i had absolutely no expectations for this book and i think i just read it at the right moment and in the right format for me i don't typically like books with slangy pidgin pigeon english particularly with repetitive phrases but somehow i got hypnotized by words like hutious and bo styles and fell in love with this boy if i'd listened to this as an audio book i might've pecked out my eyes as an ebook i might have 'fast forwarded' through the sluggish moments but as a good ole fashioned hardback book it was perfect for me","240":"good read worth my time","241":"a decent book even though it took a while to get into an unusual style of writing but none the less wortht he read","242":"i did enjoy this book the voice of the 10 yr old narrator is really well done and its a realistic depiction of the life of people within urban sometimes deprived area the voice of the kid allows the author to describe some pretty grisly or upsetting events without overplaying the details very moved at the end","243":"hilarious and heartbreaking read out full review here http www geekchicbookclub co uk 201","244":" it was an ok book i like harrison's clarity of thoughts in his naive way however the narrative from the pigeon became a distraction halfway through the book and had me wondering why bother having a pigeon talk the pigeon's purpose might have been the role of a guardian but kelman could probably find a more realistic guardian for harrison like his mother i would've liked more information about the mother i think she has a story to tell i do prefer an adult storyteller this book is creative and well written a good effort from a new author","245":"i didn't get the purpose of the pigeon's perspective lose that and i like the book a whole lot more","246":"excellent has undertones of room by emma donoghue and is just as gripping a read very short but necessarily so great flight read","247":"interesting context","248":"i was a little put off by the format but i'm glad i stuck with it the ending is sad overall good storytelling","249":"this was a tender beautifully told story written in the voice of eleven year old harri recently arrived in london with his mum and sister from ghana his father grandmother and baby sister agnes stay behind until the family can afford to be reunited shortlisted for the booker prize this coming of age combined with murder mystery grabbed me by the heart with urban london slang 'pidgin' english it was a bo styles story harri was an utterly lovable character that i'll not soon forget","250":"i liked it but it dragged in places and the ending was rushed some good ideas in the book but a bit too street for me","251":"wasn't sure initially if i'd take to this a bit harder to ingest new slang and varying sentence structure if not hearing standard english all the time to begin with but came to quite enjoy harri and his observations on life i wasn't very familiar with the current events connected to the book http www guardian co uk books 2011 but not sure that this mattered terribly in the end","252":" this story reflected recent incidents in the uk which have been featured heavily in the press the interesting slant was they were told from the point of view of the young boy of the story it was quite heart breaking at times and there was a deep sense of foreboding throughout i just knew the ending would be tragic so in that respect there were no surprises but it was beautifully written and the boy harrison was portrayed in such a realistic moving way that you really wished for a different ending","253":"this book was really good but having read it i think its definately one of those books you have to read twice to really get it i would have rated it 4 stars if it wasn't for the ending which made it 5 stars","254":"i just finished pigeon english this was the third booker prize short listed 2011 book that i have read i must say that it didn't seem to have any impact on me at all i scan read the final chapters perhaps it was due to my allergy to books which have young working class boys as their main narrator character i had to read kes and billy liar for my school exams and hated them this has led me to have an allergy to these kind of books will this win the booker my money if i were a betting type would still be on julian barnes but this stands a chance it's what they like it might remind them as it does the blurb writer of the curious incident of the dog in the night time it may also remind them of kes billy liar and other books in the long tradition books about working class boys including oliver twist etc have you read this book what did you think","255":" a dog called asbo the dell farm crew all seeing cctv cameras and one legged pigeons moving to a new country is baffling at the best of times but if you're a naive 11 year old ghanaian who moves to one of the largest cities in the world has to learn to speak english and has to find his place in a community dealing with an explosion of knife crime life is particularly difficult despite this harrison the central character in this booker prize nominated novel find a special niche for himself he collects around himself a cast of goofball sneaker obsessed friends and in an heart rendingly charming way begins to investigate one of the recent stabbings in his neighbourhood his roll of sellotape and camouflage binoculars won at an amusement arcade help him through the various obstacles that drop into view a lot of the tension and humour in the novel is developed through the fact that harri is a fallible narrator he doesn't really understand a lot of the adult interactions occurring around him some of the misunderstandings are comic 'sucking off' means kissing on the lips hard some of them are menacing the payments to loan shark protection racketeer julius that always take place in the kitchen charming witty engaging harri as a character alone is enough to drive this novel the chilling south london gangland he finds himself in and the characters that sail through it are a rich bonus that rare breed of novel that gets the mix of humour and pathos just right","256":"i am 1 3 through the book this book is great innit u0026gt","257":"it was good and funny until the pigeon showed up still a very good read","258":" i still have not figured out how this novel was a booker prize nominee there were moments when i was reading it that i was uncomfortable for the author because it was easy to determine that this was something he was writing about and not actually his characters experiencing it although the book gives a glimpse into immigrant life in england it is done so clumsily annoyingly and with minimal suspension of disbelief there are a few brilliantly crafted moments of prose that serve as a few scraps the reader can bite into and sustain them until they cross the bridge of drivel to get to the next strong section","259":"ending which was not unexpected but hoped it would not","260":"this is one of those rare novels were the acclaim completely speaks for it a funny book a true book a shattering book","261":"i want to punch this book in the face okay fuller review some 24 hours or so after finishing it pigeon english was one of those infuriating books that was a fun read while it lasted but once it was over transpired to be well not dreadful but certainly not as good as it felt while in the moment it was a quick read and once i became accustomed to the multitude of slang terms frequently used by the 11 year old narrator easy to get through harri was a fun character easy to empathise with and care for for the most part it was a charming amusing read albeit one set against the backdrop of incredibly dark events i think kelman really pushed the gang violence corruption themes too far and in retrospect it feels as though it descended into something quite patronising and that bloody talking pigeon overall it wasn't wonderfully written and the ending left me incredibly annoyed and unsatisfied but the central character was so beguiling that i hold out hope of kelman maturing into a writer capable of greater nuance i'd give this 8 10 for the majority of book but a 2 for the ending and bitter after taste i think this one will really be marmite with readers","262":"i wanted to like this book more than i did while well written it just left me wanting","263":" i read this book for my book club book plate books to be honest i didn't come to it with high expectations having heard it reviewed on the review show bbc2 before the man booker prize 2011 sadly my expectations were met by and large some of the dialogue between the young people in the book was funny and enjoyable but i'm at a loss as to what i'm supposed to have got out of reading it it wasn't particularly exciting it was pretty obvious from early on what was going to happen to harrison at the end but equally didn't impart any great revelations in terms of society or gang culture which would have been the obviously trade off for lack of suspense some parts were downright ludicrous come on people you know what i'm talking about a pigeon no really what a pigeon give me strength how this was booker shortlisted i shall never know and to those saying well really it's ya no it's definitely not younger readers would get very bored with the lack of action even if the school mates scenes might have been familiar the only character who really thrilled scared me was miquita the east end estate equivalent of the gangsters' moll she had moments that were genuinely creepy and sinister for the most part though what was he thinking","264":"meh i read it as it's just been introduced to the gcse english literature specification for 2017 and initially i thought that i was going to really enjoy it to begin with i quite liked the style and the voice of the narrator and found myself not wanting to put it down sadly as i read more i began to enjoy it less and less as the plot developed i became more certain that the character of harri was pretty unconvincing there are times when his simplicity and naivety are ridiculous especially when contrasted with the senseless evil of the gang of older boys from the same estate unfortunately this pretty much undermined my enjoyment of the novel also the pigeon thing just really did not work for me it was an interesting idea at first but really did not add much to the plot or the narrative so it just felt a bit pointless and tagged on on the plus side as a teaching text it will probably work quite well i think teenagers will probably like the plot and some of the set pieces there's some obvious language features that would be easy to write about ironically some of the simplicity and clumsiness that stopped me from liking it will probably make it work really well especially with lower ability pupils","265":"for me this book was insightful it is just what a good book should be something which opens up a new world to the reader i loved the author's style which is suffused with the magic of childhood the authenticity of the language used by harri the protagonist as well as his relationships with his family and friends","266":" a bit coming off age angst with a dash of culture clash stir in some teen peer pressure add a pinch of racial discrimination and or immigrant struggles simmer with poverty issues and you get this it is filled with cultural difference talking about a boy from ghana recently moved to london and trying to fit in trying to find a place for himself and everything around him and maybe trying to place the surroundings a bit too hard i've been wanting to read this ever since it was first published which was right after i've finished the road home by rose tremain a couple months i never did get round to it until just recently and it is a gripping portrayal of a boy who's on the verge of becoming a teen and still holds the luxury of viewing the world in a childlike fashion as a person of chinese ethnicity having lived a couple years in the uk and just returned from a 3 week visit from manchester this book hit close to home to be honest i find the hostility towards foreign faces has gone worse in the uk over the past couple years that i was absent i'm guessing the general economical environment has something to do with that especially in a industrial city like manchester so reading about the subtle hostility the hints of hardship seen from a boy's eyes it hit home too hard too fast i think parts of the writing is a bit too deep for a youngster to utter but then it's a grown person simulating the thinking of a boy so it shall be forgiven it's a good thing to look at the world with young fresh eyes again","267":"i loved harri's love of life and positive attitude so sad the direction his life takes loved his voice throughout","268":" 3 5 liked it enjoyed the change in perspective and dictionwritten from the point of view of a ghanaian boy transplanted into poverty in london kelman adopts well the voice of such a boy who often directly addresses the reader directly filling is in on the lingo occasionally dirty i appreciated the most the perspectives on 'adult' topics such as aids gangs crime sex harri appears to have unexpectedly high curiosity and ability to understand many of these concepts perhaps unrealistically so particularly for his situation but still has a childlike perspective superstitions abound harri and his buddies are trying to solve a murder and have elaborate plans to play csi this was the primary plot but wasn't as central as it might seem for me it was mostly about seeing a tough tough childhood through the eyes of that child there was some symbolism and significance to his relationship with the pigeon but that escaped me","269":"whilst i thought this was really well written and deserved all the great plaudits it just wasn't really my cup of tea maybe an age thing as think teenagers would be gripped did paint a great picture of life in those circumstances and characters well developed would recommend","270":"i really didn't care for this one should have put it down but kept thinking it would get better it didn't","271":"don't know what to say this book is a bit slow in parts but i loved it until the last two pages which were very cruel to the reader i feel well written and it did a fantastic job of reminding me of those things that everyone did at school and how people acted expect i don't think my school had the violent underbelly it is also interesting reading it from the view of a recent immigrant his lack of knowledge of the country adds to how innocent he appears","272":" this book was one of six books to make the short list for last year's man booker prize so as with the man booker books i was expecting a challenging but not necessarily likeable read and i got likeable but not very challenging it is the story of harrison opoku an 11 year old ghanian boy and recent immigrant to london with his midwife mother and older sister one can only imagine the culture shock this family would be feeling moving to live on the 9th floor of an apartment building on a london housing estate the author grew up on a housing estate in luton so he has first hand knowledge and experience of life in a setting we generally associate with inner city poverty ugliness deprivation violence drugs and anti social behaviour in other words not a very pleasant place to live or raise a family the story is narrated by harri as he is known trying to make sense of this very different world he is living in the complicated relationships and pecking order trying to sort out where he wants to be and who with and in the process finding himself doing and saying things he knows are wrong but feels compelled to do just to belong it is a savage place he is living in a teenage boy he knows from school a half friend he calls him is stabbed to death in the street harri didn't see the murder but does see all the blood the policeman standing guard the fear and sadness in the adults he resolves to find the murderer and bring him to justice and so like the hardy boys and the famous five before him he amasses clues makes careful observations with his newly acquired binoculars sets traps until he finds his mark unlike the hardy boys and the famous five however he also has to stay on the right side of the local estate gang dell farm crew their petty violence and acts of intimidation plus the usual teenage issues drugs alcohol sex harri also has to deal with homesickness and his lack of knowledge about such things as csi his mother being called a fuzzy wuzzy and why his aunt has no fingerprints as adults we generally respond well to books written through the eyes of a child we may not have experienced old age or illness or a serious accident or intrepid journeys or careers as forensic detectives magazine editors or prominent lawyers or even parenting but the one thing we all have in common is childhood reading such books reminds us of our own childhoods and how we saw the world of the adults around us books such as 'the curious incident of the dog in the night' 'room' and 'spies' focus on very large issues that are totally beyond the realm of a child to comprehend the child narrator being a major catalyst in the unfolding action of the story i feel that the author is trying to do much the same thing here with this winning formula but for me it doesn't seem to work as well it is almost as if he is trying too hard not a lot happens in this book harri tries to stay a good boy tries to find a murderer and tries to stay on the good side of the gang that is it there is also the most annoying distraction the pigeon just one of many hundreds of pigeons that nest on in the apartment buildings harri chooses one pigeon as his special bird his guardian and at random places in the story the pigeon gives his perspective on what is unfolding beneath him it really adds nothing to the story and other than one crucial piece of action towards the end boy and bird do not have any direct contact with each other the bird may be the symbol for some sort of guardian angel of the boy but because the two don't actually communicate with each other it all seems a bit far fetched however the despite all this the quality of the writing saves it as english is a second language for harri and his family his inner thoughts his conversations with his mother and sister are strewn with his own language hutious which seems to mean frightening scary weird and is the perfect word to describe much of the strangeness harri sees around him asweh for i swear his sister constantly telling him to 'advise yourself' a fabulous universal phrase which seems to mean anything from sort yourself out stop lying grow up shut up get out of my face the conversations harri has with his new friends are also funny wry very diverse and imaginative making sense of a playground sign that says 'say no to strangers' trying to make his cheap trainers look like adidas ones falling in love with a girl in his class now these would not be out of place in many children's world view but this is not a funny or happy book it is worth reading to once again be reminded of the desperate lot of many immigrant families to western cities and impoverished areas the random violence that frequently occurs around us the aimlessness of many young people with little education and few prospects but then again you may not want to read it because we have daily reminders of all this on the nightly news the newspapers and you tube better perhaps to read some escapist fantasy fiction or a bit of light chick lit","273":"excellent story of an immigrant african youngster trying to survive in an english slum told from his perspective this tale resounds with authenticity i did not like the ending","274":"although i found this book utterly depressing at times it also had some extremely funny parts and drew me in i wasn't too sure about what the pigeon represented and wasn't too sure of his role but by the shocking end of the book i believe he was intended to be an angel of an urban variety important and very moving book","275":"was a really sad ending i thought it was written excellently from the child's perspective and really made you think about the gang members in a more sympathetic way as they are just children too growing up in a harsh place","276":"i read this in my book discussion group and we all liked it some saw it as a coming of age story others as an immigrant's journey we also understood it as a critique of an unjust social system the slang is a little difficult to get used to but once you do the book is really fun quirky and ultimately very sad","277":"listen to the audiobook it is a treat aswhey","278":"read this for book group skipped the pigeon bits the ending felt inevitable but still sad","279":"better than expected pov of an 11year old ghanaian immigrant to london surprise ending","280":" pigeon english by stephen kelman is another book that was shortlisted for the booker this year and one i didn't particularly take to set in contemporary urban london it is the story of harrison opuku a 12 year old migrant boy from ghana who lives in a council housing estate harrison is all wide eyed wonder at a lot of what happens around him and at the same time somewhat aware of the violent neighbourhood he is in made all the more evident when a teenage boy in his school is murdered the book deals with the issue of knife crime and teenage violence and also touches on the general migrant experience why i didn't like the book had a lot to do with the narrative as the narrator harrison failed to win me over doing first person child narratives is never an easy task and for kelman there was also the added burden of it being a migrant child it just wasn't convincing and most of the time i found it irritating for one thing i just didn't see how he could be so completely in wonder of certain things and then in tune and street smart about others i also a found this whole thing of seeing adult issues through an innocent childish perspective a bit overdone already and what could've been fresh is if the perspective came from a less innocent child like one of the other child characters i found the portrayals of these characters a lot more succesful and convincing the child speak meets street speak was also a test of my patience especially when it's an entire book of that in room the child speak narrative worked beautifully and convincingly it also would've meant a very different story had it been from another voice and perspective i'm not sure pigeon english would have lost out had harrison not been the narrator and then there's the pigeon i assume it has a symbolic function perhaps to do with migration but other than that i just didn't see its point and when it starts to talk lord the less said about it the better there were some nice moments but on the whole pigeon english has sadly been a disappointment","281":" i've just finished reading pigeon english and really enjoyed it i found it easy to read but very enveloping and i could barely put it down it was shortlisted this year for the man booker prize although it didn't win i can understand why it was nominated for a prize as it reminded me in some ways of white teeth by zadie smith pigeon english is the story of a few month of harri's life told in his own words harri has moved from ghana to a london tower block with his mum and sister while the rest of his family are waiting to join them the language of the book reflects harri's african origins but also the language spoken by his new friends and also some mis understandings of english slang the area he lives in means he inevitably has contact with gangs but he also wants to do the right thing i really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it it is modern and current but could also become timeless","282":" i wasn't surprised by the twist at the end of this book as i think the reader gets an understanding from the beginning which particular event the novel is based upon nonetheless very raw extremely sad and a harsh realisation of what it is like as a teenager trying to adapt to the tough brutal unpredictable events that take place on a daily basis within a council estate in london the dialect took some getting used to but believe this to be intentional by the author overall an enjoyable read","283":"the story is told by harisson who is 11 years old and has recently arrived in a surburb of london from ghana with his mum and his sister he tells us about his new life his fears his new friends in a very funny and simple way still very influenced by his african background he has integrated very quickly some typical attitude of his new british surroundings besides going to school he spends a great deal of his time trying to resolve the murder of a kid of his school without realizing that he is putting his own life in danger the whole story goes beyond this it tells us about violence in the suburbs of big cities about emigration integration friendship and dreams what starts as a funny story ends in a very unexpected way great book","284":"one of the best that i have read in a long time harri rings so true to the spirit of an eleven year old boy you just have to love him although there is a feeling of doom that you carry with you throughout the book i couldn't put it down beautifully written","285":" to be honest i wasn't a huge fan of this book i didn't like the childlike language and while i appreciate it is a young adult book and a book about someone who is a non native speaker i found it very off putting the pigeon annoyed me as well both as the idea for the use of language and also for the commentary thoughts of the protagonist much more could have been made of it especially relating to harrisons uprooting from ghana to the estates of london there are some modern culture references that did make me smile such as adding extra brands to a pair of trainers but again i just felt the whole story was lacking something and could have been in a lot more depth exploring changes views and perspectives the overall story of hunting a person who committed a knife crime could have been made more interesting but i simply felt that the book didn't get into the psyche enough of the people who live in this type of environment it didn't explore enough of the ideas of what being a newly migrated immigrant in london is like and how the family cope for me","286":" seeing the world through the eyes of a 12 year old cannot be done more vividly than what stephen kelman has done in pigeon english he has painted the wonderful portrait of childhood with shades of innocence insatiable curiosity and also with the gray aspect of insecurity that surrounds it the central character harri is endearing and lingers in the mind for long even after having put down the book through his mannerisms and talks with pigeon we see a child who is trying to make sense of the chaos around him sometimes these mannerisms along with when pigeon talking to him in his imagination become too repetitive enough to be boring but the plot based on a murder mystery itself is interesting to keep pages turning","287":"at times i didn't like this book because it seemed to have no direction and maybe it made me a little uncomfortable to enter the mind of an 11 year old boy being forced to grow up too early in his urban surroundings and such is reality on the other hand it is one of the few books that i've read this year that has touched me emotionally and continues to linger in the back of my mind i would recommend it to others because it's a good book but i can't say i really liked it","288":"it was okay about summarises it the trouble with books which have been shortlisted or awarded something is that you approach them expecting to be impressed i wasn't impressed i didn't dislike it it was not bad i just wasn't impressed good things i like a child narrator i think it's probably an easy way to get sympathy for your main character on the whole i liked his figure of speech though it was not in itself enough to keep me interested it made me think a little about what life must be like for these generally good kids living on an estate with all those sorts of challenges not so good things it took too long nothing 'happened' for large swathes of the book it seemed to me pretty obvious for a long time where the book was going and it just took a long time to get there much as i like a child narrator with an unusual voice it started to grate after a while sometimes i get the impression that a books setting and it's theme is just set up to try and be a little shocking in this case immigration and the murder of a child no spoiler there this is early in the book often you can forget this and get on and enjoy the book other times it just feels like shocking by numbers in this case it felt like the latter ultimately i found the premise too unlikely the boy may have been young and foreign but he wasn't portrayed as stupid some of his actions seemed to be contrived to be stupid to bring about the ultimate ending and i found this unconvincing no spoiler there either i don't think summary it was okay just 1 9 stars","289":" another of my 2011 booker short list collection this time it took a while to grow on me as i am not a huge fan of writers using a narrative voice which cripples their vocabulary at the same time as anyway removing their authorial omniscience by virtue of being in the first person in this case the first person in question is an 11 year old ghanaian schoolboy in a somewhat deprived british inner city which naturally has a huge impact on the language there have been several books written from the perspective of a child narrator in recent years and it is perhaps in danger of being overdone the other aspect i had a problem with and never really warmed to was the pigeon at times we are privy to a pigeon monologue and while the pigeon and its spiritual interaction with the boy and his story can be taken as purely symbolic and perhaps in keeping with the boy's nature and nurture this never worked for me for the rest though this is a very confident first novel and one which despite my initial misgivings i came to be seduced by the boy and the world through his eyes came to be very real and engrossing and i was surprised to find that i was looking forward to getting back to the novel and sorry when it ended i did see the ending coming i have to say and it is one of those which i felt was probably the right one at the same time as wishing it had been different how accurate the portrayal of ethnic urban youth culture and the challenges of immigrant life are is impossible for me to judge as this is not the world i live in or in which i grew up it does come to feel very real though and effectively underlines the fact that despite differences of race language religion sex etc there is a core of common ground for humanity in the way we experience the world through needs hopes fears relationships and desires the skill of the writer became clear when i realised that i or the eleven year old me still somewhere in my subconscious was having no trouble identifying with young harrison despite all our differences i am happy to say that despite those initial misgivings i really enjoyed this book i won't mind if writers stop pretending to be children for a while though","290":"this beautifully crafted world of a small boy was over all too soon it is so unique in its writing style and depth i truly enjoyed in it","291":"beautifully written book about life as an immigrant teen in london the wonder newness and lack of real street knowledge make the narrator compelling to read but you fear for him","292":" a very sad moving story of an 11 year old ghanaian boy living on a housing estate in britain trying to survive the machinations of gang members and his sister's friends who sexually abuse and harass him there is also his relationship with one of many pigeons who visit his flat who seems to serve as his guardian angel however he witnesses an act of extreme brutality which pervades the book with a sense of menace present throughout told in the boy's voice with its intriguing mix of african and english pidgin possibly an intentional pun on the title of the book this book cannot fail to move readers it is a harsh indictment of british housing policies which have failed to provide safe accommodation for immigrants for decades and also of successive governments which have paid lip service to the needs of immigrants without fully addressing them highly recommended","293":"could have been brilliant but wasn't plods along didn't have any empathy with characters human or avian not sue what the pigeon actually added to the story but would have loved to have known about the back story of mum and aunty","294":"this range true as a teacher in a london comp i know students one in particular that this book could have been about the language of harri was consistent and believable it was funny poignant and engaging like everyone i agree ditch the pigeon bits unnecessary and distracting","295":"i enjoyed this book and the main character i found a bit difficult to carry on because of the used language nice story easy to find connections to real life but a bit sad different from books i normally read by definitely worth it","296":"loved the narration from the 11 year old immigrant so heartbreaking to know the things he is describing in his world for what they really are good look at urban life and how violence can be cyclical i liked the input from the pigeon but sometimes a bit off from the pattern and rhythm of the book and narration","297":"i am not a fan of books written from the point of view of children but this one had some sweet moments its end however was very disappointing","298":"great book from booker prize shortlist 2010 funny and sad focusing on the view of boy from ghana growing up in uk who investigates the murder of a fellow pupil intend to read a few more books from variuos booker prize years","299":"really good read bit predictable but overall i really liked it","300":"great book with great meaning and entertaining","301":"the story of harrison's life in inner city london an 11 year old migrant from ghana is told with humour and authenticity overall it makes for a thoroughly decent read but like so many books suffers from too much praise which raises reader's expectation levels if you liked \"the curious incident of the dog in the night time then chances are you'll like this","302":"the voice in this book was incredible spot on i have taught this child i could see him so vividly an clearly my heart was won in the first few pages i had a very hard time putting it down i read it in two nights i loved the use of the pidgeon it added an omniscence that fit perfectly with and balanced the youth of the narrator spoiler this book cracked my heart open but i would expreience it again in a heartbeat","303":"great book unique voice strongly perceptive view of pre teen and teen struggles in an urban environment also love the main character for his positivity and sense of humour great book but sad can't wait to try another one by kelman","304":"asweh it was brutal maybe even hutious loved it","305":"i didn't think i was going to like this book initially i think that stems from my discomfort with the idea of gang violence and inner city life harri is a wonderful character and an exuberant child but even he occasionally participates in ugly things as i continued to read i was captivated by harri's exuberance and love for the people and things around him the contrast between a wonderful little boy and the very violent grown up world in which he lives is striking mr kelman has written a beautiful debut novel harri opuku has joined the roster of young protagonists who teach adult readers important lessons about life death faith and love this is one of my favorite books of this year i think it's a strong contender for the man booker prize now that it's been short listed for more of my thoughts check out literarylindsey blogspot com","306":"the voice of the eleven year old narrator harrison opoku is funny and endearing and the novel's ending is not one i'll soon forget the back cover of my edition implies that harri endangers his family by trying to find a friend's killer but it seems to me that he and his older sister lydia would have been inevitably sucked into the world of gang violence no matter what that inevitability is what makes the novel so bittersweet in addition to playing detective harri is also trying to feed and protect a pigeon interestingly we get the point of view of the bird itself in some brief italic sections it is part bird part guardian angel and part unwanted creature bearing uncanny resemblance to harri's family and other immigrants","307":"i think the author did a wonderful thing telling an adult story through the eyes of a mostly joyful child i love you tree i love you baby sister i love you pigeon now i need to reread what came before he shot her by elizabeth george my gut tells me that harri is truer more childlike","308":"i loved this book it was funny charming and sad","309":" i enjoyed this sad emotional book and at times laugh out loud funny lines the author captured harri's youthful naivety very well as he enters a world of gang culture and violence i won't spoil the end for those who haven't read it but just to say once you find out the background of this book it made the whole thing more real and made you look at the book in a whole different way my only critique of the book are the paragraphs written from the pigeons perspective which i thought interrupted the flow of the book my thoughts are that maybe the pigeon was harri's guardian angel and his conversations with the pigeon quite nicely laced in but solely the pigeon paragraphs maybe not so","310":" a schoolboy from ghana living in a london council estate coping with his new life and the reality of inner city living including the recent stabbing of a local boy a thought provoking read told in a child's voice in a similar style to 'room' or 'the curious incident of the dog in the night time' but with a distinctively london edge benefiting myself from some familiarity with ghana and london i enjoyed the authentic use of dialect 'obruni' 'bogah' 'goawayou' 'i go sound you' though i did wonder whether this would impact on other readers' understanding harri opoku certainly found his way into my heart with his innocent outlook on life his love of nature and animals his catchphrases it was brutal and his humorous observations on his journey into adulthood without revealing too much the ending was as abrupt and as devastating as the all too frequent reality for some young people and their families living in areas of deprivation in urban environments as families united and the damilola taylor trust whom this book supports would no doubt testify i suppose my criticisms would be the almost idyllic naivety with which the author paints harri i agree that many young boys growing up on estates are guiltlessly sucked into the cycle of crime and deviance and forced to grow up before they are ready but i wondered if perhaps harri was too pure too faultless it would have made him a more rounded character if we could have seen more of his personal struggles between good and evil we are all after all only human and i wasn't sure what to make of the pigeon's narrative a spirit a guardian angel a figment of harri's vivid imagination definitely a unique approach with parallels with the movie 'kidulthood' this is an entertaining read and a good insight into the struggles faced by young people in the uk and the reality of growing up in a urban metropolis i highly recommend","311":"i highly recommend this book for anyone ftc i received a free copy of this book and was not reimbursed in any other way","312":" mmm this is hard for me although it is a good book with a message to be grateful for what you have when you've grown up 'privileged' i personally was a bit bored with the story written from the child's perspective i loved 'room' and 'the curious incident of the dog in the night time' but i think that was enough for me very sad book it did make me think though and it gave me a better insight on life in gang related areas although we read about this i don't think those of use who didn't grow up like this would ever be able to really comprehend it so yes a positive it made me grateful again","313":"interesting funny yet horrific","314":"stephen kelman's debut novel pigeon english introduces readers to one of the most pervasively and persuasively authentic narrator voices in fiction in recent memory that recent memory includes the precocious jack in room by emma donoghue and the quietly unforgettable christopher in the curious incident of the dog in the night time by mark haddon which means that kelman's 11 year old harrison opoku known as harri to his family and friends is in admirable and luminous company harri has just arrived in london from ghana with his mother and teenaged sister and is living in a housing estate that would be euphemistically labelled a priority or at risk neighbourhood in some constituencies harri's family is asunder his grandmother father and infant sister remain behind in ghana and in some unspecified peril because of the terms by which some of them were able to come to england harri's natural and infectious ebullience seems more affected by long distance yearnings for the people left behind than stymied or threatened by the more immediate cacophony surrounding him at home at school and on the streets even when a boy is stabbed to death in his neighbourhood it fascinates harri more than it truly bothers or affects him as the sound of his baby sister's voice getting cut off on the phone clearly does voices near and far are just one of an intricate interweaving of metaphors and imagery that kelman handles with impressive assurance for a first time novelist kelman controls well but not obtrusively not just his protagonist's voice but the chorus of supporting characters' voices echoed and interpreted through the protagonist through his mastery of the subtleties of voice accent and expression kelman also sensitively and precisely manages the perceptions that drive the story forward and the misapprehensions and naivete that lead it understandably astray kelman incorporates other types of potent imagery and weaves them organically and comfortably into harri's words and observations without undermining the believability of harri's voice but also of the gritty realities he faces navigating amongst schoolmates gangs shopkeepers police officers and others in his inner city world references to fingerprints and fingertips are especially intriguing how they are used to identify or when erased to hide one's identity but also how they are used to gather information and experience the textures and sensations of the world much of the imagery builds on the feelings of a child hungry to learn to grow to love and be loved for a story and characters set in an unremittingly urban realm much of the imagery infusing the world of pigeon english is exhilaratingly natural as illustrated in a sequence that captures what a wellspring of vitality and joie de vivre harri is in spite of it all i don't have a favourite raindrop they're all as good as each other they're all the best that's what i think anyway i always look up at the sky when it's raining it feels brutal it's a bit hutious because the rain's so big and fast and you think it will go in your eye but you have to keep your eyes open or you won't get the feeling i try to follow one raindrop all the way down from the cloud to the ground asweh it's impossible all you can see is the rain you can't follow just one raindrop it's too busy and all the other raindrops get in the way the best bit is running in the rain if you point your face up to the sky at the same time as running it nearly feels like you're flying you can close your eyes or you can keep them open it's up to you i like both you can open your mouth if you want the rain just tastes like water from the tap except it's quite warm sometimes it tastes like metal before you start running find an empty bit of the world with nothing in the way no trees or buildings and no other people that way you won't crash into anything try to go in a straight line then you just run as fast as you can at first you're scared of crashing into something but don't let it put you off just run it's easy the rain on your face and the wind makes it feel like you're going superfast it's very refreshing i dedicated my rain run to the dead boy it was a better present than a bouncy ball i kept my eyes closed the whole time and i didn't even fall over the only false note in pigeon english is the intermittent introduction of a second narrative voice that can't possibly match the authenticity and vivacity of harri's voice this second voice neither expands the view of the story credibly beyond harri's perceptions and assessments nor does it work well metaphorically as other imagery does as well the pigeon pidgin pun is not only forced but is ever so slightly offensive and seems to strangely demean the book's greatest achievement its convincing voices in all of their linguistic originality and complexity a pidgin language is defined as a simplified language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have a language in common harri's voice and vocabulary form a surprisingly sophisticated argot and amalgam of everything from ghanaian english and ghanaian english slang to commercial and technological terminology to his own sweet and singular usages and classifications of the world it's unforgettable and not to be diminished as something lesser or compromised when the book ends and harri's voice is stilled this reader immediately achingly acutely missed him true testament to the strength of an indelibly forged voice asweh you won't want to let go of young vibrant harri either","315":"felt like shooting the pigeon","316":"this book was very cute and taught me much ghanaian english slang aka pidgin english my favourites being advise yourself think it through don't be stupid chooked stabbed don't disturb shut up and donkey hours a long tome books with pre adolescent narrators will always appeal to me","317":"quite boring with a tragic end","318":"maybe i'll have to rethink this and give it a five i really liked this book one part curious incident of the dog in the nighttime and one part room the story is told through the eyes of a boy from ghana new to the uk a boy from his housing complex is murdered and he embarkes on a quest to catch the killers his 11 year old narration is amusing and sad to read at the same time he is trying to learn the language and culture of a new country the rules of adolescence and stay safe in the housing projects at the same time he is a very joyful and happy character to read even though the tone is dark harrison and his pidgeon will stay in my head for a long while","319":"this book made me cry how frightening to think that this is the life some children are experiencing","320":"i enjoyed this book but i felt the ending was quite abrupt and sudden it was a good read and was entertaining but it's not one i'd read again","321":"i loved this book the title is a wonderful play on words that comes clear in the book but that is only a hint of what lies in wait here the author brings to you to the world of african immigrants in present day london he provides you a perspective of modern western consumer society through the eyes of a pre teen young male who is going through all the anticipated rites of passage but in very confusing to him ways","322":"a bit like mark haddon's curious incident with only the storyteller in this book is a boy born in ghana who now lives in london a guy from his school is murdered and he goes and investigates in his own way a pretty simple yet gripping story about mordern life in the big city as seen through the eyes of an immigrant","323":"s mind very good it was amazing and sometimes even scary to read about all conditions and situation in which children living in such a multicultural place as london is have to grow up i dont mean it like in critical way but the ambience of streets full of cruelty and kids gangs i mean wow thats something i would never want to grow up there respect i liked the interpretation of kid's mind very good it was amazing and sometimes even scary to read about all conditions and situation in which children living in such a multicultural place as london is have to grow up i don't mean it like in critical way but the ambience of streets full of cruelty and kid's gangs i mean wow that's something i would never want to grow up there respect","324":" harrison okupu is an eleven year old boy a ghanaian immigrant living with his mother and older sister on the dell farm estate in london where the recent murder of a local teenager has rocked his childhood bubble to combat the nasties lurking in the shadows harrison and his friend dean embark on an elaborate detective game to catch the killer often bringing them far closer to their sinister reality than the unwitting reader can quite handle...stephen kelman writes his rough estate well and pigeon english was originally imagined up out of his experiences growing up in places very much like the dell farm estate the element of this book however that is absolutely astounding is kelman's utterly convincing often hilarious child narrator harrison is a good boy battling to do the right thing despite his limitations and despite the baddies who lurk around the neighbourhood and often seem to have him right within their grasp however these bad boys are barely adults themselves children who for lack of education or chance allow themselves to be dragged down into a quagmire of drugs and fighting...harrison may have fun playing detectives with his plastic binoculars and sellotape for fingerprints but this is no game and that is precisely where the fear and tragedy lies an eleven year old's world view is a fascinating thing all knowing yet really knowing nothing at all the peripheral darkness and danger that the boy simply couldn't begin to understands heightens the tension and for adult readers turns this novel into something of sheer brilliance http relishreads com 2013 06 29 pig","325":"good book nice and short takes you into the world of the subject harrison opoku an immigrant school kid from ghana which i found a new and interesting place to be","326":"lots of voice but i soon realized that the story wasn't going anywhere the author seemed to forget about the conceit of having the main character talk to a pigeon and having the pigeon respond for long periods of the book so when it actually came in it was jarring overall a disappointment despite some very enjoyable passages","327":"wonderful heartbreaking book thanks may ling for putting this on my radar","328":"only got to page 39 it got great reviews on a tv programme about the man booker prize the inhabitants of this english village voted it the favourite even though it did not go on to win i should have been warned that the writer had been influenced by 'paddy clark ha ha ha' which won a prize years ago for a novel written through the eyes of a child generally this is not my genre it often just sounds like an adult trying to be a kid this was like that for me so stopped there are exception like 'room' that i liked","329":"now this was brilliant book in the same mould as jasper jones only better its about an 11year old boy called harri from ghana adjusting to life on a south london housing estate love his perspective and voice through which the book is told delightful but dark at the same time a must read im not saying anything more just read it","330":"dope fine 11 year old observer classmate friend and energy sharing person lives in london projects and learns about the world around him puts you in the mind of somebody figuring out things for the first time always good to do","331":" this was shortlisted for the booker 2011 so thought it worth trying it is another contemporary immigrant experience narrative this time from the first person viewpoint of 11 year old harri from ghana who has come to an inner city london council estate a melting pot of different cultures all trying to fit in with the english it is all too plausible except for the in my opinion superfluous and silly pigeon talking of playground and street education however playgrounds are not what they used to be and the potential nastiness of children and youths is now horrifically violent and the results terrible the narrative is so accurate for an 11 year old and is innocent sometimes extremely sweet and heart wrenching but mainly the bluff of a young boy who just wants to belong i only give it 3 stars because the plot is very slow and hardly there and i felt almost like i was trudging through parts of it maybe it's just too realistic and uncomfortable","332":"i so want to give this 2 disappointing","333":" stephen kelman's debut novel pigeon english is a raw and real look into inner city london's dark daily life narrated by the profound harrison opoku an eleven year old boy recently emigrated from ghana pigeon english reveals the depth of violence and twisted justice which so quickly becomes apparent in the london youth following the death of a fellow youth and student a bloody and seemingly meaningless stabbing harrison and his friend derek take on a vague sense of duty an begin investigative reports on the scene in their simplified childish way they set up watch interrogate suspects and look for clues and evidence though the novel holds aspects of crime scene investigation it is in no means a murder mystery by genre instead through these investigations kelman reveals the beauty of a young boys mind and the simple honesty with which he lives his life both gentle and loving in his displays of caring for the pigeon which lands on his balcony one day harrison is an expressly loveable character whose affection and protective nature for his little sister agnes residing in ghana with their father is both inspiring and heart warming i pretended like all the oranges rolling everywhere were her happy memories and they were looking for a new person to stick to so they didn't get wasted \" in contrast the youth's desire for destruction brutality and violence and harri's own fascination with the local gang reveal the intensity of youth and the ease with which they as a society can slip into such immense horror and destruction killa got a screwdriver out of his pant i saw it with my own two eyes i could even see the killing thoughts in the air they were sticking to us like crazy moths after thunder they wanted to kill us you could tell through these dichotomous emotions kelman weaves the intricate tapestry of emotions which drive youth culture the voice through which the story is told most predominantly that of harri is honest and real and often times simple childish excitability certainly comes though but with a profound depth and beauty which transcends all age and circumstance his analysis of people is so childishly simple that it reveals truth so often missed by adult mindsets in his observation of mr frimpong harrison reveals the pureness of his heart \"mr frimpong is the oldest person from church that's when i knew why he sings louder than anybody else it's because he's been waiting the longest for god to answer he thinks god has forgotten him i only knew it then then i loved him but it was too late to go back \" this passage also reveals a reoccurring theme within the novel and specifically within harrison of a fascination with death the memory and 'spirit' of the dead boy permeates and presides over the story weaving its way in and out of day to day chores guilty looks and moments of personal triumph harrison is fixated on his memory a boy he wasn't particularly close with and continually dedicates his moments of happiness to the boy's memory or spirit in the same way gang members and bully figures are forever fixed on death and revenge carving death threats in apartment doors and chanting for blood during street fights there is an animalistic quality alive in each youth and each person which kelman carefully explores within the confines of brutal gang culture forcing it to collide with innocent hearts and pure minds in a violent clash of interaction and emotion a turbulent and reflective novel pigeon english uses the simplicity of style and heart to pierce the heart of the reader even as it drags them into a world of shockingly hardened young criminals perpetuating the dark inner city life of london funny sickening and triumphant stephen kelman's debut is a fine example of voice and heart in a plot driven increasingly sic fi literary world","334":" pigeon english is a journey written from a voice that is rarely heard harri the protagonist is an eleven year old from ghana living in a rough council estate in london his interactions with the new culture is both humourous and heart breaking it is hard not to fall in love with harri's innocence you will see his world from his eyes feel his relationships as if your own and get to understand him more with every word he speaks the book also brings to the fore the social challenges all around him the gangs whose approval he seeks the juvenile crime which seems too common the woes of immigration and fraud as well as being separated from part of his family yet through it all he sticks out as the only uncorrupted portion of his world i did not think the pigeons character was strong enough as very little reference was made to it the fact that only the reader could hear its words was also slightly distracting all in all a good book recommended for those looking for a light read","335":"i brought this home from the library because of the description of the 2 characters a boy from ghana in london and a pigeon but when i looked more closely the real focus of the book is a south london housing estate so i started off a bit on the wrong foot i did like it i enjoyed the speech of all the people in the book which really brought it to life but got a bit impatient about half way through by the time i had ploughed through the middle i was really worried about how he was going to wrap it up but the very end was as good as the very beginning","336":"review can be found at www the reading pile blogspot co uki don't know where to being with pigeon english i'm not as impressed with it as i had hoped to be when i accepted it for review the concept of it is amazing and i was really interested and excited to begin reading about the 11 year old ghanaian boy harri i thought the tale that kelman had come up with was going to be interesting and fun to read about then i opened the book the mix of english and ghanaian phrases asweh i swear hutious scary gowayou go away made the novel hard to read and confusing for me it took me a while to figure out a few of them this for me made the novel harder to enjoy and i eventually found that i wasn't enjoying it at all it was also written in harri's voice and i don't usually do well with young narrators i find them hard to read enough as it is the further i got into the novel and the further harri and dean got into their 'investigation' i found a few glimmers of hope there would be funny scenes boring scenes tense scenes it was a real mix but for me that doesn't work i couldn't read the story in one sitting as i'd hoped because when i reached a chapter that wasn't funny didn't add much to the story i found myself putting it down and picking something else up instead at one point that was an assignment for english the ending was unexpected but it was a well written ending it made me forgive the boring parts because i actually connected with harri in the last few pages overall not my cup of tea won't be re reading that anytime soon","337":"for a man booker this was disappointing i was expecting more insight but it's just a scared then inquisitive then scared ghanaian kid in london the pigeon talk was lost on me the family dynamics were interesting this could easily have been good","338":" it provides a wonderful insight to living on a sink estate in contemporary britain and in places it was very moving especially the ending yet i felt the author was hemmed in by his choice of an adolescent protagonist i went to an event with stephen kelman and he admitted 'this there is only so much you can do with writing from a child's view ' hence he brought in the pigeon but this didn't work at all for me it explained what we discerning readers could work out for ourselves also i understand the author didn't use the pigeon because it is often used in literature as a spiritual messenger which is a bit disappointing yet using a child protagonist can work extremely well and doesn't have to be limiting i very much recommend the boy in the striped pyjamas by john boyne which is a great example so engaging but ultimately falling short apparently the publisher is now promoting it to a young adult audience i can understand that this may well generate more sales thought i very much question the young adult label i think any serious child reader progresses from children's literature straight to proper literature","339":"harri is an amazing narrator an immigrant living in the housing projects he brings a unique perspective to looking at the western world he seems very worldly but is innocent at the same time sometimes his narration can be annoying but it's annoying in a way a very outgoing hyper kid is the ending is brutal though","340":"gripping concept and what a twist unfortunately i never really got to grips with the telling of the story and found the narrative voice a little alienating worth a read","341":"mmm liked this book but didn't love it interesting concept and i liked the way that the story was written through naive 11 year old harri's eyes however i thought that there wasn't really much in the way of a plot and i really disliked the ending not one i will revisit but a worthwhile read","342":"it was interesting and really reminded me of the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime some sections were a bit slow and some things were not explained enough because the narrator is a young boy i both loved and hated the ending though","343":"very readable with an engaging narrator in harrison","344":"i loved the narrative voice of harri his story was compelling disturbing and ultimately tragic a sobering read","345":" an endearing moving brilliant book pigeon english has two narrators a pigeon and 11 year old harri newly arrived with his mother and little sister from ghana both harri and the pigeon live in the high rise slum housing of london both have serious gaps in their understanding of the foreign society they find themselves in to their peril harri's irrepressible good nature and curiosity is a wonder kelman's writing is genius highly recommended especially for those who loved the curious incident of the dog in the night and other books with outsider narrators also the setting london's vast public housing estates and the hopelessness of the world is right on the mark concerning the riots this past summer","346":"gripping well written","347":" i guess having a young semi autistic narrator narrate novels is a thing nowadays i really enjoyed the curious incident of the dog in the night time and extremely loud and incredibly close so i'm not opposed to the premise those books seemed inventive the language strange enough to compensate for certain shortcomings and the infinite naivety endearing and refreshing pigeon english reads how my never washed vibram five finger shoes smell and i can't tell if it's because those other books are better or if it's because those other books are already books either way it's a wonder that this novel was shortlisted for the booker and that i have never put my foot gloves into the washing machines","348":"competently written but often tiresome the narrator an 11 year old ghanaian boy recently immigrated to london often came across as far too precious and the immigrant's eye view seemed a device for repetitive go nowhere scenes of observations of life in england the actual story narrative is quite thin i appreciated the ending however","349":"i usually like books that win prizes or are short listed and some people rave about this one but i didn't like it at all the story is just really boring nothing happens and i found the constant ghanaian patois irritating distracting and i had no idea what most of it meant as there is no glossary i figured out a couple of things but quite honestly i didn't care enough to work the other bits out by half way through i was skip reading and willing the book to end a total dud","350":"this was an amazing funny thoughtful book right until the last two pages i hated the ending so i can only give this a 3 star rating","351":"i was not prepared for how attached i would get to the child narrator of this book i often find child narrators to be irritating or false this was neither it felt completely genuine like the trail of thought of a boy growing up in such circumstances and rather than finding it irritating i warmed to harrison straight away predictable in the basic plot but less so in the emotions of a child in such a situation this book is both funny and incredibly sad the only bit that didn't really work for me was the pigeon i found my self almost skipping over those bits which i very rarely do i can only assume as the pigeon was there as almost an angel character to harrison whereas it was viewed as vermin by everyone else it was highlighting the differences between people's perceptions and reality however i personally found the pigeon monologues unnecessary and was thankful they were few and far between and so did not distract from a great book","352":"definitely too much of 'hutious' and 'vexing' not mention 'advise yourself ' too strong language at times and i can t find it funny it's a really sad story","353":"moving account well written quite predictable though","354":" this is one of those novels with a clear voice here the voice of harri harrison opoku harri lives with his mom a midwife and his older sister lydia on the 9th floor of an apartment building in london england harri's dad little sister and grandma are still back in ghana and harri wants desperately to see them again as the phone calls aren't enough for him harri has made a friend dean and the two boys spend a lot of time together another boy from harri's school has been knifed and killed and harri and dean take it upon themselves to look for the killer since the police don't seem to be making headway the two boys relish their role as detectives and take clues seriously trying to gather fingerprints and other hard data harri is also a bird lover and takes a special liking to a particular pigeon having secret conversations with it he is also both fascinated and repelled by the local gang the dell farm crew and is occasionally singled out by their leader x fire harri is an innocent trying to be the man of the house in his father's absence and is a good boy at heart even his work to find the boy's killer is a good work one he feels drawn to because the boy once did a nice thing for him this is a story that will stick with you young harri's voice grabbing you and not letting go","355":" what a fab book it is obvious why this book has received so many accolades as its not very often i enjoy a book as much as this one the novel is written in the style of 'the curious incident or 'when god was a rabbit' and follows harrison a young boy from ghana as he discovers things about the world the insight is fab so many of the phrases and observations that being bought up in britain i take for granted are beautifully captured by kelman harri's exploration of the world is relly well explored and explained through his eyes the dialogue is really well shown and the characters who interact with harri although not described in any detail are really clear and add to the warmth you feel for harri the basic premis of the novel is that of a murder investigation of a young boy which harri and his friend dean take it upon themselves to conduct the innocence of the two is really good and this novel has moments of real laugh out loud humour when the boys go about trying to catch the killer this novel ended on a los for me not because it was written badly but because the ending has a slight twist which really knocked me for six it would give the eding away to go into too much detail but kelman creates such a lovely endearing character in harri that the ending really does produce quite a strong emotion if i werent sat in sight of others i would be sobbing by now overall this is an excellent read i will be passing this on to anyone and everyone and telling anyone else i come across to read it it really deserves all the praise and recognition it has received and i look forward to reading more from kelman as he follows on from this his debut novel what a start","356":"hmmm this was a booker nominee but i can't think why the concept is fair enough a first person account by a recently arrived 12 year old ghanaian child in london of a local teen gang murder and its aftermath however there are far too many inconsistencies in the sub plots of childhood innocence love wonder and the character of the boy is not really believable as a result","357":"this not a review but a challenge is anyone out there willing to compare pigeon english debut novel short listed for the booker child narrator strong reviews with what came before he shot her a novel that immerses itself in the same world and explores the same challenges but is written by elizabeth george possibly the most acclaimed mystery writer of our time who took a wild chance on a book that many panned because they expected it to be a lynley mystery in my opinion george took a brave and significant plunge in writing what came before he shot her and was not so kindly rewarded the book met with critical claim but was not met with great reception by her reading public she did it anyway and i'm sure she knew the possible ramifications i liked pigeon english despite its shortcomings george's book has shortcomings as well length being possibly the biggest however i have to say hands down george did a better job of portraying the world in which both harri of pe and joel had to navigate every day and in the end i still remember george's book and characters in a way that i will not remember pigeon english but elizabeth george as a successful mystery writer would never attract the attention of serious writing prize judges based on her status as a mystery writer alone and so `what came before he shot her` was inappropriately relegated to the mystery genre and mostly ignored despite its deft writing emotional impact and social significance both books are `good` kudos to anyone willing to take this challenge on what came before he shot her","358":" harri harrison opoku is an 11 year old the fastest runner in year 7 who immigrated from ghana to london's housing projects with his mother and older sister his father grandma and baby sister agnes still live in ghana until they can save enough money for the plane fare this book is told through harri's eyes as he tries to make sense of the english language and customs and solve the murder of an older boy who once stuck up for him he also has some run ins with members of the dells farm crew the local gang of older teenage boys the writing in this book is beautiful and harri's exuberance optimism and naivete are what made the story for me his worldview was one that i was happy to return to each time i opened the book the ending took me by surprise and i had to read it a few times to let it sink in that being said i think it was a good ending for the book this is stephen kelman's debut and i can't wait to read more by him","359":"about a boy who emigrated from ghana with his sister and mother to london amazing insight into a young boy's experiences struggling with conflicting powers pulling him i listend to it on audio it is a brilliant book fabulously narrated by bahni turpin the help","360":"funny and engaging coming of age story set in england and told by an endearing young narrator a recent immigrant from ghana published for adults but a story older teens may appreciate","361":"moving funny and tragic wonderful writing a horrible environment made magical through the eyes of a child everyone should read this","362":"this book draws a lot of comparisons to the curious incident of the dog in the night time by mark haddon because it's written from the perspective of a child and as a reader you have to read between the lines of his innocent explanations for things the main character harri is a lovely kid you're rooting for him the whole time it's very funny in parts and very easy to read bo styles recommended","363":" this book has some strong recommendations on the front cover quotes from the times the guardian and short listed for the man booker prize in 2011 send out the message that this is real quality and maybe that's what lead to my low rating maybe i was expecting a lot more the story concerns itself with young harrison opoku a ghana national who now finds himself living in a tower block in modern day london with his mother and elder sister the story is told in the first person from harrison's point of view and this is somewhere that kelman really excels as a reader you are transported to this magical world of guardian pigeons amateur detection and the stirrings of first love but something never rang true for me whilst the narrative is convincing i felt a lot of the characters actions were not to the point that a major piece of plot info is unrealistic ally held back until towards the end of the book the story revolves around the murder of an older boy who harrison knows and harrison and a friend spend their time trying to find the killer they attempt to take fingerprints from the crime scene they look for foot prints and try to collect sputum samples from people in the area harrison is constantly harassed by the local hoodies they try to enlist him and when he fails a number of tasks they turn on him and threaten him with violence harrison's friend dean watches a lot of csi and tells harrison about the things they should be doing to catch the killer yet when they find the victims bloody wallet they don't hand it in to the police this didn't make sense to me as they'd spent the whole blummin book looking for evidence also when it becomes blatantly obvious who the killer is we find out that harrison had witnessed an altercation between the murdered boy and the killer on the day he was murdered but he never once mentions this to anyone or even thinks about it until the end this struck me as absolute nonsense totally unrealistic to the extent it ripped me out of the world that kelman had created with a jolt you can't have a character hunting for clues desperate to solve a crime who forgets blanks a pivotal incident from their memory just to ad tension to the story as it didn't anyway it was fairly obvious who the killer was from the beginning so this rather baffled me also whenever harrison thinks of ghana or talks to his father and younger sister back in ghana we have a picture of an african idyl strong community spirit healthy living care free days but no real indication as to why they've split up the family to be in england the child's eye view of urban london is wonderfully told with a very strong authentic voice and i suspect that it was this that lead to the short list and plaudits but the brutal plot twist and holes made it less than perfect for me in the end i came away from this feeling that it was a very well meaning middle class view of a much deeper problem the pigeon i hated tolerated and then enjoyed but never really understood why","364":"really enjoyed this book although i found that the young voice did get a little repetitive jarring after a while hope that's not massively hypocritical given my latest novel it's well written and rattles along with a nice pace despite not much actually happening that's not a criticism well researched and brilliantly descriptive in places recommend","365":"it's disappointing that this is now on the national curriculum what happened to uplifting and inspiring children's literature every english primary school child will be reading this cautionary tale that encourages the it's not my business attitude of modern society","366":"i would have easily given this five stars if not for the complete over usage of slang and dialect there is some really beautiful writing in this novel but one really has to dig for it frankly the author goes overboard in his eagerness to demonstrate authenticity of speech it ends up being a distraction","367":" great and realistic premise disappointing results maybe the use of child narrators has been overdone i didn't really connect with this one his voice as an 11 year old immigrant didn't ring true for me his slang was overused and drove me mad and most of the time he either sounded far too young or a lot older hardly ever 11 the author shows promise with his ideas and this could have been great with a lot of editing but it read like a first draft a bad first draft he must have shown a bit of potential with his writing though setting the scene in particular as it was a realistic enough portrayal of a gang culture london ghetto to make me want to get out of there asap the ending was predictable but poignant i also think that although the concept of the pigeon didn't work it could have if it were handled properly 2 5 stars","368":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this reminded me of skippy dies to a distracting degree and was equally bleak in its ending and message i think without making much of a point besides it's tragic when vibrant young kids live in violence and suffer horrific fates as a result the pigeon metaphor didn't work for me although harri's ruminations on his distant baby sister did in the end i felt like this book could have said a lot more than it did and perhaps thought it was saying more than it did","369":"simultaneously hilarious and full of ache there were some amazing language feats here the boy's voice is true compelling innocent real the ending well is it just because it was different than i thought or wished that made me wary of it i just don't know i do know some of the phrases and thoughts from the boy narrator made me laugh out loud but the course of action was also heart wrenching","370":"it took a while to get used to the mindset and the lingo of a an 11 year old boy from ghana surviving in a though neighbourhood in london there's a constant tension between the very recognisable kid stuff being a parent of a young boy myself and the ominous premonition surrounding both home and school some books keep lingering for a while as this one certainly will","371":"it was a good read but such a sad ending plus it was a bit confusing like when you first start reading it the boy sounds like he's living in another era 70's 90's or that he is living in a undeveloped country but then he mentions tinchy stryder and youtube and galaxy samsung and you're sitting there like what the hell it's about the present 2000s and it doesn't sound at all like it","372":"great book but the ending was horrible i will never look at pigeons the same way again","373":" written from the perspective of 11 year old harrison who recently arrived in london from ghana this is an incredible story of childhood growing up and adjusting to a new culture his story is set against the investigation of a murdered boy in his area which he becomes interested in i loved this book and was so shocked at one point no spoilers that i actually swore out loud a few times the second book i've read written entirely from a child's perspective and i really think it's a brilliant story telling tool excellent debut","374":"a very quick read on a very heavy topic great book i didn't see where it got repetitive in the middle like some said i didn't see the need for the talking pigeon however","375":" there are three aspects to this debut novel that are probably going to make or break the average reader's reaction to it the first is that it is largely plotless instead it follows an 11 year old immigrant from ghana as he makes his way around the impoverished london estate new home the second is that it is narrated in his broken or pidgin english and the third is that at the start and end of some chapters it also features some first pigeon narration from well a pigeon personally while i tend to prefer plot driven fiction i can live with minimal or no plot if there is something to connect with and in this book 11 year old harrison aka harri opoku is such a lovable naive child that i couldn't help but connect with his irrepressible spirit like harri moved from africa to an alien first world country at around age 10 11 and found it to be a similarly bewildering and hostile place others may find harri to be too precious or unbelievably innocent but i fell for him hook line and sinker and to be fair the book is not entirely plotless there is a murder mystery to propel things along with a minor romantic subplot i tend to really like writing that has a distinctive sound from the thick scots of irvine welsh's work to the edwardian slang of p g wodehouse to the nadsat anthony burgess concocted for a clockwork orange i found the ghanaian inflected english that peppers the book's description and dialogue my favorite is the admonishment advise yourself to be neither overwhelming nor labored it appears in just the right dosages and just the right times and carries enough nuance to remind the reader of harri's outsider status i will admit that much as i liked this book that the bits involving the pigeon just didn't work at all for me about a third of the way in i just starting skipping the pigeon's narrative portions which is easily done as they appear in italics it feels like a strained gimmick and the only justification i can think of is that the author was attempting to invoke the classic english novel a kestrel for a knave ultimately the book fits securely into that mode of storytelling that uses immigrant eyes and voices to reveal the flaws of their host society in that sense it functions as effective critique of contemporary britain one clearly drawn from the author's own background and experiences some of these themes and setting are similar to peter akinti's recent book forest gate albeit with a very different tone i am not at all surprised to see that the bbc has commissioned a script from the book and a screen adaptation appears likely","376":"a somber look at the horrors of childhood and teenage gangs sadly all too true the book was written with a good mix of humour and harsh reality i felt an attachment to the main character i was sorry to get to the end","377":"hard to describe beautiful language beautiful innocence beautiful wonder in an ugly world it could have continued i did not want it to end especially the way it ended","378":"a very unusual book it's not every author who can naturally combine light hearted amusement with almost sickening realism the story tapers off at the end rather than coming to one of the various conclusions you might expect at first this struck me as disappointing but on reflection anything else would have been false","379":"a book that reflects the current living conditions of families in council estates especially the immigrants you can guess ending pretty much as soon as you begin the book","380":" i don't usually read books like pigeon english making it a very refreshing read i was expecting a thriller but instead found myself reading an emotional different story about a group of boys in africa this story is told through the eyes of harry a year 7 boy who decides to solve a murder investigation after a boy his age is stabbed he leaves his safe lifestyle and gradually realises that the world around him isn't like he seemed it goes without saying that this book is very original the word 'hutious' was used quite a bit so i googled it to see what it meant it is ghanian slang for 'frightening and scary' which is specifically used in this novel some words are written as they would be pronounced like 'aswah' for 'i swear' and 'gowayou' for 'go away you' this takes a while to adjust to but it fits in naturally with the rest of the story and shows the difference between cultures i love the main character harri in some ways he reminded me of charlie from the perks of being a wallflower don't be mislead though this is nothing like tpobaw his innocence and naive mind made his character very different from the others personally i think this book is a good example of a modern classic it is very powerful and unique some parts bugged me but i didn't mind that much because it was part of the culture if this book was a clean story with no realistic dialogue it wouldn't have been so vivid for example using the word 'gay' as an insult annoyed me and i would roll my eyes whenever someone used 10 swear words in one sentence but at the same time the book wouldn't have felt real without it if you're planning to read this book i should tell you that i reviewed the young adult version the publisher took a lot of the graphic scenes etc and re vamped it into a teenage book this contained a lot of adult scenes so i can't imagine what the original version is like","381":"another from the booker short list pigeon english is stephen kelman's first novel the book is about harri an 11 year old ghanaian boy living in london harri and his friend are investigating a local murder after seeing the aftermath harri tells us about his life family school the local gangs and other neighbourhood characters he also tells us about his relationship with a pigeon that is his favourite bird this book reminded me a lot of the curious incident of the dog in the night time with the motif of the little boy investigating a crime i've seen people compare it to paddy clark ha ha ha as well and harri's naive observations of life do remind me of that book kelman based this book on an actual case although that's only referred to tangentially in the acknowledgements at the end another very good book i'd probably have this as second to hilary mantell so far","382":"i loved this book i thought it was very affecting i thought it made the reader think how people you may of before judged negatively got to be in their situations a very bleak story that was funny and the protagonist had such a lot of optimism which made it all the more sad in a way a very strong debut novel","383":"hated it","384":" pigeon english is the story of momentous events and small details in the life of a 11 year old ghanaian boy living in a seedy part of london the story is almost entirely narrated by the boy himself the best part of the novel is the sense of the mind of an 11 year old that the author creates the writing style does a great job of seeming like the way children think talk and act the author seems to be very effective at this there is also a murder mystery that is a small part of the book and provides the most satisfying plot thread to the book but is absent from large parts the real problem with the book for me is the large amount of relatively rambling internal monologue from the child this is initially charming but for me eventually devolved to be more just repetitive how much of that do you need to see inside a child's head less than is provided despite this an enjoyable and unusual read and worth the time for the unique experience","385":"this is the story of an 11 year old boy harrison opuku from ghana who is growing up in the projects of london when a black child is murdered by gang violence he becomes a detective to try and find the killer the book is narrated by harri so the story unfolds from his perspective i really liked the book and it has a very powerful ending","386":" pigeon english is the story of harrison an 11 year old originally from ghana now living in a rough part of town in the uk he's surrounded by violence drugs and death but harrison is different to the other kids he has an enthusiasm for life which is really refreshing he likes playing detective jumping in puddles and running as fast as he can interspersed with his play are rather more disturbing revelations like that the stairs of his flat are littered with needles and he interacts daily with members of a gang who steal and terrorise the neighbourhood mixed in with car games is talk of death and fear all the more jarring when told in an 11 year old voice if the language is repetitive that's because harrison is like any 11 year old learning new words trying them on for size he reminisces often about the rest of his family in africa including his young sister and his friends but he's clearly accepted his new life harrison love animals and in fact one of the narrators is an animal a tad bit cheesy but also realistic perhaps harrison is simply finding comfort where he can i don't like happy clappy stories and this had grit while maintaining a sense of hope and youthful optimism throughout a good fast read finished in three days flat the vocabularies a little jarring at first but harrison grows on you i really empathised with his character which made the book for me it's a good story even if it is a bit cheesy in parts","387":" i remember there being lots of hype around pigeon english when it was first published and the things i was hearing reading made me want to read it three years later i have finally picked it up and devoured it there wasn't much of a plot but one wasn't needed pigeon english is voiced by a child in an authentic way and there are words and phrases i remember using in my younger days i found harri to be immensely engaging and i could have easily carried on reading more of his experiences if there were any to be had","388":"good read right balance of humour and realism","389":" a novel with a very strong message yet the telling is very soft innocent and sweet it's like listening to the flapping of the wings of a butterfly the sound it creates is almost inaudible yet its impact can cross oceans this novel was one of the 5 shortlisted novels for booker 2011 but in the final deliberation lost to julian barnes' the sense of an ending but in my humble opinion this is better probably the reason why it went to barnes was this is stephen kelman's first novel while julian barnes has already been shortlisted twice but lost in 2005 his arthur and george lost to john banville's the sea and in 1998 england england lost to ian mc ewan's amsterdam but don't get me wrong i also like the sense of an ending 4 0 stars but i think pigeon english is better 4 5 stars it's just that there is no half point here in goodreads or maybe what made this novel more significant for me was the fact that while reading i thought of the struggles of many filipino children who were brought by their parents overseas from familiar and friendly surroundings these children were uprooted and transplanted in a foreign usually harsh soil new surroundings culture and friends i did not experience this myself but two of my siblings - when they were young adults - went to live in north america to try their luck i heard bits and pieces of their adventures victories and frustrations mostly frustrations and disillusions i could not imagine had they've been children i would have been more difficult that is the situation of harrison \"harri\" opoku the 11 y o ghanaian boy who goes to live in a housing settlement in london together with his mother and elder sister lydia due to poverty they have to leave ghana where his father grandmother and a newborn baby agnes remain one day harri sees a dead body of a classmate who has been murdered he and his friend dean decide to find out who the killer is because of the gift prizes that will be given to anybody who can provide clue to the killing harri is the first person narrator for most parts except for those that are spoken by the pigeon that visits him on their flat located on the 9th floor while i admired the purity and ebullience of harri's narration i was amazed on how kelman handled the parts of the narrative by the pigeon especially those with open and close quotes kelman's approach is fresh and inventive playful and spontaneous the pigeon has its own voice that provides contrast to that of harri's the ending is unexpected my jaw literally dropped reading the last page i was a bit bored reading the childish antics of harri and was about to get tired of the pidgin english that's one way to interpret the title of the book with ghanaian english words like asweh i swear hutious scary gowayou go away bo styles choke etc however kelman managed to keep the plot interesting by slowly revealing the identity of the killer and peppering it with the usual coming of age experiences of a boy like sexual awakening and the sentimentality of first love think of an extended version of the child frank mccourt in angela's ashes minus the infected eyes and the stinking river or an older version of the little boy in emma donoghue's 2010 booker shortlisted room minus the escape scene overall a memorable read kelman is an author to watch i was only confused for a while because there is also another kelman james kelman the author of how late it was how late and kieron smith boy i also read and liked the later but still i think this book is better i am looking forward to this book's inclusion to the 2012 edition of 1001 books you must read before you die this deserves to be there","390":"i didn't expect to like this book as i don't normally read this genre but it was very good the narrative style was excellent and the ending explosive short but thought provoking","391":"what a book the ending just made me burst out crying contrary to some other reviews i actually loved the pigeon better review soon","392":"harrison is eleven years old and the fastest kid in his class he needs the speed to elude the gangs operating around the highrise flats where harri lives with his mother and sister his father and baby sister are still in ghana harri is an exuberant curious streetwise boy with an attitude to life that's both buoyant and endearing he befriends a pigeon who becomes a character in the book harri's talks with the bird are often funny the author uses the vernacular of inner city boys living at the edge so the language is raw provocative and not for the faint of heart a tale both uplifting and deeply sad","393":"i'll be discussing this at my first ever book club in a couple of weeks excited i loved it harri was a wonderful character and the writing style from his pov allowed us to see his naivety and also his growing awareness of the situation around him the story felt so real and was told so well i didn't give it 5 stars because i wasn't a big fan of the pigeon as co narrator thing it didn't add anything to the book for me","394":" pigeon english by stephen kelman house of anansi press in his auspicious debut novel pigeon english stephen kelman catches us unawares drawing us into the chaotic and compelling world of harrison opoku eleven year old harri has emigrated from ghana with his mother and older sister to the mean streets of east london a neighborhood that has been grinding down immigrants for hundreds of years stephen kelman an unemployed 33 year old sent his manuscript on spec to a few agents more in hope than expectation he quickly found one and this book became the subject of a bidding war between twelve of the uk's top publishers it's clear why in harri kelman has created an endearing character at once foreign yet familiar written in the first person we experience harri's life through his own eyes and words thanks to kelman's use of highly inventive language in the beginning however it helps to sound out some of the words while others can only be defined with the help of a ghanaian english dictionary \"asweh he's hutious \" translation i swear he's frightening as all immigrants do the truncated opoku family harri's dad baby sister and grandmother are expected to follow someday have come to a new world seeking a better life what they find however is the same old world order - bullies betrayal and brutality - dressed in the guise of something better it is a world where harri's aunt burns her fingertips so if \"...the police catch her they can't send her away \" in this madness harri's church going hard working mother struggles to earn money as a midwife and keep her brood protected in any way she can while saving for the day the family is reunited there is an irrepressible joy in harri on the cusp of becoming a good man but still young enough to be oblivious to how perilous is his world something his older sister has already discovered every corner turned presents a quandary for harri in his new home as he races between danger and safety although the second fastest boy in year 7 harri can't always outrun his reality a friend can turn foe in the blink of a bird's eye harri welcomes a pigeon onto his balcony and into his heart the pigeon is also harri's somewhat inept guardian angel who does what he can to protect his charge but both he and harri are plagued by bullies the pigeon by vicious magpies and harri by the dell farm crew led by the brutal x fire each gang bent on beating them into submission as the book's begins a school boy who harri much admired for his basketball skills is dead apparently killed for his lunch harri and his friend dean employing a sleuthing style learned from the csi series \"they're the top detectives in america...\" undertake to uncover the murderer collecting fingerprints tracking suspects and eventually confronting the killer is elegantly counterbalanced by harri's budding romance with poppy his classmate harri is a hero for all ages his heart is filled with dreams of being a superhero and the fastest in year 7 flight is his protection \"just wanted to get away before the dying caught us \" he tells us his curiosity is what drives him to discover although what he finds is harsh reality like when he lifts the carpet looking for money only to find the words 'fuck you' scratched into the wood \"i don't think the greeting was for me \" he surmises \"nobody even knew i was coming \"","395":"probably the most annoying book ive ever read","396":" enjoyed this book loved the storytelling from the viewpoint of an 11 year old ghanian boy harrison that recently immigrated i got the impression illegally but could be wrong to london with his mother and older sister leaving his father grandmother and baby sister behind they live in a housing project and the story is just about the daily happenings in his life in an inner city environment both the good and the bad the story is funny especially with the use of the terms advise yourself dope fine bo styles and donkey hours heartwarming harri's relationship with his sisters friends and pigeon and saddening experiences with violence and crime","397":"adult fiction alternative narrator 11 year old boy urban crime tragedy harri's family comes from ghana they now live in britain illegally and face various challenges in their new neighborhood","398":"this book is full of innocence and takes you back to your childhood when you believed that anything is possible heartbreaking yet full of hope at the same time","399":"ooooush emotional this one thrilling read very believable and terrifyingly haunting highly recommend","400":"how on earth did this get onto the booker prize shortlist i found the writing irritating and who on earth has a pigeon contributing to the story it's just not a good book i couldn't really be bothered to keep reading it but it's big writing and not very long so i made myself finish not sure it was worth it","401":"the ending was the best part of the book the narrative slipped in a couple places and was distracting to the story","402":"i like a book that plays with language you might want to start by having a quick look through the glossary before reading the narration by an 11 year old was a bit aggravating to start but i was feeling the love for him midway through love for him and all the vulnerable people and animals yes pigeons trying to eke out a life in this world","403":"brilliant insightful and appalling sad read it and understand a bit more about being a child in inner city london","404":"it definitely reminded me of the 'room' and 'the curious case of dog in the night time' although i didn't really fall in love with the protagonist here i usually love a child narrator but here the innocence was lost it got repetitive and also little boring in the middle i am not saying i disliked the book i expected little more from it considering this was shortlisted for booker prize","405":"absolutely amazing read should be read by all 15 year olds as part of a school curriculum","406":"a 2011 booker short list title i found this book heartbreakingly beautiful","407":"i ended up liking it much more than i thought i would the further i got the more i really liked it especially his language 'it was vexing ' definetely worth a read","408":"eerrrrr different init not my cup of tea very strange ending and loads of slang words i personally would not recommend this book","409":"so much indoctrinated toxic masculinity uuuugh","410":"about young boy from african family living on an estate in london surrounding by gangs etc told from his point of view in his words mix of london slang and african words really liked the book but really didnt like the ending","411":"very funny and very sad","412":"see full review at www theliterarylollipop wordpress com","413":"oh my god this book is amazing funny intelligent incredibly well narrated emotionally spot on and the ending hits like a sucker punch","414":" good so far harrison is a recent immigrant from west africa who is going to school in london he has no race issues his friends at school are from all sorts of places sometimes even england the rest of society has other ideas and that's before you get the gangs who control parts of the school and the housing estates and the pigeon with which young harrison strikes up an unlikely rapport it's a portrayal of a sometimes grim world of the outer suburbs but is also very funny and the indomitable harri and his friends are a memorable creation critical reaction to this which is after all a book about a black boy by a white man has much used the phrase 'middle class' which can only be used disparagingly though some of the reactions involve the 'horror' of harri's world probably from those in whose lives there is no danger i can't imagine that in fact isn't everywhere dangerous even ostensibly safe areas can't any shadow hide sudden violence for example braintree what's that all about then one night it really kicked off and in the morning when the police and the locals came to have a look at the damage they found a brain in a tree so the town was thereafter known as braintree","415":"having read many of the reviews below strikes me that perhaps this story doesn't translate so well across the pond it has been a hit read amongst teens and teachers i am the latter who have been able to identify so closely with harrison and his peers also as this book is ultimately a tribute to damilola taylor anyone who knows about him and his family can't fail to be moved by pigeon english","416":"okay i can't say it wasn't predictable but it was also really quite good and really quite heartbreaking it's the kind of book where you see the end coming from a mile away but rather than dismissing it as predictable you spend the next 200 pages racing through the book and hoping against common sense that you are wrong i could have done without the whole pigeon thing i generally enjoy unique perspectives but in this book it felt kind of forced and unnecessary the protagonist voice was so well written so consistent and sweet that i didn't really need the pigeon vignettes other than that though it was a really enjoyable read engaging and heartwrenching and well worth the read","417":"i enjoyed this book harrison is an engaging narrator i wasn't convinced by the pigeon bits and it was a little slight overall it's booker longlisted but i wouldn't bet on it making the shortlist although it ranks ok within the five i have read so far","418":"this book is about a little boy from a london council estate who tries to solve a murder so i was always going to like it but it turned out to be even better than i was expecting it to be it's both beautiful and extremely funny a tour de force that delighted me and broke my heart harrison's voice is just perfect i had to keep reading out bits of his narration to anyone who would listen or just to myself because they were so brilliant i loved this","419":"newly arrived from ghana with his mother and older sister 11 year old harri lives on the ninth floor of a block of flats in an inner city housing estate when a local boy is stabbed to death harri and his friends turn detective and try to find the murderer pigeon english ticks off two of my favourite things in books cultures clashing and a narrative through the eyes of an innocent child this is such a fantastic book it made me laugh out loud several times and the main character is absolutely adorable but this book also has depths and layers to it and i'd like to read it again in the future it is a little bit tragic and heart breaking too recommended","420":"this book is brilliant i wasn't to sure if i would enjoy reading the story from the point of view of an 11 year old but it works really well this books really made me laugh and reminded me of my school days i just thought it was an excellent read and very reflecting of the young society in london these days","421":"i liked this book and completely fell in love with the narrator it's impossible not to but wasn't as blown away by it as i was expecting to be however it is a good portrait of how hard life can be for kids growing up in this part of london and it was interesting to see what this 11 year old boy and his sister encountered every day some of the problems were very normal and some were more than any kid should have to deal with","422":" this is a book like no other i have ever read it haunts me still i enjoyed the fun side and getting into the mind of a boy from ghana starting a new life in the poorer part of london with his sister and his mother he makes friends easily the family are good kind respectful and fear their god i read about the experiences he had from his point of view all exciting and all portrayed through an innocent's eyes fascinating i can't give too much of my feelings on the book away without spoiling people have told me they found this book hard to read it doesn't take long to get it they way it's written it is a beautiful perspective and style give it a try it will blow your mind wide open","423":"great book but sad","424":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was such a sad story though the ending was inevitable it was so well written i was shocked and really saddened stephen kelman write so well from the point of view of the child i would recommend this book and feel it would make a good novel for high school pupils to study","425":"once you get over the 'voice' of the boy it was great not sure if i really believed he was in secondary school more like a junior age child","426":" i was torn between 4 and 5 stars and actually allowed myself some time and thought before i made my final decision from the beginning i found the protagonist and primary narrator harri to be completely endearing i thoroughly enjoyed the view into his innocence and exploration as an 11 year old boy coming of age i was completely entertained with his pidgin english although without the benefit of a glossary made ongoing and sometimes hilarious in their own right mistakes in translation the book deftly remains in voice as the author never faltered in his ability to speak like an 11 yr old very often books with this age narrator are not consistent in their presentation of developmental issues or verbiage when the narrator is young but this book never missteps in this arena and is actually quite superb in its management of speech and behavior as reflected by the narrator's age there were several plot details that confused me and which i thought were ill placed but they did not detract me from my love of harri or my need to find out his fate the singularly disappointing point regardless of its authenticity was the ending which surprised and horrified me nonetheless i finally decided that i had that reaction because of my care for the boy which was a testament to the writing so i sided with 5 stars and not 4 certainly not without some issues i'm afraid i really did not care for the brief periods of narration by the pigeon but i did appreciate the novelty for which the author was seeking overall a quick read that had me hooked","427":"a child narrator is so hard to do well and for me this didn't make the cut not to mention that the pigeon interludes struck me as weird","428":" this is written in a mixture of london street slang and ghanaian expressions and i found myself reading it in a heavily accented voice asweh for this among other reasons the novel instantly seems authentic the author himself grew up on a similar estate and has been widely praised for his ability to speak as an 11 year old would however there is a downside to this book and that is the pigeon at times it seems that the pigeon believed by harri to be watching over him is merely there to justify the book's title apparently the bird is significant as it is supposed to represent the need to belong and the migratory nature of humans this all seems a bit too worthy for my liking there are even some passages narrated by said pigeon which i just don't get","429":"my rating is more like 2 5 stars but i rounded up because i did like the narrator's voice and observations other than that the plot was too boring to sustain my interest and the ending was the final nail in the coffin for me not that all endings need to be happy or pleasant even but this one was unnecessary for lack of a better word without totally spoiling it i don't think first person narratives lend themselves to the type of ending that this was i don't think they work anyway i feel like novel sounds far more interesting than it actually is this is the first book that i have read in a while that i had to force myself to read","430":" harrison was an endearing narrator and possibly the only reason i kept reading harrison's take on his new immigrant life is charming gritty london council estate living mapped onto the rose tinted memories and beliefs of his ghanaian lifeworld however the plot leaves much to be desired i simply could not maintain an interest in the murder or his delinquent contemporaries alcoholics dealers criminals and teenage gang members threatening to 'chook' one another in my opinion that was kelman's failing his indulgent writing of harri leaving little room for the reader to sympathise with any other characters i didn't take to his family or his friends their presence in the novel almost too flawed and harri too engaging i do love a good immigrant novel but was left rather disappointed by this","431":" i won this on goodreads wow where to start pigeon english is told from harri's an eleven year old boy perspective part of his family moved to london from ghana into a high rise apartment building harri tells his story to his pigeon and his pigeon answers back in his head harrie tells the pigeon about the body laying in the street the times he's tested by the dfc gang his sister lydia and her friend his conversations with his papa and sister agnes and about poppy all of this builds while he and dean are investigating the death of the boy he knew and the ending completely blew me away kelman has written a very daring story filled with the reality of living in the projects and has done a fantastic job of making the story ring true i noticed in other reviews that there was a guide to the language at the back of their books which would have helped me while trying to get use to the language that harri invented other than that it was a great read and i would definitely recommend to others","432":"ho ly cow is this book saaaaaad but great","433":" a bit tedious at times too long but amazingly vibrant story i loved being privy to harri's world the teacher in me was left with an aching heart at the end i wanted to protect harri and his creative innocence as long as i could i was impressed when i realized 40 pages in that the author was not a ghana native himself but a white briton the voice stephen kelman was able to imbue into this boy's narration was very powerful that's some skill i'll be interested to read other works from him","434":"'asweh' this book was 'hutious'","435":"just couldn't get into this novel in the first 50 pages i liked some of the books it has been compared to but it didn't move fast enough to capture my interest and the eccentric language of the narrator did not settle well with my aesthetic i hope to return to it one day and try it again","436":" i read this in one day i liked it but as stories go it wasn't the most imaginable i think the best thing was the way kelman manages to adopt the voice of both an 11 year old boy and a pigeon so coleverly the pigeon narration is quite funny and defeintely breask up the tragedy of the book harri is engaging lively and interesting if you like faux detectives dogs and school stories the ending is unforgettable no spoilers but i am not sure much else about this book are good for passing the time though","437":"told from the point of view of a year 7 schoolboy who's also recently emigrated from ghana and who lives in a highrise estate when a neighborhood boy is murdered harrison decides to investigate the crime himself really gives a feeling for the dangers of london's poor neighborhoods and harri is an ebullient and sweet narrator","438":"i think it was boring and full of blah blah full review","439":"it's hard to believe that this is the writer's first book asweh it's amazing this book will make you laugh out loud stephen kelman writes from a child's point of view so brilliantly you wouldn't even for once think it's not really a child who's telling the story asweh means i swear and it's used by harrison a lot","440":"wonderful book written as though straight from a an 11 year old's mind it jumps about in the way children do when they tell you a story expecting that you know everything that they do stark reality of life as a new kid on the block in london the hierarchies aspirations and expectations of school social life and his new friend the pigeon you know what must come and it does sadly","441":"this is one of those adult books from the point of view of a child i couldn't help but get the feeling that it's like skellig or something something you get from the school library this feeling increased towards the end as the pigeon became more significant to the story it's not a bad book at any rate it has a likeable main character with his own idiolect sequences that remind me of being young and things like that the ending would usually be seen as a copout but it fits the context it made me wonder when was the last time i read a book where no one had died recommendable anyway","442":" the child's voice is believable the intrigue gets you hooked but there are moments in the book that feel like they could have made it more award worthy perhaps sometimes the pacing seems a little odd there is a much slower pace through most of the book that quickens really rapidly at the end and it doesn't feel smooth the pigeon also doesn't have a consistent voice throughout the book perhaps that's intentional which made it sort of odd too however it was a compelling book with a whammo ending","443":" i loved pigeon english it's a compelling upsetting tale about harrison a young boy from ghana growing up on a council estate in london almost from page one the story of harri reminds you of the real life story of damilola taylor harri's beautifully innocent child's view of his new world is challenged by the fatal stabbing of a boy that he sort of knew outside his local chicken shop harri's reaction to this event is to play detective and find out who carried out the stabbing but his clumsy investigation gets him close to the truth and into trouble himself kelman contrasts harrison's innocence with the fairly terrifying surroundings in which he is living and in danger of getting sucked into what i liked most about this book is the way it's told in the first person like emma donohue's excellent 'room' in unique and childlike language harri is fond of showing that he's learning the rules creating lists to demonstrate he knows what's what and desperately wants to be part of the in crowd turning his cheap trainers into adidas lookalikes with a marker pen and talking the talk however while he is fully aware of the gang activity going on around him and the dangers it presents he is still quite naive and too willing to believe everything he is told the only thing stopping me giving this book five stars was that i wasn't so sure about the short sections narrated by a pigeon or the pigeon's role in the plot was it a guardian angel you just don't know they weren't big enough to let the story down but likewise i didn't think they added much and seemed a bit gimmicky at times i felt harri's innocence was perhaps a bit too overdone too but ultimately it was just about credible as a boy who had grown up in a society very different from the one in which he was transplanted to overall i really enjoyed the book and the ending left me with a lump in my throat it's well worth a read and i can't wait to see what kelman writes next","444":"devastatingly sad and very current with london's riots last year also written really well like a real ten year old kid's perspective","445":"truly wonderful read during the current bout of london riots this is a book that screams of home and answers many questions how kelman manages to speak the voice of london ghana and youth with such charm is a mystery this story tells a new perspective following damilola taylors death and does so with remarkably little prejudice","446":" pigeon english is the story of harri an 11 year old boy from ghana who has recently moved into the ghettos of england harri quickly learns the rules of the street dictated by the young local gangs who run them and the colorful characters who surround him filled with local slang harri leads the reader through the story of a young boy who gets chooked on his street and harri takes it upon himself to find the killer pigeon english balances serious subject matter with lighthearted childhood misconceptions through the eyes of an 11 year old who is torn between doing the right thing and doing what he must to survive","447":"annoyingly slow and predictable","448":"this was one of those books that you could tell it was well written and should be engaging but somehow couldn't become engaged by it i think i'll eventually read this book again because the end was a shock and instantly made me disappointed i hadn't been more absorbed by the lead character i think part of the problem when reading this was i was mostly picking it up when i was too tired before bed or for short periods on the train i will give this another go because it definitely seemed worthy of more stars and more of my attention i feel really guilty giving this book only two stars when i compare it to the other books i gave two stars to","449":"an interesting portrayal of youth violence the ending will leave you disappointed sad make you tremble and leave you moved","450":" the book is written incredibly well in the perspective of harrison it's what you'd expect an 11 year old to be thinking and acting but with a mix of cultures makes it even more diverse you know what's going to happen although not in an 'oh that's so predictable ' kind of way but you just hope it won't you hope something will happen however like the people in novel we do nothing but read on only hoping it makes you wonder why they don't do anything but then you realise that you would probably do the same thing this novel is thought provoking funny cute and addresses important issues about life today definitely a favourite","451":"this book has a good basic story a d concept but i felt the author could have done much more i found the ending predictable and boring and i really disliked the pigeon talking i'm still a bit confused why that was even in the book","452":"what a fantastic book so sweet and easy to read some parts can put a smile on your face and other parts are really sad didnt realise the damilola taylor connection until i read the acknowlements right at the end and then it all seems just to true esp the wall of silence in the book so sad","453":"strongly moved by this book the kid's voice was so believable you need humour to get through subject matter like this and the touch was just right recommend it","454":" i picked this book up at an airport this afternoon and had it read by the time the plane landed i couldn't put it down the voice of the main character harrison was so engaging full of innocence humor enthusiasm and childlike compassion the story is set in england in filthy tenement houses that are filled with violence the violence almost becomes its own character in how it influences story and character development it is a way of viewing the world and also a tool for surviving it after reading pigeon english i couldn't help but question the role of violence in our society which i think is a powerful aspect of the book one of the reasons i was initially drawn to the book was the cover's comparison between pigeon english and the curious incident of the dog in the night time the voicings of the protagonists are similar but i felt that the issue of violence and the plight of the poor immigrant which dominated the book made it more similar to little bee by chris cleve or the girl who fell from the sky by heidi durrow it even reminded me of andre dubus iii's recent memoir townie particularly knowing that the events were based on the true story of a young nigerian boy named damilola taylor it isn't a book i would recommend to everyone kelman vividly captures the filth of tenement living from the language to the stairwells filled with urine and used needles it feels very real throughout never indulgent or titillating but the content can be disturbing at times","455":"this book was really moving and well written i know the environment that the characters lived in and it was very true to life lots of humour and written with humility loved the book","456":"funny sad brutal sweet and a punch in the face for finishing","457":"4 5 harsh times for harri with dad and baby sister back in ghana and mum and big sister in a london tower block i had to ask myself who was better off aunty down the road doesn't fare too well either the narrative shows a kid one minute getting all excited about a rc car then living life in a really gritty adult before your time reality and this is the crux of the writing i went from being intrigued to feeling a slight disappointment after the curious incident room references i suppose i can see it but to gunning for this kid loved the language and the tilt of it original and soul grabbing","458":"hhmmm funny at times and quite sad but i really couldn't wait for the end not the most gripping of books sorry","459":"very good initially after 150 pages nothing had happened so i gave up","460":"after what i thought was a good start it got repetitive and forced don't bother only the second book i didn't completely finish","461":"good story and telling tho did not appreciate the pigeon's interjections good ending","462":" and the reason this has been nominated for the mann booker award is a good concept gone totally wrong i have to say that i have never been a fan of a child narrator i think it takes an especially gifted author to speak authentically as a child unless that author is a child himself i didn't care for the absolute jumpiness of the story written as though the narrator was on something and in somewhat hyper text pieces that were interjected the characters did not appeal to me and although i am sure mr kelman tried to make them real they just seemed like a cutout of the typical middle schooler of today the gist of the story seems to get lost quite a bit as the kids name call use the word hutious ad infiitum and adore the usage of four letter words i realize that these elements are like rites of passage for young people these days but it just did not ring true nor endear the characters to this reader and so why the sort list for this book is my question as a former teacher of adolescents i honestly believe my former students would have done a better job telling this story","463":"i really liked this book you really did feel like you were in harri's head everything felt real even though i have not experienced anything like that before the one bit i didnt like was the voice of the pigeon i am sure it was meant to mean something but i dont think it worked","464":"i suppose it is meant to be cute the world seen through the eyes of this little boy from ghana living in a london tenement even the ghetto speak tries to be quaint despite the pink spectacles the author is wearing the kid has absolutely no sense of right or wrong and you know he will grow up to be a thug i did not find any of it endearing","465":" prepare to fall in love harrison opuku bursts off the page and into the reader's heart harri is eleven a recent immigrant from ghana he is now living in england with his mother and sister his father grandmother and baby sister left behind until the family can afford for them to come also living in the projects harri is amazed at all the new things he sees the subway is an amazing item that he can't quite believe work he thinks it is bo styles the word for the ultimate cool he is thrilled by remote control cars cell phones and new trainers harri's best skill is his running no one can catch him when he runs he is the kind of boy who is open to all experiences taking them in and finding the good in everything around him harri tends to like everyone even the pigeons who flock around the housing projects occasionally getting inside where others see a mess that should be cleared away harri sees a friend but not everything is positive in harri's world gangs abound and as a newcomer he is tested for inclusion daily life is full of insults and casual violence and harri is sometimes tempted by these acts worst of all a boy who is the star of the basketball court is murdered on the streets the motive no one knows for sure maybe even just for his dinner harri and his friend dean decide that they will find the killer full of facts gained from csi shows they attempt to lift fingerprints and find dna sure that they can find the culprit and bring him to justice stephen kelman has created a character that readers will not soon forget the language is spot on for a child growing up in modern england in the housing projects the language is sometimes rough and the facts that are commonplace knowledge breathtaking but through it all the sweetness of harri's personality shines through kelman himself grew up in the housing projects of england and worked as a careworker a warehouse operative in marketing and in local government administration before focusing on writing pigeon english has been nominated for the booker prize and readers will not be surprised by that fact this is a stunning excellent book the fact that it is a debut novel is almost unimaginable this book is recommended for all readers","466":"i liked the book in general i got a bit bored of the kid's voice and train of thought thing that went on relentlessy i saw no use at all for the pigeon's interruptions added nothing in my opinion i thought though that the whole book felt very real i can easily imagine the kids the gangs the schools the grinding poverty and relentless depressing scenery","467":"asweh this book was amazing harri is sweet and funny and heartbreakingly innocent if you enjoyed room or the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime you'll love pigeon english","468":"i liked the book anyway in my opinion it gives a good account of a young boy living in london and all the hopes and fears he comes across well worth a read","469":"this book is awesome i wanted to start reading it over again when i finished this is a bittersweet story told through the eyes of an eleven year old boy he is a new immigrant to london who is on the verge of adolescence and is way over his head in his interactions with a street gang harri has an authentic voice which is slightly naive and immaginative which makes the social comment very powerful","470":"the story is really funny","471":"oh it was good i laughed out loud a lot but it was sad i totally wasn't prepared for the ending though i knew it had to be kind of abrupt considering how the book was structured this is one of the books where i thought it'd be really serious and literary and grimdark and actually it's just very cute with dark currents of course and sad serious stuff but the main character is so cute and good hearted ohhhhh i am sad about the ending now","472":"newly arrived from ghana with his mother and older sister eleven year old harrison opoku lives on the ninth floor of a block of flats on an inner city housing estate the second best runner in the whole of year 7 harri races through his new life in his personalised trainers the adidas stripes drawn on with marker pen blissfully unaware of the very real threat all around him with equal fascination for the local gang the dell farm crew and the pigeon who visits his balcony harri absorbs the many strange elements of his new life in england watching listening and learning the tricks of inner city survival but when a boy is knifed to death on the high street and a police appeal for witnesses draws only silence harri decides to start a murder investigation of his own in doing so he unwittingly endangers the fragile web his mother has spun around her family to try and keep them safe a story of innocence and experience hope and harsh reality pigeon english is a spellbinding portrayal of a boy balancing on the edge of manhood and of the forces around him that try to shape the way he falls","473":"i just couldn't get on with this book the 11 year old voice seemed contrived to me and although it sounded real and convincing i found i had little interest in knowing what happened next and felt unmoved throughout very sorry as i feel it's a good book and a story well told","474":"loved pigeon english started on the first page and couldnt put it down had to google some of the slang and african language that was used in it i actually brought it to my brothers friends house and sat downstairs till i just had to finish thanks for the great suggestion greta this is why i love goodreads","475":"one of my favourite books loved it","476":"i just hated this book another story written from a child's perspective been there i have read this same story so many times nothing new brought to the table and i didn't understand the talking crow at all","477":" harrison opuku and his mother and sister lydia are recent immigrants from ghana to a housing project in london when an older boy is murdered in the neighborhood and the police have no leads harri and his friend decide to investigate the death using techniques picked up from television shows such as csi harri's world is filled with threats of violence from the dell farm crew a local gang his attempts to stay out of the trouble that is so easy to find in london his dreams of being the fastest boy in 7th year and his imaginary friendship with the pigeon that finds its way into their apartment i understand that the book is called pigeon english both because harri speaks using a lot of ghanean slang and because of his connection with the pigeon in the book the story was a little disconnected the author tried to address too many elements and it just felt like they all got short shrift his relationship to the pigeon his burgeoning awareness of the opposite sex innoncent with his girlfriend not so innocent with lydia's friend the gang violence his father grandmother and baby sister still in ghana his aunt and her burnt fingerprints and itchy feet harri is a fully formed character but the mystery and his attempts to solve it were clouded by all of these other significant plot points and nothing is given full measure","478":"pigeon english by stephen kelman is the story of a young boy newly arrived from ghana with his mother and older sister making his way through the mean streets of london eleven year old harrison opatu is filled with gusto for life for language for experiences of all kinds he is filled with the magic of childhood his relationship with his sister lydia feels real and authentic his mother is trying her best to support her children as a nurse while keeping them safe and instilling good values in a world full of violence harrison finds the dead body of a friend knifings are increasing in this neighborhood he and his friends decide to use all the knowledge they have gained from television and shared misunderstandings to solve the case the book is filled with energy explosively light and dark by turns as harrison struggles his way through the school year mixing childhood play with adult struggles that he cannot begin to really understand i was not fond of the conceit of the pigeon the title is a play on the immigrant dialect as well as the observing pigeon friend of harri's who gives a more removed i refuse to write bird's eye view of harri's world and i found that the book began strong but became repetitive in tone by the last third as much as i loved harri and he is what i loved best about the story about 2 3 of the way through i began to wish that this rather short book was a little shorter i also felt that the story was a little bit of a screen to educate the reader on the effect of poverty and violence on children and their families which weakened the overall power of the book but i very much enjoyed this book even with these flaws i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 who is drawn to child narrators who are forced too soon to precariously balance naivete and worldliness","479":"i feel like i missed something with this so have every intention of re visiting it i found the language quite difficult to get used to","480":"i found myself unsettled by this book written in the words of harri an 11 year old boy from ghana living in a london council estate it reads like a young adult book but alludes to very adult themes which harri observes and describes but doesn't himself understand the juxtaposition of seeing things through harri's eyes and an understanding of the real world in which harri exists just didn't jell for me","481":"loved it touching the boy's voice was haunting a child's innocence scarred by the violent world he lived stephen kelman is very talented no doubt about it waiting for his next","482":"i recommended this book for accra book club partly because it did get very good reviews in the uk and was shortlisted for the booker prize in 2011 i was also intrigued as the main character is an eleven year old ghanaian boy harrison opoku who recently moved to the uk with his mother and sister","483":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here perfectly readable the voice of harrison and his funny little expressions was perfectly charming and the way the writer had him telling the story with things going on that harri wasn't aware of was quite cleverly done however i was disappointed by the ending not for the more obvious reason that it ends with the protaganist's death but because it seemed quite obvious and the message of the book innocent young boy gradually caught up in the dark underbelly of urban life who ultimately dies perfectly readable the voice of harrison and his funny little expressions was perfectly charming and the way the writer had him telling the story with things going on that harri wasn't aware of was quite cleverly done however i was disappointed by the ending not for the more obvious reason that it ends with the protaganist's death but because it seemed quite obvious and the message of the book innocent young boy gradually caught up in the dark underbelly of urban life who ultimately dies but experiences some happiness before he does so just seemed a bit obvious i was touched more emotionally by the happy and funny moments than by the sad and scary ones more","484":"interesting read i found myself wondering where this took place in london i was waiting for a bus one day in an area close to my home that i pictured as the location of this book i had never really realized how many council housing projects there are in london while the area i was in was certainly not where the events of this book took place it was much worse it made me more aware of the trials and tribulations of those in a poor neighborhood written a bit goofy as a pigeon actually has a narrative didn't like the ending","485":"asweh this is even getting on my nerves already and i am only a few pages through","486":"a sobering view of gangland london through the eyes of an 11 year old ghanaian recent immigrant made even more chilling by the fact that it's based on a real life stabbing of a young boy on a housing estate in london the narrator is a typical 11 year old boy funny and rightly concerned with the minutiae of daily life like sneaker brands girls and remote control cars the background of violence gang culture racial unrest and poverty is terrifying and especially unsettling in the wake of the recent london riots i admired this book and hope it does well in the man booker awards for which it is longlisted but i cannot confess to really enjoying it the narrator harri is sweet and funny but the constant threat of violence makes for a disturbing read","487":"kind of interesting but in all honesty and i know it had fantastic reviews and so on i found it to be a bit patronising to the main characters and rather superficial sorry","488":"i sincerely wish that the author had thought to add a glossary of the various slang terms that he saw fit to use throughout the book half my time was spent trying to figure out what most of the words meant the book is written through the point of view of an eleven year old ghanian who has to deal with the shock of immigration the violent killing of a young boy gangs as well as poverty urban grime and casual violence is juxtaposed exquisitely by ordinary family live loves and traditions the title is connected to a specific pigeon which harry the main character befriends and who he believes watches over him the book was shortlisted for the 2011 man booker prize and redeems itself by the depth and intensity of the emotions that harry has to suffer through not an easy read","489":" writing like a child isn't good enough you have to write like an interesting child writing like a foreigner isn't good enough you have to write like an interesting foreigner writing about every thought that pops into your protagonist's head isn't good enough you have to separate the poetry from the pointless and arrange it in a way that says something beautifully it seemed that the author was trying to create the next angela's ashes the next extremely loud u0026amp incredibly close the next curious incident of the dog in the night time but he obviously did not understand what made those books great","490":"this book another booker long lister left me cold the trick of narrating in the voice of this young uneducated slum boy wore thin very quickly and made it impossible to really care about him it is rightly compared to room another weird and popular book i couldn't enjoy the voice of the pigeon was an interesting twist and would have been much more effective i think had the voice of the boy been more comprehensible and true","491":"i have to admit at first i didn't like this book at all the main character was not at all likeable to me and the majority of the other characters were somewhat annoying however i just kept reading after the middle of the book it became more interesting and the end was kind of a surprise","492":" this book is told by a young 9 or 10 year old boy who's mother moved his older sister and him from ghana to london in search of a better life for them they are living in the projects and this story tells from his child point of view his story of living in such a difficult situation the book is both facinating and heartbreaking for me it falls into that catagory of books where it took me a long time to read it because the subject was hard but i couldn't give up on it either i was disapointed by the ending but mostly because it was sad not because it wasn't well written it was kinda a what is the what meets pi's life in the projects","493":"it was not really what i expected i thought it would be more about cross cultural conflict but it was more about the violence and investigation of the murder of a boy in the neighbourhood","494":"its one of those books that well doesn't really grab you","495":"yesterday i bought a book it was called pigeon english it only cost 50p from the cancer shop i don't think it has cancer though i bought it because the cover was bo styles there was also a bit about an award book cover 'shortlisted for the man booker award 2011' i read it right after i bought it it was on the train the train takes one hour and twenty minutes to get to waterloo and then i was on the bus and then another bus and all the time i read this book it was pretty good it was all about a kid named harri harri lives in the council towers in london he is from ghana he moved to england with his mother and his sister lydia his father his grandma and the baby stayed behind in england harri makes a lot of friends i liked them i wish the book was about them he also has a pigeon he rescued it and then he sees it all the time sometimes the pigeon talks to him pigeon 'i see you harri ' he only says this in harri's head the letters are all slanted on these bits we learned at school they are called 'italics' i think maybe they come from italy these bits are stupid everyone agrees it's like the pigeon is a guardian angel or a messenger from god asweh it's the craziest thing you ever saw the rest of the book is harri talking except the name on the cover is stephen kelman not harrison opuku so i think it might be fake or maybe he's using a different name to hide from the killers they do that on detective shows sometimes it doesn't work the killers find them anyway and kill them there's a dead boy in this story harri and his friend dean are trying to find out who killed him they do proper detective work and everything anyway not much goes on in this book the cover letters say it's about important things but it's not it's just kind of the story of harri's life then on the last page something hutious happens but then it's the last page until then it's just about this boy it's strange it's actually kind of like a film i saw once there was this kid and he also lived in the tower blocks but it was in brazil and he was a good kid but he knew all the killers just like harri only he was older it was called 'city of god' or something so if you liked that read this book the writing is also weird it's all jumbled and the sentences are short it makes you go red eyes and want to throw the book out the window at first then it starts working it really drags you in then it's like the person writing can't write except he can the pigeon bits are full of big words that make no sense they look pretty though all big and full of letters what i learned from reading 'pigeon english' you can be shortlisted for the man booker even if your book is not about important stuff and kind of just about a kid's life as long as he is poor or lives in a council block or both some people can make bad writing work it's never a good idea to try and write as a pigeon also don't make the pigeon a messenger for god supporting characters make books better especially if they are good i give this book 3 5 out of 5 stars i see him now writing his book review convinced his opinion has any bearing on the great scheme of things you all amuse me you try so hard to have a say and for what in the end your lifetimes will be spurious wisps of cloud in the boss's everlasting sky i beat my wings and fly away i have a kid in london i need to go shit on","496":"i liked this book somewhat disturbing to envisage children in this environment however found this book funny and ultimately sad would recommend","497":"even thought i only gave it 3 stars i truly recommend this book it is easy to read but very touching","498":"my review can be read in issue 2 of glint literary journal http www glintliteraryjournal com i","499":"the best thing about this book is the teacher with my surname i like the voice of harri but the book is completely ruined by the pretentious poorly done god pigeon the ending was completely predictable i was quite disappointed","500":"i have to get through this book as i recommended it to my book group but i'm not expecting very happy readers the language is awful and in my limited experience of inner london african children highly unlikely i think the author tried too hard and i think this subject could have been covered better and with more respect","501":"i was going to give up on this at about the halfway point i wasn't really engaged the whole setting and premise was bleak and depressing and i have loads of other books to read but i found myself unable to sleep last night and it was the only book by my bed so i carried on i am glad i finished it but it is terribly bleak and terribly sad the awful estate the dire school the mother working so hard the abused aunty and the extortionist uncle and of course the dead teenager and the gangs there is almost no light or brightness in the whole book almost none harri's journey to get to grips with english vernacular is amusing and the earnest attempts of harri and dean to be csi style detectives also provide a little light relief i found the character of the pigeon unconvincing i could see that it was an attempt to bring some lyricism and poetry into the book and to bring some of the animism and spirituality that harrison has absorbed from his african upbringing but i felt it failed the saddest part for me was actually as i had finished the book and i turned the last page and saw the acknowledgments which included the damilola taylor foundation this book is a fiction but there are real kids living and losing lives just like this in our supposedly first world civilised country and that is unbearable","502":" i'm not a great fan of 1st person narration especially when it is by a child young person because it is a difficult balance to keep it genuine for the reader and tell the story in this case i think stephen kelman manages it well from my privileged vantage point i think it gave a good account of living in an inner london estate and the pressures of growing up inside one it was moving and frustrating at times and there were no good male role models for the protagonist there was also an underlying commentary of asylum seeking and migration as well as the internal family culture around harri","503":"outstanding story told from the point of view of an 11 year old immigrant boy in contemporary britain the novel has the feel of the curious incident of the dog in the night time as in that story the main character seeks to piece together a murder and the reader is somewhat trapped by his unique perspective on events and the world around him","504":"through the experience of a 7th grade immigrant from ghana we follow the family adjustment to urban uk it felt real","505":"one of the best stories i have ever read this books makes you smile laugh and cry at times told from the perspective of an 11 year old boy his innocent details just enamors you and keeps you hooked till the end","506":"a touching book convincingly written reminds me of my time in peckham recommend this as an eye opener to the real world out there","507":"liked it more in reflection struggled to maintain interest at the start east london tower block living seen through the eyes of an innocent child would make a very good channel 4 film","508":"such a good read the ending was just totally surprising","509":"i think my wife would enjoy this book because she loves young adult fiction this person can write but the perspective and the language overall too irritating for me i appreciate it is clever etc etc and i know some people are always looking for that 'new voice' a new way of writing but i am just more old fashioned i guess and can't get past the bit where a novel is meant to be a story first and foremost","510":"originally printed in britain this book now appears on the american scene to great literary acclaim and is even shortlisted for the man booker prize harri short for harrison comes from ghana and lives in england he is an 11 year old boy trying to make sense of his new world and his new english words a neighboring boy is murdered and harri and his friends become enamored with sleuthing out who has done it throughout the book they take fingerprints from people they suspect and talk about how to trap someone into confessing the crime along for the ride is harri's sometimes pet pigeon who comes and goes as he pleases the pigeon appeared on the balcony one day and harri claimed him out of all of the other pigeons sometimes the pigeon speaks to harri this book was excellent for capturing the cadence of someone who had recently arrived in a new country and was learning a new language despite this language barrier the author managed to make harri both literate and thoughtful in his rendering of the character kelman will definitely be an author i will look for other books from","511":"best part about this book is the narrator written from the perspective of an 11 year old with 11 year old ideas pointless did not care for the writing style the language was bad and after all that the ending horrible don't waste your time","512":"my impression upon finishing pigeon english is that i missed something some aspect at this point i'm not sure what escaped and its absence left my experience flat this book will be placed on my 'reread later' shelf","513":"his book is told through the voice of an 11 year harri harri has just relocated from ghana to london and lives in the projects harri and his best friend are investigating a murder of a fellow class mate using techniques learned from the t v the book deals with the gang crimes and wars as seen through harri's innocent eyes harri is an unforgettable voice","514":"the story is told by a boy who emigrated from ghana to london with his mother and sister the language was fantastic and this is an example of a book i almost wished i'd gotten through audible it would have been great to hear his language read so that i'd hear it correctly","515":"brilliant read if you enjoyed room follows an 11 year old boy from ghana who has moved to a council estate in london part of the waterstone's 11 selection of new authors and deservedly so","516":"it was ok the ending was a surprise though","517":"nice read sounded more like the catcher in the rye","518":"a really good read and very relevant to modern times i related to the main character harri really well and it is impossible not to like him i have 11 year old sons so alot of what the character does is very true this book really made me think about kids like harri and the environment they grow up in what hope do they ever have","519":"how can you not love the 11 year old narrator in this book","520":"i am so glad i picked this book up during my brief break from school this summer it was a truly great story","521":"brilliant pigeon english is a story about an eleven year old boy from england the book is based on his life during a certain time frame while living in what i'd call the ghetto part of england someone who means something to the little boy got chooked chooked meaning stabbed in the boys vocabulary he didn't personally know the man who got stabbed but he had a connection to him and a duty he felt he had to fulfill that was to find the culprit of this murder throughout the hunt for this culprit other things happen in the book he found a pigeon he got attached to who has his guardian he also talks about his family members and what they go through living in this area the boy faces many troubles trying to get his mission done but he seems to do it calmly like he's not afraid like he's done it before like he's not afraid the ending was absolutely fantastic i picked up this book because of a recommendation i couldn't decide on a book to read so i decided to ask someone who reads many books he recommended this book to me after reading it i was grateful that i chose to read it i finished this book because it was suspenseful and or interesting throughout the entire thing there was never a moment in the book that i found it boring he was always telling a story or he was in a tricky situation either way he kept me entertained stephen kelman did an amazing job writing this book i would recommend this book to anyone over 12 although the book is phenomenal there is some language vocabulary and parts of the book that shouldn't be brought open people who haven't matured","522":" i picked up this book because i thought it had something to do with pidgin english not pigeon english despite this confusion i thoroughly enjoyed the book and wasted no time reading it the book is written through the eyes of a young african kid harrison now living in england harri likes to talk to his wild pigeon friend that he tries to feed hence the name of the book harri and his little mate inadvertently get a little too deep into a murder investigation which they embarked on through lifting fingerprints from surfaces using sticky tape and other dubious child like methods they may have struck the jackpot which gets harri in deep trouble persevere past the first few chapters as you get used to the peculiar language use and you'll enjoy this book","523":"i didn't get into the first half very well but i was blown away by the second half it really made me think i did chuckle at some parts and cry at others an eye opener the ending is 'brutal'","524":"don't bother","525":"i loved this book the author simultaneously captures the love and comradery between brothers and sisters takes us into the mindset of a child and shows us the difficulties involved in both emigrating to a new country and living in the inner city poetic and beautiful","526":"great book funny and sweet i'm more considerate of pigeons now","527":"was ok take it or leave it","528":"knocked me for six this one","529":"it was really good i loved the point of view harrision really made me look at thing differently","530":"an odd book a african boy in a horrible part of london sees a dead boy and tries to figure out who killed him all the while being watched over by a guardian angel pigeon parts of the story work well for example his relationship with his mother and sister and his childlike voice but the pigeon part was sometimes hard to swallow","531":"very reminiscent of the curious incident of the dog in the night time and a delightful read harri's innocent outlook on life is captured into words so well the storyline slowly moves forwards and little details are revealed to you as a reader that are not quite known consciously to harri making the ending all the more unexpected","532":"beautiful and devastating","533":"okay not massively my thing but something different from crime and pi novels","534":"an impressive novel intelligent insightfull inventive and timely enjoyed the experience of reading it very much","535":"so here is the thing about this book it is all about the voice and i will grant you that the authenticity and distinctiveness and consistency of the voice was quite an achievement the problem is that i still disliked reading a whole book in it and also there was something about it that felt ever so slightly patronizing and i really dislike it when authors feel patronizing toward their characters still if you liked the curious incident of the dog in night time you might well like this one","536":"not brilliant but the end really caught me unprepared and somewhat redeemed the novel harri's narrative is somewhat repetitive at times but i did like the voice of the pigeon","537":"beautiful and heartbreaking read this mystic pigeons were a little over the top but i loved the boy","538":"with the current events in london and some other major english cities a little bit too close for comfort stephen kelman's pigeon english seems only the appropriate reading material for the cat with a theme reminiscent of anthony mcgowan's the knife that killed me and a narrative voice as innocent and honest as christopher in the curious incident of the dog in the night time kelman's debut is sure to be a critic's favorite the fact it has just been longlisted for the prestigious booker prize should then come as no surprise the cat's got to be honest here and say that pigeon english only partly lives up to the hype there's no doubt that pigeon english stands out through its narrative voice the reader sees things much in the same way as harrison opoku's first person narration lets us see things this is a fresh innocent childlike but maybe a bit too much so... perspective harri is a 11 year old ghanaian boy who along with his sister and mother emigrated from ghana leaving behind a father and a younger sister they live in the urban jungle that is the london dell farm estate ruled by gangs bounded by violence devoid of opportunities and hope a grim yet horribly real future awaits any young person who has to grow up in similar circumstances optimism and hope lie in the seemingly small things of life a pair of adidas sneakers with real or fake stripes a new samsung cell phone...when a boy gets knifed near chicken joe's a local fast food place harri and his friend dean decide to do their own csi like investigation the investigation and the mystery though is never at the heart of the novel instead it's harri's wondrous outlook on his new life in england the relationship he has with his sister the interaction with locals like the drunk terry takeaway the crew members etc that stand out this is the part of the book that definitely worked for the cat the narration in harri's pidgin english mixed with current london street slang lots of hutious and innits is successful once you get over the initial culture shock however this narrative flow is often interrupted by the comments of a pigeon who comes to harri's balcony the pigeon interventions felt forced and didn't really bring anything to the overall sense of pending doom because let's face it the london that harri lives in is a royal mess - the proof is all in the current events innit it's an explosive cocktail of hopelessness violence and frustration and the fact that you have a pigeon commenting on all that really doesn't make it any better pigeon english works a charm as social commentary the book was also inspired by the true events of damilola taylor's murder on a south london estate by the way it has a unique voice in harri and its language use is interesting and different enough to make this a successful novel considering this is a debut novel the cat is willing to forgive kelman the beginner's mistakes...first published on my blog http ringothecat wordpress com","539":"i had a hard time deciding if i would give this book two or three stars some man booker nominees i really like such as the sisters brothers and others i don't like so much this one had an interesting premise that i don't feel was developed as well as it could have been the story jumped around and i felt it distracted from the story however jumping around allowed us to get into the mind of the child narrator harri and understand him a little bit more i ended up giving it three stars because as i said it had an interesting premise and the last few chapters helped bring the book together i laughed and times and was very sad at times while reading this book i think stephen kelman did a good job for his first novel and i hope to see more from him","540":"advise yourself you will love this book excellent perspective of an 11 year old's struggle to be good in this big bad world of ours","541":"i'm in two minds about this book the young boy narrator is charming bright and funny although i feel there's too much time and effort expended in getting us to see the world as he interprets it charming at first and this started to feel repetitive so for me the middle of the book dragged a bit and it took an effort to come back to it after a bit of a break you can't help but like him though which is why i'm giving this three stars not two and some of the other characters are quite well drawn too the ending took me by surprise and i won't say more than that","542":"would cannot really recommend this book i just did not connect with it i only finished it because it was so short and i am glad i did because i did like the wrap up","543":"this was a brilliant book read hot on the heels of jasper jones it is told in the voice of a 11 year old ghanain immigrant living in a housing estate in london with his sister and mother the boys wonderfully innocent relating of the grim grim world around him is fabulous as is his brilliant african expressions he also has a great dialogue with a pigeon yep the grotesque rats with wings variety which humanized the birds for me completely this was funny and gripping and a powerful reminder of the grim world some have to endure on route to a better life","544":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was one of the best audiobook i ever listened to read until the end i found the end to be a complete cop out and felt like the author just couldn't really figure out what to do so he turned in his assignment and gave up","545":" wow what an amazing book or as harrison the twelve year old protagonist would say 'bo styles don't get me wrong this is no epic plot driven novel it is 'indie' lit if you like your novels purely character driven clever poignant humorous intelligent and superbly written then this is for you the colloquialisms of the teenage characters are just wonderful 'advise yourself' 'hutious' 'asweh' and of course 'bo styles' will remain in my own vocabulary for a long time to come there is even interrupted narrations from a pigeon genius i teach english at gcse and i am going to email the exam board and suggest this novel be as set text stephen kelman i believe you are the new literary genius loved it","546":"disappointing intensely problematic the main character's entire personality is defined by his new alien english world so he becomes just another backwoods african who has to deal with immigration first world problems he also follows the quirky coming of age tm character trope which can be spotted by the made up vocabulary naivete and well meaning but often gets things very wrong theme there was just enough backstory to be annoying but not enough to actually be helpful","547":"i enjoy books written from in a childs narrative and this was no different i can see why it made the booker list well worth a read","548":"this is an absolutely beautiful book of childhood innocence in a harsh world fabulous imagery but inherently tragic i recommend it","549":"this is the best book i've read in a long time everything about it was good and i should probably re read it","550":"i confess i couldn't be bothered to finish reading this book i got halfway through and the story still didn't engage me so i stopped reading not sure why this was short listed for the man booker enough said","551":"easy read with a a powerful ending feel that the author created believable characters that reflected teenage youth and social class that is found on many of britain's council estates today some touching and funny moments created through harri's mid understanding of english culture as well as deliberate word choices that represent the way the english language is used amongst young people today worth a read","552":"another curious incident of the dog in the night hey just started but will i finish it in time i guess","553":"i loved this book a dark story with a truly delightful luminous narrator in harri","554":"disappointing i have been looking forward to this book but it was not really what i expected hard to believe this is how some people have to survive in such a civilised country","555":"i did not love this book most of the time it was just meh i did love what the pigeon says about humans each thinking they are the sea when they are really just raindrops overall a disappointment","556":"excellently written and easy to relate to main character","557":"subtly powerful bildungsroman raw but sensitive steinbeckian ending","558":" if there was a 2 5 option i would have awarded it 3 isn't justified liked the kid's perspective at first but wore on me eventually thought it was a sad story from the outset always felt that harri's was coping with life by confiding in a pigeon due to the change in location lack of friends and absence of father never adequately explained enjoyed the funny attempts of he and dean to solve the murder ironically their efforts hindered the investigation with the failure to hand in the wallet highlighted the depressing state of our inner cities and the lack of influence of parents in a unique way although i always felt that harri was good at the core i doubted how long that would be the case when surrounded by those influences he had already dipped his toe in the water and was only perturbed because the victim was known to him felt that another point would be how oblivious our parents are to what we do and who our influences are especially when they are occupied with keeping the family afloat disappointed with inconclusive ending as well","559":"sweet but sad likable main character in bad situation","560":"it was fine i enjoyed it but three things let it down a bit first for a long while i was feeling the author's effort in constructing harrison's voice and this stopped me feeling him as real that got better towards the end of the book when voice took second place to story and felt much more natural second the numerous characters were a bit confusing i was letting the names wash over me third the end was predictable all this said it is a story worth telling and it's told pretty well","561":"harri's voice started off as endearing and then just got more and more obnoxious way too overdone if he said asweh or donkey hours one more time i was going to throw the book across the room the pigeon point of view was stupid and also a big plot point","562":"didn't really get into it anticlimax","563":"4 45 stars in one word devastating devastatingly simple devastatingly current devastatingly exuberant with one of the most devastating endings i've encountered narrated in the tween protagonist's london by way of ghana vernacular pigeon english explores the contemporary plight of the impoverished inhabitants of british ghettos living in the projects harri opoku finds himself consumed by the murder of a schoolmate and he and his friends take the hutious burden of finding the killer upon themselves harri's moral compass guided by the strength of his family split between london and ghana and an omniscient pigeon guardian the source of the most eloquent passages in the novel navigates him through illegal immigration domestic abuse and gang orientation the prose is stark and purposefully juvenile yet harri's piercing perceptiveness not only shows how young children are prematurely being forced to grow up but how they can shed a refreshingly optimistic light on these very adult issues","564":" hyped like hell on the booker short list and creating lots of press for the first time author i see what its striving for and in that the intention is visible it falls a little flat told in first person narrative by the 11 year old immigrant harri from ghana now trying to survive on a rough london housing estate kelman does a great job in capturing the speech patterns of das youth some funny touching parts but the pigeon character as this all seeing overwatcher god like character speaking to harri oh dear very pretentious","565":" i came to this book out of curiosity because i'd heard so much about the author and how he'd had so many offers from publishers for his first book when he was an unknown author it's so hard to get published it took me five years to get even one offer for my book i was just so envious of this author and how easy he'd found it to get that book deal and then i read it and suddenly i understood pigeon english is an amazing book it so deserves to be published the subject matter is sometimes difficult and hard to stomach and yet the innocent narrative voice of the child narrator never slips never misses a beat this is the story of a child trying to be a child in a very grown up serious place which is no place for children it probably reflects reality for a lot of children in inner city environments fortunately it's not a reality i ever encountered and not one that my children will have to face but this book makes you realise just how lucky you are in some ways this book restores your faith a little in the publishing industry okay there are a lot of books out there that only get published because the author has either worked in publishing previously or is famous in some way books that don't deserve to ever make it into print but this book really did deserve to get published i'm grateful that it did and that i got the chance to read it definitely definitely recommend it","566":"as harri would say this book was dope fine and especially poignant in light of the recent uk unrest it felt multi faceted and textured throughout stephen kelman is a subtle and astute chronicler of our changing times here's hoping that both he and this novel enjoy continued success","567":" i loved this book it's really difficult to maintain the perspective of a child narrator and kelman does an admirable job for those of us raised in privilege it is eye opening to see the daily grind of cruelty and violence that is life in 'the projects' no matter where they are harrison the youthful protagonist and speaker is a most appealing person curious funny naive and caring he's a little bit naughty but mostly very very good with a loving albeit largely absent family he crept right into my heart and i expect he'll stay there","568":"a charming book about a not so charming world the reader is insulated from most of the awfulness by the narrator who is a child and an immigrant and a person who feels that everything in his new country is fascinating often laugh out loud funny pigeon english is also increasingly full of tension although the young man's outlook is always optimistic","569":"a neat little page turner a great central character warm welcoming open and endearing loved the way he spoke to us inviting us into his world loved the parts with the pigeon the most wished there had been more of that however it did start to feel a bit samey after a while not a great deal happened to develop the story read a bit like a young adult novel at times not that there's anything particularly wrong with that the end felt a bit sudden and perhaps a bit lazy overall i felt that perhaps a great central character had been wasted on a weak story","570":" read as part of my yearly quest to read the man booker longlist before it becomes a shortlist my rating is slightly skewed by that in that i probably got a 4 out of enjoyment the narrator's voice is simply lovely and charming but i don't think it's quite what it should be the 'pigeon' voice never worked for me and i found it distracting and annoying the children solving a murder mystery that is a device that never gets old for me as long as i like the characters and i loved them in this it was a relatively fast read and enjoyable the ending however telegraphed felt abrupt and unfulfilling the constraint that it's loosely based on real events was obvious","571":"for was brief time while reading this book i didn't think i could finish it only because for a bit in the middle it felt somewhat repetitive and somewhat bleak however that didn't last and i must tell you i fell in love with the boy at the center of the story i loved his innocence and his daydreams i adored the imagination that derived from it i was amused and charmed by his way of expressing himself which is a mixture of ghanian and rough inner city english harri is an 11 12 year old who has recently moved from ghana to inner city england and we see life through his eyes the book opens at the scene of a dead boy whose murder harri and his friend decide to solve the story is woven not only through harri's experiences but also through his sister's friend his mother and his mother's sister and her boyfriend there are lives hardened as a result of failure disappointment abuse but harrison saw beauty and revelled in it and found joy in the small things of his life and finally throughout the story is his pigeon stephen kelman has written an extraordinary book short listed for the man booker prize","572":"harrison opuku is one of the most compelling characters i have met this year stunning debut","573":"loved this book very sad at the end","574":" omg i wanted to cry i hardly ever want to cry thrown into a new world on an english housing estate harrison is dealing with so much already when he sees the body of another boy dead after a stabbing harrison and his friend dean decide they will play detective follow the clues and perhaps get a huge reward but life on the estate has its own challenges i fell in love with harrison and his story this funny bright loving boy his family and friends i think he will stay with me for a while","575":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this could have been so good but it was soooo bad the pigeon narrator the child narrator the ending argh it brought up some great issues like illegal migration and separated families but ugh i regret choosing to read this book not sure if i'll use the man booker prize longlist again","576":"it's difficult to review a book that you're so indifferent towards i feel like i would have found pigeon english a more compelling story if only i'd delved into it more although the characters aren't exactly one dimensional at no point did i find any of them interesting and i was often counting the number of pages left while reading i do however think the book is well written and the story is mildly interesting","577":"harri our 11 year old narrator takes us on a journey through london's gritty inner city with a heavy handed but well worked focus on multiculturalism gangs and knife crime and rites of passage it rings true and harris is a great kid one you want to do well find his feet and come back to visit you after he graduates well worth a read to see child narrators done well or to read a tragic yet funny coming of age style tale","578":"though shortlisted for the man booker prize 2011 the subject matter for stephen kellman's first novel pigeon english was not at all encouraging being narrated by an eleven year old immigrant boy growing up in a poor high rise flat in london think of the movie attack the block it would normally be a book i would never consider how wrong can you be when i read the first page i knew immediately i was in for a treat the whole novel is both funny and shattering at the same time peppered with innits and advise yourself we come across some extraordinary characters in and out of school the dialogue between harrison and his older sister lydia is some of the funniest i have read for a long time lydia get out of my face now you're vexing me harrison well your face is vexing me fish lips","579":"hmmm i can't get into it stopping half way a pity because the award nominations and reviews suggest it should be impressive","580":"an exquisite book funny tragic and deeply moving as we follow the grasshopper mind and the big heart of an 11 year old boy who has recently come to england from ghana","581":"this book was shortlisted for the guardian first book award and man booker prize in 2011 and i saw stephen kelman in conversation at the edinburgh international book festival that year compared to the literary big names punching their weight around he was unobtrusive reading pigeon english now albeit a year late his brand new energy in this book has much more impact than i anticipated harrison opuku is from ghana and he is 11 years old and he likes the inner city pigeons in particular one pigeon his pigeon has no name or age but he does present a bizarre omnipotent bird view philosophy the boy is an idealistic terrifically alive narrator who is at once more observant and perhaps less aware than the reader the pigeon is terrifically perceptive in both senses of the word combined they make you see the world anew the driving force of the book the narrative structure simultaneously reveals the wonder in our large cities and builds pressure as we suspect dangers go unnoticed or avoided there are so many potential pitfalls with this socially contentious subject matter and with an adult's imagining of a child's perspective it is a great relief as well as a horrible shock when the book ends as it does harri's age invites young adult or school listings but this book is equally gripping for adults as a first novel it is powerfully subtle the reader's engagement with the characters always seems detached as you gauge the narrators and observe their lack of real power and action you don't realise how much you have learnt and connected with in the book until it stops PS12 99 bloomsbury 978 1408810637http www amazon co uk pigeon englis","582":"a very good read with a wonderful main character i dreaded the ending because i was enjoying the book but also because it was clearly not going to be a happy one great language and characters","583":"one of the best if heartbreaking books for young teens i've ever picked up","584":"this book had me laughing and crying sometimes both at the same time i love the innocence with which harrison the protagonist views the world kelman totally succeeded in capturing a ghanaian child's view of this strange new country england having been to africa i know this might be what an immigrant child would think and at the same time harrison is not so different from all the other kids out there fabulous a highly recommendable book","585":"if you liked any modern day coming of age book--catcher in the rye are you there god it's me margaret an abundance of katherines--you will love this one the protagonist a charmingly forthright 11 year old boy is a recent expatriate from ghana living in london the story follows his adorable endeavors to solve a real life murder mystery author stephen kelman generally finds a perfect mix of grit and humanism although the book does feel a bit too light for its own good at certain points still i thoroughly enjoyed this one and i'm looking forward to more from this very talented author","586":"debut novels that reach the dizzying heights of international prize lists are always a draw this book seems to have had an unusual amount of buzz surrounding it since its publication i read the enthusiasm of reviewers and was disappointed i could not share in it i wonder what i was missing sometimes when a lauded book misses for me i listen to the audio track of the book in hopes that someone reading it for me will give it the inflection i am missing perhaps i will one day do this and will have a different take this book seemed to lack a center and defining core an eleven year old ghanian immigrant living in slum housing in city suburban london comes across the dead body of a schoolmate lying bloodied by the chicken take out where he was murdered taught by american tv shows how to investigate crimes he and a friend play at uncovering the perpetrator this is a plot big enough to hang a masterpiece on so i can see the reason for some excitement however the promise was not fulfilled the author used dialect expressed through the eleven year old's first person narration and had some success with that the confusion and misunderstanding of a young boy gazing out at an adult and brutal world comes across however there was some key enlightenment some grace perhaps that the author had to grant to his character and to us the viewers that was missing i had no sense of a great pathos or of this character as a player on the grand stage it was small story and i felt some discomfort boredom dare i say listening to the not very deep musings of a young undereducated boy confronting some of the most horrendous personal violence any of us will encounter in a lifetime 'it coulda been a contender' but didn't get the heart of the matter right","587":"really enjoyed it it took a while to get in to i think i actually attempted it 3 times before succeeding worth it though","588":"i tried but i just couldn't finish reading this book i couldn't see where it was going and the use of slang that i'm not familiar whilst relevant made it difficult for me to read","589":"there have been many novels before pigeon english where the author provided some extra or unique insight or some added entertainment value by having the tale told through a child i enjoyed pigeon english but there were several moments where i had to ask myself if i would have enjoyed it as much if the protagonist wasn't an 11 year old recent immigrant beyond this narrative perspective the story itself was rather pedestrian i thought","590":" i don't read much straight contemporary fiction and picked this up on a whim before a recent trip i liked the naive narrator but the found the pigeon's pov sections a little preciously po mo the pov of the main character was interesting because he bridged several worlds that i was unfamiliar with so he stood in for my own naivete in reading the interactions of others i want someone else who's read this to discuss this with me so it would be a great book club choice spoiler i think the ending made the book cohere and pulled its message together more neatly than the narrative as a whole suggested it shocked me but seemed inevitable after i'd read it that of course that was the end result i'm left more than a week later still thinking about the other characters and how his death would have affected them all whether they'd have been silenced or spoken out whether more violence would have happened to ensure silence or not that thinking has perhaps elevated the book's over all impact on me should it be a 3 or a 4 i debate","591":"moving story about an eleven year old boy from ghana living in london with his mother and sister the strenght and the weakness of the novel was for me the fact that the whole story is told from the perspective of the boy you gotta love his innocence his energy his positivity his sweetness at some points it also slowed the story down when you want it to continue to develope and to deepen","592":"god that was depressing very good but oh so so bleak","593":"while reading this book i kept thinking that it was ok pretty clever point of view and a unique voice it also made me appreciate that i'm not a preadolescent boy any more i finished the book and now it haunts me this book is one i read for a book club and i'm really glad that i'm going to have the opportunity to talk it out with others who have read the book","594":" i was disappointed by this book i expected great things and got okay i expected great thing because this book was compared to 'room' and 'the curious incident of the dog in the night time' two very good books that i absolutely love i have come to realise now that it was compared to them because it was told from a child's point of view not because of the quality of the book i struggled with the book right from the off i can't tell you exactly why i didn't like it it just grated on me i don't feel like i could connect with the character the whole flipping from one train of thought to another literately from one sentence to the next just irritated me it also may seem petty but the inconsistency of the censoring of swear word bugged me for a start this is a book meant for adults so censoring swear works seems pretty pointless but what really got under my skin was the inconsistency of it one moment the word would be censored the next it wasn't wants the point the saving grace of this book was roughly the last 50 pages here i finally felt like things were progressing i got involved and i finally got pulled in although the phrase 'too little too late' springs to mind it did up the rating from 1 start to 2 stars not a book that i would recommend anyone especially if they are big fans of 'room'","595":"if it were possible to give this book zero stars i would although the premise behind it is interesting and novel enough looking at the troubled marginalized youth in london's inner city from their own perspective the execution was atrocious i can't recall the last time i skipped through so many pages of a book the idea of the eleven year old as narrator works for the first few pages then as 'yout speak' does it just starts to grate on you what i found ironic was that the book received such praise for being 'a realistic portrayal' of who or what i thought while i don't doubt that kelman did his research i still believe both he and those writing in praise of the book give him far more credit than he deserves i felt no more empathy for these kids with nicknames like killa and x fire than i did before reading the book kelman also misses the mark with the main character there are times when harri says things that are completely out of character for an 11 year old at times he sounds like the grown man writing the story or like a 5 year old child who's endearing but whose train of thoughts is all over the place the narrative sounded too often like an adult trying to imitate a child i also think the book's ending and link to certain social issues made it seem far more important and interesting than it was some readers said they found the book disturbing but then what being disturbed by an issue doesn't propel us to action so rather than show us something we don't already know kelman is yet another observer of what david cameron et al term 'broken britain' my verdict great concept poor execution","596":" for me the very mark of success for a first person novel is when i feel like the words on the page are coming from the character not the author the opinions values and attitudes of the author simply dissolve and you can then truly immerse yourself in the book this is so much harder to do when the voice is so far from your own so writing from a kid's perspective and doing it well really is an achievement what's even more satisfying is that harri really is adorable i loved reading about his world","597":"you gotta love 11 year old boys harrison harri for short an immigrant from ghana tells the tale of life in the projects of london harri is a good friend to his classmates in love with poppy a pain to his sister lydia advice yourself is her favorite line he likes science and loves to run the ending catches the reader off guard","598":" the story follows a young boy named harri who arrived in england with his sister and mother moving into a rough neighbourhood where gangs ruled the streets a murder of a student in harri's school takes place in the community and trying to make sense of this crazy new world harri wants to find the murderer i wanted to like this book but the voice of the protagonist veered on the annoying too much for my liking the writer was influenced by the murder surrounding the damilola taylor case and that can be clearly seen throughout the novel stephen kelman ably wrote with the themes of gun culture and young violence in mind with a careful hand and although the politicisation of the murder can be found in between the lines it only added to the novel rather than detracted the world building was insular and narrow which can be put out down to the protagonist's narrow viewpoint but sadly it meant that the overall story was fairly boring perhaps not a strong criticism but if a novel is boring and almost a slog to get through then that obviously affects the pleasure of reading the book in this sense i am surprised the novel was shortlisted for the booker prize in 2011 i can see that some people didn't like the method of using the pigeon in helping to tell the story but i actually liked the device because the pigeon spoke wisely and with thought on situations that young harri was unable to articulate but still felt it further illustrated the themes that kelman was projecting in an interesting way the last couple of pages were gripping however and the ending was truly sad","599":" first time author stephen kelman's debut novel pigeon english is billed as something of a murder mystery and while this is technically true it is most certainly not its primary intent be forewarned that if you're picking this title up thinking it will be a stellar piece of whodunit crime fiction you'll most likely end up utterly disappointed that said what the novel does reveal itself to be over the course of its two hundred and seventy two pages far exceeds the expectations set by the publisher's description read more http www opinionless com book revie","600":" this is the first book i read from the longlist for the 2011 man booker prize i really enjoyed this harri the eleven year old protagonist is a possibly illegal immigrant from ghana living in the projects in london the book is full of a mixture of slang and beliefs from ghana and his new community like most children he doesn't fully understand what is going on around him and has no grasp of the danger and violence he is surrounded by i think that makes the story more compelling than it would be if the author hit me over the head with it view spoiler the one element of this novel that i can't decide about is the pigeon all of the sudden it starts telling his perspective and i was definitely surprised by that in fact at first i thought the italicized bits were his mother when i figured it out i started laughing hide spoiler","601":"when i read the waterstone's 11 extract for this i was really excited the first section with the dead boy was moving but believable harri didn't really know the boy and was equally sorrowful about the death and intrigued i must admit though that in some sense the extract and the blurb for pigeon englishwere misleading i expected it to be more about the dead boy but really it was more about life on an inner city housing estate and learning about a new culture that's not really a bad thing and actually i think i prefer it that way in some ways there was a disturbing element to this story that a boy of such innocence could be influenced in some of the ways harri was and could just walk into trouble when really he sees what he is doing as a game i work in a nursery in an area similar to the one in which harri lives and it kind of hit close to home and it makes me hope that things will have changed by the time the kids i work with grow up i don't want them to end up in some of the troubles that happen in the area i found the voice of harri was really authentic but after a while i did find him a little irritating especially him constantly saying 'asweh' after a while though i was able to ignore my annoyance as i got more into the actual story in some ways the way he talked was important to the story it showed how innocent and naive he really was and i think that was important i think i would have just thought he was an idiot if his voice hadn't been naive but instead i was wishing for him to talk to someone older about things the end was absolutely heartbreaking and brought me close to tears that's when i knew i had really come to like harri was it worth my excitement not really but it's still and thought provoking read and well worth the time","602":"i might have enjoyed this book a bit more had i not felt like i was paging through my 5th grade diary the entire time the narrator--an 11 year old ghanian immigrant named harrison--isn't what you'd call precocious exactly but he's sweet and uncorrupted despite the urban blight surrounding him while the other boys in the council houses are busy sticking each other with sharp objects and threatening each other with violence harrison is deeply concerned about pigeons stray animals and his father and sister back in ghana when one of his classmates gets stabbed in front of a chicken restaurant rather than being frightened he attempts to solve the murder with his friends even though it soon becomes painfully obvious who the culprit is also i don't mind when books are filled with the vernacular of a certain culture i found myself looking up so many words online that it was difficult to get back into the flow of the story eventually i located a ghana english dictionary online which was a handy reference point for figuring out that blood actually meant strength in the context of the story and bo styles meant stylish although i suppose that one was fairly self explanatory however toto wasn't an easy guess look it up if you don't believe me so the story is sad in a way because it's illustrative of the difficulties both of being poor and a new immigrant despite harrison's wide eyed enthusiasm for his school and friends the reader is painfully aware that he and his family must fight every day to survive in a neighborhood with needles underfoot junkies and puddles of piss in the stairwell and gangs roaming the streets as someone who reads the newspapers fairly regularly this story didn't seem too unlikely the ending although tragic is more common than one imagines","603":"what a main character harri is so full of life that he almost burst from the page i've known a few kids like him as a teacher and all that i can say is that he's beautiful his exhuberance for life innocence of its perils and the ability to mesh two different cultures into a unique worldview is amazing","604":"quite liked it but found it also a bit irritating","605":"it has it's charms and moments thought story and premises aren't that great","606":"could not finish the book","607":"this book tells the story of a young immigrant boy in london trying to learn the customs and fit in the title plays with the idea of pigeon english in the obvious sense that it is what this boy is speaking and how the book is written but also there is a pigeon who acts as a sort of guardian angel to the boy the pigeon guardian angel was just too much for me and ended up taking a kind of mediocre book down a peg for me 2 5 stars","608":"pigeon engish is a heart breaking story at harri who along with his sister and mother move from ghana to an indigent inner city project harri makes a convincing eleven year old narrator feisty and first in disparity to the misfortune that surround him in the form of dearth prostitution and gangs as harri tries to navigate his new life he finds himself evenly deterred but yet enthralled by the crime that surrounds him i was extremely touched by and dismayed by many elements of this story knowing the reality as i grew up in the same element 5 stars","609":" i do not understand how this book was shortlisted for the man booker prize 2011 first of all the writing style is annoying everything is brutal hutious and bo styles it's not cute the first ten times and it's certainly not the following hundred times and yes i do understand that this was the author's attempt to capture a child's voice but it really didn't work for me and i've seen it done more effectively and less irritatingly in other books secondly the content itself was deceiving the story just dragged on and on and i believe this is mainly due to the plot being incredibly diluted throughout the 260 pages there were also lots of unnecessary interactions with secondary characters and most of them were completely interchangeable pigeon english would probably be only half as long if you cut out all the pointless content i really struggled to finish this book something that is very unusual for me","610":"i honestly don't see any way for this book to have been any better just so hilarious so poignant definitely a keeper","611":"apparently this novel was plucked from the 'slush pile' by an agent and was then sold for a six figure sum after a round of frenzied bids were made by various publishers kelman grew up on a council estate in luton and has based this debut novel on the murder of damilola taylor the ten year old boy who was killed on a peckham estate in 2000 the book is narrated by eleven year old harri opuko he and his mother and older sister have recently arrived from ghana and live in a block of flat on an inner city housing estate harri's father and baby sister are still in ghana his mother works as a midwife although the story centres around the murder of a young boy outside a chicken takeaway shop it is really harri's observations of this strange place that he has come to live in he finds the language strange lots of words mean the same thing if something is 'gay' then it means it is stupid and why are there so many ways of saying that you are going to the toilet harri is a typical eleven year old fascinated and curious daring and innocent he decides that he must solve the murder case and soon he is out with binoculars interviewing suspects and trying to get some fingerprints there is an air of menace about the story harri and his friends are growing up in a violent environment they play 'suicide bombers' at school they 'chook' each other with compasses harri however doesn't seem to understand just how threatening a situation he is getting himself harri is an endearing quite authentic character and kelman has captured the innocence and curiosity of a small boy very well it's a fascinating look at the world of inner city gangs with characters who appear real the only part of the book that i really disliked was the addition of a second narrator every now and again there is a passage supposedly narrated by a pigeon a play on the title of the book i found this a bit pretentious almost as if the author was giving the reader a sermon about life which was not needed at all on the whole though apart from the pigeon i enjoyed reading this book it's a serious subject matter and a clever way of dealing with it i'll look forward to seeing what stephen kelman can come up with next","612":"great character seriously crappy ending","613":" ah i loved it beautiful almost visual language the pigeon of course is a metaphor kelman writes point sharp what your problem is you all want to be the sea but you are not the sea you are just a raindrop you are one in an endless number if you'd just accept it things would be so much easier say it with me i am a drop in the ocean i am neighbor nation north and nowhere i am one among many and we all fall together aaaaah can it get any more beautiful than this kelman can i am not saying you don't see the end coming but it was all i could do not to cry","614":"almost had to read this book aloud to get into the flow of the narrator in fact sometimes i did asweh young harri was naive and streetwise all at the same time very enjoyable although an emotional read","615":"one of the best books i've read this year","616":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here amazing book all the way through harri is a brilliant character full of life and happiness the ending may have broken my heart a little bit '","617":"i really enjoyed this book such a sweetie as a main character and you could totally see the world through his eyes the pigeon thing seemed a little forced but if you just kind of go with it mostly it works out and i even grew to quite like that part of it would defo reccomend it","618":"harrison opaka is an 11 year old has recently emigrated from ghana to a london council estate full of harri's first person slang he wears or wants to wear bo styles because he's fastest runner in year 7 he's dope ne when a teenage murderer who has already killed a peer realizes he's investigating the hutious murder himself harri only has his friend a pigeon to help him the pigeon and his precise speech i liked a lot i kept reading this but ultimately i wanted to like this more than i did","619":" booker shortlisted recently emigrated from ghana harri lives with hissister and mother in one of london's enormous housing projects a classmateis murdered and he decides along with a friend to solve the crime with achild narrator this is full of multicultural slang and a glossary isavailable with certain editions although not with mine which would have beenuseful however not too difficult to work it out yourself harri learns muchabout his family and the world around him due to his curiosity and amateursleuthing and this brings him dangerously close to secrets better leftuncovered i found the writing style a little tedious by the novels end andwouldn't be my pick for the man booker prize","620":"i'd forgotten that i had already read this book basically the damilola taylor story a lovely book but heartbreakingly sad","621":" i've heard it said that good editing is a thing of the past and nowhere is that more true than with this novel kelman does a pretty good job of setting up harrison's youthful ethnic english as a second language dialect in the first chapter but then mistakenly repeats his stock phrases 'asweh' 'huitious' etc ad nauseam throughout the remainder of the book this rapidly becomes an irritant and by the end i found it massively detracted from what little story there is there are other style points that grate but my main issue with the book and my reason for scoring it so low is that nothing much happens an important topic no doubt but one that is explored here through one dimensional characters limited repetitious dialogue and unsurprising observations i understand that in contemporary fiction one shouldn't expect much in the way of traditional story arcs or tidy endings but really if you're looking for a story in which ordinary people do ordinary things for a while and then you reach the end without any kind of conclusion go watch a french film","622":" i'm not against sentiment i would go so far as to say that i like things that are cute even i thought pigeon english was cloying however and unconvincing bo styles hutious it felt lovely sucked off the narrator thinks it means hard kissing asweh advise yourself the jacket calls these examples of multicultural slang but a quick google shows them to mostly be particular to this book some are clever but they are repeated endlessly there are some nice moments but they're buried in a narrative that gives equal weight to each vignette there's only about enough plot here for a very clever short story i actually wanted more of the pigeon","623":"this book is like watching kids say the darnedest things amid a backdrop full of gang violence urban poverty and vulnerable immigrants and i mean that in a positive way plus you will never look at a pigeon the same again","624":"for some reason i feel like i already read this book or i read a book very similar to this but i don't think i have i enjoyed the interesting cross section of culture and backgrounds presented by the characters in this novel the ghanaian slang was an enjoyable aspect of the story but perhaps its overuse called into question the lack of enlightenment displayed by the main character harri it was hard to believe that his cyclical innocent thought process was simply a result of youthfulness","625":"when it comes to capturing the child's voice pigeon english is classic a funny heart rending book","626":"this felt very predictable to me and i'll be vague here so as to not get spoiler y the pigeon segments were out of place unnecessary saccharine and what appeared to be a flimsy excuse for the author to sneak in some meaningful literary prose i think the novel would have been a lot better with all of that taken out there were way too many angelic figures here some realistic shades of gray characters rather than all good guys and bad guys would have made this seem more truthful and less like a 300 page morality lesson but it was shortlisted for the man booker prize so what do i know","627":"i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book it was a fresh way to approach the difficulties faced by immigrants into a foreign land trying to fit in but yet retaining their identity set in london it was easy for me to empathise i used to live in such an area when i first came to london but the ending oh the ending","628":"life and death of a pre teen in london a bit to didactic for my taste","629":"an endearing book and that grew on me once i stopped comparing it to other books curious incident the other hand to kill a mockingbird tsotsi the book is held together by the personality of the narrator harri at once incredibly naive he believes nearly anything he is told by his more world wise classmates and yet aware of a world in which teenagers can be bo styles basketball players one day and stabbed the next it's a world where he depends on the strong women in his life but yet is constantly surrounded by rampant juvenile misogyny he loves running his new diadora shoes his mother and his baby sister agnes who is still in ghana his binoculars his pigeon friend poppy morgan and the word paradiddle look it up the narrative draws you in while harri describes a world where he has to side step threatening thugs and solve a bloody crime using his unique blend of ghanaian slang asweh and advise yourself were my favorites and i plan to use them in daily chatter from now on london slang chook and donkey hours and teenage babble there were times when the narrative got lost and quite a few instances where i felt kelman was unsure of what age or naivete level his protagonist was as a result the first half of the novel felt forced at times and harri's narrative did not always ring true in my mind too often i felt i was hearing the middle class english version of an 11 year old african immigrant","630":"on the man booker short list 2011 deservedly so an unusual book about an 11 yr old ghanian boy trying to adjust to life as an immigrant in a london tower block i loved the colourful ghanian speech patterns and this unvarnished look at britain's social milieu despite the grim plot line an uplifting read","631":" if this book replaced to kill a mockingbird in high school english classes i wouldn't mourn the loss they share some similar aspects like a child narrator and a look into childhood innocence amid societies of hate and violence and pigeon english addresses racism and poverty in far more complex ways than tkam also i really liked the writing both eleven year old harri's narration and the pigeon's do you want to know what i think and i've been around long enough to have formed a few opinions what your problem is you all want to be the sea but you're not the sea you're just a raindrop one of an endless number if only you'd just accept it things would be so much easier say it with me i am a drop in the ocean i am neighbour nation north and nowhere i am one among many and we all fall together","632":"a very fine first novel young harri opoku is a wonderful creation through whose eyes we see a world that is both beautiful and ugly this novel seems particularly timely given recent events in england kelman succeeds in creating a reality that is outside the experience of most of us what more can we ask of a novel","633":"i thought this book was okay i did find this book had a strong message but i found it difficult to read and found at times i was re reading lines because of the way this book was written","634":"a great book original very good for reading groups","635":"told from the eyes of an innocent young lad the impact of youth gang mentality brutality and trying to survive the ending is heart breaking","636":"struggled to finish this one the writing style annoyed me and the story just didn't work for me it reminded me of 'the curious incident of the dog in the night time'","637":"my biggest issue with this one was all of the british slang i had to look up a lot of words but it's easy to do that on the kindle harri a 7th year student was a compelling character i worried about him throughout the book his neighborhood was a rough one and there was a lot of bullying in his school the ending was very disturbing and definitely makes you think","638":"i heard about pigeon english through the guardian's saturday review supplement and placed a library reservation almost as soon as i had read it was an adult novel with a child protagonist as regular readers of this blog may be aware child and teenage protagonists are one of my favourite things to find in a novel and that coupled with the protagonist being a boy new to the uk meant this was a \"must read\" for me i love young protagonists and or protagonists who are new to \"modern life\" e g recent immigrants the time travelled as they provide a device for the exploration of the familiar through the eyes of an outsider new to that which i see as everyday which is very refreshing and encourages my own thinking to be more creative adult as in not written for children young people not adult as in erotic before you get any ideas there are plenty of other places on the internet for that kind of thing read the rest of my review here https whathannahread wordpress com","639":"this was my second reading of 'pigeon english' and despite finding it as compelling as the first reading i had to keep stopping for breaks because i couldn't bear the thought of what would happen to harri the characterisation in this novel is amazing brilliant work i skipped over the pigeon snippets i just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough despite these this book is a must read it and weep you will","640":"this novel is narrated by an 11 year old boy who has immigrated from ghana and is living in a housing project in london at the beginning a boy is found murdered and the police don't know who did it so the narrator u0026amp his friend try to solve the murder that's the plot such as it is but the plot is not really the focus of the novel it's really just a series of scenes that provide a portrait of life in london's projects but the real draw is the charming voice of the narrator who has an infectious enthusiasm for life equally charmed by the pigeon who shows up outside his window and the lives of the gang members who both attract and repel him a reviewer for the times uk compared it to the curious incident of the dog in the night time u0026amp to emma donoghue's room i don't see it it's more comparable to little bee which i would recommend over this","641":"had to raise the rating on this one when i got to the end the world seen through eleven year old hari's eyes is wonderful and wondrous naive with a sinister reality lurking in the background the ending while perhaps inevitable is beautifully drawn out","642":"harrison or harri is a young teen boy who has emigrated to london from ghana he's a likable character and he finds joys in all the new things in his life his view is not jaded yet and he sees good or wants to see good but life isn't so good school has bullies and gangs as he tries to fit in this shows the ugly side of that world you root for him and his story he's a character to be remembered to say more would tell too much","643":" an eleven year old ghanan boy living in a deprived southern area first person narrator i was not enthused then i started reading this novel and the best word to describe it is charming kelman has perfectly captured the voice of a year seven although i can't comment on the veracity of the ghanan slang to tell a reasonably interesting if not entirely original story the key to this novel's success is kelman's use of harri as a flawed narrator who doesn't understand the world around him but doesn't realise this makes for the most charming that word again of narratives that is as funny as it is poignant at times with one booker book to go this currently sits way clear in second place for me","644":" the problem with this book is getting into the writing style it always took me a couple pages to get into the flow and once i did i felt like i should keep reading so i didn't lose the flow again i never felt like i wanted to keep reading or even bother finishing this book but i did and it was ok i think it is helpful living in london to appreciate more of the context of the story but that certainly isn't necessary to understand the book the content was interesting and i can sort of see why this won the man booker award in 2011 but overall the book just was not for me hopefully i never read another book with paragraphs written from a pigeon's perspective","645":"what the hell thanks ending","646":"really enjoyed the book right up until the end wanted sooo much more the ending seemed a bit rushed over all every page had me thinking 'omg that's so true' and i shall now have more respect for the pigeons when i go into town lol also the book should include a dictionary to explain some of the london gang ghana slang words i had figured most out by the end of the book however","647":"the voice in this book is amazing the main character could not be more different than me and yet i felt totally immersed in his world his feelings thoughts reactions everything was totally believable i wish i could write like that","648":"if you liked the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime i think you will like this as well told from the perspective of a young immigrant boy growing up in england this book is full of the wonderful insights and innocence that can only come from a child the story will make you laugh and cry it's an amazing first novel by stephen kelman i definitely look forward to reading more by him in the future","649":"i loved this book he made the real the mundane and the downright nasty sound beautiful i loved the narration through such an innocent voice of the protagonist what a fantastic story","650":"memorable characters","651":"i got to the end but just barely perhaps i just did not understand the messages in this book but it did not appear to be anything more than a series of separate observations events i felt the main character lacked development and complexity","652":"written from the eleven year old harrison's point of view in a style that makes it hard not to draw comparison to jd salinger's the catcher in the rye pigeon english tells of the situation of gang violence and crime among young kids in england","653":"wasn't gripped at all until the last 20 pages and then was floored by it leaving me thinking about the novel for days bit of a shocker","654":"not what i was expecting but enjoyed it throughly made me laugh and cry","655":"asweh i got fed up of reading in the end and i would have liked more closure","656":"wow where do i start from the moment i picked up this book i was hooked i fell in love with harri straight away amazingly well written to show how cruel and tough life can be but through the sweet naive and innocent eyes of an 11 year old boy so full of hope yet so hopeless it made me laugh and cry so much i felt this book as well as just read it","657":"great book gave a real insight into how it must be to arrive in a strange country and the adjustments needed","658":"dnf can't understand the good ratings painfully hard to read","659":"i loved it harrison is one of my favorite characters narrators of all time i just fell in love with him the writing style is spot on perfect so funny yet so sad i recommend it 100%","660":"completely brilliant bleak and tragic but so funny and endearing and sweet at the same time the voice of the 11 year old boy is realised so well","661":"read my full review here http www monniblog com 2011 05 pige","662":"amazing book full of love and hope and yet as a reader you're despairing harri the main character is an incredibly lovely boy stuck in a terrible place he sees the beauty in everything but the situations he's in and the other characters around him tell you all about the horrors of living in a truly rough inner city neighbourhood i was in tears at the end highly recommended","663":"yuck ok i get it you know precisely how 11 year old boys think feel and speak but how about we move the story along a bit i got suckered into this one this is not a story of a boy who solves a murder it's a study in how well the author can articulate how an 11 year old sees the world and he's great at it but it isn't enough to hold this book together skip it i wish i had i took this one to the beach what a mistake","664":"this is a great book that effortlessy captures the vivid voice of harri an elevn year old boy and over the course of 200 pages glimpse the world through his eyes","665":"told in the voice of an eleven year old boy who has migrated with his two sisters and mother from ghana to the slums of london the author does a great job of contrasting their former life in ghana with the very rough and dangerous urban life in london he does this very well without actually spending much time on it with very few words you get the sense of the predicament of those living at a poverty level and facing circumstances and events that are simply not going to allow them to climb the socioeconomic ladder the dialogue can be tough to read as it contains a lot of slang but it is not hard to get the gist of what is happening i could see the playground park basketball court and apartment harri's life is tough but the wide eyed innocence with which he approaches everything is wonderful i felt like i got a sense of what it must be like to live in the circumstances described","666":" pigeon english just isn't as good as i wanted it to be the narrator harri opoku an eleven year old boy recently emigrated from ghana to the projects in london is incredibly engaging he is enthusiastic loving mischievous and amazingly big hearted his voice is fun and authentic but sometimes frustrating the events he is involved in beg for an adult point of view to round them out the only other voice we hear is that of a god like pigeon this device just didn't work for me and thankfully comments from the pigeon are brief and infrequent harri's voice however is so joyful and humorous that that it almost makes up for the novel's faults if i could have given this a three and a half rating i would have","667":" i was drawn into this book more and more as it went on at first its style made me think it was a children's book and i was put off by the mixture of ghanaian patois pidgin english and harri's learning english idioms but it was soon proved not to be for kids as beneath the naiveity of the narrator is a darkness of topic and mood which pervaded the plot as the reader understood more than the protagonist and began to fear for harri the power of the storytelling grew it is a very unusual book to be shortlisted for the man booker because of its child like style but its serious and topical themes and the clever motif of harri's pigeon deservedly lift it into that category","668":"this book as it is told through the voice of a child is an easy way into a world a lot of people don't know or understand harrison opoku is an immigrant just trying to make sense of his new home in england trying to navigate the allegiances and dangers of his council estate the pigeon was a little weird but i guess made sense in the end","669":"luckily this nice woman i met at the booth of bloomsbury berlin at the bookfair in leipzig last week recommended this wonderful book to me otherwise i would have never crossed paths with it picture london a young ghananian boy approximately 13 years old and very new to this big city picture him in a neighborhood full of risks him unbeknownst to the dangers that are lurking through the alleys and just like that one day he tumbles onto a body onto a body of a friend you can guess that this young boy now seeks justice while he's doing his researches he also meets love in form of hannah pigeon english is not a love story it is a story about love friendship justice and injustice about how easily people can get away with crimes and how easily they manage to make light of it also it deals with how easily one can be influenced by the wrong people i highly recommend reading this book although maybe to give it an authentic and genuine touch it states a lot of cussing quite a bit of violence and also sexual content","670":"a strange read not my normal sort of book shocking ending","671":"the boy's view on the world reminds what it was like to be 11 and what a shocking place our inner cities are brilliant except for the pigeons","672":"a story told by a young immigrant boy ghana living in the projects in england life there is hard and full of crime he tries to be a detective to find out who killed a boy living nearby","673":"an intricately descriptive story of innocence as told through the eyes of a boy who recently moved from ghana to the rough and tumble neighborhoods of inner city london the reader is truly able to see life as harri sees it and it is beautiful vexing and hutious as harri would say","674":"wonderful book one of the best i have read this year","675":"eleven year old harrison harri to his friends opuku is a recent arrival to england from ghana he is still young enough to believe he can influence the world around him by whether or not he steps on cracks in the sidewalks but at the same time old enough to be approached by the neighborhood gangs as a potential member it is this juxtaposition of innocence and experience that i found so interesting about this book the story begins with the murder of a local teenager and is told from harri's point of view he liked the victim and along with some of his friends turns detective to try and solve the mystery of who is guilty of this crime i quickly became very fond of harri he loves his family has a crush on his classmate poppy and just wants to be happy and good but he's not living in a world that makes that easy and the tension in this book comes from watching as harri attempts to navigate a dangerous world he is too young to fully understand","676":" not a bad book but not as challenging or moving as i had hoped the narrative style not only aliented me within the first 30 50 pages but it also irritated me whilst repetitive slang phrases may well be realistic for a child narrator newly arrived in the uk it doesn't make for an engaging read in all fairness i enjoyed the book more as it progressed although progressed isn't necessarily the right word since very little actually happens in terms of plot or character development but it just didn't affect me in the way i had anticipated given the inspiration subject matter perhaps i would have liked more background to harri's childhood in ghana rather than the at times overly simplistic monotonous description of tower block london life as he discovers it and whilst i really like the title of the book the actual personification of the pigeon and his addition to the narration seemed rather pointless again i think i'd rather have had harri's narration perhaps interspersed with his mother or father's perspective","677":"an insightful story that will stick with me it's very easy to categorize gang members as evil it's harder to realize that many kids are unwilling members who are only trying to survive the environment that they're thrown into harri an eleven year old boy is the narrator after coming from ghana to the uk he must learn to survive on the streets that surround his tenement his family had to be separated and harri misses his dad baby sister agnes and his grandmother who are still in ghana harri must learn the language and the behaviors that will allow him to survive his tender heart and frequent social misunderstandings are totally endearing the author was able to maintain harri's voice throughout the story as he tried to solve the mystery of who killed his classmate in front of chicken joe's harri uses his detective strategies learned on csi with little luck but much determination asweh that's why then he would tell the reader what he'd learned or how he was feeling donkey hours many of his tasks took donkey hours love it he lived in a world in which athletic shoes defined your social class and a great gift for your sister was the discovery of some fresh cement to put your footprints into he knew his family's love unlike many of the others who lived in this poverty this was both a blessing and a curse as he had to develop appropriate survival tools his pigeon friend's life paralleled his own and allowed him a safe place to spend kindness so why didn't i give this book 5 stars the pacing although meant to simulate his daily life often made me just a little crazy i look forward to reading stephen kelman's next book","678":"the writer did a great job in writing from a child's perspective i had numerous oppportunities to reconnect with my own childhood and be amazed how logic works when you are 12 i had a great time reading this book","679":"such a gorgeous little book the happy bubble of the narrator an 11 year old boy is a buoyant appealing innocent voice from his vantage point the world of the projects bad boys and bullies comes alive and through it all his happy spirit soars this is such a moving story and for anyone who has raised a boy oh you will so recognize and adore this child's enthusiasms","680":"style overcomes whatever the book seems to lack and propels the reader to a car crash of an ending lasting impression not really enjoyable yes","681":" a really lovely book my only real complaint between this and the invention of everything else i think i can definitively say that having your protagonist connect with cosmic mysteries via a pigeon is a stupid idea and one that would seemingly be easily avoided but that's a minor complaint the real marvel here is voice of hari the narrator and protagonist kelman did a truly remarkable thing in capturing the thoughts and speech of a kid in hari's position nearing the end of boyhood innocence navigating the strange gap between two cultures the kid i work with at floc is very much in the same kind of position in his life full of new enthusiasms gleaned from his peers and questions about how to relate his cultural identity to the world he's in now hari was incredibly spot on aside from that exercise in narrative voice there isn't too much else on offer here but the book is worth reading for that alone","682":"a very moving sorry told from the eyes of an 11 year old boy who's family has moved from ghana to a block of flats in inner city london the language used can be a bit difficult to keep up with at times but the moral of this story is nothing short of truly shattering this is the authors first book but he captures the truth of this story in such a way that you are gripped the whole way through it is so sad to believe that this is the life a lot of children lead not just in london but all over the world this story had to be told and reading pigeon english is the best way to understand it","683":"this is different i like how it was written as the boy speaks shocking at times","684":"i read this very quickly and found it a truely engrossing read i didn't guess how it was going to end at all and was left feeling totally stunned a great book","685":"brilliant kelman brings something very real to this narrative by 11 year old harri the fact it is told from the view of an 11 year old makes everything seem that bit more dangerous and pre emptive as you read from the start i couldn't shake that feeling of foreboding harri is a superb character his innocence compares sharply with the more knowledgable traits of some of his fellow friends enemies the juxtaposition of not wanting to step on the cracks in the pavement to the more real fear of knife crime is frightening you can picture the estate these gangs live on all the chracters are very real and the tension is palpable you truly live through this book in the book there is the odd narrative by a pigeon am still thinking on that i feel that it is an outlet for harri's confusion over is new life because although he seems to be getting on okay it is a very different life to the one he led in ghana and his brief sojourns into his past life make that very obvious in ghana he and his friends helped people whilst here in london there is so much stuff going on that is never properly explained and whilst some of it is very serious dangerous stuff to an 11 year old who can't comprehend it it sometimes seems just like make believe because how can some of these things really happen so i think that when harri is really feeling the confusion and not wanting to acknowledge the truth of some situations he projects thoughts onto the pigeon it is probably one of the best books i have read so far this year brilliantly told and realistic sad and funny and told with an inevitability that still manages to shock you read it now","686":"this book was funny and wonderful but devastating it's the sort of book i wish i had read with other friends so we could talk about it it's very different from anything i've read in a while","687":" well written and well observed the knife play in the uk's urban landscapes is rampant to hear the press this book gives a good insight into the forces at work in those estates uk vs immigrant neighborhood vs neighborhood white vs black etc that give rise to violence and misunderstanding i found the book very topical and really did enjoy the use of the pigeon as an omniscient narrative device a clever book a quick read kudos for its originality recognition by the booker committee was indeed well deserved","688":" my day today involved dealing with my fair share of passive aggressive bull so finishing pigeon english this evening helped me fully appreciate how refreshing a voice harri possesses simply saying what he means i understand why this book drew comparisons with curious incident the main character's voice is so unique and his world view so cleverly conveyed as he tells his tale this made for thought provoking reading and i'm looking forward to discussing it in book club the world would be a nicer place if we were all a bit more like harri","689":"a fine quick read","690":"well worth reading thoroughly recommend","691":"thought provoking story told through the eyes of a young ghanian boy recently moved to the uk with mother and sister thoroughly recommend","692":"the narration and style were promising but this book was just all babbling for me it had an interesting plot i've always been fond of anything related to detective work but the novel failed to deliver character development is as essential for me as the plot and this was also my concern with the story i didn't see the growth of the main character i also failed to connect with him and the other characters and even their so called quest in finding out the truth behind the death of their schoolmate the author must have lacked influencers as we know personal style can be achieved in two ways sticking to your innate skills or reading other writers' works and then inculcating your own style eventually it's a series of learning and unlearning of knowing the rules and then breaking them thereafter i've read a couple of crime suspense novels over the past year and admittedly that's a big factor in judging books with the same genre if i may though i believe that the author's style is something that he could develop as it is very interesting inserting conversations in between babbles i think the story would have worked more if the author focused more on the plot instead of insensible banters it's so hard to give poor reviews like this we all know the blood sweat and tears that have been exhausted to put together a certain piece nevertheless we continue to read pieces in every genre to join in our writers' seemingly endless cycle of learning and unlearning so that the next generation will follow suit","693":"this was not an easy book for me to read it took me a really long time to get used to the pigeon english harri uses in the book this book was unlike any other i have read before i can imagine many high school students relating to this book but even though it is told from the perspective of a middle school child i would be hesitant to have a middle schooler read this novel","694":"pigeon english defies definition it is at once a child's novel but with the maturity that sometimes years can bring","695":"4 and 1 2 i don't know that i have ever liked a protagonist as much as i liked this one","696":"i always feel weird marking a book on goodreads when i listened to it on audiobook but here we go this is a remarkable story of harry a recent immigrant from ghana in england while he is 13 harry's neighborhood witnesses the murder of a boy his age harry begins what seems to be a childlike game of detective while capturing fingerprints with tape and asking people for spit samples harry also continues to struggle and thrive through his adolescence girlfriends peer pressure and fights with his sister all color this playful book about serious subject matter but his game of detective is not merely a child's game according to the local gang for them it is a pursuit that could have serious consequences the book unfolds from two perspectives harry's charming child's eye and the thoughts of the pigeon that frequents his windowsill is this pigeon merely a boyhood play thing or could these common birds be something more listening to this book was really satisfying because harry's accent is very charming i personally have a hard time imagining accents when i am reading and for this book it is helpful to hear the different immigrant accents kelman really masters the childlike perspective it reminded me a lot of call it sleep and portrait of an artists both books that apply a meandering child's mind in their narrative i also loved this book because i always thought pigeons were wonderful it is great to see a narrator and an author appreciate and play with their beauty as well","697":"one of the glimpses of lives you're glad you haven't lived in this case in council housing in london kelman's vision of life in the english capital for non white people is harrowing and sad","698":"a fantastic book that looks at gang violence death immigration and poverty through the eyes of a young boy who has just moved to england from ghana the hopeful narrative is reminiscent of the young narrators of the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime mark haddon and the boy in the striped pyjamas john boyne keep an eye on the next issue of viewpoint for a full review but if you can find a copy int he meantime read it","699":"i'm afraid i couldn't finish this the first 50 pages were amazing loved the voice loved the style of writing the pace everything but then it just didn't really go anywhere the story just fell apart and i'm not really sure why perhaps i just got bored i don't know anyway it was disappointing","700":"takes me back to teaching in inner london great writing about seeing a new country from the perspective of an 12 year old ghanian immigrant boy","701":" genre literary fictionpublication date 2011number of pages 263geographical setting london housing projectstime period contemporarythree words or phrases best describing this book child narrator closely observed colloquialplot summary eleven year old harrison opuku recently moved to a london housing project with his mother and older sister while his father baby sister and grandmother remained temporarily in their native ghana his new world has introduced him to knife violence gang dominance abusive relationships and adolescent sexuality yet his infectiously innocent sometimes to the point of naive narration is more concerned with being the fastest kid in year 7 superheroes the latest \"bo styles\" shoes scoring points in made up games with his friends and the well being of a neighborhood pigeon he calls his own yet when harri and a friend decide to use csi inspired techniques to investigate the stabbing death of a neighborhood boy readers can see - even when harri can't - that he is treading in increasingly dangerous waters in an unusual narrative choice kelman intermingles brief passages told from the all knowing perspective of harri's pigeon friend which stand out by being more mature than harri's slang heavy multicultural patois appeal characteristics authentic bittersweet character centered chatty episodic evocative setting exuberant frequent use of dialect and slang insightful issue oriented poignant strong language and violence stream of consciousness urban vividpersonal notes had a really hard time getting into this one even for a school assignment it took me a week to get through abrupt ending made me mad by being simultaneously out of the blue and too predictable an easy way out also the pigeon narrator was weird and unnecessary","702":"solid writing and storytelling i appreciated the immigrant african perspective reality is not for the squeamish redemption costs","703":" i should probably write a long detailed review of this book it really deserves it but i am not the most articulate person and i don't feel i could give it it's due praise in words that would convey how i felt about it i should have known that reading a book in a language other than my own would be difficult i speak american southern english and this is written in london slang english yes i got most of it but much of it was truly a foreign language i still don't know what hutious means and if i never hear innit in real life that will be okay with me here's the thing about this book after a while i didn't care about the language the story had me completely wrapped up harri was such a little charmer so innocent and unaware of the very violent surroundings he and his family were living in the little stories he would tell about his dad grandma and little sister back in ghana were so sweet told against the real life stuff he and his older sister were dealing with living in the projects of london these experiences were as different as night and day i really hated the end that's why i can't give it five stars it really pissed me off but i think that was the author's intention the story ends abruptly and in a way that completely surprised me so much so that i reread the last chapter a few times to make sure i had gotten it right i had and it sucked","704":"gritty compelling disturbing but really worth a read teenage immigrant violence well written and punchy if not a complete pleasure","705":"it took me a while to care about this book though it was quick to read at some point however it won me over and i began to love the main character 11 year old harri and his funny sayings and love of pigeons even though i began to suspect the ending from about half way through i still wanted to see how it would play out and found it a good and affecting read","706":"what the heck man","707":"i wasn't convinced by the pigeon talking but for the rest i loved it and the ending came so abruptly and brutally that it took my breath away uff not an easy read but a fascinating sojourn into a young african immigrant boy's mind out of the ordinary","708":"story builds so delicately in this book as to be almost imperceptible brilliant voice of an 11 year old boy with an child's open eyes when it comes to describing the london estate he lives in his home written with huge warmth for all the characters even the gangs that maraud the estate who come across as children still despite their actions really enjoyed this","709":" reading this was rather an odd experience i enjoyed the switch from harri's narration to the dreamlike 'pigeon' sections i think i'm a little bored of child narrators though and i suppose aside from making me a terrible person i needed something with a little more substance i didn't expect the ending as it seemed too obvious considering the setting and the characters but when it came anyway i found myself a horrid mix of exasperated and tearful i didn't want it to come but it did anyway it was far too predictable the blurb on the cover says that this book will should be discussed in school and although i feel that it's a great example of racial issues inner city life an outsider's view and young love i do feel that this novel has been over hyped i can't remember why i was drawn to it but i don't feel satisfied after reading it","710":" i really wanted to love this book everyone i know has raved about it but it just didn't work for me i love the language choices and the overarching plot is fine but i was really really distracted by the narration style the way he leaps from one topic to another i know children can have a short attention span can flit from one thing to the next but there's usually some stimulus for the change and there isn't here i spent a while wondering whether i've been reading too many pacy simple structured ya books and have somehow become a stupid lazy reader wondering whether i've missed something i hope not but regardless this one's not for me","711":"the story was told with the voice of an 11 year old ghanian immigrant to london and a resident of a public housing project the naivete of the narrator was engaging to a point but inconsistent his observations had humor but at times wisdom beyond his years overall an enjoyable read but not amazing i may have enjoyed it more had i not just read house which also had a child narrator","712":"a beautiful book about a young ghanaian boy's love letter to his new homeland the end will devastate you","713":"found this book to be boring just went on and on in an odd way didn't finish it","714":"funny sad uplifting tragic intelligent harri's experiences as an 11 year old immigrant to uk from ghana speak much of urban life in a truly enthralling manner","715":"insightful e g 'girls love it when you give them presents it means you're serious about them girls always want you to be serious about them otherwise they worry too much and it's not fun anymore ' p 228","716":"first the good i enjoyed the overall story of harrison and dean's investigation into the murder of the dead boy and i felt that i was able to see harrison's world through his eyes perfectly when you're 11 years old it's impossible not to see the world with fascination and wonder and this comes through loud and clear from mr kelman's narrator there were times when i read a passage and immediately was taken back to being a middle school student and knew i felt the exact same way this is quite a feat considering my middle school experience can in no way compare to harrison's and perhaps speaks to the underlying reality that on some level children do experience similar revelations when confronted with similar events regardless of the way or place they experience these events i also felt that underlying themes such as the randomness of violence and that even in a difficult life certain children will still respond with happiness were made without hitting you over the head with them finally i appreciated some of the nuances of the character of harrison he is a child with a good heart who is nonetheless attracted to the security a gang might provide but ultimately rejects the gang as he slowly learns how reprehensible its members actually are but i only liked this novel because mr kelman allows his narrator too much leeway to drift into meaningless observations and because i found it difficult for the first 100 pages or so to get into the mind of harrison due to the use of an invented childlike vocabulary donkey hours hutious dope fine bo styles too much of what harrison comments on felt like mr kelman trying to drive the point home that harrison is 11 and that he's trying to channel that voice in a faithful way i understand the need to do this especially for a first time author like mr kelman but it was done too bluntly and with too much repetition it is mr kelman's responsibility to corral his fictional charge from time to time to keep the focus on the story and not necessarily on the nonsensical thoughts that will of course pop into the perspective of an 11 year old i can understand falling in love with a character you've created but a character should primarily be a way of animating the content of a tale and not every little idle thought of the character is going to do this i am certain others will disagree with me and say that the vocabulary and the seemingly unfocused musings of harrison are necessary to really understand the story but for me personally i found both of these issues to be distracting and that they ultimately detracted from the novel","717":"i picked this up as it was recommended for readers who enjoyed 'room' one of my favourite books of last year this is also written from the perspective of a child an 11 year old ghanian immigrant to london the author has done a wonderful job of getting inside this young boy's head and i found the narrative to be authentic and genuinely believable the book exposes the dangers of inner city life for young children and the most shocking theme is their innocent acceptance of horrors around them the lead character has infectious enthusiasm for his new life in london and all through the book you so hope there is going to be a happy ending","718":"this character's unique voice will be hard to forget","719":" i tried to read this all the way through but in the end i just gave up it was just too hard i was not convinced by the 'writing as if a child' style and aswah it ended up being quite irritating admittedly the book went nowhere and was probably an accurate depiction of life as a child however it failed to capture my interest or attention i laboured on for lack of other books in the house to read i think these attempts to write from a child's perspective genre are very much an acquired taste sorry mr kelman i was unconvinced","720":" i loved this book getting insight into a young boy from ghana in england harrison's bright kind at his core and completely fascinating i could have just read along for pages especially when he describes awesome things as bo styles tells his sister to advise yourself and points out when someone's being a confusionist pick it up now as this book brings such a unique refreshing and enjoyable perspective if you liked oscar wao you will fall in love with harrison even more and now not really a spoiler but an indicator the ending is pretty devastating for me and this is coming from someone who doesn't believe happiest endings are the right thing devastating so if you don't want to go through the pain skip the last 2 pages","721":"really captures the confusion of being a child and not understanding the adult world harri's world is even more confusing b c he's a recent immigrant from ghana to london he lives in public housing and manages to survive amidst violence drugs etc loved the narration by the pigeon ending is tragic","722":"it's never a good sign when you can't wait for a book to be over or find yourself wanting to skim paragraphs or skip pages altogether and now that i've finished the book thank god i realized i wouldn't have missed anything had i skipped pages the narrator an 11 year old boy was so unbelievable and i never felt any sense of endearment towards him in fact his thoughts actions and words would have made much more sense had the author chosen his age to be 7 or 8 comparisons of this book to room and the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime are not accurate at all and do a disservice to these books if i ever read or hear the words hatious bo styles or dey touch i just might scream","723":"2 5 3 stars i became less interested in it as the story went on because the ending seemed fairly obvious and turns out i guessed correctly and the main character's manner of speaking and slang became tedious and less amusing","724":"a different child's voice interesting","725":"good concept fell a bit flat unconvincing narrative voice as someone else has said on here it's exceptionally difficult to write a good child narrator and this author misses the mark i was a bit bored by it to be honest","726":"interesting book took a while to get used to the slang terms thank goodness for the glossary in the back entertaining once you get into the language of it","727":" harrison an 11 year old recently arrived in london from ghana describes his daily life of school family life and gang violence with a curious mixture of naivety and sharp observation how authentic his pigeon english vernacular is i cannot judge but his character feels right and commands our sympathy but there is an altogether different aspect to this book enter the pigeon a real bird that is as a visitor of harri's 9th floor balcony who he tries to feed and talk to as a friend co conspirator and alter ego \"i waited for the wind to move then i put a nice big pile of flour on the handrail i spread it out proper long so the pigeon could see it from miles away adjei the wind came back quick quick and blew it off \" and then he sees a robber is it the murderer you suspect where this is going the pigeon accompanies harri throughout the story and on and off is talking to us readers in italicised paragraphs which i find de trop at the very end in an otherworldly dialogue between harri and the pigeon the pigeon is being transformed into some kind of holy spirit an overdose of symbolism may be getting the better of the story at this moment this is compounded by some weakness in the plot we find out towards the end that harri has actually been witnessing the other boy's murder but must have been too traumatised to acknowledge to himself in that light one could see the various twists and turns of harri's detective work as mere detours to the inexorable path between the murders at the beginning and the end however funny or insightful they may be in their own right","728":"in 1993 we had roddy doyle winning the booker with \"paddy clarke ha ha ha\" as told through the eyes of a 10 year old and in 2003 we had d b c pierre's \"vernon god little\" told by the 15 year old vernon last year emma donoghue brought us jack a 5 year old who has spent his whole life in one room this year we have harri an 11 year old ghanaian recently arrived in britain and living in a council high rise according to \"the independent\" this debut novel \"was the subject of a 12 publisher six figure bidding war \"whereas roddy doyle dealt with deteriorating home relationships and irish struggles and vernon told his story of being wrongly accused of a texan shooting and jack spoke of his wonder for all things bigger than his room \"pigeon english\" draws the innocence of youth together with the harsh reality of gang violence alienation in a new country whilst wanting to be accepted single parenting not by choice but by necessity and the simple joys of being young for a full review visit my blog at www messybooker blogspot com","729":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a book club picked and not at all what i expected glad i read it but it really knocked me flat as i hadn't realised the damiola taylor link would be so strong i wasn't sure it would end sweetly but told through such playful yet knowing prose of a child it was hard for me to guess","730":"witty and fascinating simple and sad this novel accomplishes much more than it's slight size and readability may at first suggest through the eyes of an 11 year old ghanaian boy harrison opoku growing up in a tough housing project in london kelman mixes sensitive observations of childhood with tragic realities of immigrant fears and rough neighborhood violence the story is slight sort of a vehicle for the distinctive and memorable child voice of harri i didn't really get the pigeon's role as guardian and friend to the little boy but i loved harri's multicultural slang his sweetness and innocence despite all that he sees happen and i appreciated how the author infused such an ultimately sad story with humor and pathos i'd give this 3 5 stars","731":"it is a geniunely funny book there was no story to it really so i put it down there probably would be a story if i kept on reading however","732":"strange sad and enjoyable i have definitely never read a book with a pigeon narrator before i found harri an engaging protagonist but can see how he might have annoyed other readers","733":"i found this book quite boring and difficult to read especially as i read it over christmas the ending left me feeling drained which i suppose was the intention","734":"a lot of things to love about this book unique narrative voice interesting thoughts on death and the human experience quirky and charming main character but the whole pigeon as guardian angel angle was off putting also the ending but no spoilers here so that's all i'm going to say about that","735":"an interesting perspective on gang violence i was so caught up in the little boys world that his actions and decisions seemed natural i saw how i've judged the urban poor and gangs as well this book doesn't take away the fact of the effect of gang violence but it does help you see them more as people and understand a little why a young boy might want to be in one","736":"fights with siblings first loves and those particular to immigrants homesickness mourning the absence of those who have been left behind in ghana the naively child eleven year old harri has come to britain from ghana with his mother and sister and is thrust into the unfamiliar lifestyle of a schoolkid in a deprived area of london once there he struggles as children do to make sense of events unfolding around him i was struck by the juxtaposition of those events which happen to us all  fights with siblings first loves  and those particular to immigrants  homesickness mourning the absence of those who have been left behind in ghana the naively childlike narrative voice was especially well written and the ending was absolutely perfectly pitched although not entirely unexpected this thoroughly deserves to win the man booker prize for which it has been shortlisted this year","737":"few people like full frontal preaching even if they actually agree with the hard issues intoned by such sermons many writers have found that looking at heavy topics trough the innocent eyes of children can make such normally slowly digestible affairs go down easier i read one earlier this year in to kill a mocking bird a master piece in such use of literary device and no found myself reading another because i received this novel as a souvenir far from the segregated south this novel chooses impoverished immigrant communities of london area as its environment narrated by an eleven year old boy former resident of ghana we get a innocent view of the life where youth gangs roam the playgrounds and the school halls and crime is almost a given for some the social commentary almost slips by out of focus on the sides of a boy living the roller coaster ride of early teens with all the pumps and exhilaration the slightly outer cultural view of the protagonist harri bring humorous attention to details of his surrounding every day life and cultural structures and his mind moving with the relentless pace of his youthful vigor keeps the story rolling forward at a leisurably swift speed still kelman doesn't sugarcoat even is main boy but keeps the reader on his her toes holding on to his reader's outsider view instead of forgetting him herself and just going with the story the novel in all its happiness and humour doesn't let the reader forget about the cruel circumstances surrounding the youngster's journey the novel is very readable and at some points quite fun but it was no to kill kelman was sometimes so interested in making the reader laugh sometimes with quite easy jokes that i was left hoping for a more gripping exploration of the social setting then again perhaps its my personal distance talking perhaps i could relate more with the prejudices outlines in to kill as it probably spoke more to me as a pretty well to do citizen of the 21th century finland but still overall i kinda felt the novel let the reader of a tad too easily than again i am being unfair with my comparison but it is the one i made because of the styles of the two novels","738":" for such a slim volume it took me surprisingly long to read that's because i was filled with dread every time i picked it up i knew that every page would deepen my affection for harri the main protagonist and narrator of the story and that the pain i anticipated feeling by the end of the novel would be acute kelman skilfully weaves together the sweet ebullience of harri with the ever present malevolence of his deprived london environment the cast of misfits such as take away terry and his aunt's dubious relationship with a baseball bat yielding monster are viewed with a matter of factness that belies the author's political intent in writing this book for harri is not naive for all his superstitions he understands who is responsible for his aunt's injuries he understands that the gang members are potential murderers yet it is seeing this damaged dangerous world through harri's eyes that ultimately was a transformative experience for the author and is also for the reader the inevitability of harri's fate recalls richard's wright's 'native son' and yet perhaps that inevitability only exists inside the structure of a novel for it is kelman's aim to remind us that even amidst the most unjust and tragic circumstances we would do well to cling to the big hearted joy and positivity personified by harrison opoku for why stephen kelman wrote this book in his own words http www guardian co uk childrens b","739":"this is about a boy recently arrived from ghana to england with his older sister and mother he loves birds and speaks to the pigeons he lives in a very rough area in london after a boy is murdered he and his friend play detective the writing is good it portrays life in a tough environment it wasn't the type of book i normally enjoy to read","740":" i would have liked to hear more from the pigeon no actually that's not true harri's repetitious boring style grates very quickly and i thought to begin with that the voice in italics would be a bit of relief which just goes to show that i'm not much good at thinking the voice in italics turned out to be a pigeon come on in the words of big john mcenroe you cannot be serious plot so thin as to be utterly transparent two narrative voices that are properly vexing this doesn't have an awful lot going for it it's a pity as the story of damilola taylor needs to be told","741":"awful couldn't even finish it","742":"you laugh at the innocence until the hard tragedy strikes you","743":"i love the way the author has captured the african voice and spirit of the protagonist if you have lived in any african country or have worked with african children you will find harri's voice so truthful you'll really live the story with him advise yourself","744":" for me this book succeeded where 'room' failed it presents a complicated and hostile world through an innocent child's eyes in a way that made me feel as though young harri was relaying his story exclusively to me as though we were friends underneath harri's innocence and humour some of his observations made me laugh out loud as i read them this book has a serious social and political feel familiar to anyone who lives in britain right now i'd be interested to know how people from outside the uk felt about the book and story and some of the phrases and language and is i feel a book firmly of its time and a very important book i loved this book for the journey it took me on and although i've finished it harri's voice is still in my mind highly recommended","745":" this booker prize longlisted novel is narrated by harrison opuku an 11 year old boy who has recently emigrated to an impoverished south london neighborhood along with his mother and older sister while his father and baby sister remain behind in ghana his mother works long hours as a midwife and he and his sister lydia are left mainly to fend for themselves harri is a good boy although a bit naive in comparison to his classmates and the boys in the neighborhood he lacks a father or other adult male authority figure that he can relate to and falls under the influence of a local gang of older boys who terrorize younger kids in his school and conduct random acts of violence in the neighborhood with little deterrence from the adults who live there or the local police who are generally viewed as incompetent and hostile the novel opens with the stabbing death of a schoolboy on a sidewalk near harri's flat harri does not know the boy well as he is older and goes to another school but he and his friends vow to find out who murdered him inspired by the american television show csi the boys use their fledging detective skills to spy on potential suspects and gather fingerprints and other specimens from the crime scene harri is generally well liked by his classmates as he is a fast runner and a good fighter and he eagerly participates in typical boyhood pranks and games his home life is a bit dull as his older sister finds him to be a bother and he befriends a pigeon who serves as a companion confidant and guardian angel as the story progresses the identity of the boy's killer is obvious to the reader but not to harri whose investigation intensifies as he gathers more clues and puts himself in danger pigeon english was written in honor of damilola taylor a 10 year old nigerian boy who was murdered in 2000 in the south london neighborhood of peckham along with other children in the uk who experience fear and violence on a daily basis and is also based on the author's own childhood experiences and people he encountered as a child and young adult harrison's voice and character are maddening lovable and ultimately unforgettable and this is one of the better coming of age stories that i've read the novel's main flaw is the character of the guardian pigeon whose comments i found inscrutable and whose presence was unnecessary and distracting which caused me to knock half a star off of my rating of this otherwise superb novel it is also a very timely one given the recent acts of violence in impoverished neighborhoods in south london and elsewhere i doubt that pigeon english will win this year's booker prize or even make the shortlist but it is a novel that was enjoyable and deserves to be widely read","746":"difficult to read","747":"wow a fast read that is very hard to put down the setting and narrator feel so real i loved it","748":" fun fact when i was checking this book out at the store i

from a kids perspective interesting and thought provoking the whole way through","750":"i followed frances' advice and listened to this book the narrator did a good job with the different voices however i just did not like what this book was about senseless violence amongst young people perhaps it was too real i would have like to have spent this time listening to something else","751":" this book was described as being like the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime because of the narrator a 10 or 11 year old boy it is similar in that the reader knows more than the narrator even though all of our information comes through the narrator as adults and members of this society we can interpret events and actions better than harrison can the story is funny touching and sad horrifying even but not surprising like some other books it takes a real event and fictionalises it so in some ways the ending is a foregone conclusion i didn't love it but it was a good read","752":"the innocence of the 11 year old ghanaian protagonist contrasted starkly with his experience of life growing up in his new inner city london home being narrated through his young eyes made the subject even more harrowing and the ending though abrupt was a perfect reflection of how fragile life in such places can be","753":"clever and well thought out very disturbing due to the fact that you know this is reality","754":"writing is fresh its funny and alarming at the same time","755":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here pigeon english is the story of an eleven year old boy who has recently moved from ghana to london a boy who is full of hope and innocence despite being placed in the middle of a community which apppears to lack both

surrounding him although the book has a heartbreakingly tragic and hopeless ending pigeon english is the story of an eleven year old boy who has recently moved from ghana to london a boy who is full

but his relentless naivety prevents him from being dragged down by the circumstances and events surrounding him although the book has a heartbreakingly tragic and hopeless ending it did in my opinion remain full of optimism throughout as an example of how someone can remain positive in the face of profound negativity more","756":"i wanted to like this more than i did it was a good concept but just not that well executed the main character from whose perspective the story is told is very endearing but the narrative voice got a little tiresome at times the other characters weren't really well fleshed out there were a few sections told from the perspective of a pigeon the boy was fond of which were just kind of odd i read that this was short listed for the man booker prize the year that sense of an ending won and i have to say they made the right call on awarding that one","757":" the powerful ending of this book added an extra star to my rating one amazon reviewer commented that this book is what little bee should have been you tube has several excellent interviews with the author for anyone curious about the nature of the book i'm not sure i could have worked my way through a print copy i needed a recorded version to follow the language which i'm sure is a faithful rendition of children's communications in mixed immigrant housing projects in england i felt while listening to it reminders of the exhilaration anxiety delight and sorrow i felt in my 20's when substitute teaching for rough grade schools in richmond california the narrator harri will stay in my heart for a long time and i may want to listen again to his story several times","758":" this book is just amazing and very poignant i really love books that are written from a child's point of view and i think the author of pigeon english captured that perspective perfectly i fell in love with harri and was absolutely crushed by the ending even though i had a feeling it was coming i closed the book lay down on the couch and sobbed for a good twenty minutes only one other book has ever made me cry like that i know a lot of people had issues with the pigeon part but i actually really liked that part i thought of it as some kind of metaphor for how we all treat each other","759":" the forced innocence was way too much for me the child narrative gives the story an interesting feel but you just know from the start that bad things are bound to happen drama disaster and a lot of tears oh dear oh dear and what about that pigeon vague and well boring it's a nice idea but poorly executed the story is worth it with funny anecdotes and an occasional laugh but i got seriously annoyed by the childishness of it all and was contemplating on not finishing it halfway through the novel or so i just couldn't help imagining how this the author a grown up man was trying to think like a 11 year old","760":"3 5 stars i really enjoyed harri's voice i didn't get the pigeon's though","761":"i really liked this i didn't get it straight away but after a short way in i was just carried along by the narrator who is cast into the alien world of year 7 in a london comp the reason he won me over was the language comical but perceptive and his sheer goodness he never gives up hope even whem maybe he should the ending though flagged in some of the cover reviews still comes as a nasty shock its deep wrongness and the hope are what remains with me a modern classic","762":" i read this book very quickly as i was drawn in by the story and the central characters and it is a very easy read being written in the voice of an eleven year old boy a few odd words and expressions presumably from ghanaian english crop up so frequently that their meaning soon becomes familiar the book gives an insight into the lives of children growing up in areas where gang rivalry and knife culture - casual violence in general it seems - are prevalent i am lucky in that i have no idea as to whether it is an accurate insight but it certainly seems convincing one of the recommendations on the back cover likens it to the curious incident of the dog in the night time and that seems like an accurate comparison in that both stories involve boys who are somewhat out of their depth trying to solve a mystery whereas in dog in the night time the style is so idiosyncratic because of the narrator's autism here it is because the narrator is only eleven and freshly arrived from west africa the book also features the most eloquent pigeon imaginable but never veers into annoying magic realism territory overall i found it an endearing but tense read thoroughly gripping and enjoyable and because of its unusual style and how it sheds light on a world about which many of us only hear from news reports i suspect it will be memorable up to a point but as i hardly found it earth shattering i'm only giving it three stars 'liked it' a note to the book designer though the bird on the back cover is a woodpigeon columba palumbus not a feral pigeon columba livia do more research before incorporating library images on book covers","763":"really wonderful harri is an interesting and novel narrator and provides a quirky and beautifully innocent view on his tower block life in london moving funny poignant really loved this book","764":"charm and peril are on full display in stephen kelman's first novel a finalist for the 2011 booker prize pigeon english is based on the true tale of a 10 year old nigerian who was murdered in london in 2000 by other boys just a few years older that death sentence hangs at the end of this story but kelman writes in such a buoyant delightful voice that you'll want to forget where the novel is headed despite some ominous reminders along the way in a narrative that jumps and darts like its young narrator in a new pair of \"trainers \" harrison opuku tells us about anything that comes to mind from all the crazy new english words he's learning to the \"dope fine\" model cars he collects in his room in a london housing project but throughout he struggles to make sense of the senseless violence around him when the story opens harrison and another seventh grader are staring at the blood left by an older boy who was murdered for his chicken dinner \"you wanted to touch it \" he admits \"but you couldn't get close enough \" inspired by the tv show \"csi \" harrison and his friend decide to solve the murder searching for dna \"just a load of colours\" interviewing suspects and watching the crime scene through plastic binoculars \"we're proper detectives now \" harrison says \"it's a personal mission \" but he'd also like to try sleeping in the washing machine and cramming four jawbreakers into his mouth that mixture of ridiculous observations and accidental insights makes \"pigeon english\" continually surprising and endearing \"have you heard of youtube it's a place on the internet just for films of things eating each other \" whether he's explaining the rules of farting or the tragedy of gang killings there's a sweetness here that's irresistible it's a shame though that kelman didn't resist adding a touch of \"jonathan livingston seagull \" several chapters open with the italicized voice of harrison's pet pigeon a birdbrain who tweets out portentous lines like \"we live and breathe within the boundaries of our charges we reach out for them when the bridge between them and their god is blocked \" fly away you winged rat and let us enjoy harrison just a little while longer http www washingtonpost com enterta","765":"i really enjoyed this book brought back alot of memories of the news of damilola taylor back in 2000 in the uk very well written","766":"if someone asked me to describe this book in just a few words i'd say that pigeon english is this year's room and that because the narrator is a young boy here as well but not one kept in captivity but an immigrant that arrives to london from ghana with his mother and older sister and having to live in a housing project which feels like a ghetto is trying hard to adapt to this new reality harrison opuku is a boy gifted with lots of imagination and love for the others as well a kid like the kids used to be before the digital era arrived with all its side effects hard and tender at the same time poor but satisfied with his life a big dreamer but above all someone who cares about other people the hard facts of his life so far may have made him a bit more mature than other kids of his age but the cruelty of this world did not manage to take away his goodness if he becomes strong headed and hard every now and then he does so in order to survive and he'd never try to bring harm to anyone at least not intentionally harri if nothing else is someone who knows how to love he loves his mother who's trying quite unsuccessfully to put the fear of god or rather of her into him to give him discipline he loves his sister lydia who every now and then seems to be somehow losing it but most of all he loves agnes his little sister who's stayed behind in ghana and who's going through a serious illness and he sure loves his dad and misses him since he was left behind too harri however doesn't only care about playing all day or just for his family he also cares about the people around him especially if something bad comes their way anything bad and that's exactly what happened to a boy his age who was killed for his lunch harri having his friend dean by his side is determined to find out who the killer is since the police doesn't really seem to care that much and bring him to justice of course it will not prove so easy to accomplish this mission due to the lack of experience and founding however using tricks they pick up from csi and their very special binoculars the boys will set out on a journey of discovery during it harri will come to learn and understand more about the country that's now his home and will also start creating new words while throwing in a few aphorisms for good measure every now and then as well \"i do know the shape of a mother's grief\" \"grown ups love sad news it gives them something special to pray for\" \"laughing is the best way to make them admire you\" \"that's why people wave to each other because it makes them belong\" wearing his new shoes which are definitely bo styles he'll also come to realize that he's the best runner at school and that will prove handy in a number of occasions the narration though even it has at its epicenter harri's everyday life is also used as a tool to criticize the modern english society a society where crime became a way of life for many kids where the people living in the poor areas feel and are excluded from the equal opportunities that everyone talks about but no one is working hard enough to establish and where the authorities do not do too much to stop things that are considered disgraceful when happening in the third world countries from taking place on their own turf kelman seems to have taken over the body and the mind of his narrator so his voice sounds more than convincing harri is an eleven year old kid and he sounds exactly like that he may have been through a lot already but his soul remains pure childish but also kind of sly and curious this is a great novel about growing up and coming to terms with the world around you and is highly recommended to anyone who's interested in good literature","767":"moving lovely","768":" this one was my pick for episode 5 of the unpr ntable podcast and i chose it because i felt it was a near perfect example of how a writer can inhabit a character to the point at which you forget you're reading about them and actually begin to see the world through their eyes yes a little sentimentality creeps in yes the plot is not exactly complicated no this book will not change literature as we know it put those things aside it's worth reading just to enjoy how thoroughly kelman has succeeded in the deceptively simple task of making a character come to life","769":"this book may not for everybody but somehow i like how stephen kelman told the story through the eyes of 11 years old boy from ghana who just moved to england reading this book was taking me back to my childhood memories and how did it feel to be a kid the innocence and how they harri saw the world amazed me but i sort of didn't like the ending since there was so many possibilities that could happen to harri however though this book was shortlisted for man's booker prize in 2011 the sense of an ending is way better and no surprise that it won the prize give it a shot and you will find back your childhood memories as you turn this book page by page","770":" just realised i hadn't written a review for this after so long this was a great book raced through it just waiting for the moment there'd be some kind of happy event that brings harrison and his family closer together and shed a ray of light towards the future alas this is not that kind of book and that's probably why it was hard for me to say how i felt about it immediately afterwards won't spoil the plot for you it's a great book if you like novels narrated by young boys figuring out their way through a tough world like extremely loud and incredibly close or about a boy","771":"i didn't like the ending it almost felt like a cop out why not write a bit more and wrap it up","772":"not for the faint hearted i cried for about half hour and it still haunts me a little beautifully written and the protagonist is created in a gentle and heart tugging manner you just fall in love","773":"1 i decided to read pigeon english written by stephen kelman because i got it for a present and it looked like a interesting book to read the book is about a boy called harri and his family who newly arrived from ghana to england 2 a character in pigeon english i found interesting was harri because he has to adapted to his new environment and learn the tricks of urban survival he also starts up a murder investigation when a boy was knifed to death and the police had no witnesses 3 my favorite quote from the book is \" you all want to be the sea but you're not the sea you're just a raindrop \" i liked this quote because it tells us that we are only individually a part of the wider world for example while harri tried to solve the murder he found out alot about the world around him and himself 4 something new that i thought more deeply about from reading this book was that when things come your way you have to adapted fast and keep going forward","774":"struggled with this and one of few books i didnt finish","775":"i really liked it except for the ending boo","776":" the rain keeps falling the sea keeps raising you keep going you keep going out of spite or with magnificent defiance you keep going through steely instinct or by cotton wool consensus you keep going because you're made that way you keep going and we love you for it we miss you when you're gone the best quote from the book that eleven years old boy try to be the man of the house to protect his family knowing and without knowing the thread around him but he is strong and always keep going love him and the story the ending t_t","777":" there is a frightening irony about this story by stephan kelman the reader finds herself willing the narrator a recent immigrant to return to the peace and security of his african village and so escape the jungle of a modern british housing estate kelman doesn't pull any punches as he describes through the eyes of this eleven year old ghanaian the dangers which beset the young and the old the handicapped and the marginalised in the the modern urban ghetto a grim underworld where senseless knifings have become everyday topics of conversation even among young children this story needs to be told and kelman does it well harri opoku's voice is a compelling one swinging easily between innocence and experience there have been other popular 'hindered' narrators in recent fiction eg mark haddon's fifteen year old autistic boy or john boyne's nine year old boy in the striped pyjamas and it is certainly a huge challenge for a writer to create an accurate rendering of a child's thoughts kelman succeeds most of the time and the 'pidgin' patois with which harri's speech is sprinkled helps to make the his voice ring true the pigeon's voice worked less well","778":"the premise of this book was interesting but i realized that i don't really care for british writing","779":" 4 5 5 starswow what to say i just finished and the ending really got me i just fell in love with this little boy this story is told through harri's voice an 11yr old who recently emigrated from ghana to the housing projects of london him and his friend decide to investigate a murder this story is so much more than their investigation harri's innocense of the threats around him touched my heart how he said if he was in the gang he would tell them about god and about good missions he really was so naive i found the view of inner city life told through harri's voice very touching i laughed at some points and found other parts so very sad i do have to say i did not see the relevence of the pigeon i thought it was harri's way of talking to god mamma says giving up is a sin it's the same as lying it's even worse than that because it's lying to yourself","780":"possibly my favourite book ever i first encountered pigeon english as an audiobook and loved it so much i bought a paperback copy to keep on my shelf","781":"really loving this so far i marked it as mystery but it is a mystery like to kill a mockingbird or the curious incident of the dog in the night time is a mystery there are puzzling elements in the novel but they are not necessarily what drives the story all the time","782":"when you are over halfway through a book and you want to skip pages chapters just so it can be finished is never a sign for a good read i had trouble enjoying the narration what with all the mentions of 'asweh' 'bo styles' and 'hutios' in pretty much every single sentence the plot was far too slow at developing seemed very unreal and lacked the availability to keep my interest the only reason i gave 1 star at all is because for some reason i liked the beginning i had hope that the story was going to develop into something great i am so very glad that i finished this book quickly so that i don't ever have to read or think about it again spoilers do not read i did not like how the pigeon actually started to have a voice and narrate the story i found this unnecessary the part that prevented me from enjoying this book was that the young 11 year old kid is forced to snog and very inappropriately touch the friend of his older sister while his sister was right there watching","783":"i actually finished this a while ago now and can't really remember what i thought of it except that it was really quite absorbing and i really didn't like the ending","784":"the narrator's language is a mixed of london youth slang and the immigrant's english and then the pigeon speaks it's trite and tiring to read it's about knife violence in london council estates but the story drags the main plotline often is forgotten the ending was a cop out","785":"this was a very enjoyable read viewing life on a rough estate through the eyes of 11 year old ghanian immigrant harri viewing everything from harri's point of view is most enjoyable even the most mundane of things is imbued with wonder and innocence my only complaint would be the ending i found it rather abrupt and left me rather unsatisfied like there was so much more still to say that apart the book is wonderfully crafted totally engrossing and well worth reading","786":" this never lived up to the hype for me while parts were interesting because of the milieu the 11 year old voice never quite convinced the forced naivete for comedy in particular seemed thin and the pigeon based mysticism really was just silly too serious to be comedy too lame to be serious yes the end packs a startling punch but that does not make up for the meandering lulls that precede it the book dawdles quite a bit without making that dawdling rewarding don't quite understand the hype would seem a bit trite if not ripped from the headlines remember se hinton books this is that for now but somehow hyped as deep","787":"by the end of this book i was hooked i found it a fascinating and disturbing account of a lively young lad's interaction with the world around him gangs knife crime precocious teenage girls 'in' trainers separation from his native ghana i was unconvinced of the use of the pigeon figure but didn't let this put me off","788":"3 5paints a nice picture of a young immigrant boy in england in his own words","789":" i like man booker books i like reading them but every once in a while i can't help but think some of them are just overrated my mood usually affects my overall liking of the book i'm currently reading and i was in a pretty down mood when i was reading pigeon english but to be honest i don't think my thoughts would differ even if i was in my most cheery self i'm sure mr kelman has created some loveable characters but sadly i could feel no sympathy towards any of them yes even harri i don't want to sound coldhearted yes the story is a sad one and the ending is even sadder but that didn't really help me to enjoy reading this book at all i hate it when a book lacks spirit and this book didn't have any for me it misses that certain spark that makes you enjoy reading i hated the slangs i hated the random ranting and if it wasn't an e book i think i would just throw it across the room every time i read asweh and advise yourself i contented myself with grunting instead","790":"this is one of the best books i read this year the character of harri young but old illiterate but smart endearing but off putting was fascinating to me i liked the way the author put us right into harry's mind but other critics may say that the author could never know this child's experience the description of harri's first impression of the ocean was one of the most interesting passages i have ever read","791":"it was ok not as good as i thought it would be","792":" stephen kelman is a very accomplished writer the voice he has created in eleven year old harrison opoku is authentic hilarious and as close to perfection as it gets and the dialogue took my breath away there is an air of menace around the story which i really enjoyed because it kept me turning the pages the dark undertone was perfectly balanced by harrison's cheery lovable demeanor and the book looks seriously at some important social issues the only thing i didn't like about the novel were the chapters written from the point of view of the pigeon they were unnecessary added nothing to the development of the characters and novel and almost got in the way of the rest of the story but this is truly an amazing accomplishment and i recommend it heartily","793":"pigeon english features aspects of gang crime and 'youth culture' in england especially those gangs who target young children either to join them or to make them their next victim i love how the book is written so well from the perspective of an eleven year old and for me this is justified when i can actually hear harri in my head as i'm reading his thoughts who'd have thought a middle aged man would be able to capture the thoughts of an eleven year old so... perfectly i mentioned before that the plot just jumps from one thing to another often being put on hold with an interaction with a minor character but in actual fact this just adds to harri's character i mean the mind of an eleven year old is everywhere and just not in focus on one thing and the way the book is written reflects that you can read more of my review here theres spoilers me linking the review to my blog http minasalcove wordpress com 2013","794":"this book is about a kid from a ghanian family living on a rough council estate in london and his experiences after seeing a murdered child it's told in a very authentic voice the writing very emotive the bullies hurt me the murder worried me i felt for the family still at home in africa and i hoped he'd get through still the same go for it full off life kid there was one irritating note which was that there was a pigeon whose voice could only be 'heard' by the reader it really spoiled it the ending was sad and strange and explained the device of the pigeon but in my opinion anyway the book would have been improved without it to sum up it's really an interesting book and a tear jerker strangely for one so politically relevant but a warning it might annoy some american readers with a lot of unfamiliar words and different accents these words are also unfamiliar to a lot of british people not living in that area but there are so many accents and dialects in the uk english is a less homogenous language than in the us maybe that it doesn't really annoy anyone the book is especially recommended to those who haven't forgotten the way the police and judiciary treated the murder of damilola taylor whom this book is obviously about may the little boy rip http en wikipedia org wiki death_of inadequate to say the least but at least details of the crime if not the police response","795":"beautiful haunting ans unsettling has a real feel of a modern classic but

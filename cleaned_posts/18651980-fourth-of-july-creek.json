after 100 pages of this i was so depressed i wanted to stick my head in the oven i usually like the darker side of life but this was too much for me it was well written and i wouldn't be afraid to try another book by the author but not this one","2":"an expanded version of my esquire review midway through fourth of july creek--smith henderson's wise gripping debut novel--a woman describes her mind as an old time dresser like an apothecary cabinet its dozens of drawers containing buttons that represent the different kinds of trauma she endured as a foster child and troubled adult sometimes she gets new buttons faster than she can put them away sometimes they spill out this seems true for all of henderson's emotionally broken characters often injured by their upbringing so that they drink smoke steal run lie brawl screw their way through life pete snow--a social worker in tenmile montana in the early eighties--drinks too much and cares too much \"i'm a disaster can't wait to happen \" he says which applies as much to him as his clients they live in rusted out trailers and splintery cabins their dogs bite their yards and living rooms are heaped with trash their hands seem to always be reaching for a cigarette or gun snow can't keep up with all the bruised malnourished hollow eyed children that populate this mountain community he cares for them obsessively--even as he neglects his own wrecked family then benjamin pearl enters his life a nearly feral boy living up in the mountains with his bible thumping rifle toting survivalist father jeremiah who attracts local and then national attention for his apocalyptic beliefs and anti government harangues and eventual murder of a parole officer snow earns jeremiah's trust and then ends up in the center of an fbi manhunt while also searching for his runaway daughter the assured voice the rich characterization the majestic setting the political backdrop the sweeping plot the great american novelness of it all doesn't seem like it should be the product of a debut novelist but it is henderson is the real deal","3":"i think this is very good writing but the rare occasion occurred i never became interested in the people or the plot","4":"3 stars for plot 4 stars for writing it's 1979 and pete snow is a social worker in rural montana he moved there leaving his 13 year old daughter with his wife who was unfaithful he meets jeremiah pearl a paranoid survivalist who lives in the woods and believes the end of the world is near and jeremiah's young son over the course of the novel we see pete's family fall even further apart and we learn more of jeremiah's story the book is beautifully written but depressing in its view of the family","5":"lol i am not sure what all the hype was about for this book as i did not care for it too big too long and i still am not sure why the chapters with his daughter narrating where included i guess sometimes i just don't get it","6":"this one blew me away with its passion and poetry from the soul of a social worker in rural montana in the early 80's pete works for child protective services in a remote region in the northwestern part of the state near glacier national park people live here for the freedom that isolation brings but the dangers there make the interdependence within the community especially important many people are humane nature lovers or competent salt of the earth types others are nuts survivalists or criminals hiding out pete works with all walks of life in trying to find solutions for children at risk he has to make many tough choices often making placements that fail the trust he tries to build with the kids and he frequently takes great personal risks dealing with parents who violently resist his interference his most compelling case concerns the welfare of an 11 year old boy ben who is living in care of his religious fanatic father jeremiah pearl on the run in the wilderness he believes the end times are near and is paranoid of any conventional authority he seems to have some scheme to expose a federal monetary conspiracy by distributing coins with holes punched in them pete braves his violence and guns to try to help ben and works over time to gain enough trust to check on the status of jeremiah's wife and several other kids the interest of the fbi and other federal agencies in jeremiah as a suspect in domestic terrorism makes it more difficult and dangerous for pete to resolve the mystery of jeremiah and fate of his family the writing is fresh and constantly surprising in its interplay between third person and second person narrative interspersing of dialog and dreams and breaks into omniscient visions or imagined interviews with unknown authority who knows everything pete is afraid to know here is a wonderful early riff that summarizes the scope of pete's work your caseload is brutal and will get worse and the holidays steadily advance on the poor deranged and demented kids waiting with cops in the living room or the front seat of a squad car to stay out of the cold until you arrive you run the children up to the crisis shelter in kalispell there aren't many beds you have twenty four hours to find a placement ... but as always the calls are mostly bullshit ninety five percent landlords ratting out noisy alcoholic tenants divorcees fighting over christmas morning custody visit the little studio apartments or a trailer or a yurt up in the sticks confirm that there are cheerios in the cupboard frozen juice in the freezer blankets winter coats and mittens in the hall closet ignore the bong hastily covered with a bandana and write out an action plan and get the hag with stained teeth and her balding homunculus to sign it and fare thee well out the door don't even bother with the paperwork for the state office because by then there are three new cases to replace that one ...you have a backlog of real cases to work into your real rotation cases that are as slow to close as infected wounds ...yes you have bigger fish to fry than potheads and mileage reimbursement newly suicided fathers and their wreckage the mother who calls your office wondering if you could take her child god is telling her to kill him you better hurry cecil in the fresh hell of pine hills ...and the pearls living on pinecones and squirrel gizzards waiting for armageddon with their coin scoring apocalyptic old man ...and circle back to your own life like a pair of headlights in the rearview late at night some trouble tailing you on the black highway despite his heroism pete struggles with his own demons and failures the breach in his relationship with his parents his broken marriage his escape into heavy drinking and casual sex and the frustration in keeping a meaningful connection with is teenaged daughter a crisis emerges early on in this tale when his ex wife decides to run off to texas with an irresponsible lover dragging his daughter rachel into unknown perils associated with her reckless lifestyle soon his fears become real when he learns she has run away much of the book alternates between pete desperately trying to solve the mystery of the fate of is 14 year old daughter and ongoing work on the case of ben and jeremiah there is much heartbreak here and i was totally caught up in rooting for pete to find a pathway for his humanity to be fulfilled the reader gets to spend a lot of time from the perspective of the daughter as she makes her way from city to city getting involved in all the things parents most fear pete can only imagine we can't blame him for occasional binges he is shook the is in another room the is peeing in a closet the is peeing in someone's bed the is peeing into a bottle in a car missing pissing on the floor the is among many angry strangers the is walking on the roadside under a transom of falling stars the sky streaked in a kind of agony white grooves his eyes can't brake their casters at one point he is drinking with his ex wife beth and she raises the painful issues of what they did wrong he is led to the harsh conclusion that \"i take kids away from people like us \" it is so true that many people see the intervention of social workers as a shameful retribution a judgment for their failures beth ups the ante with this painful analogy i feel like i've been busted like the cops have pulled me over like god has pulled me over and i got to sit here with my hands at ten and two and i got to get right or something or something gonna happen to rachel--if it hasn't already it's god who's the social worker pete and he's taken our kid away you know \"later pete has a dream of being the geography of the mountain west and of harboring spirits of people who don't exist its conclusion is a fitting summary of his life's work and an overriding theme of this powerful book he dreamed that we all contain so many masses and that people are simple potentialities instances cases that all of life can be understood as casework that dfs was a kind of priesthood","7":"a rough sad story about a very important subject but there is an inauthenticity about it that i cannot quite place there is too much rescuing and not enough truth telling the children in the book never get to have their say they are one dimensional victims with no story of their own and that enraged me i'm all for the hard working social worker trying to help these lost children but the story does us all a disservice by not giving these kids more of a real truthful messy honest voice the social worker gets one so why can't the kids is it because they are the innocent victims needing rescuing even our most innocent young people have complicated voices that need to be heard and every victim has a rescuer inside them as well","8":"haunting story about a social worker in montana during the early 1980s whose own life is unraveling while he's busy helping others the author has an unconventional writing style with a unique rhythm some may find that distracting but i thought it helped to capture the mindset of these very troubled characters amazing first novel from a very talented writer","9":"super enjoyed this book great story and can't wait for his next book highly recommend","10":"set in montana story of a male social worker who becomes involved with a local family while losing a part of his own family","11":"very possible the best new writer i've read this year traces of cormac mccarthy richard ford more of a guy's writer if i hadn't to say good story gritty measured pace a good read","12":" this book is difficult for me to review there were a few times in the first 200 pages or so that i was tempted to just quit but something about the characters that kept drawing me back into the story pete is a social worker in montana trying to do good by the families that he's assigned he sees terrible things happen to children he works hard to find solutions happy endings for troubled families but pete's own family is a mess his ex wife is an alcoholic drug addict who he left to parent their young teen daughter pete finds out that his daughter has run away from home and none of his social worker skills contacts solutions for other troubled parents can help find his own child yet pete becomes involved with the lives of a truly troubled punk an orphaned little girl and a child of the wild ben and his father jeremiah jeremiah lives in the montana hills running away from perceived then real government agents and his own troubled past as a parent","13":" it's interesting to compare this book to edan lepucki's california while this is not a post apocalytic novel california wasn't exactly either but they both inhabit a somewhat chaotic unpredictable place and time with characters who have a realistic blend of likable and dislikable traits however in this book you are immediately drawn in and actually care about the characters even the violent anti social ones this was not at all the case in california a couple of short criticisms i didn't care for the style in which rachael rose backstory was presented but maybe that's because i just didn't get the point also the book seems to lose steam a bit about halfway in before picking up again toward the end so perhaps closer to 4 5 stars","14":" i can safely say that this has been my favorite book that i have read this year and probably up there in my top reads in the past few years this book was so heavy and so amazing what an incredible cast of characters most of which you rooted for even though they weren't all that 'good' in a conventional sense there was such a deep sadness that rooted through every single person the story encounters sadness and despair each of the families children that the main character pete is tasked to help as a social worker are desperate and depressed sometimes depraved i don't know what to say i loved it so much it was one of those books that i never wanted to end","15":"smith henderson can write but goodness this book i was not at all prepared at how gritty and hard to read it would be i thought the book sounded like an interesting read based on the book blurb and i understood it would probably have some parts that were hard to read but i was not in any way prepared for this i guess maybe i live in my little fantasy world where life is just not this bad and i now know i am soooo very thankful it was really too hard to read about","16":"a hefty book but worth every sentence i had to re read sentences or paragraphs because the language was so beautiful and rich sparse but full of meaning what an amazing debut i cannot wait to read more of smith henderson i was initially drawn to it by pete being a social worker in the 1980s in rural montana what a combination so often my heart was overwhelmed for pete and benjamin and for pearl lovely amazing unexpected","17":"i loved the book though it was heartbreaking but it lets the world know about the kids on the street 22223","18":"gritty intense heart wrenching bleak...... all these describe my thoughts on this fine novel i found smith henderson's prose to be mesmerizing his story is dark while his writing style is beautiful the protagonist pete snow is a well meaning self destructive social worker in a poor rural area in montana he takes his work with the children very seriously his personal life however is spiraling out of control due to his own sabotaging he finds himself in the midst of a huge us government domestic terrorist sting when trying to help a malnourished 11 year old boy meanwhile his 14 year old daughter rachel runs away from his estranged wife the reader learns of her escapades through chapters that are written like a third party interrogation of her her life as a runaway left me heartbroken and profoundly sad in his acknowledgments henderson gives thanks to researchers and social workers in texas and montana this reader thinks that the adventures of rachel are authentic stories of runaways rachel's biggest need is to appear mature and this need gets her in a load of tribulations social workers around the country will adore this novel for it's illumination into the sometimes futility of their work god bless the social workers of this country this novel is bleak it's not to be read without this in mind because if the reader wants a light and airy book they will miss the beauty of this fine novel there are many themes that henderson explores in this work such as alcoholism family community trust religious zealots and government intervention there is much to ponder henderson chose the best quote to begin his book it's from henry david thoreau \"if i knew for a certain'ty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for my life \" that in a sentence defines this novel perfect quote i highly recommend it for everyone because it illuminates the struggles of social workers and the lives of runaways after reading this you won't see either in the same light plus henderson's writing is phenomenal i look forward to his next work","19":"this book was recommended to me by my mother and was chosen later the same month by my book club it did not disappoint never a dull second four ongoing stories all connected in a wonderful sometimes depressing sometimes thrilling ride highly recommend","20":"i started out loving this book though depressing topic interesting premise and characters however the middle and it's a long middle dragged for me unrelenting sad and horrifying topics the writer started to drop main characters mid storyline and i lost track during many scenes","21":"have you ever wanted to head up the the north country and watch paint dry if your answer is yes then have i got the read for you fourth of july creek is about a flawed social worker who drives around a lot drinks a lot and then drives around some more he also fails at helping children fun for me there was nothing here assumably the book is about shitty people who are trying to survive and trying to be good but it never develops anything interesting in these characters this is in part because the whole story is told through pete the alcoholic social worker the only other perspective comes from an oddly framed conversation between two unnamed characters that shows up periodically and randomly this is the kind of book that spends pages talking about the weather and the cold and the changing of the seasons some might think it's a slice of life book but it's not it's a chunk of boring ass life book that is overstuffed with a bunch of nothing there is next to no 'story' here there is next to no plot here shit happens and then also more shit happens there is sadness and tough lives a plenty in this book but there is no thread that brings them together pete interacts with all these sad things totally separately from each other and by the end nothing has changed nothing has happened","22":"brutal violent sad discouraging this book is brilliant in spite of the fact that it is brutal violent sad and discouraging it left me hoping for forgiveness and redemption for anyone anyone three lost children redeemed three lost men redeemed","23":"not worth finishing ugly state of affairs","24":" wow is everyone in montana a complete mess i don't think there's a single normal person in this book every bat shit crazy person ended up with a nice tidy ending though well except the prostitute daughter no resolution there her story actually ends mid sentence too long too many crazies it would've been nice to have had one sane person just for some perspective and the ending was just too pat for me so why 3 stars because the benjamin jeremiah story was compelling and i got to use my dictionary app like crazy lots of new words that i can use to win big on jeopardy one day","25":" every once in a great while a book like this comes along a book that you stay up late and get up early to read a book that you think about talk about worry about until you can finally struggle out of whatever else is keeping you from the book and go back to reading a book that is as momentous as a raging love affair you want to furtively secret it away in your own heart and scream its name from the middle of an interstate highway at the same time and when it is over when you have finished reading the last page when you are staring dumbly at the back cover wondering what the hell you are going to do with your life now you know that you have just experienced something bordering on the sublime smith henderson's recently released novel fourth of july creek is my raging love affair","26":"liked this book so much the writing style the story the setting everything","27":"if raymond chandler and cormac mccarthy wrote a novel together it would probably be better than this even so good mix of tough guy dialogue and lyrical nature passages with memorable characters and a mounting sense of dread that doesn't fully pay off","28":"couldnt put down didn't read like a first novel great book","29":"this is a generous 2 half the time i didn't know who was being talked about and the story was very choppy and all over the place it had a lot of potential that's too bad","30":" this is a pretty amazing book and it's hard to believe that it's a debut novel by this author first let me state that it's a pleasure to read because of the way henderson has written it the wording is spot on and the descriptions place the reader exactly in the moment and place it's seductive in that what you read isn't always pleasant but it's so compelling and literally sucks you in as a reader so completely that you can't put the book down but the characters really steal the show here there's pete snow a social worker who is trying hard to do his job while watching his life crumble around him he is so very real and troubled and brave all at the same time then there are all the different folks that pete is working with as well as those who touch his personal life it's a really satisfying novel about a man who is struggling to get through life saving both others and himself and how he does it day to day","31":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a lot of people liked this book so i kept asking myself as i read am i just wrong the beginning was an enjoyable read but it just turned darker and crazier that darkness alone doesn't bother me but narratively just too much goes down maybe being a social worker is like that constant havoc but it ruined the reading experience for me i felt like every time i started a new chapter some huge disaster had occurred now this character is a prostitute now the fbi is shooting at one of h a lot of people liked this book so i kept asking myself as i read am i just wrong the beginning was an enjoyable read but it just turned darker and crazier that darkness alone doesn't bother me but narratively just too much goes down maybe being a social worker is like that constant havoc but it ruined the reading experience for me i felt like every time i started a new chapter some huge disaster had occurred now this character is a prostitute now the fbi is shooting at one of his clients now this boy is homeless and in juvie and throwing hot chocolate against someone's face then the ending the mid sentence cliffhanger just felt like a gimmick i guess this is the kind of book people who like breaking bad and cormac mccarthy read i'm just not that kind of girl more","32":"outstanding dark haunting disturbing and profound pete snow is as messed up a social worker as the cases he deals with an antihero damaged and damned when his path crosses jeremiah pearl's a paranoid survivalist it can't go well every character is flawed and generally makes poor choices and the result is a beautifully written and wrenching story of how we somehow manage especially when we're beyond hope","33":"kept me up until 1 00 am reading and forced me to close my office door to read more","34":"read my full review on my blog http bit ly 1pmsjop","35":" the world is a blade and dread is hope cut open and spread inside out i was really excited to read this book for a couple of reasons first it has a fantastic jacket description second i've lived in missoula montana for a year now so i loved the idea of reading a novel set in my new hometown third i love the jacket design which sounds shallow but there it is fourth i've heard good things about the novel from a couple of people now and yet it hasn't gone well fourth of july creek is billed as a shattering exploration of america's disquieting and violent contradictions it is supposed to deal with the complexities of freedom and anarchy and i can't think of a better setting for this than montana where independence is not only valued but fiercely defended these themes are meant to be reflected in the story of a social worker pete snow who gets tangled up with jeremiah pearl a mysterious anarchist preparing for war in the backwoods of montana pearl is a survivalist who believes the end times are not just upon us but already in motion that would make a fantastic novel and henderson has the talent to pull it off fourth of july creek crackles with dangerous energy whenever pearl makes an appearance the problem is for more than two hundred pages his presence is merely hinted at instead we're treated to pete's sad sack life you see pete is in his early thirties and can't seem to get his stuff together his wife cheated on him so he ran out on her and his daughter now he can't decide if he wants his ex wife back or hates her forever and in a twist that could be interesting but only really grates the social worker is an inept and apathetic father he has a history of a drinking problem that is becoming more and more essential to his makeup the guy is a mess most people might not have so much of a problem with this but a curious thing has happened to me in the past year i've become increasingly impatient with novels that essentially come down to screw up white guy can't get his life together because seriously it's incredible how many of those books exist in the world and how they continue to multiply there are so many more interesting stories that could be told jeremiah pearl's comes to mind add in the fact that pete finds himself a love interest who comes down to the exact cliche you would expect for a guy like him she starts out appearing strong and wise to his screw up ways then upon their second meeting inexplicably sleeps with him her actions make no sense because when it comes down to it the author doesn't understand her and doesn't want to understand her so she's left fluctuating between strength weakness and potentially violent emotional instability add to this the fact that the only other female characters including pete's ex wife are harpies nags and emotionally immature his daughter is an exception i suppose aside from the emotionally mature part by the time i reached the novel's halfway point i was exhausted and it had become increasingly difficult to care if jeremiah pearl's story is going to be filtered through a character i find increasingly irritating then why bother so i put it down which is a shame because i really think this had the makings of a great book in addition the narrative is curiously fractured pete's narration is the focus presented in the standard format then we have the tonally jarring narrative of his daughter which takes the form of an interview and gradually the narrative of cecil one of pete's cases who was sexually abused by his mother did i mention that all women are horrible in this book becomes a thing maybe it all comes together in the end but two hundred and fifty pages is a long time to ask a reader to be patient grade c for more please check out my blog supposedly fun","36":"gripping made you think about unusual cases i e waco texas and the branch dividians and the couple in idaho where the wife was killed by the fbi it made we wonder about how many people in the u s live under the radar and why would love to see a movie made from this brad pitt should have the leading role and robert redford could be the judge","37":"it's a five now","38":"fourth of july creek by smith henderson is an occasionally brilliant but overlong novel about children and how they are failed by the adults charged to take care of them it is seen through the eyes of pete snow a social worker working for the department of family services in rural montana in a case of physician heal thy self snow can barely take of himself and then has his fourteen year old daughter run away from home but that isn't the main story that would be snow's odd relationship with a man jeremiah pearl and his son pearl is one of those guys who fears the government and heads to the hills puncturing holes in coins to express his distrust of u s currency snow interested in the well being of ben the boy comes to a grudging friendship with pearl who guards a dark secret snow is one of those characters who is mercilessly mistreated by his creator he gets rip roaring drunk falls in love with a woman who betrays him spectacularly gets beaten up by a law enforcement officer has his father die and his house burn down that's not to mention his daughter running away and becoming a prostitute the action takes place around 1980 and i've been trying to figure out why there are a few mentions of the time period the election of reagan the eruption of mount st helene's but i didn't find the time setting to have a profound meaning on the events of the story whenever an author does this now i suspect it has to do with not having to deal with the internet or cell phones if the story isn't particularly enthralling it took me forever to get through it the writing is often vivid and memorable henderson has a way of equating color with a variety of emotions wyoming which means to drive through ugly subscrape the color of dirty pennies or what did he smell like like brown like whiskey tobacco and river water befitting a novel set in montana henderson also celebrates the wilderness and the characters' relationship to it he sat on the limestone in the dark felt the notches carved by water into the rock he'd have wept but for the cocaine and the numbness and the queer sensation that the stones all around him were subtly shifting position the very ground seemed to writhe nearby something slipped into the water he wondered was he both seeing and hearing things i suppose the foremost reason this novel didn't send me over the moon is that the subject matter is so overdone missing children and anti government wackos both in one novel henderson does not do enough with these trends to make them transcend their ubiquity","39":"one of the best books i've read in a long time the interconnected stories of a social worker his daughter a young client and a reclusive anarchist father in rural montana all of the characters are sympathetic in some way despite some serious failings and questionable judgment recommended for social worker friends and anarchist survivalist friends alike","40":" so i got about 327 into this one and i just couldn't move forward with the narrative anymore i skipped to the end and read the last ten pages or so to find out what happened with the characters typically i just stop reading but i did want to know what the deal was with jeremiah pearl the story is about pete snow he works for montana's child and family services in his work he comes across all manner of people but he is stumped when he meets the son of a survivalist and isn't sure how to help young benjamin pearl the story was interesting around 150 pages in and then the story meanders for quite some time i feel as if henderson put every time of depravity into the each character we meet to make certain it is understood what type of humans we are dealing with here and it gets a bit tiresome if the story focused on the pearl family and pete's own demons that may have carried my interest to the end but we get pete's backstory with his father and his wife and daughter he is a man in charge of keeping family's together and he can't keep his own intact we also get the odd relationship he develops with a fellow employee that takes an unexpected turn and one that i'm not sure i completely bought i used to work in a homeless shelter with teenagers up until they aged out of the program i am not a pollyanna thinking that life is all rainbows and unicorns i understand that there are some pretty dire situations many kids find themselves in with regard to family i also know that not all of those kids come out jaded and wounded a lot do but some come into their own and make their way down a path created by them and not the past there is also an element to the writing that didn't always flow to me there are sentences that begin with no subject and it reminds me of text messages i used to grade papers with similar construction and it just feels jagged and incomplete to me","41":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here how much sadness is necessary in one book","42":"i was excited to read a book focusing on our political divides instead it is a book about two families where the adults are children i kept looking for some deeper message all i could find is that the children in this book shouldn't trust their parents to be sane","43":"really enjoyed this book but i like closer at end so couldn't give it more stars","44":"this is not an easy book to read it's gritty disturbing violent in spots gut wrenching in others but an amazing story written amazingly well nonetheless it gave me a glimpse into a world i have never really known much about before and it introduced me to characters i'm not likely to forget and every single one of them rang true","45":"fairly epic in scale touching upon american history conspiracy theories drug addiction relationship abuse parental neglect and the impossible decisions many of us must make when dealing with people including ourselves who are 'outside' the borders of 'civilized' society 'fourth of july creek' is simply put a masterpiece of contemporary literature rarely have i felt so deeply connected to such volatile characters who live in the rural gray zones of humanity stripped of itself","46":"really well written oh and the author is crazy hott signed copy","47":"rich complex novel that explores class politics religion and family through the lens of a social worker whose life resembles those he's trying to help","48":" i was offered this by random house uk cornerstone via net galley i knew nothing of the author or the plot except the publisher's blurb but thought it sounded interesting i was not disappointed fourth of july creek follows social worker pete snow as he tries to juggle some difficult cases and his own car wreck of a personal life in poor rural montana in the early 1980s his main challenge begins when benjamin is found malnourished and poorly clothed wandering in a local school in which he is not enrolled ben is the son of jeremiah pearl an extreme religious conspiracy theorist who thinks the end of times is coming and keeps his family away from all corrupting contact with the outside world slowly and with great difficulty pete gains their trust and discovers more about their lives meanwhile his own teenage daughter goes missing and the reader follows her tragic trajectory interspersed with pete's attempts to find her and work his cases this is a powerful and arresting novel the plot develops in an intriguing and surprising way pete is an interesting central character but is a little close to becoming a stereotype the maverick social worker with a drinking problem who cares so much about his cases to hell with the rules etc etc the writing is cool and clean with a great sense of time and place coming through and all the voices sound authentic for a debut novel i think this is quite an impressive achievement with a lot to say about american culture politics and society 4 5 stars","49":" so much of the american collective conscious relies on the possibility of redemption in fact redemption is one of the great themes of american literature think about the classic and often grizzly works by flannery o' connor and william faulkner that so elegantly portray characters seeking something different from their chaotic pasts--something they can grasp that can free them from their guilt of sins smith henderson's debut novel fourth of july creek is the latest offering in redemptive americana and it's downright masterful henderson's work tackles the same subjects that populate o'connor and faulkner's best writing--religion grace violence and of course redemption fourth of july creek follows the life of a montana social worker named pete snow early on we find out that pete is a sinner but he's an okay guy you know he's normal he's made mistakes but he's working to patch up his life as a social worker he gets to go into homes and protect the child inhabitants he finds joy in his work because he gives children their salvation what pete struggles with though is maintaining his personal life his relationship with his family is essentially non existent henderson writes of the moment that pete's daughter knows the relationship with her father is lost \"when she realized that he chose the job that he wanted to be there for the other families that he didn't want to be there for the one he had \" with such a proclamation fourth of july creek makes it rather obvious that pete spends little time with his own daughter who has herself fled to a life of drugs and sex he wants to save her--like he does his other \"kids \" but life isn't that easy we can't go from complete separation to acceptance within a span of days or weeks--probably even years too such redemption would be an easy copout in a novel that is raw and brutal henderson turns his focus to pete's hope for becoming a better man--not necessarily a better father his decision to do so works beautifully pete faces worldly temptations and he occasionally succumbs to them however when evil stares at him he faces it with boldness pete shows his redemptive behavior in two separate quests the first involves pete's interactions with a teenager named cecil cecil is a boy who can't get along with his mother he is violent and she too responds in angry mannerisms pete comes to the rescue of cecil and finds a home where cecil can live peacefully well things don't go so well pete struggles to get cecil to understand that second chances are tough to earn and shouldn't be wasted by making stupid decisions cecil finally breaks down just as he is being pushed to what he imagines as his personal limit cecil asks pete \"can i stay with you \"cecil's question is direct and it's a sincere request what makes the narrative so powerful is that we know how pete wants to respond we know that he wants to cave in and care for the troubled boy we know he wants his chance to redeem himself as a father but pete also is the same man that he was when he failed his daughter he knows this and because of his own awareness he essentially redeems himself he makes a responsible decision albeit a difficult one pete's other conflict is with how to handle young benjamin pearl benjamin like cecil is a boy who comes from a very rough background his father jeremiah is a religious fanatic proclaiming sin to fill just about every object in the boy's vicinity--including childish cartoons benjamin's mother brothers and sisters are all dead presumably at least for most of the novel by actions of jeremiah when pete first meets benjamin the boy is malnourished and desperately in need of new clothing pete tries to help the boy by giving him necessary goods but jeremiah refuses the charity and threatens to kill pete if he tries to get close to his family again again pete has to decide what to do and for the second time in fourth of july creek he does the right thing he puts his life on the line by visiting the pearls again pete's job is to make sure benjamin is okay and he does so eventually pete is able to speak with jeremiah and the two come to an understanding however their truce comes just when outside problems start appearing without revealing too much of the plot i can say that the ending is incredibly explosive spewing with violence and rage pete has a moment with benjamin where he thinks he might can save the boy then he remembers who he is he's a man who is in love with his job he's in violent situations every day he is never at home he doesn't take care of himself just before he says the wrong thing to benjamin pete says \"never mind the other thing won't work \"by refusing to take on the responsibility of another life--not once but twice pete snow redeems his past mistakes he shows that he is a guy who understands what he can and cannot do in other words he becomes a man henderson is in command from the first sentence until the very last word it's hard to believe that fourth of july creek is a debut the dialogue is rich populated and fulfilled with a variety of characters the pacing is also noteworthy just looking at the heft of the book you might imagine that you'll spend a month getting through it trust me when i say that you won't these pages fly you'll be racing to get to the next chapter it's a roaring untamed read atmospheric and written in a haunting prose that is tightly focused and spectacular in execution smith henderson's fourth of july creek is an american masterpiece original review published at drunk monkeys http www drunkmonkeys onimpression","50":"this book blew me away just searing yow i feel like i should slow down and read it again but it's just the kind of book that you tear through","51":"i don't usually give bad reviews but this time i did maybe because i hurt i am on medication i just did not like it here is my review this book was recommended for our book club to read as i read this book i was disappointed about the great reviews it received especially for the quality of the authors writing for me the writing was so bad that it made it impossible to follow the plot or characters there are sentence fragments disjointed sentences run on sentences and sentences that make no sense at all it read like a jumble of scattered thoughts i am glad i have a kindle with a dictionary because i had to look up quite a few words and i am not a dummy other common words could have been used instead then i wouldn't have had to stop reading and look up the words book was difficult enough to read i ~love~ learning new words but they just made a bad thing worse i read and gave the book 51% chance but decided i couldn't finish it i only read 51% because... in our book club you have to read a minimum of 50% to rate the book there are so many other books to read why bother to finish this one in my opinion it was a waste of good money","52":"i can tell what this author is trying to do he's trying to be cormac mccarthy he's got a very spartan writing style which i think actually detracts from his story it was confusing at times another book i read this year the painter by joseph heller did a much better job at pulling that style off this one not so much it gets three stars because i do think he's a good writer and i'd give another book by him a chance this is his first but only one more","53":"too much like a couple other books that i recently read and that i ultimately disliked decided to give up","54":"loved this book one of the best books i've read in a long time","55":"enjoyed the writing but too many plots happening could have been more engaging if there were less stories being told","56":" is it a requirement that literature be tortured and depressing i was pulled in to this story primarily because i'm a sucker for an unsympathetic main character who is compassionate but flawed but ultimately i'm not sure the depressing aspects were worth the read it says on the back of the book which i normally never read that the novel is about a manhunt which it is but barely and definitively not in the sense of something suspenseful i can see why it has won awards there is definitely a literary sense to it so if you're in the mood for this kind of book perhaps this is worth the consideration","57":"a dark look at the human condition that could have been about a hundred pages shorter compelling and stark though it ends on a more hopeful if improbable note","58":" this is a great book to be fair i listened so really i'm saying this is a great audio book you probably know the basics 1980 montana pete snow the social worker with his own issues but a heart of gold his messed up daughter rachel or is it rose his messed up friend mary the religious fundamentalist family the pearls and lots of other great minor characters great stories great character development lots of the story is conveyed through interviews and conversations that are like interviews excellent figures of speech a reasonably high level vocabulary and best of all a view inside a culture or subculture that i have only heard about but never witnessed first hand until now awesome","59":"i didn't care for this book but felt like i had to finish it i liked the storyline at the beginning but thought the author could have developed it better it had promise at the beginning but about half way in i wanted it to be over","60":"i'm not sure what to say fourth of july creek was technically well written but the story could have and should have been more about one thing or another instead of being very little about everything does that make sense fourth of july creek isn't about anything at all it paints a very disturbing picture of everyone involved or just leaves them incomplete against my better judgment i finished the book","61":"i was so looking forward to reading this great reviews heard it was the book of the summer i kept waiting fighting back my distaste of pete the main character 84 pages in after another he silently burped i knew this just wasn't for me i don't believe everyone in montana is a boozing dimwit don't see that continuing this would result in any insight or payoff so i am done","62":"holy hell this book smolders easily one of the best books i've read in the last several years there is so much going on and for this brilliant work that trying to summarize it would be pointless and you can read the publisher's summary in these pages is an abundance of hurt love compassion and despair be prepared to ache in your soul when you read this","63":"every character in this book was dysfunctional in one way or another but somehow i started to like some of them despite their many issues some were not so likeable but others had their hearts in the right place even if they did not always act in rational ways it would not be my favorite book but it did hold my interest","64":"i cannot decide if this book should have four or five stars henderson's debut novel is beautiful and sad and matter of fact and realistic and remindes me somewhat of jess walters' writing and characters it's a tough book to read rough people rough land rough actions rough consequences although the latter may be the only unrealistic part of the story some of which if you're like me you wince at but know are true but wish weren't he tells it like it is and i know i grew up in northern idaho less than four hours away from where the story takes place in the time in which this story takes place and from my perspective henderson writes about the panhandle region north idaho eastern washington and western montana which i ve added myself where so many scrape by with little education and even less of a promising future","65":"several things that were interesting enough to keep me reading but after reading 470 pages wondered what was the point i don't expect all novels to have a happy ending but i do expect all plot developments to serve a purpose","66":"absolutely loved this book i cannot wait for more titles from this author","67":" it's difficult to know what to say about a book that's this good messed up parents raise messed up kids falling in love with a crazy person can make you crazy too or all it takes is one good adult in a child's life a parent an uncle a social worker or even another older child to keep a kid from going off the rails this book impressed me as another example of great contemporary american fiction being written far from the east coast hip urban centers where the u s publishing industry typically dredges up its mediocre offerings if you skipped it because it's set in montana then you've missed one the best books of 2014","68":"3 5 the extra 5 is for the last couple of pages which usually let me down but in this book i thought worked well","69":"great story great flawed leading man loved every minute","70":"\"i am the kakangelist \"\"i don't know what that is \"\"the bringer of bad tidings the bad word \" i noticed this in another review rural fuckedupness i think that describes this book best every action induces a reaction from where things spiral out of control still you got to love the main character he has his heart in the right place found a word gem ichor greek mythology the fluid that flows like blood in the veins of the gods","71":"smith henderson knows how to turn a phrase but for me the many threads were not unified enough to make the book a satisfying read granted i don't have big blocks of time for reading so am piecing smaller chunks together but every time i picked the book up again i had to rethink what was going on perhaps some strong editing could have made the story more compelling","72":" 3 1 2 for me it got better as it became more comprehensible that is when the pieces started coming together and i understood the interviews at the end of many of the chapters at first it was too confusing to be enjoyable but i believe it's worth the effort and when i started reading in bigger chunks it got better and better except for the frustrating ending this is a book i would like to discuss it could be one of those books that given others' perspectives and interpretations could rise in my rating as in why are all the social workers so dysfunctional and let's talk about jeremiah and his fierce philosophy the passion with which he held his beliefs was frightening but almost admirable are there parallels in our political climate not maybe as paranoid and anti government but as tenacious in their grip hold of right even writing about it makes me realize this book stirred me up and maybe that's good writing","73":" i am so confused not only by all of the rave reviews of this book but especially those that praise the quality of the writing the writing is so terrible that it makes it impossible to even get into the plot or focus on the characters there are sentence fragments run on sentences and the author even seems to try to impress the reader with big obscure vocabulary frequently tossed in when a simple adjective or none would be perfect and then there are the constant ridiculous metaphors and similes that made me definitely decide i could not finish this book the following quotes were all in the same paragraph beginning on page 50 mammatus clouds popcorned and gumdrops of rain broke up like a crowd after a fistfight stood in the fields like wet yurts candescing in the sun like a sheet of copper the papers in the car fluttered like a rookery there are too many other books on my to read pile to waste my time on this one","74":"a beautifully but plainly written story about a social worker in montana and his experiences with a reclusive mountain family along with side plots of his father brother ex wife girlfriend and daughter honest sad depictions of montana life and people of all kinds these characters ring true","75":" pete snow is a social worker in rural montana and a damn good one too he regularly goes beyond the call of duty to help families in need and is a knight in shining armour for several neglected children he's a also a raging alcholic tormented by the guilt of abandoning his wife and daughter when the dangerous enigmatic jeremiah pearl enters his life and his family relocate to distant texas his world starts to spin out of control the question is can he handle it our protagonist is a fascinating character a mass of contradictions there's no doubt pete is a good guy at heart but he's weak and self destructive he goes out of his way to help troubled families and all but ignores his own kin when they need him most it clear that smith henderson is a talented writer and he excels at rendering the harsh beauty of the montana wilderness but this novel is too long the narrative soon meanders and pete's endless benders become tiresome and repetitive though at times unbearably grim this book is a worthwhile read but i feel like it could have shaved some subplots and and gotten to point the a whole lot sooner","76":" it's a 2 5 by the end pretty entertaining but slow going for two thirds of the way and rather overwritten and purple in places when rain is 'pellets' and clouds get too many similes hey just say 'it was cloudy' the survivalist montana and elsewhere setting was interesting and the social worker angle felt very authentic but the character of pete felt a tad 'stock' to me it's that otherwise decent guy who's made some bad choices prone to punching walls and melodramatically grabbing a bottle of rye whenever his wife makes him do the ironing curse that bitch to hell i kept seeing sean penn or some such scowly actor and i always get quite annoyed by what you might called 'clipped pronouns' took the pitcher poured a beer sat down cursed his luck i wasn't crazy about the question and answer format of the daughter's interludes either so strong fresh first novel and could do better","77":"thought the book was ok but found it really really really dragging along by the end","78":" this book comprises three stories on protagonist told concurrently it might have been better with only two i felt like the story of the cedric story could have been a separate book pete's story along with jeremiah ben's story melded together better i am a montanan and these stories were reasonable montana stories i could not tell how pete could take someone to pine hills and go visit him without taking extensive time away and not being directed to do so by a judge pine hills and libby are just about as far away from each other as you can be in montana i guess henderson didn't count on there being too many montana readers he did locate the story in a place you could imagine the j b story happening that there are many people who are anti government and or want to get away from it all in northwestern montana is true i do not live there but worked there in 80's shortly after this story's timeline i never wanted to quit this book as i had to know what would happen to ben in that the author succeeded well his family's decline was tragic and believable knowing how belief's tied to mental illness could end note to audiobook makers make sure the reader knows how to pronounce locations names i grew up near and live near choteau and have never heard it pronounced the way this person did and spokane is never spokane with a long a","79":"this is an amazing book the writing is so authentic the colloquialisms correct the flawed hero is so true to form the people and situations the trailers lunging lunatic dogs on chains alcohol abuse child abuse drugged out moms and people who don't give a damn about their outrageously angry children the poverty of the surrounding and poverty of spirit all there mr smith is a true joy to read it's brilliant thank you kitty for recommending this","80":"excellent a long rich unflagging novel a wonderful ending so happy for this excellent author","81":"absolute page turner filled with really gorgeous writing and decadently rich characters a clever deep and yet completely readable book how nice and i love that there were big complex words that needed to be looked up no one does that anymore why smith henderson obviously is a true craftsman and a real talent","82":"about 100 pages too long the daughter chapters weren't a great use of my time a lukewarm recommendation","83":"this book is his first and it's s humdinger most interesting literary style the hero is a totally screwed up mess but with a heart of gold for hard luck kids i really loved this book","84":"it is quite something to not be able to put a book down that keeps breaking your heart so so good","85":"turns out that the secret service is under the treasury dept keep that in mind when you start defacing currency","86":"pretty good story i liked how it was told from the perspective of the protagonist anti hero and his missing daughter i like all the references to the pnw overall depressing and hopeless story","87":"hard dark great book back to beach reading","88":"holy cow this novel set in rural montana contains real flawed and interesting characters they are so well written that you feel like you can actually understand them and their internal dialogue without the story ever being told from their point of view reminiscent of the writing of larry brown this one is so gritty that you can taste it like the sand in a sandwich that you try foolishly try to eat at the beach on a windy day","89":"i had a really hard time getting into this book i finally gave up when i realized i was doing laundry as an excuse not to read it i'm sure it was fabulous if i stayed committed but i just couldn't push through it i did like the author's descriptions and messy multifaceted character development i'll give this author another try","90":"if this is the new literature i'll stick with the old thank you henderson can't seem to find a consistent style to carry his work reads at times like a jumble of unrelated thoughts that desperately needs an editor can't in good conscience recommend this one","91":"beautifully written but harrowing read that i kept having to put down and return to fantastic sense of place and moral ambiguity","92":"this book had a page turning plot and it would have been fine without one that's a pretty rare combination this book has no heroes and somehow makes you root for everyone while being completely unromantic i'm all around impressed","93":"powerful heart wrenching sensitive and emotional although the book seems disjointed in rhythm allow it to seep in and the author takes you on a journey to children their fears joys and heartaches loved the book","94":"wow smith henderson does not sugarcoat his story of pete a montana social worker and his young charges the reader travels from the wilds of montana to austin to seattle and back and feels much of pete's pain and despair along with him outstanding","95":"interesting and different i was always interested to pick it up yet couldn't remember a thing about it a week later","96":"interesting writing flow characters i cared about good basic story but somehow it just never came together for me","97":"a really sad book with a child welfare worker who needs help himself touches on homelessness teenage prostitution and right wing fanatic religionism nobody looks good in this story and yet it is strangely haunting and has an underlying note of hope remote as it seems i did feel that nothing is really resolved and the characters are left with miles left to travel and with unknown endings maybe that is life nothing is really over until you die","98":"this guy is a very good writer the story is absorbing and the characters likable and or complex but the strange little interludes of quasi interrogations with one of the characters was very distracting and weird the book would have been considerably better without that in my opinion","99":"this book was a bit rough hard book to get through it gets better midway","100":" beautiful minimalist prose did not save this book from a dead fourth act and a protagonist with very few redeeming features there's a lot if build up with jeremiah and the coins but this all kind of falls short some plot points seemed to exist for the sole purpose of adding pages never tying into the central plot still beautiful prose and a lot of shocking content which the author says is toned down from the reality of social work it was really refreshing to have a protagonist whose profession wasn't really idyllic but the constant return to his rampant alcoholism seemed juvenile and turned me away there's a lot of skill and heart in this novel but for me it failed to grab me to way i wanted it to","101":"i found this book endless depressing and disjointed i wanted to like the main character pete but he was such a mess and made so many poor decisions it was difficult to sympathize with him the chapters told from his daughter's perspective were inconsistently written and confusing why was she talking about herself in the third person and who was she talking to i would not recommend this book and can not fathom why so many people gave it 5 stars","102":" blazing characterizations even of minor personages terrific scene setting a wonderful stylist uneven pacing seemed like hbo writing in some spots in terms of the situations and forgive me but i expect a novel to be a little deeper than series cable i didn't doubt that small town montana was like that in the 70s and probably still is sounds a lot like small town nh when i was growing up i often laugh at republican nostalgia for small town america it was all about drugs alcohol sexual assault including incest and other forms of battery it was just that motivational development was a little thin it wasn't say russell banks's affliction not saying fojc should have been the same work of art just that it's not as deep i have no idea why pete a montana guy born and bred went into social work for instance guys in general don't tend to go into that let alone montana guys i'm married to a colorado guy who worked in cps for a couple of decades and i feel like i do have some insight into this but not sure pete does to get back at his dad was my guess and he does seem to care about the kids but why does he care later he seems to be seeking redemption for being such a bad dad himself but why in the first place and also why is he such a bad dad when he obviously knows better pete is terrible at rescuing as he well knows or he wouldn't be in this ineffectual field and he is incredibly non reflective you'd think someone with an msw would be getting marriage counseling or getting therapy for his daughter etc though i do get that it was the 70s and it was montana it's not that i doubt that he wouldn't but i didn't really understand why he wouldn't it doesn't even seem to have been considered he seems to have no interest whatsoever in self improvement there's just this lack of interiority which seems to be the bane of american lit of late esp when written by men or rather this lack of soul maybe this is the bane of western lit particularly english lit and english american lit not to generalize in this novel we have access to the interior lives of three characters pete cecil and rachel cecil as a character works but i don't have much hope for him thanks to pete rachel is uninteresting thanks mainly to herself she's just a twit pete doesn't seem to have much of an interior life he's also a twit meanwhile pearl while there was an attempt to create a backstory a why for him it felt kind of rote to me here we have a stereotypical doomsday preacher guy per an hbo series where's the inner spirituality for a guy like this wouldn't he have one didn't moses or abraham have one if not why not it just seems to me that today's authors can't quite grasp this question and their books are a little bit empty because of it so back to the pacing lost me fairly early on for a while right after the dog bite when pete goes down to missoula and proceeds to get really really drunk and paw women and what all with no mention of the bite no pain nothing then suddenly a day or two later there it is again and he needs the bandage changed on this suppurating wound that apparently needs no further care and causes no actual pain or difficulty such as when he reaches for something also i thought the dog had got under his coat and done some damage to his side as well but that's dropped too so about 60 or so pages into the book we see that here we have an author who goes to the trouble to create situations in vivid detail and then just drops threads i hate that and here's this guy after a bender unwashed reeking didn't even brush his teeth getting his stinking wound changed and the woman helping him out hits on him yeah right only a male writer would think that one up tip brush your teeth guys point being we had all this gripping stuff going on up north and then here we are in missoula with this horrible dilation pages and pages of this boring drunkenness barfly women fucking pathetic female social worker fucking etc in the same vivid detail as say the dog attack but with like zero interest for the reader because next point being these people up north with their structural poverty and multigenerational addictions and abuse are despite themselves interesting pete really isn't and i didn't give one shit about his wife or for that matter about his totally banal daughter an insightful precocious daughter might have been cool but she was not such a one she had options she could have had a little perspective there are kids in this situation who mature early and become the ones who take care of the parents who get themselves to school and figure things out in some ways they're even sadder but nope not her i suppose she was rejecting her father in a way sort of similar if inverse to the way he rejected his but going off to harvard and never coming back might have been another way just a thought twit so the novel rocked and raged in the sections where pete engaged with his clients and fell down imo when he dealt or didn't with his family as did pete himself i had no more hope for these people or for pete himself than i did for pete's clients this was probably the point but because these people including pete when he is on the page with them are not interesting having had so many more options that they do not choose to see or execute it makes half the novel drag great debut looking forward to the next novel totally worth reading is what i mean and while i think it should be highly praised it belongs in the category of debut novels that are pretty darn mind blowing but not exactly the heart is a lonely hunter or to kill a mockingbird you know","103":"despite glowing reviews i'm hard pressed to say that i enjoyed this book or really got anything lasting from it sure it's gritty and vivid but it's also dismal and meandering er wyoming i'm sire the odd sentence structure and lack of punctuation was meant to underscore the informality of the settings but it was a bit distracting and sometimes confusing for me i was off in a woody area on vacation and thought this book would draw me in but instead it took me over a week to slog through i don't always need a satisfying ending but i do crave a substantive or meaningful end this book ended almost too tidily yet still seemed empty and pointless","104":" the real deal for 460 pages henderson hustles and moves with this story packs punches and surprises lingers where he needs to linger and skips where he doesn't i was wary of this one i'll admit it wary of the hype wary of how much it sounded like it should be exactly my thing wary of how much energy it might take if i loved it-- or worse if i didn't i love to be dead wrong what did it turn out to be exactly my thing no \"should\" or \"maybe\" about it pete snow the pearls mary and cecil and katie and even rachel or rose they didn't sap my energy they gave me energy sometimes a book is just good and if this one's got a trajectory you could draw on paper that line would curl and wander and loop back on itself and race ahead but in elevation it would look like the line drawn east up the west face of a mountain straight uphill i thought i had the ending pegged down and once again dead wrong the fifth star was earned in the last fifty pages not to make you wary like i was with the praise but highly recommended sometimes a book does just what it needs to do","105":"i hope henderson writes more books masterful storytelling in a book that's almost 500 pages but you can't believe it's already over a story that's full of bad choices and bad endings but somehow makes you feel hopeful great writing raw and real","106":"see amanda whitten's review","107":"not bad i wasn't sure i'd like it but it sounded intriguing so i gave it a shot it's fairly gritty and no happy ending but it works","108":"i know i'm a sucker for anything set in montana but this is fantastic i'm sorry it's over","109":"there's a great story here but the casual writing style got on and stayed on my nerves multiple points of view and many characters didn't help things either still the story is like nothing else i've read oh the novelty","110":"extraordinary first novel","111":"the dense picturesque writing and emotionally fraught story had me immersed in pete snow's ever more bizarre reality through the entire book as the dark secrets of every one's past bubble to the surface and stories intertwine some mysteries grow more wretched henderson is a colorful writer that knows how to craft a tale","112":"very powerful will tear at your heart","113":" best fiction book i have read in quite some time although it has quite a few parts that are hard to read the main character is a child protective services worker in the 1970s there was a lot of suspense and intrigue and even some of the bad guys are shown to be human the whole way though i was convinced that i could not possibly be satisfied with the ending but i was i listed to the book on audible which had a different female narrator for the rachel sections after talking with others who read the book it sounds like the audio made those sections better highly recommended if you can handle some of the depressing violent sections","114":"don't let the 3 star rating fool you this was a good book with seriously good writing but omg these were some messed up people once the story got going it was very good but the build up took too long i was seriously considering putting it aside for a while but i'm glad i stuck with it","115":"i would give this book 20 stars i cannot get it off my mind","116":"not my favorite book but did keep me interested definitely a different kind of book than what i am used to","117":"absolute page turner filled with great writing and incredibly rich storytelling an imperfect hero does what he can in 1980's u s a to save a child and family and his own family as well","118":"a bleak gut punch of a book henderson's writing is excellent as he manages to find sweetness and moral ambiguity at the core of people whose actions range from stupid to unlikeable to unjustifiable i couldn't help rooting for pete rachel as well as pearl luke and even pinkerton despite the fact that i do not expect i would want to be surrounding by these people in real life the washington post book editor named this the best book he's read so far this year high praise and well deserved if you're looking for light beach reading steer clear of fourth of july creek but if you want to relish the power of words and a story beautiful told then grab this book immediately","119":" how can this not be five stars it's essentially a story about three lost children and this one guy's attempt to find them he's a social worker so we have a social worker as alcoholic fuckup hero one of the kids he's trying to save is his daughter in the novel it's 1980 81 82 carter into reagan and we're in the wilderland of montana where there's a crackpot and his family one of these millenarian swivel eyed ranters about the gold standard and masons and the illegal government in washington and how roberto calvi's death by hanging from blackfriars bridge in london was precisely foretold in revelations and is a portend of the end times our social worker pete snow gets involved gets fascinated when the son of this family wanders into the playground of a school intrigued by the sight of so many children he's not related to this is a big statement novel and i was reminded of that famous aside in hendrix's song fire \"move over rover and let jimi take over\" because in this context jonathan franzen rover and smith henderson jimi if franzen is continually taking the psychological temperatures of his bedizened middle class cohort and making neurotic notes and fretting here and fretting there henderson is showing us a whole other thing a working class world where everything is in a continual state of fuckedupness people are careening like pinballs from one carcrash to the next and if there are any notes on these terrible cases pete snow out of his brain as usual has just opened his office window and hurled them out into the street his daily anguished protest against the enormity of what happens to americans without a safety net where his social services department is the only one they've got and you can see for yourself what state that's in there's a really chilling theme running like an evil undertow in this large novel child sex there are some offhand remarks about fostering and children's homes indicating as if this was such an open secret that it's on a level with santa claus not being real that foster parents and children's home workers routinely had sex with the kids in their control - like of course jackass what did you think this is not pursued it's just there like background static like the abstracted humming of all america's paedophiles then there's the fate of female runaways they become hookers we're also given to understand that this is the way the world is and what if they're only 13 14 15 so much the better because the punters will love it another author would have made this the main plot but here it's just part of the picture i admired the coldness of that there's going to be a tv mini series for sure which will be a must see for 2015 or 2016 and i'm predicting right now that the kid actress who gets the role of rose snow pete's daughter will be someone we never heard of and will knock us all out and will get the golden globe for jeremiah pearl there's only one choice but it's too obvious daniel day lewis a globe is also waiting for that actor and i was thinking amy ryan would be great as the drug fiend mother of cecil but it would be a retread of helen mccready in gone baby gone in fact that's why i thought of her so sorry amy it has to be somebody else you'd have been great henderson's style has come in for some comment it's in your face and sometimes it does have more than a tinge of the cormac portentousness about it but i think henderson has really got his own voice going here here is pete overwhelmed by what could have happened to his daughter when he went out in the chilled morning to his car tiny handprints from some prior removal preserved in the frost on his windows promptly undid him he slumped against the car door into the crusty snow and howled out griefs that had come on as sudden and frightening as earthquakes and even after they emptied out left him in fear of aftershocks of unseen cracks in the load bearing trestles of his mind and he's fond of uncommon words he parked and circled the abandoned brick and granite structure stern bartizans like watchtowers the turkey vultures turned in slow circles black and cruciatepearl spoke endlessly of catamounts how they are the only creature that kills for sport they spent a day climbing up into the floor of a glacial cirque they hiked an esker that cackled with snowmeltmaybe you will think that stuff is overwritten striving to impress but for me it made this fictional world as real as pain where smith henderson came from i don't know but he's here now i recommend this novel to all of you","120":"i fill bad for my one star with all the rave reviews had to start this book twice just to weird form me the pearl family was the only story in the book other than that just a lot of rambling","121":"not for me but i gave it a 75 page try","122":"incredible novel i regret that i can only give this 5 stars it deserves 10 at least this author has a remarkable future ahead of him a must read for anyone interested in sociology political science and philosophy definitely one of the best books i've read in my life time gritty dark heart breaking a staggering first endeavor by the writer i believe that the writing style is well suited to this type of storytelling","123":"this book was intense an engaging story centered around a social worker drunk dude who makes questionable decisions in rural montana in the 1960s and the people with whom he interacts so it's a fairly disturbing story line henderson's style reminds me a bit of faulkner meaning that i didn't totally understand what was happening all the time and was a slow read for me all in all i thought it was ok it was certainly unique and a distinct point of view and i'm glad that i read it but i can't say i really enjoyed","124":" congratulations to smith henderson on an outstanding novel about life in the montana wilderness during an interesting time in our recent history fourth of july creek very fitting title is riveting and thought provoking from start to finish with inspiring and engaging characters pete snow is a true hero a complex but a truly good man who wins our hearts for his selfless courage with troubled characters including his daughter jeremiah pearl is chilling but henderson brings about sympathy for him and understanding for his plight pearl's son benjamin wins the day how can you not love this boy and many many other great characters and plots interwoven in this great book very intense but engaging not overly difficult to read","125":"for my taste this is one of the best books i read this year well written quirky characters interesting plot and doesn't fall apart at the end i almost feel like reading it again because i may have missed some things in the early morning reading hours when i didn't want to put it down","126":"if you enjoyed philipp meyer's american rust or d w wilson's ballistics then i think you will enjoy fourth of july creek set mostly in the wilds of montana as reagan comes to power the theme of a disconnect from society has a genuine resonance with today's world which i guess is the point a good man tries his best to do the right thing in difficult circumstances helping problem families as his own family falls apart likeable but hopelessly flawed the america he encounters is broken and no war on drugs or war on terror or war on the poor is ever likely to fix it","127":" this is one of those books that i could hardly put down and consequently i am re reading parts of it to make sure i cement it in my brain it is a riveting gritty story with lots of layers and a gripping character study of pete the child welfare worker whose own daughter is a runaway his ability to reach out and care for neglected or abused children is touching even though his alcoholism wreaks havoc with his lifestyle many subplots to this fascinating book with themes of how complex our relationships are and how people surmount tremendous obstacles and are able to love","128":"i did not really enjoy this book pete is a social worker in rural montana and encounters the pearl family who have some interesting ideas on the world pete's encounters with the pearls is also peppered with his own problems in life like his runaway daughter the end of the book was more intriguing than the beginning but i wouldn't actually recommend this to anyone","129":"dark and haunting characters are dark and complex i kept changing my mind about them not a feel good novel but deserves the maximum number of stars","130":"an amazing book i wish i had time to write a longer review because this book deserves it this is a debut novel and i can't wait for whatever smith henderson does next but i need to see a birth certificate before i believe his name is really smith henderson","131":"audio version 3 stars fyi rating has more to do w me than the author's writing which was very good however i found this book on a list for the mystery genre when i was looking for a book set in montana for a state challenge and as a bonus saw that it won many awards so to be informed it is more a historical character and issues driven book however lesson for me check the genre tags on grs and better read not skim the synopsis so part of the less than stellar star rating is b c i went in expecting something else and was disappointed b c it isn't a mystery u0026amp a little diff than expected fr skim of preview the other part had to do w it being slightly longer than necessary u0026amp just too many storylines for my tastes also this was a historical period piece a little u0026amp set in early 80s which i wasn't expecting but that part was interesting b c since it covered a span of nearly 2 years reader can learn or reminisce about mt st helen erupting regan carter presidential elections and regan brady shooting attempted assassination which played into storyline as well as for background setting right off the bat i did like the one main character pete social worker but could clearly see he drank way too much u0026amp too escape so alcoholic which wasn't addressed in the book to very far into it u0026amp wasn't references synopsis so wondered if this was about an alcoholic or not then there was a storyline w him helping one family where there was abuse addiction u0026amp incest and he was heavily invested in that family u0026amp it ran throughout book then there was the family mentioned in the synopsis the nearly feral boy u0026amp mountain father that didn't appear much of the earlier part of book except quick initial meeting u0026amp him asking around about the father but second half was heavily surrounding that storyline then he also had detailed u0026amp lengthy family issues w his criminal brother hiding from his p o his somewhat estranged dad u0026amp his wife w many past related issues there and w his estranged wife and his daughter who start age 13 u0026amp goes through abt 15 and latter plays a big part throughout but esp towards the end including her mom taking her out of state tx and her disappearance u0026amp then her pov through various relationships u0026amp situations while missing along this road he meets a new woman co worker also w issues and that is interwoven at various times throughout then throughout there is a pov part that is an interview or therapy session type thing w girl u0026amp who seems to be pete's daughter but not be u0026amp interviewer therapist social worker is also not identified which since i was listening to audio i thought i missed that but found out via grs not specified and all for the reader to ponder analyze u0026amp speculate about there were some very good elements however for me it would have been better even if still not a mystery so much if it he would have focused on maybe only 2 storylines in detail u0026amp others lightly in background u0026amp even 1 or 2 removed thus allowing it to be shorter as well as reader getting more attached to a character situation issue rather than 5 or 6 storylines u0026amp not connecting so much u0026amp losing interest","132":" not sure how to write about this book exactly i really wanted to like it but didn't love it as much as i thought i would but first of all i have to give the author props for making his central character be a social worker you don't see that too often and as a social worker myself i have to represent though i don't work in child protective services at all granted this is one messed up social worker that seems to have just as many or more problems and dysfunctions than the people he's trying to help but still i really liked that aspect of the story the novel focuses on pete snow a social worker in rural montana i think the story is set in the late 70's or early 80's who visits children and families in their homes and has a very difficult job trying to assess safety and abuse issues over a huge area of land with people living in the woods and way far out it follows pete through crises in his own life and family as well as several children and families that he interacts with in his role as the social worker including a man and his son that are hiding in the mountains living off the grid and there may or may not be some kind of mystery going on with them this is a very dark and gritty book a little too dark for me very depressing some explicit sexual scenes involving sexual abuse that were really hard to read it's difficult to judge a book based on that because as a social worker i know that horrific things do happen in life kids get abused and people treat each other horribly and you can't just sugar coat things however i'm not sure that i want to spend a lot of time reading about if you know what i mean also i felt like the story rambled a bit like it went in several different directions and almost felt like he wasn't sure where he was going with it all that said in many ways i felt that the writing was excellent the way he captures dialogue and sets the scene really drew me in and made me feel like i was right there in montana and made the characters feel very real i think this is henderson's first novel so i'll be interested to see what he writes next","133":"pete fourth of july creek's social worker protagonist lives and works in the middle of nowhere montana in addition to being a save the day social worker pete is also a black out drunk separated from his alcoholic cheating wife he has a teenage daughter rachel whom he rarely sees and with whom he has a tenuous relationship his guilt over his relationship with his daughter fuels his attitude toward the kids with whom he works he finds himself frequently enmeshed in horrible situations but fails to recognize how much he contributes to these catastrophes like pete the book as a whole has a lot going on it is not singularly focused there's the issue of pete's own family crises his cheating wife who decides to move to texas his runaway teenage daughter there's the issue of pete's brother who's had some run ins with the law and has now crossed state lines to hide from his probation officer there's the issue of pete's new girlfriend a fellow social worker who was herself shuttled from group home to foster home to group home in her youth suffering innumerable abuses along the way there's the issue of the fighting mom and son that we meet in the first few pages and finally there's the issue of the pearls by far the most interesting part of the book a religious extremist paranoid father who has a frightening obsession with numismatics \"every time there's a recession someone goes on about it how the whole game is fixed how bullets and seeds are the only really real currency only with pearl more intense you can tell he's brewing trouble the way he talks \" and his young son benjamin who are squatting in the montana wilderness occasionally all of these subplots interact and overlap but for the most part they share just one common denominator pete the writing is labored and intense there are lots of sentences in which it is clear that henderson is trying a touch too hard \"snow falls in white floc like the ashy precipitate of a yonder fire in discrete spirals and helixes on a haphazardry of vehicles squad cars and motorcycles on the way to fourth of july creek \" there are endless paragraphs of dense details replete with metaphors \"he turned onto highway 28 and the clouds quit raining altogether and shortly thereafter broke up like a crowd after a fistfight he drove into mature afternoon sunshine the yellow valley slicked and glistening where the haymows stood in the fields like wet yurts \" the ending no spoilers don't worry is silly in its affectation and at 470 pages the book is obviously way too long if i were henderson's editor i would have hacked away at 90% of those paragraphs of details but that's not to say the book is all bad and considering all of the above i actually liked it a lot more than i would have thought there are plenty of great ideas pete is a really interesting character the pearls' storyline is excellent and engaging and the book is emotionally complex and not at all in a cheesy pull at your heartstrings kind of way but the style is definitely not my cup of tea the book is long full of angsty poetic prose and very character driven you can read my full review here https iknowwhatyoushouldread wordpr","134":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i needed some time to absorb this book before i could really talk about it i initially gave it 4 stars but since i can't stop thinking about this book and the characters within i'm bumping it to 5 stars here are some of my thoughts pete snow and jeremiah pearl are the central characters in the book and both are fascinating and complex men who are complete opposites on the surface but maybe not so different down deep i know smith henderson originally wrote these characters for two separate i needed some time to absorb this book before i could really talk about it i initially gave it 4 stars but since i can't stop thinking about this book and the characters within i'm bumping it to 5 stars here are some of my thoughts pete snow and jeremiah pearl are the central characters in the book and both are fascinating and complex men who are complete opposites on the surface but maybe not so different down deep i know smith henderson originally wrote these characters for two separate novels but throwing them together into one novel was genius some of the minor characters in this story could be have their own novel as well i don't see this mentioned in most of the reviews i've read but the female characters are so important to this story and to our understanding of pete snow i see mary rachel and katie in many ways as the same person in different stages of this terrible foster care runaway life i also think pete found it much easier to help the men and boys in this story but he couldn't be there for the women in his life his way of helping was black and white get kids out of dangerous situations provide homes for them get them the basics like clothing food medicine but when it came to providing emotional support he failed most of the time and now for some serious speculation with no real evidence i'm quite sure smith henderson modeled the seattle street kids after the kids from streetwise mary ellen mark's article and the 1980s movie i went to college in seattle and we were shown the movie streetwise during orientation it was a way to say you are now part of this city you can't just pretend poverty doesn't exist you can't ignore the presence of these kids pomeroy is an important character in this story and pomeroy is the name of a well known seattle street kid that was featured in the movie and that committed suicide at 16 the physical descriptions of rachel match up really well with tiny the main child in the movie the description of how small she was and how young she looked in her jeans and tennis shoes the comments about her funny haircut with long and short bangs if you look at the photos of tiny you can see rachel google it more","135":"this book is hard to rate because its unlike anything i've read before it's well written smith henderson draws you in with his descriptions landscape and bleak situations i've heard comparisons of his writing to cormac mccarthy which seemed to fit it's the story of social worker pete snow with his crusade to help the son of religious zealot recluse benjamin pearl pete's own daughter runs away underscoring the irony of pete's work the interesting part about this novel is that most of the characters are largely unlikable but you have to keep reading which is a credit to smith henderson it switched viewpoints back and forth which was a little rocky for me his daughter's perspective is presented in a third person question and answer format it took a little bit of getting used to and i kept thinking leading the witness as the questions were asked the viewpoint didn't work for me but maybe other people will enjoy its uniqueness i'm glad we got to uncover what really happened to make the pearls act the way they did it's a good reminder that you don't really know people's whole story and so you shouldn't judge the ending left me wanting a little more closure but that may have been the intention of the author to have you wonder about some of it i feel like the characters in this book will haunt you for some time after you finish it great debut novel for smith henderson","136":" i would not have guessed this book would have been a five star for me as i slowly worked my way through it i actually started it months ago just couldn't get into it and then picked it back up over the weekend this is not a fast paced plot driven book and if you have to like the characters to like a book then this one might not be for you but when i finished it and set it down last night i suddenly realized how much i loved it the writing is phenomenal there were paragraphs i read re read highlighted and went back to and the characters were so deeply flawed and human in a way that was somehow relatable like making us all see a little bit of ourselves in a fundamentalist religious extremist anti government whack job i loved the way that his daughter's story was interwoven in the format of this mysterious interviewer it helped to juxtapose the extremes pete was going to to save his clients while he couldn't save his own daughter or himself and without giving any spoilers i was totally ok with how it concluded even though i bet it pissed off many a reader this is one of those books that gives truth to the idea that reading allows you to live many lives in many different places i feel like at least for 500 pages i lived the life of a social worker in montana just trying like anyone else in any other job or place to do the best he could to get by","137":"the novel tells the story of a flawed social worker pete snow and the disturbing characters he comes across in rural montana i can see why literary folks give this 5 stars very well written however i found it too grim and depressing to enjoy","138":" better than average writing and top notch characterizations just not my cup of tea to depth of human moronic behaviors and self destroying continual habit of the characters living in this beautiful physical environment if given a set of better matches for a bonfire or an eternally powered heating system they would all proceed to burn their own lodgings and forest down or use it as a liquor rack or something parental and authoritative representations in nearly universal aspect in this are as sick as the helped most of them even sicker i almost made it to the end but not quite this will be the last low life category book i read for quite some time juxtaposition this with a louise penny or a georgette heyer or a julian barnes and it truly comes out the loser in other categories as well but i do see the 5 star rating from some gr friends because it certainly does meld","139":" i see that smith henderson gets a lot of praise for this book and i'll agree it's deserved fourth of july creek is a dark troubling all american read and will infiltrate your dreams in strange ways finishing it is like coming off a bender for a couple of days i couldn't tell if i was physically ill or just psychically overwhelmed henderson has created a remarkable cast of human beings who when all is said and done you will be glad you got to know some of them anyway pete snow is a kind of hero a man whose life is so f ed up but who still just gets on with it and always tries to do the best he can what more can one do i was strapped in on this roller coaster from page one","140":"this is in my top two favorite books this year the story of a social worker and a survivalist family in rural montana is told in a very unusual voice voices the story weaves with several others and manages to fully explain several very diverse characters i'm not doing it justice this is an amazing book","141":"some chapters are written like a poem i haven't sat still long enough to just read something like it deserves so i'm glad i took the time to finish it now","142":"huge shout out to karlie for recommending this to me it was a gorgeously written truly heartfelt first novel for smith henderson i think we can expect really great things of him in the future this book was just captivating i didn't want to put it down","143":"i read this a couple years ago and it somehow got removed from my list anyway wonderful book poor pete a social worker he went through some unbelievable situations you will love this book","144":" i listened to this on my ipod and it has really stayed with me the author raises the usual questions who are we to tell others how to live their lives even if they aren't living how most people live do folks with a different lifestyle need rescuing what is the line between avoiding the government and being a criminal can a person help others when he she has lost control of his her own life how long does it take for someone to realize they are trying to undo past wrongs by saving others who may not want to be helped after reading this book i was even less able to answer these questions than before","145":"best work of fiction i read in 2014","146":"i was really glad to finish reading this book","147":"this is a story of a wretched individual or maybe not so wretched but wrecked maybe a person with a dark corner that could be very similar to us if allowed to bloom with life's happenstance there is a descent into debauchery and a sense of oh man why are you doing that he cares he loves he tries he feels and bad shit happens a lot many points of view much great writing you care you feel you like the book this is a powerful novel and one that i will think about for quite some time","148":"perhaps 4 5 stars it would be a no doubt five star book if it wasn't so full of crappy people doing terribly depressing things amazingly well written and vivid just yeesh i'm thrilled that i discovered and read it but i can't imagine reading it again","149":"beautifully written study shades of bukowski and tom waits lyricism of the people and environs of late '70s montana equal attention given to the landscape as well as the characters rambling and absorbing never less than intriguing and interesting","150":"my rating 1 out of 5 had to quit it was so tedious","151":" she already had a beer on the floor near her that she picked up and drank put her palm on her hip the loose beauty of her the way her smile cracked across her face her wide lopsided curl rigged into a bun that seemed liable to topple down reminded him of a tooth about to come out a button about to fall off everything about her always on the verge of falling down or out made a body want to screw her heart out even now this is one of my favorite books of the year next to station eleven review forthcoming it's about a social worker working in one of the most difficult parts of the usa in the '80's he has a lot of cases but the main throughline of the book follows his interactions with a father and son living loose in the mountains it seems like a clear case of neglect at first but there's a lot more to learn and it's as much about the social worker coming to terms with his life as it is his clients there's a lot of tough and a lot of sadness in this book but there is also so much warmth and life and humor it is ultimately a triumphantly uplifting experience i loved the writing and the fallible main protagonist and of course i fell in love with young benjamin what i didn't predict was how fascinating his father became as a character jay jay a lot of his dialogue reminded me of our discussions about the homeless man that used to visit me on sepulveda and the character he became in the story we're still writing to wit you come clothed in weakness but i know what stands behind you you insinuate yourself among good people and you rot them from the inside with your diseases and mental illnesses also the book captures female adolescence in a way i haven't read in a long time did i mention the book is really funny sometimes i feel that the quotes i gave might not give that justice in any case the author delivers so many distinct and perfectly drawn characters and i loved the experience it is also a remarkably honest account of social work i'd recommend this to judge lauren dash and nicki and jase but know that children are in peril so choose accordingly","152":" the worst thing in this world next to anarchy is government henry ward beecherit is 1980 1981 and social worker pete snow works with no backup in the backcountry of montana and not very many people are happy to see him when he shows up even though he's quick to tell them he's not law enforcement he sees awful things that have been done to children he gets shot at dogs come after him and that's just a normal day it's no wonder he's an alcoholic and falling apart emotionally his wife cheats on him and then moves out of state with their 13 year old daughter who has a story of her own included in this lengthy tome and his world just keeps collapsing on him then he meets benjamin pearl a half wild young boy and his father jeremiah pearl who live on the outskirts of society and for some reason this wild duo halfway trust pete and his troubles really start snowballing what a classic this book is destined to be this definitely isn't a feel good tale but it is a stunning first book by author henderson that's not to say it doesn't have problems disjointed in spots and it definitely could have had probably 100 pages trimmed and i thought the interview segments about snow's daughter were handled awkwardly but it held my interest all the way to the end so what do i know fast flowing dialogue rich descriptive passages super character development all put together in a literary winner note i received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review","153":"a hauntingly deep plot with lush prose this story is filled with one hardship and broken life after another set in choteau montana pete snow is a social worker whose main responsibility is handling cases of children in poor families filled with drugs gloom malnourishment and neglect pete's marriage to beth is in shambles because she cheated on him beth takes their daughter rachel and goes to texas because she's fallen in love with a truck driver jimmy as beth and rachel drive across america rachel shares her thoughts of their wyoming in life which is as empty and void as the state of wyoming they cross only fourteen rachel runs away from her mother and her life spirals downward when she gets entangled with pomeroy a pimp and yo it is heartbreaking to read about rachel who renames herself rose as she falls in with pomeroy and yo pete seeks desperately to find his daughter pete's father dies his brother luke assaults his parole officer wes reynolds and flees to oregon parallel to the story of pete's fractured family are two families whose children are cases pete is handling cecil and little katie are in a broken home with their drug addicted mother debbie cecil is a young boy and his life goes off the rails as he is placed in various fosters homes and is wanted by no one benjamin pearl is living in the woods with his anarchist father jeremiah this portion of the story is filled with the fear and paranoia of vigilante groups who think the world is coming to an end and the government cannot be trusted pete tries to solve what happened to jeremiah's wife sarah and their four other children who have disappeared jeremiah defaces coins with symbols of what is coming he prohibits his family from going to school reading watching tv cartoon books etc pete meets and falls in love with mary who was sexually abused as a child when she was passed from foster home to foster home she turns tricks on the side and puts relationships into different drawers in a miniature chest stored in her mind pete is dealing with so many damaged people and their damaged hopeless lives that his life too becomes broken neglected he loses his daughter and he drinks far too much to cover and anesthetize himself from all of the sadness and pain","154":"great story about some very hard lives","155":" so great for whatever reason i didn't have high hopes for this but i loved it from the beginning the writing is great as in i stopped a few times to admire phrasing and the characters are remarkably likable plus the narrator of the audiobook version is phenomenal i want to read everything he narrates forever i would like to add that i'm mad at publisher's weekly for the dumb review of this novel the reviewer was either exceptionally grumpy that day or has no business reviewing contemporary fiction bah humbug","156":" this book made me think of junior year english with mr leal and made me want to get out the pen to make notations in the margins what layered nuances to character did the names pete snow and jeremiah pearl have given to them i wanted to brush up on my biblical knowledge of the prophet jeremiah to see what light it shed on mr pearl this book was beautifully written the characters are at times unlikeable but they are real and you can feel the pain and torment jump off the pages while the overall story could be disheartening and dark there is an underlying theme of hope optimism and goodness","157":"it is so hard to start reading a new book after this one and i've even chosen a work by a stellar author yet her opening pages are blanched of color it's not her fault it's merely proximity to fourth of july creek the power the residue of this book continues to haunt me i can't help worrying about its characters the montana weather enveloped me what sensory writing and the situations twisted my gut yet this work is shot through with such compassion this is a stunning novel","158":"some parts were great but others in the back story were hard for me to follow","159":" it was hard for me to mark this book didn't like it since it is really well written in many ways with very clear characters i do understand why it received so many positive reviews perhaps it is just the season but i just really felt everybody in this novel was living a pretty awful and even sordid life so it got me down and seemed much too long still glad i read it though there are a lot of threads in the tale the two main ones concern pete snow a social worker in montana and jeremiah pearl and his son benjaming an anti government survivalist living out in the wilderness at first i was prepared to cheer pete working against all odds to try to help truly down and out people but shortly i realize that he too is leading a rather wasted life too much drunkeness too much gratuitous sex too little effort to really lead a meaningful life and appreciate the beauty and possibilities and the dialogues between pete's runaway daughter and whom i thought it was with him but it couldn't be really so i never figured out this particular stylistic effort nor could i appreciate the inner dialogue of questions that weren't in the form of questions yes at the end there are some resolutions that seem good bucking the system that isn't working the way it should righting some wrongs due to incorrect assumptions and some resolutions that don't happen and seem realistic but overall i was left wanting to read something uplifting that would convince me that the lifestyles in this book aren't as all pervasive as it seemed i guess i wasn't made to live in the great west wilderness country","160":"this vivid novel follows circumstances in the life of a montana social worker he is an imperfect person working through an imperfect system to try to do what he can for imperfect people during this struggle we see the challenges in his own life as his marriage daughter and his own sanity parallel those in his work the book is beautifully written with very little to remind you that this is a first novel could easily be the plot line for a season of hbo's true detective","161":"this one was just too grim to finish","162":"this book is amazing and engrossing and horrifying and depressing and real and it's like watching a car wreck but one that's somehow also beautiful i stayed up past 3 am two nights in a row because i couldn't stop reading","163":"wow this was a doozy gritty and soulful and beautifully written just kind of smashes you","164":" quite a good book at the beginning i kept asking when is plot going to happen before i reached the midpoint of the book i was hooked i found the ending very satisfying despite not getting everything wrapped up with a pretty bow on it some other reviewers commented negatively on the way the book jumps around and can be hard to read at least when i was reading pete's story this simply made the book more real he's an alcoholic so we shouldn't expect his story to be 100% coherent similarly cecil's nuttiness and horrible mother and rachel's rose's descent should be hard to read about they're children and troubled ones at that they're thoughts and actions should feel all over the place","165":"best book i've read this year and i doubt it doesn't end up that way","166":"only august and i already have my pick for best book of the year wow","167":" fourth of july creek follows social worker pete snow through one of the most intense cases of his life pete is used to dealing with drug addled and neglectful parents and their troubled children for his work but when benjamin pearl appears at an elementary school dressed as if he has been roughing it in the woods of montana it is a case on an entirely different level benjamin's father jeremiah is a survivalist who has abandoned the modern world his beliefs are founded primarily on the visions of his wife sarah who agreed that they should move off the grid and become self sufficient pete's first interaction with jeremiah are tenuous jeremiah points a gun at pete and pete feels confident that jeremiah will use it still pete can see that benjamin is malnourished and is concerned fascinated with the family he wants to help them at the same time pete's daughter rachel runs away from home and while his ex wife seeks solace in religion pete begins a campaign to contact any and every locality that she might have passed through as this quest to find rachel proves futile with missed connections and false information pete becomes more focused on the pearls who he can help pete isn't the only one who has taken notice of the pearls however and pete becomes entangled in an fbi and secret service investigation into jeremiah this novel is gritty and doesn't shy away from some of the harsh realities of the child welfare system and juvenile justice this novel might not be the best for a more sensitive reader at the same time there are some exchanges which are pretty funny and not even just with gallows humor it wasn't fast paced like some novels i mean the protagonist is a local government bureaucrat but i didn't want to put this one down smith henderson's novel is set firmly within the gray area of right and wrong what is a personal freedom and what is a crime that should be punished and what is helping as opposed to interfering certainly pete and jeremiah have very different ideas about what constitutes a crime and what help is acceptable while it doesn't wrap everything up into a neat package this ambiguity is part of makes the novel read true","168":"i admit this was beautifully written but i really had a difficult time getting through it it's just such a sad and dark story filled with abuse drug use alcoholism rape prostitution etc the characters were all so troubled and flawed but the only one i felt truly sorry for was benjamin no bright light or closure at the end of this story","169":"interesting good writing with a lot to think about but never fully gripped me in audio or print","170":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here 1 just because you own a thesaurus doesn't mean you have to use it in every single sentence way was way too many $10 words crammed into this book 2 i did not give a darn about pete's ex wife or daughter all the pages devoted to either of them could have been spent developing the pearl's more 3 what was the point of mary what was the point of burning down the cabin can't anything good every happen to pete that said the last 100 or so pages moved quickly i liked the resolution of the 1 just because you own a thesaurus doesn't mean you have to use it in every single sentence way was way too many $10 words crammed into this book 2 i did not give a darn about pete's ex wife or daughter all the pages devoted to either of them could have been spent developing the pearl's more 3 what was the point of mary what was the point of burning down the cabin can't anything good every happen to pete that said the last 100 or so pages moved quickly i liked the resolution of the pearls more","171":"overall a great book but took a while to find it's footing","172":"wow this will be one of my top reads of the year","173":" well right away have to chalk this up to being unsure if he's read the same book as everyone else or maybe just another case of bad timing possibly potentially right book at the wrong time mood getting the rating out of the way it's a rounded up 3 star good book but unofficially 2 5 stars for just being on the fence about liking it it is a grim dark bleak gritty almost relentlessly so novel of dysfunction violence and abuse in rural montana this did not stop me from liking the novel but it didn't exactly encourage me to want to pick up the book at every any available moment thus i never felt like i had much any momentum with it and it took me about halfway to get into it a bit too late to recover for me but enough to soldier on i did like the lead character of pete snow an anti hero ish social worker with a life that needs some serious social work itself definitely physician heal thyself territory and likewise there were interesting characters and situations but overall i wished the novel was tighter too much bloat or perhaps wyoming to use an oft quote word from the book also the subplot written in a qu0026amp a format always jolted me out of the narrative and just seemed and ineffective if a bit gimmicky way to tell that particular story i also found myself wondering about things how could pete just pick up and leave town granted for good reasons for extended periods of time what about his other social cases given the stuff we knew about in his territory there had to be more likewise not sure how he could afford it either i am quite willing to suspend reality belief but it is never a good sign when my mind wanders off to this kind of stuff while reading a novel i will remember this novel for the wonderfully flawed character of pete again found the writing competent but none of the many superlatives i see as i am skimming through the mostly glowing reviews so what i am most left with is wondering what i missed though i don't plan to spend too much time worrying about one of the great things about books is how they resonate differently with each person another great thing there's always another one waiting in the wings onward","174":"dark heartbreaking frustrating and yet i couldn't stop reading","175":"loved this book from pg 1 it's the story of a cps social worker covering a large portion of rural montana including some survivalist camps through his cases you see how there are people who value and love their kids among all swaths of society just like there are people who neglect and abuse their kids through all swaths of society","176":" smith henderson has created a fascinating main character in this book a social worker who operates in the rural community in minnesota during the 1980s he is a flawed character and you empathize with him and worry about some of his decisions as he tries to help many of the people in his community yet lives a fairly reckless life himself the prose is beautiful but two parts of the book the use of the male and female narrators confused me in understanding the plot i also felt that the end of the book was somewhat abrupt as if the author was tired of writing and was eager to stop","177":"i either loved this book or was forcing myself to finish it very weird ups and downs and i just had such a hard time giving a shit about pete","178":"a raw and powerful novels that shows how even people who try to help others function in the world can get drawn into their own world of darkness great use of language but the end of time storyline was a little over the top for me","179":"amazing the best novel i read in 2014 i wouldn't be surprised if it's one of the best books i read in this decade i have procrastinated on writing a review because i don't think i can do it justice maybe i'll try another day but for those who love literary fiction i will just say yes you should read this in my view smith henderson is one of the most exciting voices in american literary fiction today","180":"pretty sure i'm the only one who didn't like this book i got 115 pages in and was just trudging through it and not enjoying it at all which is when i usually stop in books life is too short to read shitty books i found the characters to be boring and un relatable and only wanted to know more about cecil and less about pete and his family the style in which it was written was also hard to follow and get the hang of it took me awhile to figure out who was talking or who the chapter was about","181":" i really struggled to read this book it is very dark and i couldn't always follow the characters very well i nearly gave up reading but when i got just under half way through the book did then start to interest me more as the pace picked up the main character of the book pete snow is a social worker which in some ways is hard to imagine as the plot exposes the state of his own life and disintegrating family if anything i came away from reading this book with a reminder that none of us is perfect yet we can still make a difference to others","182":"excellent book i read this on the recommendation from the literary disco podcast and i couldn't recommend it enough for people that enjoy a good drama slight crime novel","183":"i'm giving this book 1 star but that's only because i couldn't finish it not bad writing just couldn't keep my interest and i didn't feel connected to any of the characters even after reading 1 3 of the book just not my style","184":"the writing in this book is amazing graphic real heart wrenching and satisfying some of the best writing i've experienced in a long time even when the subject can be uncomfortable","185":"not a single redeeming character in the whole creation sorry but i didn't enjoy this novel","186":"i thought this was a really good book sad and distressing at times but very enthralling it told a story of an america i can't even recognize from my california suburb","187":"i liked this but just had too much going on to really get into it another time i'd like to give it another try","188":"he doesn't say how they made it perhaps he thinks it and thinks he says it there is more than paranoia at work here his mind isn't right he bobs to the surface of human connection but resides mostly just under like waterlogged driftwood steadily saturating and sinking he drinks again wipes his beard with his dirty palm","189":" this is a story about a social worker in a small town in western montana in the early 1980s who is trying to help a renegade child avoid reform school and is trying to help another boy whose father is regarded as another version of the unibomber apparently a religious survivalist who is dangerous to all who come near him at the same time the social worker is trying to find his own daughter who has run away from her mother's home mother left the social worker a while ago the structure of the novel is interesting as the main story is told in a straightforward fashion but the daughter's story comes as a series of questions and answers the novel is realistic pervaded with alcohol and drug abuse by almost all the characters but one develops a fondness for all of them i believe that this is henderson's first novel and i am looking forward to more one more thing henderson has come up with a wonderful verb wyom taken from driving through wyoming and might be defined as living life bored or moving on in a bored fashion it works perfectly for people going through the motions","190":"wow this s a great debut novel a modern western in many ways pete snow is a social worker in montana his world is bleak really bleak he's a good guy but off duty has more than his own share of demons he gets involved with a fundamentalist christian who is convinced the end times are near and his young son who are living off the land up in the forests the book is hard hitting and ultimately has a lot to say about freedom","191":"an incredibly engrossing book pete is a social worker in western montana an essential good and noble man his life and the lives of his clients take a series of twists and turns these take pete down the depths of his soul but his goodness manages to recover time and after time how do people write such wonderful books","192":"the plot was interesting and the characters compelling but i just couldn't get over some of the writing this book needed to be edited there were lots of little inconsistencies in one paragraph the dog would be talked about as having no balls the next paragraph it was referred to as she dialogue was attributed to characters who weren't in the room at the time books always have something like this nothing is edited perfectly but i just felt like this had too many and it got in the way of my enjoyment of the book","193":"a social worker who is as dysfunctional as his clients still tries to do good undeniably well written although i did not like the intermittent chapters written as questions and answers seemed like an affectation quite a depressing read found myself hoping for some light at the end nope 3 1 2 stars","194":"i wish i could rate this higher but the unlike ability of pete just took something out of it for me unlike winter's bone where the main character is someone you're rooting for i just wasn't rooting for pete he kept screwing up his own life and i kinda wanted to yell at him definitely a nitty gritty real sort of read like winter's bone things don't get all tied up nicely in the end which is frustrating but true to the realness life doesn't tie up nicely in the end im not sure i understood the interview portions of the book have no idea who was being interviewed nor who was doing the interviewing i think i missed something there","195":"phenomenal book it's almost impossible to believe this is a debut novel the time period the setting the gloriously flawed characters are all woven together seamlessly in a story simultaneously bleak and moving","196":"not a redeemable character in the book it was a bit overly descriptive and a bit of a downer but i got into it and wanted to see where it went some very interesting dialogue and perspective choices i was interested in the rachel story but the qu0026amp a format was bizarre i kept thinking she would get together with cecil in spokane oh well","197":"very interesting book with a compelling protagonist in pete snow i didn't know quite what to make of the chapters about his daughter though","198":"one of the more depressing fictions i've picked up but an incredible read","199":"pete snow is a social worker who lives in montana and he has lots of problems in his personal and professional life i liked pete because he has a good heart and wants what is best for the children who he tries to save from their awful irresponsible dead beat parents these children are in crisis mode and pete removes many from their homes and places them in foster homes and this book moves quickly and has some interesting plots the heart of the book is certainly about the tragedies involved when children are mistreated and uncared for by their parents my major problem with the book is that smith henderson overdoes the bad parts maybe he thinks their are no bright spots for these children for me this would have been a great book instead on an okay one if there had been less violence drug use and sex and more good choices by someone anyone","200":"astonishingly good debut","201":"very dude lit interesting flawed male characters involved in drinking hiking regretting pretty flat female characters nice plot and scenery can't say i'd recommend it but kept the pages turning","202":"wow this isn't pretty but it is good","203":"there are very few books that i won't finish even if i'm not particularly enjoying them this was the exception i've read serial killer novels that were more uplifting i desperately wanted to like the main character but couldn't the story of a social worker is an interesting subject and the lives of the children in this story could be real but because of the writing style and digressions into the social workers life it just didn't give me the incentive to get to the end of the book","204":"despite the great ending only 3 stars the middle was a bit tedious and it took me forever to get through","205":" so if i had reviewed this book halfway through it would have gotten 2 stars i had a lot of trouble getting into it and almost quit there are quite a few story lines going on and for me it took time to understand what was going on and i kept waiting for them to get to the story that was described on the book jacket i kept reading rave reviews about this book and i still don't see that it was okay i hated the main character pete he was self absorbed and annoying what kept me reading was the story lines of the children on pete's caseload and his daughter's storyline the stories were sad and upsetting but powerful pete's daughter rachel also had a storyline it was written like an interview with her and that made it very different from the rest of the book it stood out to me and was a nice break from pete's story so in the end i gave it 3 starts it wasn't great but i finished it and don't feel like i wasted my time warning it is a fairly depressing book and there is a lot of foul language","206":"great characters and descriptions of scenery as the story went along such a thought provoking story makes one appreciate a stable environment and family","207":" despite the rave review in the nytbr i found this not to be great good but overly long and sometimes a bit precious wyoming and wyomed etc and come on the guy never had to show up for work and all the drinking and drugging to what end but it was a pretty good read if you don't mind the dark side of things fun to read about montana and its skin head libertarian days and impulses but the whole federal bad guy stuff was a lot dated i did finish it but in a rush and was not surprised that there was no ending of a believable nature all plot lines left unresolved","208":"although touted as the book you're going to be talking about this summer i found it to be a really difficult book to listen to it actually put me in the mind of gillian flynn's books the story line is good and the writing was good but the story was just so gritty that it was hard for me to get through it pete snow is a very flawed social worker for the montana department of family and children he is divorced from his wife alienated from his daughter and a little too dependent on alcohol to get him through his path crosses that of benjamin pearl an eleven year old who lives with his father jeremiah in the woods when pete tries to help he discovers that jeremiah is a survivalist who is convinced that the end of days is coming and he's going to be prepared there is also talk of his wife and additional children but pete doesn't see any evidence of them as pete continues his attempts to find out what he can do to help the pearls his own daughter runs away and he attempts to find her while continuing his regular work as he slowly gains some amount of trust from jeremiah he constantly seems to be walking a tightrope between being in danger and learning more about their history eventually the f b i becomes involved and then everything hits the fan after working in the mental health system for 36 years the situations in this book were just so true to life that they were difficult to read about so good book if you can handle it read by macleod andrews and one of my all time favorite readers jenna lamia","209":"it was a slow start but about two thirds of the way through the book it started getting interesting","210":"this is one of these books that make you sad to finish it very well written and researched henderson's knowledge of the social welfare system and what it is like to be a caseworker is amazing it loses momentum towards the end but overall one of the best i've ever read","211":"simply remarkable poignant touching disturbing engulfing best read of the year","212":" i don't know what to think about this book other than 'what the fuck did i just read ' it was bad it had the potential to be great it was well written but i didn't enjoy the way it was written at all the stream of conscience type it didn't work for me and i want my social workers to be super heroes not flawed alcoholics although his heart was obviously in the right place and mine broke for him so much heartbreak i have a hard time believing rachel would make the choices she made picking the streets over what seemed to me to not be that bad a situation why not go to pete and what exactly was this book about no clue i kept wanting to quit and now i wish i had i'm sure a ton of people will love this but not me sorry","213":"i really liked this book and was simultaneously really frustrated by it the characters were so compelling i really cared about them but so much of the time their stories came to dead ends the themes were a bit heavy handed but the narrative kept me incredibly engaged","214":" this was certainly worth the wait once i heard about fourth of july creek coming out in mid 2014 i knew i could bet a pop as in soda this would be for me not that i'm all that all that enamored of the big sky state it's one of my least favorite states of the union really with endless 100 mile long drives just to get to the next town with towns having little more than three {protestant} churches and ten taverns and really bad diner food but there's just something about novels set in montana that really appeal to me the last two novels i read that were set there the mixed reviewed canada by richard ford and the ya heart render the miseducation of cameron post by emily danforth each got five stars from me when i heard the protag of this was deeply flawed i'm a sucker for shlubs and losers this seemed a can't miss indeed it was terrific i don't know anything about author smith henderson other than this seems to be his debut novel though you'd never know it but this guy sure can write this novel is so substantive it could fill two perhaps even three novels without a whiff of filler i was riveted throughout the entire book it all starts with that aforementioned flawed ptrotag pete snow by no means a loser but plenty problem ridden consider his profession social work specialty child protective services in a chronically poor logging town tenmile montana a place in the early 1980s anyway if not even today mistrusting of government and its intrusions but desperately in need of its services further irony despite pete's calling to save children from neglectful families he along with his soon to be ex wife beth is a raving alcoholic and a terrible parent to his troubled teen daughter the story follows pete from neglect call to neglect call trying to save these kids in the community while trying to keep his own life together sound bleak and boring it's not okay yeah certainly a little bleak watching pete fight what seems like a losing battle but never boring this story is practically bursting at the seams of its rattiest hand me downiest parka with plot threads that guarantee to keep your attention glued it becomes immediately apparent that this is henderson's life work he knows every inch of the often recidivist often ineffectual child protection system the story he's woven here with pete snow as his intermediary trying desperately to atone for his familial mistakes while trying to right society's shortfall to its children totally wrecked me in the best way possible stylistically it's a wee bit grandiose streaked with flights of creative fancy but i dare you to read this and not come away affected in some way highly recommended","215":"see ed's review on 15th july he nails it perfectly","216":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i wanted to like this book i really did but i had major issues i forced myself to stay up last night

actually quite smart and seemed to be able to socialize with others ok and i felt the feral child actually helped pete snow 4 he leaves said feral child with his alcoholic brother who has beaten his parole officer and is living on the lam to live in a tepee a brother he hated until page 350 5 rachel rose no resolution there zip who was interviewing her police psychiatrist just randomly placed in the story and we never got the answer some may say the answer wasn't important i feel it is this book was less about the clients and more about he alcoholic social worker pete snow the guy needed time on a couch he failed his family and himself and then the author tried to have him redeem himself in the last twenty pages more","217":"review http www theguardian com books 2014","218":"the book started out slow and depressing but as the story progressed so did the anticipation of what would happen next henderson's amazing descriptions of action and movement allowed me to picture exactly what was happening in the scene very well done i'm glad i stuck with it","219":" pete snow is as broken and imperfect as the children he tries to save and the story is much darker almost relentlessly and frustratingly so than i anticipated which bogged me down a bit that said it is very well written vividly capturing both the time period and the starkness of rural america amidst these settings henderson slowly peels away the layers of both the characters and the plot to an unexpected climax the qu0026amp a device was a little challenging to me as i wanted more of rachel and her journey than just the sneak peeks that we were allowed the novel reminded me of richard ford while it didn't satisfy like it seemed to a lot of readers i do look forward to his next novel","220":" so praised i was prepared to not like it i liked it so much i devoted almost two entire days to finishing it the story was compelling enough the telling of the story more so lots of elegant underused words i was tempted to scribble them down to use in future words with friends matches many oddly shaped sentences that in the hands of a lesser writer would be just that well drawn and sympathetic characters a satisfying though hardly happy ending it's good intelligent summer reading and i highly recommend it","221":"beautiful writing","222":" shit happens in life and when it does we are always left with a mystery why me what caused this to happen did i deserve it no one answers all of the questions because some of them simply cannot be answered big events provoke these thoughts and we all have big events our parents die we have near misses on the road and our children may not reach the potential that we see in them but even the simple things cannot be fully explained and because of their lingering mystery they must be endured as well this is where forth of july creek lives it lives within the events of ordinary life big and small and it's hugely impressive that henderson chose the ordinary as his medium and while ordinary may not sound all that interesting it is indeed the stuff that comprises our lives forth of july creek is relevant because it puts our lives on display but not in the sense that we are looking at ourselves in a mirror rather it's because henderson lets us feel those things that we all feel when things must be endured from this perspective forth of july creek is absolutely about you and your life henderson's writing is uniquely his own this is not a book that was quickly put to paper and sent to market whether it's dialogue narrative or descriptions of the wilderness every word has a feeling of relevancy to the moment at times henderson changes his perspective in such a way that again gives weight to the feelings of the moment even though the plot may demand that the mystery of the unanswered questions be continued","223":"it was okay maybe a little bit of filler the ending was a cop out","224":"loved this book so much what can i possibly read next that will even be half as good","225":"if i could have given zero stars i would have i had to force myself to get to page 100 and finally have up the writing style was horrible and extremely hard to follow","226":"spooky story of a social worker in montana his own messed up life and the children and families he tries to help","227":"most depressing book i've ever read probably realistic but very sad","228":"very well written disturbing at times but good","229":"one of the most unique books i've read in a while very well written heartbreaking","230":"this is a very dark and depressing story a fact i should have anticipated when i learned the protagonist was a social worker in a rural impoverished area","231":"amazing first novel the author weaves together multiple plot lines in such a way that i never got confused","232":"honestly i just don't get what all the fuss is about none of the characters are remotely sympathetic and the author seems to enjoy making them wallow in their misery","233":"this book tackles many issues and gives the reader much to think about it took me a while to really care about the main character but i came around to accepting him with his many flaws and really wanted to find out what happened to his daughter the description is excellent and the writing style is creative if you are looking for a neatly tied up ending you won't find it in this book","234":"it took me several chapters to really lock in step with his writing style but once i did what a reward","235":"another 3 5 star read i thought this would be a good book to read over the 4th of july weekend but it has nothing to do with holidays it is basically a story of dysfunction violence and abuse in small town montana the writing is disjointed on purpose moving from flowingly poetic to choppy realism interesting but sometimes confusing the story of an alcoholic social worker and the 'wretched refuse' he serves is almost very good but way too long 500 pages and disjointed it is a first novel so hopefully next time the author will address some of these issues","236":"this is a remarkable first novel touching and powerful smith henderson is a writer to watch","237":"a book with some truly flawed characters good writing that took me to some very dark places this felt like it could should be more than one book to me i saw an interview with the author after i had read it he admitted that he had combined the ideas for two books into this one","238":"i'd give it 3 75 if i could entertaining and well written","239":"this books gave me goose bumps","240":"every reviewer or amazon commenter compares smith henderson's long novel set in mostly montana to cormac mccarthy and william faulkner which is obviously accurate since it's so unanimous but i think i've only read the very different the road by mccarthy and nothing by faulkner so i don't really have anything more to say on that what i do know is that fourth of july creek tells the story of social worker benjamin pearl whose territory is the dying gummit hating small towns out in the northwest and who often deals with horrible people doing horrible things to their children he's an active alcoholic and his alcoholic wife leaves him taking their 14 year old daughter to a horrorshow life in texas people get the crap beat out of them on numerous occasions in the novel spitting out teeth and such everyone eats shitty food if they eat at all and ben becomes fascinated by and eventually semi friends with a dangerous ultra christian mountain man and his young son a couple of other things happen too there's an important subplot involving ben's daughter which curiously kind of fizzles out and i like that the story set in the 1980s just because it's kind of nostalgic how fucking difficult it sometimes was to coordinate and communicate with people especially strangers who needed for something back then there are many well drawn scenes over the 450 pages and henderson's a colorful writer but i really stopped caring about everyone just a little past the halfway point and so all of the emotional punches of the novel's last act lacked any sort of force or urgency oh well on to the next","241":" this book was spectacular it was about a social worker in montana who becomes involved with a family of survivalists he tries to help their children and befriend the father but building trust takes a long time meanwhile his own family is falling apart his wife takes his daughter to live in texas and his daughter runs away the parallels of different broken families was well crafted but not over wrought i literally can't think of a single thing negative or even neutral to say about the characters plot writing style or composition of this book just amazing","242":"it has its ups and downs sometimes i was pulled in sometimes it was luke warm","243":"this book was so sad but so brilliantly written that i had to keep reading also love that the author lives here in portland","244":"the sign of a good writer is one who in spite of a very staccato writing style intentionally inundated with run on and fragmented sentences can take downtrodden characters who most likely the reader would never choose to have as friends and put the characters in a grim situation where only bad things happen to them compounded by the fact that they make only bad choices all while still managing to eke empathy out of the reader who can't stop turning the pages to find out if the characters' luck fate destiny call it what you will is ever going to change","245":" this is not something i would typically pick up but i did so because it ended up on some must read list for the summer i'm conflicted a bit i did not like the author's writing style at all and i hated the ending i mean not to spoil it but it totally leaves you hanging or maybe i just didn't get it i'll be anxious to hear the thoughts of others i know who might read it it did have very good character development and the plot was ambitious but much in the way of tartt's goldfinch it just kind of meanders to nowhere i gave it 3 stars because of the creativity it took to create such a story and also because i'm a sucker for great characters and i finished the book feeling like i would know these characters if i saw them on the street","246":" i was hooked from page one the working title of this novel was likely wyoming a verb which smith henderson defined as going from no where to no where by going through no where and getting no where like a drive through wyoming this novel will not wyom it is brilliant beautiful and ugly in spite of some rather odd metaphors and the strange tale of a woman nursing a baby from a bottle page 72 smith henderson will earn a spot in history for his first novel and i cannot wait to read more from him","247":"review coming later but i will leave you with this awesome book","248":"so the thing about this book is that i started it and it was wonderful and then dc public library tweeted about how it was their book of the day so i responded saying that i was actually reading it right now and loving it and then the author of the book tweeted at me and said bam moral of the story twitter can be amazing anyway pete is a social worker in rural montana a pretty serious alcoholic and going through a separation terrible right well it gets worse pete's life is a never ending wave of shit that happens to or around him why did i like this firstly it's an incredibly interesting wild and amazing story secondly the writing is superb it's depressing as hell but in the most beautifully done way","249":"my god it was depressing very well written certainly different but not at all a happy talen","250":"pete snow moved from missoula montana to the small town of tenmile to escape his past employed as a social worker in the basement of the courthouse pete tries to help others when he couldn't even help his own family he lives anonymously and in obscurity which is how he wants it all that changes one day when benjamin pearl shows up on the local school playground he has been living in the wild and has a multitude of diseases pete takes the boy home and meets his father jeremiah who lives up in the mountains and is very disturbed although jeremiah initially threatens pete he eventually finds a common ground with him but the events start to spiral out of control and the dea and fbi become involved in the midst of being in the crosshairs of two federal agencies pete's own family starts to spiral out of control as well can anything end well this book has had a ridiculous amount of publicity hype for a first time author so i thought why not give it a try maybe it really will be the next best american novel what did i get for buying into publicity a book that was anything but what was publicized smith henderson's writing style is very disjointed and sporadic many parts of the book do not flow well at all nor does it contribute to the plot of the book there is a mixture of speaking with quotations as well as without quotations that occurs throughout the book without regard to anything specific this occurs between multiple parties and gets very confusing the segments throughout the book concerning rachel rose snow are also extremely vague and disjointed it is very difficult to ever attain what is going on through her life for the majority of the book also it appears that mr henderson kept a thesaurus on hand as i'm pretty sure he used every available adjective in the thesaurus for multiple words but perhaps he just has a superlative grasp of grammar the book is also filled with profanity which begins on page 2 on an interview with the author he talks about how the characters are based on people that he actually met that where in worse situations than he wrote about that being said i understand that people do use this language in several occurrences however not only is profanity used in the structure for most of the characters but also occurs throughout personal thoughts of the main character and rachel rose snow additionally there were several disturbing sex scenes that had no bearing on either the plot or any portion of the story for that matter they only seemed to be included to shock the reader which was successful overall nothing tasteful occurred in the content of this book on a positive note the character development was astounding the author definitely has a gift on creating descriptions of his characters that are both vivid and specific the first time that we meet jeremiah pearl we automatically can picture exactly what he looks like even though it is night during the scene overall i would say that mr henderson is striving to become the next john steinbeck it is almost as though he read cannery row and then picked up travels with charley and decided to write a piece on a section of america as how he sees it undoubtedly there will be many out there who probably enjoy this book but i did not and cannot recommend it the story has very good potential but the way it was delivered will be offensive to many","251":"bleak last third was much stronger than earlier parts","252":"an absolutely essential read here's the thing listen to it macleod andrews' voice is perfectly married to pete's viewpoint and the interludes with his daughter rose rachel are also wonderfully portrayed by jenna lamia even if you've read it once in book form go for it again in audiobook form if only so you can hear andrews' snarl as jeremiah pearl","253":"i'm not sure what to make of this book totally unrealistic portrayal of social work boundaries too long still a compelling story disturbing","254":"very different story from anything i have read b4 page turner enjoyed it","255":" who would imagine a social worker would be confronted with shady side of human existence to this extent the first part of this book is such a downer that you will be tempted to quit reading don't do it it's one of the best novels i've read all year pete snow is a social worker plying his craft near the montana wilderness in one of the first scenes he's called to a local school to deal with a boy loitering the halls who seems to have come in out of the wild he's disheveled and doesn't smell all that good this boy is benjamin pearl son of jeremiah pearl a survivalist living in the hills pete takes ben back to his father and the two soon develop a rather live and let live relationship pete sees ben as a client and occasionally leaves food and clothes where the boy might find them jeremiah believes we're in the end times and that government script isn't worth the paper it's printed on pete is also having problems in his personal relationships his wife has cheated on him and he moves out she moves to texas taking their daughter rachel who wants to be known as rose with them rachel soon runs away and pete spends the rest of the novel trying to track her down pete's brother luke has also run afoul of the law and has jumped his parole his parole officer thinks pete knows where he is smith henderson has a unique style especially during the rachel viewpoints he asks questions then narrates rachel's answers this is a technique that lots of writers use asking their characters questions to get to know them but i've never seen one put them in the book in this fashion it sounds rather like the reader asking the author what's happening with rachel rachel has two boyfriends during her escapade the second one is a street kid named pomeroy who dyes his hair black we get a good look at street life and what kids think they have to do to survive fourth of july creek is a unique perspective on american life i mean when the social worker gets drunk gets in fights and is accused of harboring a criminal who can you trust not that pete doesn't have a good heart he truly loves his daughter and he shows jeremiah pearl more understanding than he probably deserves","256":"pete a montana social worker with lots of issues of his own drinking problem separation from wife and daughter tackles those of his clients in his child and protective services job story centers around jeremiah pearl a fundamentalist survivalist and his almost feral son and cecil another client who must be separated from his drug addicted mother well developed characters well written gripping","257":" raw gut wrenching and heartbreaking midwest america outside the city limits exists poverty homelessness addiction crime and abuse much less resources to help those in need pete snow is a social worker living day to day attempting to protect and remove children from abusive homes he is an alcoholic unable to deal with the stress in his job as well as within his own life trying instead to make it better for others at the cost of losing touch with his own daughter who becomes a runaway and starts living the life of these children he is trying to protect henderson creates a character and story we can unfortunately relate to 5 stars","258":"an absolutely beautiful and heart wrenching book i believe this will become a classic american novel","259":"very well written but the level of dysfunction contained within each of these incredibly well developed characters made it impossible for me to love this novel if smith henderson can produce a novel at this level the first time out of the gate i cannot imagine what is yet to come he is indeed a talented author","260":" a story about pete a social worker who wants to save everyone except himself and his own family lots of bad things happen and the majority of characters are pretty screwed up in one way or another pete comes into conflict with jeremiah pearl a bible literalist and doomsday prepper convinced that the end is literally nigh jeremiah is probably the most interesting character in the book and many of his crazy beliefs echo conspiracy theorists one comes across online his mentions of fiat currency always made me laugh if you love bitcoin you'll love jeremiah pearl it's not a badly written book but the thing is it's not an amazingly well written one either it's hard to nail down my feelings about it exactly as they're not that strong one way or another i wasn't won over by the writing or the story but nor was i loath to keep reading throughout my strongest feeling was it seems like this should affect me more i'm sure the story is written to almost expects me to be feeling empathy with these characters but i just can't care that much i think this was due to the writing style or perhaps i am the wrong reader maybe this could be a deeply moving book for the right person someone who comes from a broken family or knows what it's like to struggle to hold it together","261":"smith henderson please write more novels hollywood please make a movie out of this book","262":" social workers deal with ugly situations that most of us don't even want to think about so it's no surprise that this novel digs up an enormous pile of misery no surprise either that like cops they'd take to alcohol to dull their senses in the face of an endless onslaught of grim cases of human suffering that can't be mended outside of trying to tweak out solutions of temporary relief for the victims hell i'd be drinking and popping prozac if i were in their shoes so yes i more or less expected this to be a bleak downer and it is after reading do many rave reviews i was also led to expect an exceptionally stunning novel and it isn't at least not for me the storyline is not bad and there's a fair amount of slow building tension that percolates throughout but some of the prose just poked me to the point of teeth grinding irritation for example it would be dusk the lock would click open she would come into the bedroom with a cup of wine disrobe slide into bed and thy would begin to harvest orgasms but there are also some very poignant parts particularly those invoking the tentative survival techniques of runaways in which pete the social worker doesn't figure so maybe the main problem for me was all the focus on pete or rather pete's focus on himself the anti hero with the prerequisite flaws and as many problems as his troubled clients this is basically his story it's all about pete and he's not really a very interesting guy","263":"oh man this was a doozy but in a good way reminded me a lot of a constellation of vital phenomena with vivid settings montana chechnya a fair amount of the action taking place in the wilderness people in severely compromised situations concerned with taking care of children and obsessive searches for missing people the big difference was the writing style constellation was more florid while the style here was stripped down with lots of short sentences that build up into a nice rhythm interspersed at the ends of most chapters are these question answer sections that deal with a storyline involving the main character's daughter which also provide a good rhythm on a larger scale","264":"can't say i enjoyed this book it is so dark and disturbing but was well written not sorry i read it but wouldn't recommend it","265":"far to much graphic sex for my liking but nonetheless a great read at least 3 plots interwoven and all tense and harrowing flawed characters all contributing to their own misery as they flee from hurts inflicted by others there is also much tender and 'human' to this story with a sense of hope always in the background","266":"stunningly beautiful heartbreakingly sad but ultimately optimistic despite one of the main threads of the story not being explicitly resolved","267":"kind of a mess while the main character tries to be as moral and as identifiable as possible the narrative arc is all over the place","268":"i don't care how many rave reviews it received i cannot tolerate one more page from the publisher's description i expected a story about a social worker getting entangled with a survivalist and his fight against the government--a fictitious ruby ridge situation not my usual read but it could be interesting i suppose that all kicks off in the second half but the first half is mostly about abused and neglected children it's relentlessly depressing and the writing is not compelling enough to push me through it","269":"first half of the book i sort of wyomed through characters take a while to get into or maybe its the writing but i did end up really enjoying the book and reading the last 100 or so pages in one sitting enjoyed the main character pete who tries to do the right thing by the various people set in his path also like the flip story of his daughter being asked questions thought it was going to reveal some sort of police interview but i guess was meant to be a more diary styled viewpoint might have missed something there anyway i give it 3 5","270":"an interesting story but you won't find any happiness here every character has problems not small problems but major problems just made me really sad","271":"the writing the characters the pathos damn that was a good book","272":"i never write reviews but can't help myself here unbelievable that it's his first novel this guy is terrifically skilled good story that resonates featuring a heroic but humble and believable character i highly recommend this book rated r","273":"if i could give this book more than 5 stars i would it is beautifully written with language that transports the reader to a world unknown to most of us the characters are so complex they linger with you long after you stop reading i loved their foibles and their strengths and the fact that each one could easily have become a stereotype but never did in the sordid world where pete a social worker with the department of family services exists life is generally pretty ugly and yet pete is somehow a cynical optimist hoping for the good in spite of all the times he is confronted with disappointment in daily life i appreciated the intricate vocabulary and the style of writing and believe that fourth of july creek is a literary masterpiece","274":"a bruising muscular masterpiece never read anything quite like it a lot of it is deeply disturbing and there is a weird surreal quality to some of the scenes that will continue to haunt me for years if you can cope with graphic and upsetting descriptions of child abuse and neglect visceral violence and gruesome descriptions of injuries involving eyes you must read this book date read 12 october 2015 published by penguin random house through windmill books","275":"a gorgeous book with great writing characters and plot","276":"way too many tragic storylines for me tokeep straight","277":"what an amazing great novel this book made me cringe and feel bad for humanity this is a superb example of fiction and everyone should read this it is brutal and eye opening and makes a person look at their own life and see things really aren't so terrible the prose is astounding and the use of vocabulary and phrasing is eloquent and almost poetic must read can't say enough about this book","278":"i think i held my breath the last 100 pages and still sooo many open questions but we can't go through life expecting","279":"utilizes some cool techniques and styles that keep it flowing and going but unique as the work is it's still a mystery a pa it's hard to give a book like fourth of july creek the due it deserves a month has passed since i finished it and it's still oiling the gears in my head it's easy to call creek a mammoth tome which at 431 pages it kinda is but it's actually three or four novels braided into one with plots that run concurrent intersect and underscore each other smith henderson  utilizes some cool techniques and styles that keep it flowing and going but unique as the work is it's still a mystery a page turner it has all those special qualities that make a classic great i won't divulge any of the storyline there's already 150 five star reviews on amazon that'll tantalize you with more details and my review will add one more i just wanted you to know this is a special book well worth the risk of purchase and the time do yourself a favor","280":" at first i thought this was just another one of those critically acclaimed books that i just could not understand the appeal to and then the book caught me in it's web and i could not put it down the novel has three main threads the main story is pete stone who is a social worker in the 70's for the state of montana there is no distance he won't go for his clients but the irony is while he is out saving other people's kids his own child is a mess as he tells his ex wife we are the people that i take children away from the sad state of pete's family life is due to his ex cheating on him and taking off with their daughter the other two threads of the story relate to pete's clients cecile has been asked to leave the home by his mother if she can be called that and benjamin pearl shows up in town one day exhibiting the signs of malnutrition the mystery of the pearl family was the most compelling part of the book for me pete knows that there are other members of the family besides benjamin and his father but where they are is a mystery until the end this novel kept me turning the pages right up until the heartbreaking end normally this isn't my type of book but this time the reviews were right i highly enjoyed this haunting story that stayed with me long after i finished the last page","281":"depressing heartbreaking at least once a chapter there's a multi syllable word that requires context or a dictionary","282":"somewhat difficult read because of the self destructive behavior of virtually all the main characters still different and interesting sort of happy ending","283":"listened to the audiobook","284":"excellent debut novel about a social worker who's life is a bigger mess than any of his clients brilliantly written highly recommend","285":"admittedly i do not finish the book leaving the last 100 pages to be read before it was due back to the library however i had a hard time believing in and connecting with the main character or the situations in the book","286":"descriptive imaginationdon't really remember why i chose to read this book but i have no regrets whatsoever enjoyed the descriptiveness used by smith henderson","287":"i had a really hard time getting into this book i wanted badly to like it and it slowly started to grow on me but i can't honestly put it anywhere near one of the best books of 2014 the hardest part for me was the choppiness of the question answer interview part i felt like it wasn't very effective in the grand scheme of the book take that part out and the reading flows better","288":"slow start could have been written in half the pages considered abandoning it part way through but hung in there glad i did but still left with a lot of questions","289":" wow this is one of those books that grab hold of you and don't let you go i was quite taken by the blurb a social worker in montana who gets involved with a father and son who live in the backwoods but has to deal with his own family problems but the story became so much more than this set at the beginning of the reagan administration these small town families live a pretty isolated existence with an almost inborn mistrust of authority and government officials as represented by pete snow in the story pete works a vast area with little support and since splitting from his wife who has kept their daughter with her begins to find it difficult to keep the personal and professional separate one official case and one incidental one take up most of pete's time but when his wife ups and leaves for texas taking his daughter rachel with her pete sees his own family begin to fall even further apart and outside of his control meeting jeremiah pearl and his son ben who live a migratory existence cut off from society and convinced that the world is soon to end pete finds himself on a mission to save these two individuals shotguns and violence threats and conspiracy theories are the keys to pearl's existence and pete is soon drawn into this confusing and dangerous world there is a real sense of time and place in this novel the language is occasionally obscure maybe even created and the pace of the novel does not invite stopping for a dictionary break but this aside it is a powerful and gripping read highly recommended","290":"i wish there was a 3 5 star rating just feel that 4 is a tad too much but 3 is just too average there is a lot to like about this first novel but for some reason i felt a disconnect between the story and its setting in 1980 81 seems like the story should have taken place a few years earlier at the low point of the 70's i don't know silly thought maybe but that's what i kept thinking do characters need to develop for a novel to succeed","291":"an awesome book about the complexities of flawed people there is good in all of us some things we mess up some things we get right most things fall somewhere in the middle super quick read little bit of politics little bit of religion little bit of social work whole lot of page turnin' good one","292":"complex disturbing brilliantly written first novel","293":" after reading this book i was left with questions and the main was one was what was the point i know i am the odd man out here but i just did not enjoy this book with the very sad derelict and depressing characters i just could not connect or want to connect to these characters pete a social worker in a small rural town has lots of compassion but it's not enough even the hero pete was so flawed that i didn't find him endearing but misplaced i wish he at least he had more insight and fortitudeto act more assertively since he is a social worker i dont' know i just thought some of the situations he came into contact with he could have done more or gotten someone else involved to remedy that situation it was like he put a bandaid on everything and that was never good enough then again annything he did was mostly helpful becasue these people were utterly disfunctional most of the writing was absorbing but some parts important parts were incohesive the ending was just blah and really a let down i thought there would be more closure","294":"social worker in rural montana becomes involved in many disturbing family situations one of which explodes at the same time his own family is crumbling","295":"the best book i've read in a long time","296":"i wanted to like this book and it sure did keep me wondering where it was going it is well written with flawed characters but for me the ending was very frustrating","297":" more 3 1 2 than 3 the setting is rural montana in 1980 where the poverty as well as the people are scarred from life where there are \"attack dogs violent drunks elk poachers pawnbrokers hawking nazi flags anarchists thieves and backwoods pot growers \" think \"winter's bone \" from the very start of the book we know we are headed for tragedy a male 31 year old social worker who is an alcoholic estranged from his father not such a nice man as well as his wife a party girl and his teenage daughter who ran away and he is desperately trying to find her the book which won awards would have received 4 stars from me expect it wasn't till the end of the book focusing more on a fundamentalist recluse mountain man and his 11 year old boy that i found myself really drawn into the story","298":" at the surface it would not appear that a novel with a social worker as it's central character would be so appealling but i can assure you it is the start of the novel concerns itself with two cases involving children that dominate pete snow's life added to that is his own daughter is missing the real strength if the book is its unpredictability i read this while cycling through montana and indeed passing many of the creeks and towns that feature though on the surface local montana people may not be happy about their wilderness being tainted with child abuse and social problems the novel twists cleverly away from this it is an excellent read and a very different sort of novel","299":"great book and story the interweaving characters brought a twisting story together that kept me interested and intrigued","300":" judging by the blurbs and reviews on the book itself this is a highly regarded novel judgments about art are always subjective so take my review with a grain of salt i think some would claim that fourth of july creek is a gritty realistic novel it's definitely gritty i felt weighed down by the characters drunks abusive parents and people who are generally self destructive or destructive to others i can handle a story that has tragedy even darkness but i like at least one character who is worthy who gives me reason to hope i confess that i didn't finish the book but i got close to half way through just too bleak for me","301":"absolutely loved it the prose was wonderful every word in its proper place and the narrator was brilliant","302":"social worker ptsd this is the story well written great character development it is a disturbing story and i learned several things i'ld rather not know but it was a page turner i listened to a pbs interview of the author and decided i wanted to read this award winning novel i understand there will be a series developed based on the book i will watch","303":" i made the decision to grab this book from my local library after i had seen its appearance on just about every best of 2014 lists i had scoured looking for new recommendations i was a bit slow in the beginning with reading this the holidays were busy and left me with no time i would pick it up read a few pages and put it back down i was beginning to think i was going to abandon this book i picked it up and vowed i would give it a shot once i allowed myself the time to engage i devoured this book set in the 1980's in rural montana the reader is introduced to pete snow is a social worker with the department of family services pete spends his life trying to save children from the dismal lives they are forced to live in however the life he lives rivals those he is attempting to save pete is an alcoholic with generally self destructive behavior pete chooses to abandon his wife and daughter in order to better the lives of children in his caseload who live dysfunctional lives while ignoring the dysfunctional family has left behind this book is beautifully written and it is hard to believe that this is henderson's debut however be warned despite the effortless way that henderson weaves the story the story is bleak and sad it is dark makes you feel dirty and i mean that as a compliment","304":"wow i couldn't put this book down","305":"it goes on and on and on and by the end i wondered what the point was of a lot of the scenes especially all the drama with pete's girlfriend the chaos of his personal life contrasted with how sensitive and caring he was toward the people he encountered on his job was interesting and the whole storyline with his daughter was just heartbreaking","306":"well written if a bit cliched at points the narrative momentum seriously flags but overall a good read","307":"this is somebody's first novel also the blurb is so misleading","308":"wow one of the best first novels i've read in years the extensive research and deliberate time taken to craft this story really shows and only in the best ways stark brutal unflinching unique desolate gripping and quietly powerful easily one of the best i've read in the past year","309":"brilliant completely and utterly brilliant this is one of the most powerful books i have read in a long time henderson's muscular prose that's the only way i can think to describe it grabs hold of you from the start and doesn't let go of you until this roller coaster of a ride is finished","310":"this book was well written unique and engaging but it's not going to cheer you up i don't remember how it ended up on my list goodreads suggestion nyt list social workers see very difficult sad situations 3 5 is more likely from me","311":"beautifully written but i just wasn't in the frame of mind for so much sadness and depravity","312":" i think for a seriously fucked up case this book is a modern day fairy tale not in a love story kind of way but because the hero actually was able to save the day i was expecting the usual ending for cases like these a hopeless one an it is how it is ending or an i can't do anything to change things ending had this book ended the way i thought it would i would've given it 4 stars the author's ending pretty much changed my mind err mostly because it made me cry although it's disturbing and very sad the ending made me feel hopeful that there are still people out there who are trying to make a difference in the small ways they do and it's not just because it's their job or so they can say on facebook or twitter to look at me i'm helping people i guess what i'm trying to say is here's a seriously messed up guy who turns to alcohol and drugs when he's really down whose friends are a bunch of happy go lucky guys who had to hit rock bottom to be able to forgive his brother and who can't even help his own family but he went out of his way to help cecil katie and the pearls also the family in the end there's your modern day super hero right and yes i think i might be a little bit in love with pete snow heh for the most part it seemed like this book mocks religion and their avid followers but then it also shows how religion can bring solace to those who needs it actually i think the book has a passive aggressive relationship with religion and the government it builds up a person a law enforcer for example as someone who has a bad character someone who's going through all the lengths to do his job even if he ends up harassing other people and then suddenly he's all omg this happened i didn't know poor pearl if you're anal about it there are a few more things that don't add up like how much does a social worker in a small district earn how can he afford to fly or drive around the country looking for his own daughter with his salary especially since he apparently doesn't want to receive anything from his rich deceased rancher dad also please note that i'm not from the us so i don't know how these things work exactly but this guy broke a bunch of rules big ish ones to be able to help cecil and the pearls is it possible for social workers to do that does no one check on their work and how they do it or is it just because he has connections with the judge then again would you really focus on things like those when there are more pressing issues that should be addressed","313":"so much of this book is so good the writing is great for example wyoming as a verb the characters are so flawed and sometimes i didn't much like them but i was still caught up in their stories","314":" there's a lot happening in this novel that is worthy of praise there's a distinct prose style interesting rhetorical devices and a unique plot that has several interwoven threads of tension to top it off it's set in a place and among a people that don't get much attention in much of contemporary literature however there were several characteristics of this novel that made me less enthusiastic about it than i might have been for starters the anti hero protagonist like most good anti heroes is difficult to comprehend and or sympathize with at certain points in the story he's an alcoholic and lapsing distant father and even as a social worker he has a string of terrible performances he does want to do the right thing or so he tells himself and so we see happen on occasion but it's almost not enough to make up for his failures secondly one of the threads of tension in the story the protagonist's love interest seemed ultimately unnecessary when it reached its conclusion and i wonder why it was present even more troubling is the way it plays out for the reader there almost seems like subtle judgment placed on the female for activity that is the same as the male protagonist's we forgive him but don't forgive her for the exact same behavior third while the prose and rhetorical devices narrator as social worker interviewing the protagonist's daughter are admirable the prose does still borrow a bit too heavily from cormac mccarthy for my taste it's such a distinct style that it's hard to use some of its elements without sounding too similar and unfortunately that's what seems to have happened here still all in all a solid read if you're a fan of dennis lehane or daniel woodrell you'd be happy to give this a go","315":"how is this book getting so many rave reviews it baffles me i feel like i'm taking crazy pills because the fourth of july creek that i read was simply not good spoilers ahead by the way the frustrating thing is that there is a good story here unfortunately though it got drowned in a bunch of nonsense first of all the only plot that i found compelling was the one that revolved around jeremiah pearl his son and their preparations for the end the stuff with rachel and cecil felt like little more than a distraction and then there were just so many extraneous details the book started out fairly well and then farted around for about eighty pages the story itself didn't really get going until about 200 pages in so that was frustrating i have a compulsion about finishing books i start otherwise i would have just quit around the 150 page mark everyone is praising henderson's writing maybe i'm just an unsophisticated literary plebe but i found his style incredibly obnoxious and his prose was so purple it about gave me a headache henderson clearly has talent but he just went way over the top to the point that it felt embarrassingly self indulgent here are a few little gems he swooned like a drunken woodland god shapes of steam from the hot pools sifted lazily through the wet pines like robed ghosts of a sudatorium they would begin to harvest orgasms unseen cracks in the load bearing trestles of his mind they birthed themselves again and again through the wet and heated throng under a transom of falling stars the sky streaked in a kind of agony white grooves his eyes can't brake their casters snow falls in white floc like the ashy precipitate of a yonder fire and finally this goofy little fragment the heart's living tropism the book is chock full of this kind of nonsense and he seemed like he was trying so very hard to sound fancy and cowboy poetic his descriptions were like winced hugely chewed enormously he volunteers that he needs to pee invited a fusillade of french fries the cold evicted his breath his words sluiced out a restless logorrhea chemic colors diskiltered jaw the language became distracting instead of reading for the plot i found myself instead propelled by curiosity about what overwrought turn of phrase he'd pull out of his ass next between that and the excessive artistic sentence fragments and run ons i was rolling my eyes so hard i got a little dizzy or as henderson would perhaps have phrased it my ocular revolutions were so vigorous that i was struck with a peculiar fleeting sense of disequilibrium i wonder if maybe henderson has read one too many cormac mccarthy novels am i being too mean in this review i am aren't i but i'm sorry some of it was simply laughable like the big denouement moment pearl is snow is himself is everyone wow jeez what an epiphany do you get it because it's like the human condition so we are all them and they are all us so deep man so deep and actually you know what i don't feel bad about being hypercritical because this book has all the hallmarks of a pretentious over hyped under edited male author trying to be poignant and genius and dark there's a missing girl molestation pointless scenes of drug induced hazes and random bitter sex scenes between people who don't like each other and i gotta say i'm really fucking sick of usually male authors using molested raped vulnerable sexualized young girls to make their story gritty and real it's overdone it's unoriginal it's lazy so that really pissed me off too i think with some serious editing fourth of july creek could have been a great book as it is though i found it terribly disappointing and obnoxiously overwritten it tried so hard and accomplished so little it reads like something that guy in your mfa would have written i don't understand all the literary wanking over it and i got nothing out of it but maybe that's just me","316":"i have a really hard time stopping a book tossing it aside for another once i begin especially as a reviewer i hate this because i'm sure i could get things done a lot faster if i was a little picker about my reading but i don't know it's like i'm thinking a bad book could have a good aftertaste like a shitty wine or some passage that just turned the table and made it all better even though 9 times out of 10 that doesn't happen why i'm saying this right now i can't even tell you how many times i wanted to put down smith henderson's fourth of july creek and it's not at all because it was bad or wasn't well written or any of the other reasons i usually throw books away basically the reason i wanted to stop reading this book was that it's just so intense but i couldn't throw it away along with being so intense the whole thing was so real that it would be like hanging up mid phone call with a crying friend - just because it's hard for you doesn't mean you can just bail otherwise you're just a weak hearted asshole did i simply finish this book not to be a weak hearted asshole maybe but also i had to see if things could possibly end well i had to know what the hell was going to happen to the story it's really set up with two main protagonists although one gets significantly more pages department of family services agent pete snow and his 13 year old ish daughter rachel who would rather go by rose you know those people that are like \"it's so funny that my job is x because i simply suck at a character trait related to x in real life \" for instance an accountant with massive credit card debt or a marriage counselor who is divorced or so on... you can probably get where i'm going with this pete snow is a department of family service agent who is divorced with a daughter who has run away from her mother's home whose family is by all purposes fucked up that's not to say he's bad at his job he's kind and generous to the children under his watch in the montana wilderness including a young man so messed up by his mother's touches that he doesn't know right from wrong anymore and another boy on the edge of manhood that's mysterious wandered onto a schoolyard without proper shoes or clothes and bitten a teacher it's this second boy that pete watches more closely following him home and finding his gun wielding nearly mad father a man named jeremiah pearl it's this jeremiah pearl character that really steals the show he's a great part of the reason i couldn't just stop this book a novel that intricately describes the way this man's son peels the skin off his calloused foot pearl's got some crazy religious ideas about christ coming back and the dollar losing its value and the only thing worth anything after that being actual gold and copper but not the shitty stuff they're making coins with these days he's also got the fbi watching his ass after getting his coins mixed up with some sketchy organizations that have gotten themselves under suspension after president reagan is shot it seems jeremiah pearl's got everyone intrigued alternatively there's rachel rose pete's daughter who's moved to texas with her mother and the woman's scum of a boyfriend in the very family that the dfs agent used to belong to the teenage girl's getting weird looks from her mother's boyfriend sneaking out and making college aged boyfriends soon she's had enough of this household and her mother and just runs away doing whatever she can to make it along the way i mean nothing so far is probably telling you just how raw and gross and painful this whole book is just the same nothing i've told you has prepared you for the way this novel will suck you in try to solve the story in your own mind it's not a book i'd ever recommend to a friend as a beach read or something for the plane or vacation because i'd never want to read something so stressful under those circumstances but if you're looking for a gripping intense family drama fourth of july creek is it","317":" this book and its characters are so messed up there are some truly despicable characters with some truly despicable lifestyles but the writing and story were so compelling that i didn't want to put it down most readers won't have trouble finding somebody to hate in this story and overall it is bleak and devoid of happiness but well worth a read in my opinion by the end my feelings were so conflicted the only criticism i have is that the interview type chapters with the daughter were confusing and uninteresting the first few times it wasn't until later on that i really got into them and appreciated that perspective the ending will surely disappoint those looking for a tidy conclusion to this hot mess of a great book highly recommended unless you're easily offended","318":" okay i didn't want to like this i read through half of it and seriously considered putting it away and not finishing it ever maybe burying it with other half read novels that i'll read one day after i finished making a stain glass mural and teaching myself the difference between affect and effect which is to say never but i did i made myself a hot bath and resolved to sit there until i finished this novel even if i became so pruney my husband could turn me into a mediocre wine i would finish the book so here is my consensus the ending is horrible it just is the epilogue makes it a teeny tiny microscopic bit better i felt sick about the pearls i felt sick about rachel rose i felt sick about benjamin and katie i felt a little less sick over pete dude's a jerk and yet i liked it the damn book is like an obnoxious listeria carrying little homeless man in your neighborhood that you don't want to like but somehow he weasels his little paranoia ridden self into your heart i don't want to recommend it but i do","319":"wow i so don't understand the overwhelming praise for this book it reads like third rate denis johnson or at its absolute pretentious worst a cormac mccarthy knockoff this is basically the quintessential straight white guy mfa masturbatory novel it works so hard to announce its importance which means it isn't really doing anything important or interesting at all","320":" i put this book on hold as one of the best authors under 35 suggestions the book is also set in montana so of course i was intrigued the book follows the mid life crisis of a state social worker pete snow who is stuck in the middle of nowhere an alcoholic and deeply upset about his wife cheating on him he meets and tries to help a boy benjamin pearl who is living in the mountains with his scary fundamentalist conspiracy theorist father snow tries to put the pieces of pearls' family story together while trying to figure out what to do with his own life his wife moves to texas his daughter goes missing etc there was a lot of drama in the book but some chapters were very slow it was an interesting read but not something i'd ever go back to and read again","321":"dark with just a hint of optimism very very well written","322":"it was set in montana where i live about a dfs worker and how he tries to help other children and their families while his life is in need of help i recommend this book","323":"i was quite excited to read this book following all of the positive reviews however i found it really difficult to get into and quite disjointed to begin with if you like to stick with a book i would say this is worth the perseverance and for me it really picked up from about 60% if only it had had that draw from the beginning","324":"fourth of july creek is an unusual book it is violent and complicated and very difficult to put down none of the characters have their acts together all of them are deeply flawed in many ways the town reminded me a lot of some of the mountain backwaters i've visited the cul de sac in the woods where people go or drift or end up people without ambitions people about futures","325":"3 5 read this really quick and enjoyed it not something i was intrigued by but time well spent the ending was a bit disappointing","326":"i did not like this book yes it was well written but i had to force myself to read it it was a book club read otherwise i would have closed it and never finished it why read about this stuff in a novel just pick up a newspaper and read the same stories depressing","327":"a great debut novel with a decent realist ending","328":"unexpected amazing read very gritty look at very dysfunctional people in 1980's in montana author kept me hooked as horrible as the situations got i still found myself caring and rooting for these characters could not put this book down","329":"i liked this book though it got really depressing at times didn't love the ending i'd give it 3 1 2 stars","330":"if kent haruf's plainsong is an austen version of the small town rural west fourth of july creek is the bronte version wonderful language and characters more at aboutbigbooks tumblr com","331":"a friend from book club asked me to read this to see if it might be a good book for our group to read and discuss i started it and thought oh no another book about unhappy screwed up people i probably would have stopped reading it but felt i obligated to finish it after letting it sit a week or so i picked back up and it was better i'm glad i finished it but wouldn't really recommend it to anyone it reminded me of all the bad experiences i had as a casa","332":"fourth of july creek by smith henderson is an astonishing debut novel and a one that i will carry with me for quite some time henderson takes the reader back to the beginning of the reagan area and into rural montana where pete snow a social worker is trying to help almost feral eleven year old benjamin pearl until he comes up against benjamin's survivalist father jeremiah soon the f b i are involved in a manhunt for pearl and pete finds himself in the center of it all while his own life is falling apart fourth of july creek with make readers think about iconic america in all its complexities and contradictions along with the ideas and views of violence anarchy freedom and the value of community fourth of july creek is a book that is not to be missed","333":" this one took a while to read but it was worth the effort it's montana in the early 80's deep in montana people who don't like the government people who live off the land people who rebound from violence the main character is an alcoholic social worker during the book his own estranged young teen daughter goes missing his work rescuing maltreated youth at home makes a contrast to his own helplessness with finding and saving his own daughter it's very humbling to read about his dedication to the vulnerable ones in society and he's so human with his own challenges","334":"i'll admit it i'm partial to books about social workers","335":"this book was pretty great definitely in my top 5 books of 2014 i have read a lot of good books this year with minimalist prose such as brian allen carr's last horror novel and katherine faw morris' young god this book is the opposite in that there is very rich and thorough character development the story remains interesting and you develop feelings for the main characters i will definitely be reading future smith henderson books","336":" what did i just read the lonesome star is a nod to henderson's skill as a writer the man can write more mature authors wish they had half of henderson's knack for finding le mot juste even so i was reminded of why i gave up on lolita not that henderson is quite up to nabokov's caliber yet but for me beautiful prose cannot pardon horrific nauseating subject matter the back cover of the book will tell you that the plot centers around pete snow and a religious conspiracy nut there is no plot this a parade of all the ways society is failing children it is a parade of all the sexual abuses that adults inflict upon children sheer neglect rape incest prostitution no one is innocent and everyone is guilty parents social workers foster parents aunts uncles group homes other children... there's even a scene with a dog the darkness is unrelenting although this book is set in the 1980s i found myself hoping for an apocalypse of fire just so the abuse would end i don't know why i finished it i know that it is going straight to the recycling bin","337":"his daddy was a mean sonofabitch but now he was dead he himself was a sad sack drunk women didn't understand this was because they were all whores sometimes tragically so but whores nonetheless little girls were innocent but they too would grow up to be whores he found a boy who represented his lost idealism he failed the boy and in doing so failed himself time is a flat circle","338":" a rather harsh and hard read detailing the turbulent life of pete the social worker as well as that of his clients while pete is trying to rescue feral children his own daughter has run away and his brother is dodging the cops and he doesn't speak to his father this could present an interesting dichotomy but it was not handled at all the stories that unfold are largely uninteresting and one thread that of the daughter was bizarrely written in third person q and a form which was just irritating or they would be but they were not executed well at all mostly i did not like pete or anyone else and felt that while the writing was strong the story stories was not","339":"grungy story about characters i had little desire to know yet now i do and thought i'd leave unread but the writing the beautifully crafted sentences the insight and the story line propelled me to the finish with appreciation for humanity in spite of painful defects certainly this book deserves all stars for skill","340":"it was difficult to finish reading this book i kept going back to it in fits and starts amid finishing other books and i mostly continued only because i hoped the ending was worth it it wasn't and it was how come whenever a blurb raves about a book being american the characters are all alcoholics or country bumpkins and weapons feature prominently in the story that's the problem with this book not much story but plenty of problems i liked pete snow but i also didn't like him everyone is an alcoholic or a skank or a druggie or suicidal or murderous or a would be terrorist or something i understand that's the main theme of the 'story' but it was hard to feel anything but despair and latent hostility for the main characters who were so hopeless and far removed from their own lives how can i get behind these characters how can i care about them or maybe i'm not supposed to maybe that's the point if i wanted to ponder the state of humanity i'd just turn on the news and wait for the world to end by our own hand is that bleak enough for this review","341":" i was drawn to this story for three reasons it is a first novel the author was the recipient of the 2011 pen emerging writers award and the plot sounded different than most novels i read while i did finish it i can't think of anyone i would recommend it to it started off sad got worse throughout with no resolution at the end the main character pete snow lives a life of hypocrisy he is a social worker who spends his days attempting to protect and remove children from abusive homes while having no control over the life of his own daughter who becomes a runaway and starts living the life of the children he tries to protect he is also an alcoholic unable to deal with the stress in his job as well as in his personal life there is sadness throughout the writing cycles between raw foul language gut wrenching abuse and heartbreaking outcomes there are several story lines going on at the same time and they all have to do with poverty homelessness addiction crime and abuse supplemented with pete's personal and professional perspective that little care or resources are available to help those in need to close to real life for my reading pleasure laura","342":"i admit i gave up on this book i was listening to the audiobook and the reader was great however the story is just so unremittingly grim that i couldn't finish it","343":"smith henderson's debut \"fourth of july creek\" is downright exceptional the novel contains the delicious ease of a night of drinking and all the crags of a brutal hangover the story plays out on the fringes of society and magnifies the plights of the communities who are allowed to fester there it's a story of family of addictions survival and the blinding complications of love henderson fearlessly explores the overlooked social terrain of the rural poor writing with a fierce clear eyed empathy and a remarkable gift for description \"fourth of july creek\" is set in the backwoods of montana pete snow is a young social worker who we meet breaking up a fight between an addict mother and her teenage son the house is filthy and the complaints perennial it's a situation that's going from bad to worse and pete is sharply aware of the limits of his position his is a sisyphean task which he pursues with the conviction of a man who is trying to save himself soon after pete meets benjamin pearl a dirty feral looking boy who has wandered into town his father jeremiah greets pete's return of the child with a loaded shotgun and a refusal of the clothes and supplies he offers pete works to earn a modicum of trust from the duo and as he draws closer he stumbles on religious zealotry government subversion and the machinations of a highly disturbed mind it's 1980 and the world henderson describes is one that too rarely holds our attention a world of semi rural poverty alcoholism and desperation henderson crafts an expert plot around the anti government jeremiah pearl and his family but at its gut the novel is about the bare bones opportunities available to the have nots and the sucking swamp of alcoholism prostitution and drugs that expands infinitesimally waiting to surround you when you slip pete is heroic in his attempts to salvage innocence and patch together the pieces of the families he is sent to rescue this shining picture is in deep contrast to his personal life recently separated with a daughter of his own pete has so many demons that you wonder why he is battling everyone else's as pete becomes further embroiled in the life of jeremiah and his son we're shown how the world is developing for his daughter henderson captures the voice of a girl whose bravado far exceeds her circumstances and maturity she is introduced with a description of her near drowning in the arms of her alcoholic father and slowly breaks our hearts as she races toward the life that pete tried to keep at bay with both hands every one of henderson's characters is finely wrought from pete's violent brother to his entrancing damaged lover these pages are populated with people whose lives deserve attention henderson writes with the same strong concision of annie proulx and the dark contortions of daniel woodrell he uses language beautifully and i will forever equate the word \"chevron\" with the image of a flock of birds \"fourth of july creek\" is as arresting as it is poetic the paint has been stripped away and the bare grain reveals the beauty of the knots and the trenchant flaws henderson carves his characters from the rough and majestic woods of montana and their edges are unfinished and snag at your conscience his subject is raw and it is dirty but henderson probes its depths for grace and sometimes he finds it http bookingaround tumblr com","344":"i'm still not sure how i feel about this book i absolutely love the imagery of henderson's writing and i typically love books that are intense when it comes to life situations the kite runner prince of tides cutting for stone are my favorite i felt oddly detached from the characters and story which is strange considering montana is my favorite place on earth and college roommate lived in wyoming and i live in texas maybe i need more time to let this book marinate in my thoughts","345":"this novel is a bracing journey through the sometimes brutal but very human world as encountered by a very flawed social worker named pete who is divorced estranged from his teenage daughter with an ex con brother and often drunk himself while trying to piece together the shards of his own life pete also tries to put the lives back together of one boy battling his hopeless mother as well as that of another who mysteriously comes out of the woods of montana one day as the son of a backwoods survivalist type character both the storytelling and the language in this book are superb and i look forward to reading more from this author in the future","346":"this may be one of my favorite books of this year it's fantastic i still can't quite believe it's a debut novel i will say that this one took me awhile to get into and i think that was partly a result of getting connected to the narrative voice as well as the 'feel' of the overall story but once i connected wow i couldn't stop reading i wanted more and more and more well written really interesting and multi faceted characters realism at every turn the primary thing that pulled me in initially was the social work angle i'm always pulled into stories about social workers and the families they serve this may be one of the most realistic depictions of the challenges of being a child protective services worker that i've read in fiction this social worker isn't the usual do gooder we see in fiction this man is flawed and real and at times very dark as real people can be this story felt very realistic and true to life the characters felt the same this is a gritty book that doesn't flinch from the hard things in life in fact it pulls up close and really explores the darker side of things in life and i loved this book for that unflinching look it gives the reader i highly recommend this one but don't give up on it if you don 't immediately connect to the story or the characters give it time live in the world a bit and i bet you'll begin to connect it is so worth it i cannot wait to see what smith henderson has coming for us in the future if this book is any indication of his talent","347":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it was a selection on the new york times top 100 books of 2014 what caught my eye other than the overly flamboyant reviewer's personal style was the comparison or influence of the author to kerouac and cormac mccarthy the latter an author i have great respect for in any normal context i would never have chosen this book for the subject matter alone on spec it sounded depressing as all hell loser social worker in some podunk montana town dealing with hicks rednecks and other losers making sure to crank out and turn their offspring into a new generation of f'd up losers ack but i loved it mr henderson vividly brought characters to life and made me give a s t about them even the seemingly paint by numbers losers revealed levels of real humanity i had to sympathize with and the interspersed narrative surrounding the daughter both frustrated and amazed me i had no idea and still don't who was asking the questions and who was answering it was an inspired vehicle to employ to tell that particular story i didn't find out until finishing the book and reading the author's bio that he's from portland oregon and works at wieden kennedy close to home yeah i dig their offices the 'nest' wow that's just a trippy space man looking forward to future stories smith henderson might have to tell","348":"it took a while to get used the the writing style but it really helps to pull you into the entirely messed up universe of characters none of these characters deserve any sympathy on the surface but henderson drew me into their lives and i found myself deeply caring about them it's not a small book but i consumed it quite quickly picking it up at every possible moment","349":"all i can say upon completion of this book is who are these people i must be hopelessly out of touch with an entire subculture and i find little there that inspires me for me to enjoy a novel i need to be able either to identify with or like at least one character no such connection here for me i was disappointed as the washington post identified this book as one of the five best audiobooks of 2014","350":"a very well written book and engrossing story well deserving of the rave reviews it has received this one will stay with me for a long time","351":"i'm in awe of this book","352":"every single character was seriously flawed whether it was the alcoholic social worker his runaway daughter or the religious crazy zealot bringing up a wayward son in the wilderness i truly liked the use of language and style of the book but i just got waylaid by the depressing trashed way of living even in the the midst of the beauty of montana","353":" it's what the world is going to look like someday a world of chasers and just a few runners takers no carers p 406i lost sleep over this novel it's dark deep and nothing less than unforgettable painfully honest an impressive debut novel for smith henderson he dreamed that we all contain so many masses and that people are simply potentialities cases p 440brilliant character development they stick with you whether you want them to or not one of the better books i've read in awhile","354":"this is a good one i couldn't put it down highly recommend","355":"intelligent writing apart from the usual the characters are exceedingly imperfect and not the type you really end up liking for all their flaws but they move they story well sometimes it's just nice to read really good writing that employs interesting twists and turns along the way","356":"a saintly emotionally damaged social worker struggles against the tides of poverty and ignorance in rural montana a religion obsessed survivalist in the wilderness carves holes in coins to warn humanity of the bankruptcy of society and the coming apocalypse while children of unfortunate circumstances are doomed to repeat the mistakes of their elders or worse this novel is as much a comment on the character of america as it is on the people in it depth of character and plot are exceptional very moving an epic story told from the fringes a remarkably good first novel wow","357":"fourth of july creek has a great premise but was ultimately disappointing i found the rachel rose interregnums to be distracting from the overall narrative and to be poorly placed and written","358":"i honestly don't remember the last book i read that is as good as this one the severely flawed characters nonetheless inspire empathy and the writing is just beautiful what a heartbreaking career social work can be and yet pete just keeps going he sees how some of his actions bring great harm to those he is trying to help and tries to learn from those mistakes his personal relationships are highly dysfunctional and the irony is not lost on him there is lots of action as well as angst in this tale what a great read","359":" the most depressing book i have read in recent memory i definitely do not like my literature light and fluffy but the fact that there was not one redeeming quality to any of the characters that any bad thing that could possibly happen to any of the characters did indeed happen and the relentless dreariness of the setting just did it for me i slogged through this book and breathed a sigh of relief when it was over i didn't even care that the author tied up 0% of the many storylines was it well written oh you betcha that's why it got three stars from me instead of one or two","360":"if this is what montana looked like in the early 80s then i am glad that i wasn't there","361":" \"fourth of july creek\" by smith henderson published by ccco category - fiction literature publication date - may 27 2014pete snow is a case worker for the department of family services in montana pete becomes involved in several cases that are of the dark variety and adds his own personal dark life in the mix he is divorced from his wife and she has taken their teenage daughter to texas to live his wife has problems that range from drugs to alcohol to prostitution of course pete has his problems as he could be classified as a problem drinker his daughter living in a screwed up family seeks an outlet but finds the going difficult in the outside world pete also has a brother who is \"on the lamb\" from the authorities as he has had several encounters with the authorities if this isn't enough pete is handling the case of a young boy who seems to be incorrigible who is living with his mother who has problems with addictions pete tries to get him on the straight and narrow but finds him to be a most difficult challenge pete if you can believe it gets involved with a family that can be best described as religious survivalist again he is involved with a young boy that becomes his key to getting information about the family and getting them assistance the family becomes deathly ill except for father and son and all die in the meantime pete is flying or driving all over the country in an attempt to find his missing daughter i found this to be a difficult read due to its structure and i kept asking myself how pete who is a government worker is able to keep coming up with monies to support his actions the reader should be aware that the book contains strong language and sexual content","362":" reminds me of graham greene's the power and the glory in having a central character who so wants to do good in fact is in the profession of doing good in this instance as a child protective services worker rather than a priest but who most of the time f's it up on the whole i'd rather read greene i read this for the new and noteworthy book club at book people someone else pointed out that all the mothers in this book are messed up or missing smith henderson is also a writer of short stories this novel seemed more like scenes and character sketches interesting scenes and sketches that didn't always string together well at this length also in candor it bothered me some that here is a 21st century writer evoking 1980 a year that i am old enough to remember small details the rancher with the moleskine journal characters repeatedly rolling their own cigarettes seeking refuge from attacking rotweilers atop a late seventies toyota corolla kept jarring my suspension of disbelief i hear this is also in the works for a television series i think i might watch it as a tv show but probably not","363":"i'm not really sure what to say about this book except that it was sad and raw the protagonist has at least as many problems as the people he's trying to help and everyone just sort of bumbles around creating tragedy it wasn't terrible but i wouldn't call it good","364":"beautifully composed yet painfully written anderson's tale of pete snow a social worker in tenmile mt who means well but has demons of his own to confront weaves family drama with the characters snow manages in his career the social worker's clients evoke sympathy and pity at some moments while at others the reader feels contempt and disgust a truly talented author who clearly familiarized himself with the cities he wrote about whether in wa mt tx or or this is a must read","365":"oh boy here we go right off a cliff from the start lovin' it visceral brutal story yet a story woven with a thread of beauty and compassion kinda like real life shit happens to all of us right some of it karmic justice most of it random smith henderson has captured the spirit of life with his words he has the gift not a read for folks that gravitate to a more uplifting tome","366":"stunning real complicated thoroughly engaging but brutal to read at times at first i was wondering what is up in this town that would be home to so many troubled individuals and families but i bet this story is familiar to law enforcement social services and judicial systems i came to know and care about these deeply flawed characters i m astonished this is a debut novel and award the full five stars in response","367":" this book is no laughing matter it's dark depressing distressing bleak and grim but i get to page 435 and laugh because of this one sentence then there's trouble i'm like this author is messing with his readers 434 pages of absolutely craziness and hard to believe situations and then there's trouble it was an lol moment i loved this book it's not a happy book and i'm not sure there is any hope in the book that's up to each reader to decide it's a well written book that's hard because of the disturbing subject matter so be aware this is a debut novel and it's hard to believe the author got it all right at his first attempt but in my opionion he did 5 star read but now off to something a little less heavy","368":"this was a very good book the story was great it was hard to put down but it was also one of the most depressing books i have read in a long time the way some people use and abuse children is sickening","369":"wow wow wow i've been in a reading slump lately finishing several books that i just didn't find satisfying kind of like when i eat a bunch of little snacks that aren't bad but leave me still feeling hungry ish i didn't even post reviews for most of those books because i felt mean spirited writing so many three star reviews then along comes fourth of july creek a big satisfying banquet of a novel it grapples with all my favorite topics parent child relationships class conflict and religious political fanaticism and despite being written by a guy with all sorts of mfa literary chic credentials we're not going to hold that against him much the plot still charges along our anti hero is a pete a social worker in rural montana who managed to put himself through college despite having knocked up and married his high school girlfriend pete is better educated than the dysfunctional families he's charged with helping but he's not much better off than them financially or emotionally the novel has three plot threads involving pete's efforts to help cecil and katie whose mother is a neglectful addict ben whose father is a conspiracy theory obsessed survivalist and rachel pete's own runaway daughter the stories of these families are very dark indeed the adults in the novel are all wounded people searching for love and some kind of belief system to bring order to their worlds when they can't find what they need it's their children who suffer kids don't choose their parents they're forced to play the hand they're dealt this is not a feel good book but the ending while by no means happy does offer a glimmer of redemption the characters all all flawed but compelling the novel takes place in the early 1980s mainly because the eruption of mt st helens and the attempted assassination of reagan play a minor but important part in the plot other than that the story feels like it could be taking place today highly recommended","370":"i was a little disappointed in the ending of this book so i struggled with giving it 4 stars maybe a 3 1 2 interesting story lines which even though set in the 70s could be more recent as much of idiots as the main characters could be i still liked them enough to care what happened to them i would put this on a summer reading list if you have run out of other things to read","371":"i tried to finish this book but the more i read it the worst it became the book started well with pete and cecil but the writing became dry and boring and lost interest would not recommend","372":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book couldn't put it down","373":"this is a convoluted story of good intentions bad choices heroic efforts revenge misunderstandings forgiveness it's all there the thing is it works after what i thought was a slow beginning i was hooked i'd have given it 4 1 2 stars probably but thought it deserved to be rounded up rather than down","374":"from kalireads chromed long haulers glinted like showgirls among logging trucks caked in oatmealy mud white exhaust thrashing flamelike in the wind from their silvery stacks -- smith henderson fourth of july creeksometimes a book rises up out of nowhere something unexpected and fresh for all the right reasons with language so pretty it rolls off the tongue molding the world around you into something so crisp and haunting it seems exactly like the way things are but at the same time so much more than you've ever perceived like you've stepped out of real life and into the prettiest messiest coloring book you've ever seen fourth of july creek's story is sad but brilliant and angry in a way that we all might be a little angry as we're all doing our best and sometimes that just doesn't seem to be enough protagonist pete snow is far from the stereotypical social worker a man working in rural montana and partying out his pain when what he sees gets to be too much rather than creating a stereotypically \"difficult\" protagonist or the opposite a soft spoken hero pete is somewhere in between reminding us how much of our reality is acted out in places most books movies and magazines don't dare visit what i wanted pete to be what role i expected him to fulfill in the novel from the start was so far from where he ended up it was a startling reminder of how individual characters often fail to bloom into full realizations of human strength and failure greatness and ugliness all rolled into one the local small high school calls pete to handle a malnourished and dirty teenager who stumbles upon the grounds and pete begins to help this hesitant wild boy and his father a paranoid extremist who has seceded from society speckling this story is the story of pete's daughter in interview format and this separate storyline becomes a sort of call and response ode to how simply things go awry to how easily we make decisions with little understanding of why and ultimately to how well we keep going despite it all i didn't think twice when i started fourth of july creek-i had no idea what it was about i just saw the title around a few places and thought i should read it as my endless struggle to read all the books in the world continues right away this book had me smith henderson's trawling plodding use of language is eloquent in a peculiar way which feels true to the montana country featured in the novel also feels comfortable other reviews compared henderson's language unavoidably to cormac mccarthy's but this is mccarthy's country at its most human rather than being overworked with grammatical fireworks the book's stunning language is nestled deep and snug within the story within the pull of strained relationships and a man diving in to save everything or maybe nothing it is dare i say my best book of the year thus far give it a read i urge you","375":" i may cry i wanted this book from the minute i saw the first blurb about it i've drooled for it then i start reading it i wasn't crazy about it what is wrong with me i love this type of book gritty dark and the souls of the characters are laid bare still didn't like it the writing for me and this should not stop anyone from reading it was choppy and uneven half the time i didn't know what was going on or which character was being discussed i think i'm gonna troll my damn self for being a hater why stupid evil queen wannabe","376":"an amazing and must read did not want it to end characters were terrific and very well thought out plots and twists were well handled and could not put this book down can't wait for his next book","377":"montana conjures memories of two wonderful vacations i took with my family that were filled with breathtaking scenery and amazing wildlife but every beautiful area has its dark sides as smith henderson reminds me in his arresting debut novel fourth of july creek smith takes a harrowing look at a troubled world caused by poverty drugs and mental illness through the eyes of pete snow a montana department of family services social worker for a dangerous job with paltry salary pete tries to improve the lives of neglected and abused children who live in a rural part of the state in the early 1980s he finds his ultimate challenge when he discovers a starving raggedy 11 year old boy named benjamin living in the wilderness with his paranoid father jeremiah pearl when pete tries to provide the boy with food clothing and medicine jeremiah threatens to shoot him but pete persists and slowly gains the trust of the father who turns out to be more than just a crazy survivalist jeremiah has drawn the attention of the fbi for his beliefs that the american government is the enemy and the end times are near pete is a complex character and his developing relationship with the pearls is intriguing he cares so much about other people's children yet fails as a father after his estranged wife beth moves to texas he eventually gets word that his teenage daughter rachel has run away he copes with his overwhelming feelings of failure and sadness by excessively drinking henderson's book reminds me of julia keller's mysteries which shine a light on the social problems of west virginia's appalachian mountains fourth of july creek is an impressive debut novel with beautifully written prose and character development it is one of my favorite books of 2014","378":"reads like watching a film simultaneously dark and gorgeous","379":"this book held my interest throughout and is really about a 3 7 characters and writing are very vivid the story is so challenging at times because there are so many unfortunate unhappy people in the book it's clear to me i would not be a good social worker","380":"i did not care for this book it was one train wreck after another i wanted to stop reading but was compelled to see how all the wreckage ended","381":"\"fourth of july creek \" by smith henderson is a gritty and gripping novel set in 1980s montana the protagonist is pete snow a social worker responsible for a large rural area pete's world - both at home and at work - is full of people who are teetering on the edge of society dealing with drug addictions poverty homelessness abuse and a callous criminal justice system henderson's novel brilliantly explores the lives and attitudes of these people - many of whom desperately need help but are too proud or suspicious to take it the major thread of the novel involves pete's efforts to gain the trust of a survivalist named jeremiah pearl who lives with his young son in primitive conditions in the backcountry as the novel progresses the pace accelerates as pete's personal life begins to fall apart and he becomes wrapped up in a large fbi manhunt for pearl this all leads to a conclusion that i found to be both surprising and satisfying overall i really enjoyed the book and recommend it highly","382":" i stumbled upon this book at the airport and my nook battery died so i picked up a copy because i had read a review that was positive and this is his premier novel i was curious to see what editors and publishers look for in authors nowadays insanity bestiality and runaways oh my oh my oh my the story plods along pretty slowly with characters that i wanted to like but never could pete the protagonist never really redeems himself i was trying hard to root for him and in hopes of seeing him become a better father and person but alas too little too late for rachel rose and his community anyway he doesn't even like himself a couple of things really annoyed the hell outta me so much so i put the book down for a couple of months before picking it back up to finish it time i will never get back mind you #1 who the hell is the wizard of oz persona who questions rachel rose's journey don't think of finishing to the bitter end to find out because the reader won't ever know the man behind the green curtain or what happens to the girl really #2 the fancy schmancy words contained within here let me give you a sample bulwarks yurt logorrhea blotto slattern klaxons wyomed inured augur catenary fusillade apocrypha etc etc etc i really had to lament over 1 star vs 2 stars well it is his 'premier' novel after all i'll give it a star for finding someone to publish this and i'm worried editors or publishers won't like my 'premier' novel well i have nothing to worry about then","383":"perhaps i just couldn't take off my social worker hat to stop thinking about how horrible of a professional this guy was but i did not enjoy this book at times too far fetched at times just annoying not quite worth the read in my opinion","384":"a messy read constantly jumping around i normally like a book with dysfunctional characters but these people are beyond and still unravelling it just wasn't for me but don't take my word for it everybody else loves this book i think my taste has changed recently which hasn't helped my rating","385":"hideous yet awesome piece of fiction","386":"3 5 stars not enough to round up to 4 i feel a little torn the writing is very good there are some interesting characters it moved well enough to keep me going through almost 500 pages but by the last 75 pages or so i just wanted it to be done it's dark dirty and depressing but not in a very moving way maybe i just can't relate to the setting that's possible but i didn't feel as connected to any character as i need to be to really love a book and nothing good happens for any of them nothing that being said the writing is good enough that i would read more from the author","387":" boy meets girl...meets child...meets job dealing with other boys that have met girls that have met children...and boy meets lifethis book is all shades of life sucking like sucking so bad that those sucks break off and or shatter and continue forming new sucks sucks that begot sucks that beget sucks that begat sucks and before you know it you forget what you were attempting to do in the first place i'm pretty sure it was to be in a state of not sucking but who can remember there was beauty in the writing that flowed in and out of the suck void the character connection was so obtainable and my mind was left spinning in a thousand different directions with each step they took in their world of suck butit was dry at times and i did have to randomly back read a bit to keep myself on the same page as the story i also didn't reach for this book when i found spare moments to do what i love most butlife can and does suck this bad and to see others managing to deal with it all in various ways is something to behold not that i support their coping mechanisms but that i understand them i see you there fighting the good fight and i offer you a nod oh and one must never forget the frogs","388":"a book not for everyone every character is seriously flawed some even detestable yet the author let's us into their lives so that we along with the main character recognize ourselves in them in our common humanity i was hoping the ending wouldn't be neatly tied up in a bow with all intesecting stories living happily ever after and henderson left it open for the reader","389":" going to just chalk this up to this book being not for me i can see how the style could be appealing but i only found it tedious and disconnecting i could never get into this book at all i mostly found myself wondering who the narrator was even referring to at any given point in the story this isn't one of those books i'm going to call bad but i will say i definitely did not like it most tedious and laborious reading experience i've had for a long time it took me forever to finish this glad to moving on","390":"an amazing novel that everyone should be reading and re reading","391":"started off good i finished it but by the end didn't care about the characters","392":"i'm not denying that this writer has talent and there are some striking lines at the same time i think this book confuses darkness for complexity and gratuitousness for grit too many stories and tangents mean losing what is interesting and important about this book often we can provide for others what we cannot provide for ourselves","393":"so many good reviews but i just couldn't finish it","394":"though it got off to a gooky start i just about pitched the book across an airport lounge when the author compares a speed freak degenerate's makeup to the american flag and all it stands for this ended up being a sensitive exploration of trauma's work on children and the difficulty of social work he writes with a beautifully specific sense of place i felt like i was back in austin or high in the mountains of montana it's not for the faint hearted there's so much bad shit happening in this book that it almost became a horror novel in parts","395":" slow and moody with a choppy narrative i really don't see how people's minds are being blown by this book sorry america i don't hate four of july creek but i'm about two thirds in and i'm gonna bail cuz i'm bored and don't really care about what's gonna happen next i think the biggest problem i have though is the writing style sometimes the dialogue is in quotes and sometimes it's not sometimes it isn't even made clear who's talking so you have have to \"listen\" for each character's \"voice\" or whatever and sometimes i couldn't tell what was going on in a scene cuz we get descriptions of what a character is seeing feeling and thinking all in one paragraph only without any distinction between the changes like there'd just be random one or two word sentences random nouns adjectives verbs everyone's got a style and that's fine i just need some kinda flow some kinda rhythm i do most of my reading on the subway and this isn't the best book to read in such a distracting environment so maybe that's the problem but even if i was on a quiet porch in the middle of nowhere i doubt this would've kept my interest let alone blown my mind","396":"this book takes place in and around rural montana which is the perfect setting for the desolation and starkness of the situations facing the many characters whom themselves are desolate and stark images of humanity for me this book was troubling and very difficult to not just walk away from and chalk it up to a bad book choice the author expertly evokes feelings of trouble conflict and human disaster pete the main character is a social worker who has no business trying to help others with all of his flaws and baggage that he openly carries ben is a breath of fresh air in the novel yet he too causes the reader to worry and fret for his well being and for his future rose pete's daughter is a runaway on a crash course with every possible trouble known to teenagers it was so worrisome that no adult in her life including police officers faced the truth about what this group of homeless teen was doing surely these events could be prevented the whole situation of teens living on the streets apparently invisible to the rest of us is extremely distressing i am not sure how i feel now that i have come to the end of this novel but it does give readers some serious issues to consider","397":"took me a while to get through this one but i finally made it i couldn't take much of the fault filled narrator at one time lots of misery and certainly not uplifting but still captivating enough to make you want to keep reading","398":"total and complete dysfunction enough already","399":"this is one of my thus far favorite books of 2014 set in 1980 pete snow is a social worker in rural montana a functional alcoholic with a soft spot for the families he is trying to aid while ignoring his own crumbling marriage with the coming of the age of reagan pete stumbles across benjamin pearl an undernourished eleven year old who wanders into a school one day and leads pete face to face with jeremiah pearl an anarchist hiding with his family in the wild when pete's daughter runs away from home his ability to balance his personal and professional life teeters wildly as jeremiah attracts the attention of the feds and threatens pete's entire way of life the prose is stunningly good arresting smart images all throughout the novel had me underlining sentences yet nothing takes away from what is a pageturning story pete is a damaged complex engaging character whose mistakes are shown plainly and whose goodness cannot be hidden there are neat narrative asides as the book also shows how pete's daughter rachel runs away from home and becomes the type of child pete sees in his daily life and jeremiah pearl is a fascinating foil both sympathetic and scary there are so many wonderful subplots and ideas pulsating through this storyline and it's told with the rich confidence of a wizened veteran rather than a debut novelist this is an absolute must read","400":"pete a social worker deals with 2 cases in particular cecil katie and their druggie mother and jeremiah pearl and his son benjamin in the meantime pete's own daughter runs away and pete is always just a little too late to catch up with her it was a sad story no happy endings but very real","401":"a bit of a low scoring simply because i'm not a big fan of this type of genre but a well written ineresting american tale i enjoyed it more than i typically enjoy this genre","402":"go get this book and read it immediately","403":"omg and wow had to put my big girl panties on to finish this one amazing story great characters some twists and turns several shocks and surprises it's all good except now i'm left with that i just finished a great book and the next one won't be nearly as good let down feeling","404":"quite possibly the best book i read all year yes i'm a year behind fourth of july creek is grim and beautiful and even when you think you know where it's going the plot turns organically just enough to shed new light a very dark but very lovely book","405":" pete snow is a jekyll and hyde character he's a social worker who sometimes gets too involved in his cases even thinking of taking an abused child to his own home in the opening pages however when it comes to his own family he's a disaster both in his relationship with his ex wife and his teenage daughter i don't expect him to be an angel but at the same time this difference in persona is bordering of the schizophrenic and i couldn't take his role as a social worker seriously from the beginning and he doesn't help himself by returning to his roots to hang out with his oldest friends he's one of those who have made it got an education and made good for himself away from the stultifying confines of the small town in which he was born not only does he regularly have alcohol fuelled sessions to be able to cope with his working and personal life he uses liberal amounts of class a drugs in the process by creating such a character to carry the story henderson made it difficult for me to find what was to follow credible i couldn't believe that snow was real someone in his position just wouldn't do what he did and get away with it as he does constantly in the present day environment when not playing by the rules oft times ridiculous rules i'll accept is just a non starter i just never got to a stage where i could suspend disbelief a requirement if you wish to immerse yourself in any story henderson has good ideas the young boy who's taken into the mountains living a very precarious 'survivalist' life style by his distraught father distraught after an avoidable disaster that had killed his wife and other children is a good plot line but how snow reacts had me saying far too often 'i just don't believe it' he gets obsessed with saving this young boy but doesn't seem to realise that if he had paid as much attention to his daughter she wouldn't have run a way an event which causes him to travel across state lines like a chicken with its head cut off in order to try to find her snow constantly does things on instinct without thought without consideration of the possible consequences he never learns and repeats the same mistakes and rails at the world for what he considers is an injustice but a more rational approach would have produced greater success he's not a bad person just a fool henderson is making comments about contemporary american society the environmental degradation that goes unchecked the marginalisation of an increasing number of poor working class men women and children a growing group that is becoming more and more alienated from the society in 'the land of the free in the home of the brave' empty words that seem to prevent americans from confronting the problems of their society and retreating into their own gun protected shells - and hence the increase in the number of survivalist groups all a product of the fear and uncertainty in which so many live the state itself is represented by a vile vicious and vindictive probation officer whose obsession to right a perceived wrong borders on the psychopathic his eventual fate doesn't draw any tears things get resolved in a sense in the end but the journey was too hard and stretched my ability to believe that such a scenario is possible even in the benighted united states of america","406":" this book had everything places i know of in montana and seattle alcoholics and drug addicts runaways pimps and prostitutes odd people who live in the wilderness that hole up with guns and are suspicious of everyone social workers with messed up lives themselves of darkness and light kindness and well defended survivors who no longer trust and a mystery that i cannot divulge or i would be a spoiler the prose at times was striking an amazing contrast to the plot peppered with characters from the underbelly of society that lives on the fringe","407":"unfortunately for lack of time and sometimes due to lack of it holding my attention i would put this book down for a week at a time and when i'd pick it up again it was sometimes hard to recall all the characters one thing all the characters had in common was that they all had major personality problems including the main character who was the social worker for most of them the book held my attention more toward the end","408":" henderson reveals the soft underbelly of rural america and it ain't pretty but he does so with characters and writing that grips your soul and makes you look he's a sly writer though with pete the flawed hero and rachel the 'applesauce' fallen angel although with a wink henderson tells us her story is yet to come the book's setting is very reminiscent of the movie winter's bone here's a new twist on a funk \"wyoming forever you could wyom all day and not make any progress to wyom was to go from nowhere to nowhere through nowhere to see nothing to do nothing but sit you turn on the radio and wyom through the dial slowly carefully in search of a sliver of civilization only to find a man talking about the price of stock animals and feed you listen to a dour preacher wyoming about your bored and dying and wyoming soul \"","409":"i didn't get the hype utterly depressing but i think that was the point","410":"bleak but not despairing challenging but not highbrow falters in a couple places but gripped me more and more as the pages turned until at the last i was a wreck the world as it was and as it is the landscape of the northwest my home and its self made people as unforgiving and hopeful as they are the spirit and the spiritual the inescapable past and the uncertain but promising future henderson sees it all the women fare worst but even this it could be argued is as things really are i will be surprised to read a better book this year","411":" this is so raw no one in this whole book makes wise decisions pete snow the a social worker in rural montana hates his father and his step mother possibly with reason he married too young had a daughter too young now separated from his wife and daughter substance abuse is rampant by everyone pete his wife his brother his clients his friends he tries to help but always is too late and his daughter is one of the casualties the dea the police at all levels his fellow social workers all seem to be incompetent and pete is always always confrontational with the authorities it starts out slow but by the end you are hooked","412":"a social worker in montana encouters difficulties in his work and his life gritty stark beautifully written","413":"i was ready to give this book five stars about halfway through because the writing u0026amp story are just that good it's probably more of 4 5 stars as is typical with my reviews but hell why not this story is filled with good things unique characters plot twists u0026amp vivid scenery i don't think the plot summary does it justice thank you parnassus books for introducing me to smith henderson i'm thoroughly impressed fourth of july creek is his first novel hopefully more good things to come from him","414":"exquisitely written but very disturbing i think this is the best book in terms of writing quality that i've read in a long time but it made me sad and depressed","415":"i didn't want this book to end it reminded me of necessary lies the language of flowers and weight of blood but a hundred times better","416":"the world is a blade and dread is hope cut open and spread inside out this is by far the best book i've read in quite a while because of the original plot flawless prose and structure and the questions it asks regarding charity freedom and social responsibility the protagonist pete is by no means a great social worker in fact he is mediocre bordering on pathetic while his intentions are good he is blind to the needs of his own family a wife who has left him and a teenage daughter thirsty for love and acceptance a modern american novel wouldn't be complete with a a tinge of paranoia and anarchy so pete meets benjamin pearl and his son pete is introduced to the pearls when he is called to a nearby elementary school where the boy has wandered in dirty and catatonic with signs of scurvy and malnutrition and appears to have been living in the woods indefinitely thus benjamin pearl's goal is to take down the government or at least live apart from it which become one and same pete is entangled in pearl's drama because of his tragic big heart and soon finds himself in danger the novel begs us to consider how members of a community can best serve one another while preserving individual dignity","417":"this book is not easy to read as it's very depressing but i don't know how anyone could deny this is an outstanding book the writing is great every character comes alive i listened to this on audible and the narration is clear and the characters easy to differentiate but if there is an award for audible narrators then jenna lamia the voice of rachel rose needs to win it win all of them i've never heard a character voiced with such life i would recommend the audio over the book just to hear lamia's narration","418":"honestly i initially was struggling with this book despite what the title may imply this is not a light summer book that you can read for a few minutes before an appointment or ten pages before bed once i gave this book the time it demands and deserves i was swept away i am not a re reader but today when i finished the last word of this book i knew i have to read this one again soon","419":"a brilliant portrait of the fringes of american society the chief protagonist pete snow is a remarkable character the bleakness of a mccarthy novel but with the humanity of steinbeck a compelling read","420":"perhaps fittingly i finished fourth of july creek on the 4th of july vacationing in hawaii while i'd be happy to include it on my desert island reading list it's not a light vacation style read the desperate troubled characters in henderson's debut include not only those the social worker protagonist pete snow encounters but also pete himself there are some real misanthropes in the bunch particularly the evangelical survivalist jeremiah pearl whom pete must engage in order to care for the man's feral son off work pete is nearly as messed up as the people to whom he tends but his commitment to others is absolutely inspiring and he earns the reader's sympathy so do other characters who no matter how vile they might seem initially are not without their admirable qualities there's also a sub plot based around pete's daughter which is compelling in its own right although i kinda wished henderson had written it in the same style he had the greater narrative instead of the unsituated qu0026amp a dialogue in which it appears","421":"only read this bc it was a ny bs honestly not sure why middle of the road writing story scheme was daunting and stale glad it was finally over","422":" as far as fiction goes i would say this book leans towards realism my main problem with this book is that it doesn't lean towards that enough and hurts my ability to suspend my disbelief and engage with the story as the story goes on it's hard not to notice how many of the major characters behave in psychologically unrealistic ways i get the sense that the author just wanted the characters to do certain things in pursuit of telling a certain story but in doing so sacrificed the believability of the characters many tense or dramatic situations arise out of this sacrifice and i think it really lessens the impact of those sections it almost had me just rolling my eyes it's like i might as well be reading a fable or something where the focus is on the storytelling and not on trying to make it feel like real life i don't expect authors trying to write about human beings to be masters of psychology but to a point it can really hurt the story if i don't feel like the characters are behaving like real human beings i know that the characters in this book come from very irregular and individual backgrounds but even with that in mind it doesn't explain their unbelievable behavior i'm thinking about pearl in particular anyway the story is really just a serious of unfortunate events and overall dreary there's a few exciting moments but overall i felt like most of the story was quite boring and mundane a man searching for his daughter does sound like it should be interesting but it just boiled down to he thinks he might have found her so he desperately drives to where she was last seen oh surprise surprise he doesn't find her now he goes and gets really drunk and self destructive in short the book was okay but i felt like the realistic setting set up an expectation for me that i would be reading a story about human beings and that expectation was not met oh and one more thing it's too darn long it would be fine if the length came from new or interesting stuff happening but a lot of it just felt really same y and repetitive especially the chapters with the q a with rose","423":" i kept reading this book in the hopes of finding something of value in it that would justify the raving reviews it's received never did find it i didn't like any of the characters or cared about any of them except little ben pearl who was caught in all of his father's paranoia i don't see where the writing was brilliant i thought it was very disjointed and confusing very disappointed in this book and will stay away from anything else written by this author the book literally gave me a headache and made me feel sick i very seldom give any book two stars but this hardly deserves that i'll give it those two stars only because about a third of the way in i was curious about what would happen especially to the pearls but that curiosity died out another third of the way in","424":" i glanced through other reviews to see why this book averaged a rating of 3 9 stars not stellar pardon the pun but quite respectable apparently other readers are willing to overlook the meandering plot the muddled flashbacks the inexplicable and jarring plot devices such as the question and answer sessions used to tell the story of the protagonist's daughter ah the protagonist pete the child welfare worker whose own child needed him desperately but he ran away far away rather than standing by her and giving her the stability she needed several reviewers say he is a good man ask rachel rose whether he is a good man pete's response to his wife's infidelity was to go on periodic alcohol binges understandable as infidelity can be devastating but when there is a child involved you grow up grow a pair and take care of her pete's child welfare clients for the most part did not fare much better than his daughter the most interesting plot thread in this novel which has way too many subplots for my taste the story of jeremiah pearl and his family is only hinted at in the beginning and doesn't actually start in earnest until over a hundred pages into the book that's another question i had where was the editor 465 pages this story could have been pared down to 300 350 pages and been much better for it this is the first two star rating i've given on goodreads admittedly that is in large part because i have been listing every book i can remember reading and i have forgotten far more than i've listed therefore i've had to guess at a rating on books i read 30 years ago however i feel two stars is all this book deserves perhaps henderson's second novel will benefit from his experience in writing this one in my opinion this is one of those first novels that should have stayed in the desk drawer for a few years while the author worked on subsequent novels refining his style and learning proper grammar at that point perhaps he would be ready to pull out this novel revise and edit it and make it a story worth reading","425":"could not put it down well written so very depressing and dark","426":"social work meets winter's bone pete is a basically good but flawed person he drinks too much he hooks up with damaged women he practices unorthodox social work for family services in the boonies around tenmile montana the families he works with live on the fringes of society his marriage to a woman who also drinks too much is collapsing in the fallout their teenage daughter runs away and ends up on the streets working as a prostitute pete becomes involved trying to help a family who live up in the mountains religious and anti government zealots with 6 children pete strikes up a friendship with one of the children pete is heartbroken that he can't locate or help his own daughter while he makes a living helping other people's children he knows he has failed his daughter because of his own demons it was a good book cover to cover i didn't want to put it down once i started reading it","427":" this book does not wyom not at all so much happens in this book most of it bad that i don't even know where to start so i'll just say that this is a great read there are plenty of characters but all of them felt real to me i loved pete he frustrated me but i still loved him i take kids away from people like us ouch my only complaint is that i was much more interested in reading about the pearls and pete than i was in cecil's family or rachel's story hers was almost too upsetting for me and i hated reading it but at least this wasn't the sort of novel that drains all the joy out of your heart and lingers like a sickness once you're done with it it had a solid ending and by solid i mean it wasn't at all solid and i'm sure it bothered some readers but i loved it overall i'm very glad i picked this one up","428":"couldn't finish this well written but the characters are pretty awful and i have just no sympathy or compassion for them once i stop caring about or rooting for all characters i'm finished i wanted to like the book it all ended when there was a scene involving sexual abuse of a child disgusted me","429":"brutal lyrical and beautiful all at once i was so engrossed in this amazing novel even at its bleakest i couldn't put it down one of the best books i've read this year hands down","430":"this protagonist is supposed to be a screwed up alcoholic social worker who gives up his own daughter to his alcoholic ex wife so no matter what good he thinks he does it does not impress me as meaningful","431":"started off in agony being reminded of why i disliked much of goldfinch but it took a different turn and was a really great read really loved each character","432":" the initial excitement i felt when this arrived at the library for me faded as soon as the 3rd or 4th page when i realized that the backwater dialect of the characters would not only be used for their dialogue but for every word of the book this might be okay if it were a first person narrative but when it's third person it's just irritating pointless and detracts from the story and characters which i found interesting plus the overwhelming amount of run on sentences took away their emphatic power it felt like the author was trying to show how original and or cool his writing was and here are some examples that disprove his assertion it burned and he winced hugely pete took a bite from the burger and chewed enormously ursula kimmie and some girl else ugh very disappointing that i won't get to know these characters more fully or know how this story ends","433":"i gave up after about 150 pages just couldn't get invested in the ugly characters","434":"this book started strong and died a quick death at around page 100","435":"this book was hard to read because i could not find a single character that i liked all were well developed and the author's writing is excellent yet i cannot recommend this book just because it left the reader me with only dark thoughts about people and our society it was also a totally unbelievable presentation of child protective services and how they operate","436":"an audio listen for me and it was very well done this book grabbed me from the start my only compalint about this one and i did debate about dropping it a star was the young girl's voice the words she uses are not words that are typically used by teenagers it felt off every time she spoke and frankly it annoyed me but overall the story was really good so basically i'm giving this one a 4 5","437":"this book may have really been 4 5 stars for me rather than 5 because as well written as it is it is some grim stuff to absorb not one that i would recommend to most people looking for an easy fun read then again i am huge fan of southern grit lit so despite the montana wilderness setting this felt as comfortable to me as any southern landscape that larry brown or william gay has ever conjured below is one of my favorite chapters of the book which i am including in total only because it is short and beautifully written and i want to remember it later it takes place during a car ride with 13 year old rachel and her mother that is moving them from montana to texas in an earlier chapter rachel contemplates changing her name to rose this doesn't really contain any major plot spoilers but i am hiding the review since it is excerpted straight from the book what was it like on the way to texas it was wyoming which means to drive forever through ugly scrubscape the color of dirty pennies it was just wyoming along they were wyoming forever you could wyom all day and not make any progress to wyom was to go from nowhere to nowhere through nowhere to see nothing to do nothing but sit you turn on the radio and wyom through the dial slowly carefully in search of a sliver of civilization only to find a man talking about the price of stock animals and feed you listen to a dour preacher wyoming about your bored and dying and wyoming soul did her mom wyom too mom wyomed all through colorado she smoked she drank coffee and tab and then beer wyoming her fingers on the wheel sometimes and stopping to wyom to someone on the pay phone maybe daddy but probably that friend in texas the truck driver is he your boyfriend it's an old friend rachel leslie she said rachel's name to annoy her old friend from when from when i worked at the trucking company he's a trucker is that why we're going all the way to texas he said we could stay with him yes what's his name jimmy how do you know him i told you from when i was a receptionist did you do it with him too what is that supposed to mean him too what come on i know why daddy left did her mother hit her or pull over or give her some kind of talking to worse what did she do she cried drops big and quiet racing down her face did it unnerve rachel rose did it unnerve rose yes why because her mother's heart was wyoming it was wyoming hard and she was days and years and maybe forever from a good man","438":"hard to believe this is his first book dark and powerful beautifully written more gushing here at http thedailydosage com 2014 12 10","439":"nope i'm half way through this book and i'm quitting i cannot get with the main character he is a father and a caseworker for child protective services and a colossal screw up he's a raging alcoholic and wholly inappropriate with children i'm sure people like this really exist but i don't want to read about them i gave the book two stars because there are some really good story lines in there too bad","440":"i spent too much time reading this book to give up on it but it was not quite enjoyable the style quite bothered me--in place of good writing there's lots of artistic run on sentences and cliched dialogue interviews about the protagonist's missing daughter briefly interrupt the story but i am still unclear about who the dialogue was from i was just relieved to finish it and start something fun","441":" fourth of july creek there's a lot to unpack let's call it a 3 5 from where i sit pros slick prose cannily round main characters some truly fun scenes to read beautiful imagery of the great american nowhere a fairly compelling premise acceptable plotting cons occasional painful prose purpling e g they began to harvest orgasms oof occasional western genre trope traps pretty testosterone laden overwhelming unlikeability of virtually everyone yet no one is a villain exactly u0026gt offputting messaging more below didn't really pass the bechdel test a slight feeling that this entire thing was a dry run for television i don't want to say i didn't like fourth of july creek that wouldn't be the whole story but the book is long and much of it quite disturbing the sort of literature that revels in making itself a little hard to like essentially there are two main characters two armature characters of these main characters and a host of satellite characters used to prop up the plot and flesh out the setting naturally i went into the book expecting these two main characters to be in conflict as one of them is a social worker and the other an abusive parent i think perhaps the best decision the author made aside from some of the choices in the resolution also masterfully executed was turning this conflict aside in favor of something else i love the idea that we have two characters we expect to be on a collision course who turn out to do no such thing unfortunately this is a novel and there has to be a conflict somewhere and regrettably the conflict that emerges is man against corrupt consumerist federalized society and this is where the book veers off the rails for me not only does the plot take a nosedive in credibility at a certain juncture where the conflict expands its scope but so does my conviction to follow the author where he's going this is criticality with no solution offered more and more the book's only villains emerge to be faceless violent pseudo criminal police officers and federal agents as anonymous as they are empty in their motivations meanwhile its main antihero and faux antagonist continues on his crusade to end the global jewish currency conspiracy largely free of moral judgment by the author i don't buy it not for plot credibility nor for messaging nor in fact for down home authenticity the author doesn't have the elmore leonard chops quite down for my dollar and a lot of the extrema of colloquial setting and speech come off like a bodybuilder admiring self in gym mirror perhaps if the protagonist were a young black man instead of a pretty blond white man from a government agency these rampant police abuses and conflicts with oppressive authority would resonate more believably but as is the antagonists of the novel just come off as straw men for some point being made by the author about society that doesn't jive with my understanding at least of same but i'm also not from where he's from haven't experienced what he has so that could be my ignorance just as easily fourth of july creek is a tough well written heavily plotted book with some memorable characters it's got a hook it can deliver on not a lot of thriller types do if you can stomach a certain level of faithlessness with all its human agents and accept their flaws you may even like it but i'm betting smith henderson's piece de resistance is still on the horizon ethanhttp metafold net hellofold@gmail com","442":"this book is certainly not for the faint of heart but if you can hold up it is a wonderful story not wonderful as in disneyesque but an epic story of the heartache that adults confer onto children both intentionally and not and a story of the assumptions we make about others and their lifestyles it's a story that will stay with you for a long time after you've finished it","443":"a terrific book that takes place mostly in montana the main character pete snow a social worker tries to take the best care of his clients but as a result loses his wife and daughter much of the action takes place in the wilderness outside missoula and tenmile where a survivalist family is hiding both pete and his ex wife are alcoholics and this might contribute to some of pete's poor decisions there are good discussions of apocalyptic religion the incorrigibility of the atf and fbi and the effects of poor parenting on children the novel takes place during 1980 and 1981 and the election of the anti christ president reagon","444":"one of the best books i've read in a very long time","445":"ridiculous book including the ending seems like the author suddenly got tired and tried to tie up all the loose ends and go home to bed there were only a handful of people i would want to even live in the same town that i do is montana really so hard up for social workers and do they actually write them a blank check for buying food medicines clothing","446":" thoughtful and provocative read set not so long ago and not so far away in 1980s in the northwest corner of montana where extreme thinkers go to be far away from the rule of a government they disdain social worker pete snow discovers an all but feral child benjamin roaming around the mountains with his father jeremiah pearl somewhere nearby jeremiah's wife and other children are supposed to be hiding out as well slowly pete tries to build trust and a relationship with the father and son even while his relationship with his own child is shattered as you read the book the echoes of waco and ruby ridge make you think you know what will happen next but don't trust those echoes you don't know really amazing book","447":" pete snow's life's begins to become derailed when he meets a paranoid conspiracy theorist woodsman and his quiet child i'm not exactly sure how to rate or review this book at some moments the characters are strong in their personalities and agents of their lives at others the characters seem to act inconsistently with their personalities within the contexts of the plot on some pages the prose is lush and poignant on others it is unclear and sloppy with its descriptions but one aspect that i appreciated in henderson's novel is the ways in which the different stories help the characters contextualize and solve their conflicts all the characters develop over the course of the novel you'll be entertained for 466 pages and maybe get some insight into the lives of derelicts and suffering but don't expect to be blown away","448":"i am a montanan and the reference to towns and travel did not ring true the male protagonist was a sad sack hippie social worker and was a punching bag for life what is frightening about fourth of july creek is the pearls as this family was believable and the federal government chase to eradicate jeremiah pearl is reality the hunt to get their man and the implications of the chase deny truth","449":"this was a brutal graphic book i'm not sure how it's rated so highly i wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends","450":"by the 100th page i had had more than enough 300 pages to go laborious development of characters no real story line","451":"i really liked it at first but then all the characters turned out to be so self destructive it was too much and there was this weird interview type method of writing interspersed throughout the book that didn't work for me","452":"i'm exhausted but in a good way what a ride love the darkness rawness and energy pete goes on a real journey here and not much of it is good he's got some stamina this guy characters are real and breathing and suffering loved the setting 70s montana perfect","453":"amazing book but not for the faint of heart","454":"i thought i would like this more because i'm a social worker myself it just never really grabbed me maybe because the social worker in me kept questioning pete's behavior also i wasn't crazy about the technique he used to tell rachel's story all that said the story of the pearl family was fascinating but the conclusion didn't work for me","455":"couldn't get through this book because characters were such low lifes too depressing","456":" 4 5 stars this book was intense and heartbreaking poverty child abuse and neglect sexual abuse drug abuse alcoholism prostitution i liked pete snow even though i wanted to throttle him most of the time he has a good heart and is sometimes misguided sometimes not i like my fictional characters flawed and imperfect the audio version was great i liked the separate narrator for rachel rose i was a little confused though was rose talking to pete i think in print this would have been confusing i think the ambiguous ending was spot on even though i want to have the fictional threads wrapped up life isn't like that it's kind of like a more modern grapes of wrath when i think about it","457":"i could not put this book down strong writing and very complex characters and plot however as noted by other reviewers it is a dark book packed with grim situations in reagan era small town montana","458":"the first 100 pages had beautiful writing but for the next 300 i couldn't tell you because the plot was so captivating that i couldn't slow down to enjoy the writing i feel like now that i know what happens i should read it again to pay proper attention to the writing this book is very good","459":" first off at nearly 500 pages this first novel by smith henderson that is garnering a lot of accolades is way too long add this to the list of books i've complained about in the last few years being in need of a firm hand a scalpel to cut it down some to make the book better i know these writers editors publishers want the epic that comes with length but with a book like this the epic becomes exhaustion and frustration by the end henderson is a fine writer it's just too long this is the sort of book i remember reading a lot in the 1990s super serious bleak focusing in on hopeless u0026amp emotionally damaged characters as they keep destroying their lives while teasing the reader with flashes of redemption that will keep us reading whilst it propels itself forward in endless loops buried in its own misery about halfway through the book i remembered why i kind of stopped reading books like this","460":"i was pretty disappointed with this book bleakness masquerading as depth with a writing style i found overly self conscious particularly the interview style chapters which read like a bad writing workshop experiment","461":"i loved this book the story is set in montana in a rural area pete works for the department of family services he loves his job and particularly the children he tries to save them all he discovers a feral child one day watching school kids at resess he follows him into the woods to find his father has a gun pointed at him at the same time there is trouble in petes own family the characters in this story are so well described as well as the scenery the story is one i didn't want to end","462":"started out strong but failed in the stretch not bad for a first novel though","463":" add fourth of july creek by smith henderson to your drop everything and read list the story centers on peter snow a thirty year old social worker who is struggling with his own demons just like the many families he serves in tenmile montana pete has an estranged wife and a thirteen year old daughter rachel who wants to run her own life complicating matters are his brother luke who is hiding from police and unresolved issues with his father as pete is spiraling down while his wife and daughter leave for texas he happens into the lives of jeremiah pearl and his son ben pearl is a survivalist preacher who has moved his family into the backcountry and sees a conspiracy in almost every action around him there is addiction brutality and beauty that inhabit the world that author henderson has created montana is not a forgiving place even when characters are looking for a fresh start pete is as dysfunctional as his clients and when he hears that rachel has run away from her home in texas we see him almost collapse in grief yet he holds out a hand to jeremiah and his son as pete digs into jeremiah's past he is both intrigued and repelled as he learns the preacher's secrets the story also alternates with rachael telling her story to find herself we see her come to realize that being free and having freedom can be two very different things the scenes with pete's clients are especially poignant we see how despair poverty and unrelenting stress make them act out in a world where they have too few skills to make it livable we experience foster care juvenile treatment facilities and the life of street kids who do anything to get by the author does not give us a happy ending tied up with a bow but we do see healing compassion forgiveness and redemption--all of which make this book a heart breaking read","464":"fairly epic in scale touching upon american history conspiracy theories drug addiction relationship abuse parental neglect and the impossible decisions many of us must make when dealing with people including ourselves who are 'outside' the borders of 'civilized' society 'fourth of july creek' is simply put a masterpiece of contemporary literature rarely have i felt so deeply connected to such volatile characters who live in the rural gray zones of humanity stripped of itself","465":"this wouldn't generally be my type of book but henderson's prose is achingly beautiful the first 150 pages are up and down but the seemingly simple story is supported by the beautiful writing with layers of emotion and pain","466":"definitely kept my attention but such desperate pitiful characters that sometimes it was difficult to keep reading","467":"i tried but i gave it almost 80 pages and never got engaged bummer since it was getting glowing reviews on to the next book","468":"excellent fiction a quick read and a real page turner","469":" literature novels and possibly poetry more than any other discipline seem to tap into the collective consciousness more deeply than any other social chronicling and one of the subjects that come up over and over in the novels i'm drawn to is that plight of children in an increasingly unsheltered world runaways child prostitutes violence toward children the violence of children that have been unsheltered that come to react to their environment in violent ways because that's the only ways they know in henderson smith's book a novel that sprawls across time and place we become acquainted with the children of jeremiah pearl a man deeply paranoid a survivalist clinging to distorted biblical understandings and his vision obsessed wife these children want more than a life on the run in the dark forests of montana but they can only live on the edge of their father's harshness and violence we meet a few of these folks through the book's central character pete snow a social worker who intends to help these children despite jeremiah's paranoia but pete has problems too his wife beth has had an affair and the couple separate beth taking young daughter rachel with her to texas beth isn't exactly an ideal mother she drinks does drugs hangs out with unsavory men one of which apparently attempts to rape rachel as with most children of tortured broken marriages rachel feels trapped and decides austin's mean streets offer more promise the book intermittently chronicles rachel's later known as rose descent into street life and prostitution while beth sits at home in austin drinking and praying pete roams the northwest looking for his daughter constantly crossing paths with the pearl family finally pete who has a drinking problem of his own becomes victim of his attempts to salvage lives he finds impossible to rehabilitate and ends up the subject of a manhunt henderson resolves nothing in fourth of july creek and this is ironically his project in a sense he's the literary child of steinbeck and cormac mccarthy bent on showing us a naked view of down and out people especially their children in a world that would just as well be rid of them henderson's book reads randomly as if written in bouts of inspiration that aren't necessarily connected his prose careens to the edges of coherence at times making this a somewhat difficult read i've learned though that such flaws aren't to be taken too seriously this book's strength is in the characters henderson's spotlight on people who belong to the night to the woods that have been forsaken by society and that makes this one of the most powerful books you'll read this year my rating 16 of 20 stars","470":"i was blown away by this book i finished it in 3 days it was engrossing but also depressing made me feel like the mother of the year","471":"about 2 3 through i started to lose interest but it picked back up good things i had to look up a lot of words which got me wondering where did this author go to school that he is able to drop these words into his writing as though he uses them all the time in conversation an interesting touch some chapters just a couple of pages long are written in a q u0026amp a format we don't know who is asking the questions","472":" this is an incredibly well put together novel that makes you believe you've been waiting your whole life for a novel about a kamikaze social worker in rural montana in 1980 the writing is crisp and propulsive the dialogue sharp and the narrative has a kind of rock bottom compassion for its characters that makes even their worst excesses compelling my only caveat warning is that henderson does a lot better with male characters than female who tend to get the blame for things otherwise highly recommended","473":"this was a well crafted book but contained a lot of ugliness in plot and theme which kept me from truly enjoying it i'm usually a fan of darker themes but only if this illumines insightful moments as well and i don't feel that this ever really got there","474":"i just finished and i can't decide how i feel maybe in a few days i will have a more fully formed opinion it's definitely the kind of book that needs time after","475":"i just never found myself hooked into this novel storylines or characters with the exception of jeremiah and ben pearl i hated pete throughout fairly strongly what a total selfish jerk of a guy i'm a little surprised others felt he's overall a good guy as i don't feel this way the excellent writing lured me in enough to keep me reading but overall the book fell short for me","476":"this book is set in montana the social worker pete snow and his job show the gritty side of life his agony over a lost marriage and daughter and his wanting to make things right for the people he's sent to help","477":" a gritty heartbreaking book about a social worker's struggles in piecing together the lives of others while his own is falling apart the weighty depressing aspects are highlighted and offset by beautiful writing definitely rated r but i haven't ever read a book like this that splits open the depths of human experience and so painfully describes this broken world yet still with hope the leaves like shuddering lids of tin and razors of lightning and how could anything be okay in all this the world is a blade and dread is hope cut open and spread inside out","478":" it is possible that i tossed this book into my to read list because of the author's head shot head shot aside it's a really fantastic book one of my favorite novels of the year everything revolves around a social worker in montana in the early 1980's the way the story unfolds is so effortless and so organic free of irritating devices outrageous plot twists contrivance of any kind i've never read a novel in which the author treats every character's storyline as a mystery and i love the approach it's intense gritty and challenging i had a hard time putting the book down so i guess you could call it a page turner of sorts but not an urgent kind of page turner i was so invested in these characters and really wanted to know what came next redemption or pain character driven page turner different from plot driven page turner if you like books with good guys and bad guys and neat endings finished with a pretty bow i don't think this is for you how henderson ends up justifying the most radical character's position having us say yeah i can see that perspective that is talent","479":"loved the writing and the beginning but what happened to all the women redemption for all the man and the women are either abandoned bonkers or doomed","480":" 0 stars did not finishlife is too short to waste on this book this book is seriously horrible which is surprising because it is getting rave reviews perhaps other people can suffer through it but there is so much sexual molestation physical abuse and general neglect of children that i can't even read it without feeling like i am going to be sick no thank you i actually made it to almost page 200 before giving up i thought there would be more about this boy and his family the pearls who live in the woods of montana in forest owned by the timber company and generally eschew the government it had potential i was interested enough to deal with the general neglect of the boy instead we got a brief glimpse of that and the rest has been focused on a teenager named cecil who is raped by his own mom sexually assaults dogs and gets drunk by inserting alcohol in ways i have never even heard of through his anus his social work pete the main character of the story is an alcoholic a$$hole who can't even control his own life this book is not worth my time now i am off to read a nora roberts in hopes that this feeling of wanting to vomit goes away soon","481":"interesting characters and situation not so much to keep my interest","482":"wow the writing is beautiful with a thoughtful and disturbing and profile of a remote montana social worker pete snow and the children he serves it is a dark gritty profile of people that are broken and the world they live in there is a sensitive portray of the characters and their demons drugs abuse poverty politics mental illness and just plain bad luck this one will stay with you for a while i found it hard to believe this was a first novel","483":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is definitely not a feel good book though it wasn't advertised to be i kept turning pages because i was waiting for pete to learn what we already knew about jeremiah's family what i think pete knew in his heart but couldn't process otherwise i kept turning pages because i wanted pete to sober up and be a better dad and a better social worker and i don't mean being a better social worker by totally playing by the rules i cheered when he let cecil go it's hard to remember it's set in this is definitely not a feel good book though it wasn't advertised to be i kept turning pages because i was waiting for pete to learn what we already knew about jeremiah's family what i think pete knew in his heart but couldn't process otherwise i kept turning pages because i wanted pete to sober up and be a better dad and a better social worker and i don't mean being a better social worker by totally playing by the rules i cheered when he let cecil go it's hard to remember it's set in the early 80's and can be frustrating every time pete goes chasing after rachel speaking of rachel i thought her part of the book could have been done differently overall a worthwhile read but stay away if you absolutely can't stomach reading about child abuse more","484":"this novel simply overwhelmed me the only coherent thought i had upon finishing it after about the 2 3 point i couldn't put it down again was holy su0026amp t i'm a bit biased i know these places and these people very very well i acknowledge that the authenticity in the portrayal of these folks especially those around the margins of the novel certainly caused me to buy in in a way that someone unfamiliar with the areas might not so easily that said given all of the reviews i don't think my reaction is idiosyncratic i don't know that i can offer any meaningful reflection that hasn't already been said i can only say that i haven't been as impressed with a new writer in well maybe ever missoula should just go ahead and rename the public library smith henderson library now","485":"wow i really loved this book but truth he told it is not for the faint of heart for those friends who tell me they don't want to read anything depressing you may want to steer clear however i found pete the flawed protagonist to be such a compelling character and the story so moving that i couldn't out this one down read it","486":"incredibly written debut about a social worker in montana during the 1980's an emotional and gritty account of the american experience the author relates how pete snow strives to patch broken families while his own disintegrates into shambles plot driven and character driven this novel is simply brilliant","487":"did not like this book very dysfunctional so dysfunctional that i kept reading i never felt compassion for the main character until the very last chapters and then the last line was the hook you gotta believe you can't just go through life acting like there are answers to every","488":" this book is long but somehow i was still sad to turn the last page the story of a social worker with a good heart and a mess of a personal life is gorgeous totally realized and riveting when the main character finds a young boy with terrible family secrets living in the woods with his survivalist totally unhinged dad he has to decide how far he is willing to go to help him the answer is pretty damn far this book was a fascinating exploration of redemption child exploitation backwoods justice reagan politics small town politics and addiction great work highly recommend","489":"for once all those superlatives that publishers use to hype their books and which are so casually bounced around thus becoming meaningless here actually apply this is an amazingly confident and accomplished debut novel stunning masterful mesmerising a triumph - you can add some of your own and they'd be just as apposite i finished this today the 31st december and what a fantastic book to end 2014 with certainly one of my year's reading highlights and one that has made a deep impression on me it centres on pete snow a social worker in the depths of montana whose case load is almost unimaginably difficult it's a bleak and cruel world that he lives in full of dysfunctional families - and i mean really dysfunctional - a world of abuse of all kinds drugs alcohol as well as child abuse poverty violence and despair nobody comes out ahead and that includes pete himself whose own personal life is as messed up as most of his clients it's a raw and visceral account of a hardscrabble existence that is both shocking and deeply moving henderson is a writer of enormous power and this is indeed a great book","490":"far too gritty for me i couldn't finish it","491":" i straight up loved this book pete snow is a social worker in rural montana in the early 1980s struggling to do right by his messed up clients especially the kids his work is all kinds of rough as you might expect in a region with low incomes and minimal infrastructure and pete's own life is no cake walk he took the job in remote tenmile in part to escape his failed marriage and fractious family he's not perfect but he's trying hard things kick into gear when he encounters benjamin pearl a semi feral eleven year old kid who turns up in a public school out of nowhere pearl lives in the montana wilderness with his father jeremiah an old testament conspiracy theorist and general end of the worlder pete gets gradually caught up in their lives as he tries to help them out and starts to come across signs that jeremiah may be more dangerous and complicated than he seems this is a fairly long book over 400 pages but i raced through it i read it the way i eat mu0026amp ms but without the stress on my pancreas henderson's style reminds me of annie proulx in particular the shipping news he can be terse and he sometimes dispenses with his articles and pronouns but he's more cormac mccarthy than hemingway describing the frigid unforgiving yaak valley wilderness and the hardscrabble people who live around it his sentences are like volleys of punches direct vivid and resounding it's also clear that he knows this world its dive bars and logging roads meth heads and ranchers and hard worn waitresses extremely possibly regrettably well there's a strong plot here to go along with the great writing events concatenate without quarter either for pete or the reader in another book this might start to feel like one damn thing after another but henderson's writing is so solid and his handling of consequences so good that the fictional dream almost never fractures only at the very climax did i question any of his plot points and by that time it didn't matter i was sold this is a smart book with heart a character based literary novel with a solid plot and a glimpse into a world that's probably foreign to most readers but still populated by people whose triumphs and failings feel important and real i loved it without reservation i can't recommend it enough and i hope henderson publishes more soon so that i can read whatever's next now there's a blurb","492":"smith henderson does for rural montana what ron rash and wiley cash do for appalachia hard to believe this is his first novel his characters lead hard lives shaped by poverty and circumstance adults making poor decisions that cost their children's innocence and threaten their lives pete snow is a flawed but good man a social worker doing the best he can to help damaged children and their desperate parents even when he sidesteps the law he has our sympathy yes he's an alchoholic who fails his own wife and daughter but he tries to find the best in his clients and goes far above and beyond to help those he serves it is henderson's talent that a book as grim as this one oddly enough kindles a bit of hope henderson's writing is beautifully poetic he uses arcane words in an innovative way that is particularly effective in showing the beauty of places others have quoted enough of these passages suffice it to say he has an appreciation for the wild countryside and those who strive simply to live within it this book was a kindle daily deal for $1 99 i hadn't heard of the author or the title but the description and kindle reviews caught my eye and ron charles' goodreads review sealed the deal i'm glad i was lucky enough to stumble upon this treasure highly recommend","493":" at first i wasn't too sure about this book the writing is jagged and harsh and is a bit overworked until you get into it once you do it's gets inside your head and makes the story and characters unforgettable pete snow is a caring social worker who gets caught up in a sh storm when he tries to help benjamin pearl a feral dirty scared 11 yr old taking benjamin home a camp high up in the montana mountains he meets and befriends his father jeremiah jeremiah is an armed paranoid survivalist convinced the whole world is wicked and about to meet it's maker while dealing with this and his other cases his 14 yr old daughter runs away from her mother and is living on the streets her pov and whoever she's talking to i think it's the reader is gripping after i got into the feel of his writing i couldn't stop thinking about the pearl's or pete for that matter really good although none of them are good people characters and settings","494":"montana in the 1980's wow i struggled to read the book so when the library ebook went away on my computer i wanted to know the end so finished it with the audiobook","495":" when i decided to read fourth of july creek i did it mostly because 1 it's summer and this seemed like it could be summery turns out not really and 2 i was pretty sure it would help with a challenge i didn't have a ton of expectations going in and as i started reading i had mixed feelings the writing style wasn't my favorite it was a little disjointed and definitely felt like it was from the main character's pov the writing never drew me in but the different parts of the story did keep me reading the ending was to me both very good and very frustrating it was probably the most memorable part of the book so stick with it if you've started i'm not sure i can say i really liked this book mostly because of the writing and mostly unlikable characters but i didn't exactly dislike it either it falls solidly in my meh camp it wasn't really my favorite but i can see how it could work for someone else i'm giving it 3 stars because i did like many parts of the story itself even if the writing style wasn't my particular cup of tea","496":"sometimes i rate a book highly because the plot is so much fun and is riveting while the plot certainly isn't slow this is not that book the plot goes from bad to worse and nobody makes a single good decision i hung on to every word waiting for things to turn around for pete to turn out to be the responsible one additionally the writing is exquisite i hope i don't forget rachel rose's wyoming concept","497":"so gorgeously written i couldn't put it down not because of the story which is actually quite gruesome but because of the quality of the writing","498":"i just finished this some ten minutes ago need some time to compose my thoughts i mentioned previously that i was re editing my ratings and saving my 5 stars for books that blew my brains out this is a five star","499":"this book was a suuuuuuper slow start for me i didn't start really enjoying it until i was at least halfway through it typically when books are like that i consider them to be too long and think they could use some serious cutting down but i don't think that's the case with this one everything that seemed slow to me served a purpose in the end to build characters to illustrate the mundane to build suspense i like how the pearls bring a post apocalyptic element to this story set in a different time period because i think most post apocalyptic stories are set in the current year or the future i love all the characters and found them all to be extremely well developed i loved the ending too though most people might not towards the end it started reading like a literature y thriller which i absolutely loved since i find thrillers a bit predictable and lacking in good writing and character development i think this book would make a great movie the only thing i didn't really love were the chapters that were written in question form i just didn't really think that format added to the story","500":"just ok good story didn't like the writing style","501":" closer to a 3 5 on one hand this pseudo mystery involving a montana cps worker who gets in way too deep into a case has its moments of really interesting and fascinating scenes on the other it gets almost too deep into its own self and it ends up dragging down the whole thing as a result i don't have a lot to say about this and i wish i did it's well regarded for a lot of reasons perhaps its nontraditional narrative i found it to be more of a turnoff than anything else but that's just me but i don't know if i expected something different or just something more either way it didn't grab me in a way people who enjoy mysteries or more modern contemporary fiction might","502":"there are so many plot lines and themes running through this book which make it seem a bit disjointed however that's perfect for telling pete snow's story i didn't want the book to end this could be the first book in a long time that i quickly read again","503":" there is so much happening in this book and that's the problem i had with it henderson is a terrific writer painting a vivid picture of montana's wildness and wilderness but there are too many story lines weaving throughout the novel and muddying the main one the story of benjamin and jeremiah pearl and social worker pete snow' s efforts to help them got tangled in the stories of snow's daughter and ex wife snow's own alcoholism and other cases i needed more of the pearls and more fleshing out of snow i also felt the novel was too long i don't mind long novels per se but only if the story merits that length all that said this was a very enjoyable read there were times when i didn't want to put it down because i just had to find out what happened next","504":"a cormac mccarthy esque scene y meditation on freedom parenthood and america set in rural montana and elsewhere in the early '80s of a time and yet completely relevant now survivalists runaways wonderful prose and a pair of mysteries that unfurl with care and deliver with resonance","505":"i read the blurb on this book then saw most of the reviews were 4 or 5 stars so i couldn't wait to get stuck in but i don't know why but this book just didn't do it for me i couldn't get caught up on any of the characters and to be honest the story didn't grip me it just kind of 'floated' along","506":"i can't say enough good things about this stunning and powerful book just read it your heart will break many many times","507":"a big book but a fast read because it's so darn good disturbing and moving eye opening didn't want to put it down","508":" wow this is going to be a hard review to write for a first novel it is a masterpiece the story takes place in a small town in montana the main character is pete who works for dcf pete is an alcoholic who has just divorced his wife for infidelity and has moved to a really small town which keeps him busy with so many disadvantaged and mistreated children one day he meets benjamin pearl whose father is anti government and thinks the world is ending and constantly on the run the book is said to be an exploration of the complexities of freedom community grace suspicion and anarchy it would make a great movie","509":"brutally beautiful","510":"i really had mixed feelings on this book the writing style was so good but it was overly long i eventually just wanted to be done with it i don't mind a good dark book but this one just got grim","511":"heartfelt intense compelling u0026amp complex i love it","512":"having already received the pen emerging writers award and the pushcart prize for his short fiction don't be surprised if henderson's debut novel walks off with lots of major year end literary awards since it is firmly entrenched in what for better or ill constitutes the american conscience it really should be a shoe in for the pulitzer","513":"depressing as hell but still amazing my favorite book of 2014 so far","514":"470 pages following a host of unlikeable characters i can't believe i finished it","515":"where to start with this magnificent novel i tore through it i couldn't put it down it knocked me sideways the writing is superb henderson's command of language is masterful the plot is fully realized and the characters are multi dimensional and alive to the reader i was immersed in pete's world and life from the very first page henderson has a keen eye for detail seemingly throwaway sentences returned to me as i got further into the novel and discovered the connections that were being made barely hinted at by what at first reading appeared to be stray scraps of prose it becomes clear that each of those sentences serves a purpose it is one of the great strengths of this book that outside of the thread of rachel's story the reader makes discoveries at the same time as pete nothing is revealed to the reader before pete learns it and this technique gives the book much of its immediacy and tension fourth of july creek is an intense reading experience it is dark powerful and simply stunning it will stay with me for a very long time","516":"best book i have read this summer well developed characters and story highly recommend this book","517":" a slow painful trudge through the wilderness of the author's social commentary complete with switchbacks uphill trails leading to nowhere and unwitting contact with indigenous impedimenta that leaves you itchy and uncomfortable for days some of the verbal vistas were poetically breathtaking making you feel at times like the journey might be worthwhile but at the end you're just worn out and realize that those few payoffs didn't justify the arduous distance traveled i'm clearly in the minority here and i'll give props for fantastic imagery that elicited emotional reactions but overall i really disliked the book and the main character","518":" wow this book is dark disturbing and in my opinion beautifully written this author is a real craftsman and he 's captured a raw essence of flawed and very human characters and a country full of wildness and the complexity of government libertarianism paranoia and religious insanity i keep wanting to reread parts of this book turning the words over and over in my mind sitting uncomfortably with the paradoxes while relishing the beauty of how the words hang together the poetry of the words this is northwestern montana and i live in montana but not the extreme northwest not the yaak those parts of montana and idaho are still havens for fringe people and smith henderson depicts this truthfully as someone who knows it my first husband during the 1970's when this book begins was actually a social worker in western montana and while the story depicted is extreme it rings true this is shades of randy weaver ruby ridge and hayden lake all disturbingly familiar good people very messed up what a read wow","519":"loved this bookone of the best books i've read in a long time definitely deserved it's spot on the best of 2014 book lists","520":"here is another unbelievable first novel exquisitely written full of emotion not to mention despair yet with a sense of hope however hidden not many firsts have such power are so well put together are so compelling can we compare maybe 'cold mountain' comes to mind as does 'american rust' and for me years and years ago 'setting free the bears' as well a 'v' that's some fine company and fojc belongs right there if not at the top of the list i had my local library order a copy an after returning it earlier today i had second thoughts as i'd just as soon start all over at page one again you don't need me to retell the story here you just need to get your hands on a copy and read it for yourself soon","521":"wonderful book i didnt want it to end love the characters despite their flaws i highly recommend and can't wait for his next novel","522":"one of the truly great american novels the best book i've read in a very long time the characters are flawed and damaged and absolutely true to life if i was going to write a book this is the book i'd want to write","523":" i listened to the eaudio version this is a gritty novel that provides a bleak and unflinching portrait of social work the foster system teen runaways and conspiracy theorists anarchists it's easy to recoil at the descriptions and lives of the characters but i loved how henderson's writing had me facing my disgust and shock without pulling back main character pete snow has a lot to do with this the things he deals with not just in other people's lives but very much in his own as well he handles with an odd sort of grace it's not pretty but you do see the humanity that still exists in all the characters in spite of what life has wrought on them i also appreciated how the story was set around 1980 carter reagan election mt st helens but is timeless macleod andrews and jenna lamia narrators of the audio version are fantastic both imbue the story with much more characterization than i could have imagined had i read it instead i did get confused however the first few times lamia's voice began the change over was abrupt and without the visual cue provided by the typed page i at first thought the eaudio had skipped ahead by accident i soon figured it out however and looked forward to those interviews which sounded to me like a father daughter exchange","524":"not a light read lots of characters and intertwining story lines","525":"everything i want out of novel and more i can't wait to see what henderson does next","526":"i particularly enjoyed this as someone who worked as a social service provider in a rural area the characters resonated in a disturbingly familiar way","527":" fourth of july creek does a terrific job of depicting a small town containing a cast of characters who allow their demons to define their actions throughout the novel i find myself facing mixed feelings regarding pete a social worker dealing with atrocious child and custody situations while having his own slue of family issues at times i want to shake pete for not trying harder and others pity him for still trying at all my biggest issue with this novel is the author's transitions between descriptive text and active voice the nonchalance descriptions and text surrounding big moments tend to get lost on the page i found myself having to re read what i had just read to confirm what was actually happening it didn't help that the author chose not to use quotations when characters were speaking making it rather difficult to tell if they were speaking out loud or thinking within themselves my interest began waning throughout the mid section of this novel my peaks of interest came around the mysterious jeremiah pearl and his radical tendencies the sub plot with rachel rose pete's daughter felt more like filler i initially appreciated the idea of writing the sub plot with a question and answer format to differentiate itself from the main story eventually the questions became so long and descriptive the format started to fail in opinion it's as if the decision to format the sub plot in that way was made before the importance of the sub plot was thoroughly defined there was a small one page caption towards the end of the book that appeared visually to be a rachel chapter but it turned out to be an unknown narrative about pearl i had to read through this passage a couple of times to figure out who the narrator was and what in the world they were talking about the last 50 pages transformed the novel into a psychological thriller many of the things i felt that were missing up until this point were suddenly there it's a shame the same excitement i had for the last 50 pages didn't span the entire book this is a dark and heavy read but somehow still refreshing in its style at parts i would be interested in seeing what this author comes up with next","528":"good but definitely has some parts that are uncomfortable to read i would give it a 3 5","529":"i did not like this book it was well written but the story was extremely depressing","530":" if social work is anything like it is portrayed in this work of fiction then it has to be one of the worst jobs on the planet the book was fascinating but also horrific and depressing we know that terrible things happen in the world and this story brings some of that misery craziness and awfulness to the surface i liked that the protagonist was flawed but he must have been super human to withstand the emotional stress the violence the constant encounters with misery in his personal life as well as the insanity of dealing with sick and demented people and their vulnerable sometimes damaged offspring in his job having no personal boundaries makes you more empathic but also more susceptible to pain so a good but disturbing read probably not for everyone but maybe interesting to people who have an interest in the edges of the social fabric for me it was unsettling and about as upsetting as they come as an intrepid reader one sometimes has to face the awfulness to realize goodness in that way i think i found a lot of value here","531":" apparently i am one of the few that did not like this book i found it frustrating with too many plots going on that had nothing to do with the central story i realized that they seemed to be parallels but they just didn't fit in well there were too many narrators and i couldn't stand the main character most of his background was in the book and i still found him flat as with the other side characters as well i did enjoy finding out what really happened to the pearl family even though it was extremely twisted i loved it but as much as i wanted to like this one i just didn't","532":" ended too quickly disproportionate to the rest of the book like i get that lack of closure was supposed to be the closure but some things were entirely left out and forgotten ex mary jeremiah's doomsday anyway this is the exact type of story you'd expect from someone with the first name smith all beards and glasses and vague themes of fuck the man still i really enjoyed it its like hick lit for people who dont like hick litedit the more i think about this book the more i realize how poorly written it was but i still really liked reading it so im keeping the rating","533":"yikes why does smith henderson hate women so much all the female characters are prostitutes addicts or homicidal all of them cause otherwise decent men to do bad things i barely hung on to finish this","534":"believe the hype this novel tells all the truth possible at 470 pages hardcover it was too short i turned the last page and felt changed punched in the guts ruined yet hopeful this is grandiose and subtle at the same time a beautiful horrible devastating novel i loved it thank you for writing it mr henderson i will read everything you ever write","535":"i look forward to any new works by this guy super cinematic","536":" smith henderson asks us to do an awful lot of heavy lifting in this challenging yet rewarding novel there are so many characters to care about so many broken hearts so many damaged souls but we get caught up in the story of pete snow and his family and clients and we do just that we care and we keep caring long after the final page is turned i will think about rachel and cecil and pete benjamin and jeremiah for a long time i'll wonder what they are up to where there wanderings have taken them and if they are okay because smith henderson makes you believe these characters are real and he makes you root for them in spite of the troubles they bring upon themselves","537":" book #22 of 2016almost halfway through my goal of 50 books this year and i am thinking i should have set a slightly more lofty goal i wanted to read fourth of july creek because it had been a while since i had read one of the gritty mysteries that i so often love i was disappointed at the outset the pace starts out fairly slow and for a little bit our protagonist pete seems a bit too cookie cutter no worries though once his flaws shine through it becomes almost difficult to root for him the poverty that all of the characters in this novel deal with is harrowing and realistic it's never exciting in fact it is mostly tedious that reality gives this story traction of course i was reeled into this book because it mentioned a doomsday believer living up in the woods and i thought that this aspect was also dealt with appropriately while it was clear that jeremiah's beliefs had no basis in fact he never came off as completely unreasonable or a caricature he was just as real as the other characters and as a reader i definitely felt for him the writing style was interesting especially with rachel's story line told through some sort of interviewing style i personally thought that there were many ways to interpret who the interviewer was at first i thought that she was just questioning herself and having a conversation in her head but by the end i wondered if this was supposed to be a conversation that we the readers were having with her i like that interpretation better because it reminds you that the events of this story are somebody's reality fourth of july creek was an interesting read but not one that i dashed through however i wouldn't recommend dragging this one out either it would be easy to get lost in the intricacies of each character","538":"i wandered past this book at my local library and recognized the title as one i've heard good things about so tucked it into my book stack and brought it home with me and dang good things indeed this book pulled me in fast and kept me there and i'm still trying to pinpoint exactly why the cadence of the sentences and the voice these are definitely part of it also the twists is the wrong word unfolding the unfolding of pete's story the stories of the people around him and the way these revealed layers intersect and play off each other this i think is the heart of this book's magic let's get tangible for a minute or two i'll try to nutshell this pete is a social worker in a small town in montana in the late 1970s early 1980s we get to see him interacting with the kids he's trying to help with varying degrees of success and failure at the same time we watch him struggle with his own family dramas and personal upheavals and make new connections that are imperfect and sometimes surprising and never quite redemptive much of the novel is told from a third person pov that mostly hovers very close to pete although a couple of chapters follow one of the kids he works with there are exceptions to this pov though several chapters or just parts of chapters are in second person there must be a thread that ties these together there is an introspection to these bits but i feel like i'm missing some intersections here there are also a sprinkling of chapters that are significantly different both in structure and in voice these chapters are presented as interviews with no context or setup and the person being interviewed is pete's daughter that might be as tangible as i can get without divulging bits that could taint the experience of the reading itself but here's one more thing another thing that hooked me every single character in this book is some part asshole there is no good guy although there is also no bad guy there are a lot of complicated humans wandering around on these pages they are selfish they make shitty decisions and treat each other terribly and try to do the right thing and love the hell out of each other but get the gestures all wrong i dig this about all of them a couple of quotes to get a sense for the voice and sentences because damn they're so good this is the opening paragraph the cop flicked his cigarette to the dirt and gravel road in front of the house and touched back his hat over his hairline as the social worker drove up in a dusty toyota corolla through the dirty window he spotted some blond hair falling and he hiked in his gut hoping that the woman in there would be something to have a look at which is to say he did not expect what got out a guy in his late twenties maybe thirty pulling on a denim coat against the cold morning air blowing down the mountain ducking back into the car for a moment reemerging with paperwork his brown corduroy pants faded out over his skinny ass the knees too he pulled that long hair behind his ears with his free hand and sauntered over boom voice setting time character and the beginning of plot a cop needed to wait at this house for a social worker why delivered so quickly in a smooth and tidy package i felt immediately validated in my choice to bump this book to the top of my reading list i didn't mark specific passages library book meet english teacher but these are from me randomly opening to two different pages and what could be more magical more alchemical than a soft yellow metal that derives from itself currencies and wars and then more complicated magics like markets and exchanges loans interest compound interest mortgages credit cards lotteries futures bonds derivatives short stocks all manner of financial spells burgeoning out in ever increasing complexity and intricacy like a heathen mandala all of it originating in a substance that has no physical application save as a symbol of itself in coin or bar then he starts in about tulips spring come march 1981 a spell of warm weather set the snow melting everything dripping water running under the ice the ice white and slick as enamel re opening these pages makes me want to read this all over again but alas today is the day it goes back to the library for someone else to discover if you happen to wander past it on a shelf i highly recommend picking it up","539":"i'm not entirely convinced that it's time to break out the anointing oil but fourth of july creek is a fine novel yet one that won't be for everyone you can read plenty of other reviews and in fairness you should read both the positive and negative ones then pick up the book and decide for yourself a heavy hitting unflinching frequently disturbing but ultimately unforgettable novel","540":"great setting such human characters and although set more than 30 years ago nothing much has changed in the sad foster care setting distressing disturbing but an impelling read the audio is great","541":"i wanted to like this one i did but it was a struggle it's depressing beyond belief and the story jumped between several different characters with no clear trajectory","542":"smith henderson's debut novel proves that he's certainly a remarkable wordsmith even when i wasn't tracking with fully invested in the unfolding plot i flew through the rich text with pleasure","543":"very dark u0026amp depressing characters doing illegal u0026amp immoral things even after they condemn someone else for doing the same thing very scarey to think of this individual in charge of children's welfare","544":"if you seek a book about nutters living in the wilderness and their intersecting fates with ordinary people i would recommend mr splitfoot if given the choice between the two works","545":" it is said that every lamp has darkness under itself the central character pete personifies this saying he works for the department of family services but is unable to give that same attention and care that he gives dead end families to his own wife and daughter it is easier to guide others and take decisions for them and enforce them but when the ball lands in your court there is a sense of disbelief and horror pete's moral dilemma is pitiful there are interwoven narratives of other dysfunctional persons mainly an anarchist pearl and his son ben the book is astounding and mesmerizing in terms of its language its characterisations its story some of the parts are so personal and intimate in nature that i felt like an intruder with a voyeuristic streak simply amazing and satisfying my words are trivial as the book is meant to be devoured by lovers of literature and people who like holding their breath till the book ends it is also true that there is light at the end of the tunnel and yes we get to see it","546":"what is it with recent books that rely on subplots involving child sexual abuse is this what it takes these days to be hard hitting shattering gritty i was intrigued to read this book as it was described in reviews including goodreads' review focusing on the paranoid survivalist family and the social worker who tries to reach them but i was not prepared for every subplot to center around abuse and addiction it was too much and i couldn't continue even to find out more about the pearl family too depressing that said the writing is superb i like an author who uses words i don't know","547":"amazing descriptive unique writing and story highly recommend","548":" more of a 3 5 because although it took well over 100 pages before it pulled me in the themes of this book have been spinning around in my head ever since i finished it fourth of july creek presents in a raw crass shockingly rough manner many major issues in our country today i think of the medical adage first do no harm and i think of the thoreau quote which opens the book if i knew for a certain'ty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for me life and i think of our government's involvement in private lives and i cringe this book journeys into a very dark underworld in the rural pacific northwest i have read many stories set in the realm of the city underground the arenas mafia machismo and sordid street crime i have read much set in the south usually depicting racial tension and poverty this is the first true taste i have had of this particular version of american underbelly there is rock bottom alcoholism and intensely neglectful patenting there is physical conflict to an extreme child abuse and sexual abuse abound rigid racism and religious extremism crossed with an end of days survivalism permeate the pages this book presents child prostitution child runaways and ferrel wilderness survival as if it is almost an expected outcome of living in a small rural community in this part of the world there is a true mistrust of government agencies and their agents there is a look at the distorted version of justice those in power have succumbed to there is a sense that the world itself is evil and crumbling and barely survivable this is a hard read it is confusing in style and voice to say the least but it is also shocking and shaming and discouraging it is dark and depressing and painful it is uncomfortable but it does force some serious human rights issues to the surface and then it flays them fully so a reader has no choice but to view the tangled web of layers beneath","549":"henderson brings lots of linguistic horsepower while a barn burning and suspense driven plot brouht back the fun feeling of high school days reading john grisham and nelson demille","550":"3 5 stars the man can write no doubt but this book should have been 1 3 of its length sometimes too much description is just too much","551":"there's nothing to say about this book well actually there is too much to say about it just read it holy wow","552":"this book got great reviews but i missed the hype i thought it was slow and sad","553":"i read a lot but smith henderson's writing style is like nothing i have ever read his voice is extremely unique and gripping climbing into the mind of the characters the story is horrific and at times i didn't want to read anymore because things just keep getting worse it takes you to some deep dark places and tears at you from start to finish bravo mr henderson","554":"gritty shattering real amazing","555":" most of us easterners and this new england yankee know the west primarily through westerns on film montana is a place that in many american minds is full of empty spaces cowboys and american indians i was surprised to find there aren't many films that have been set there the best known are probably little big man legends of the fall and the recent film nebraska the protagonist in this novel is pete snow a social worker in a small town in the early 1980's pete is estranged from his wife who lives with their teenaged daughter in billings the states largest city and his brother is on parole pete grew up in a dysfunctional family and drinks too much this was the era before meth production and addiction took over many small rural towns but families are poor and many struggle with drugs and alcohol pete's case load at times overwhelms him because of the lack of resources both personal and in his office and the large territory he is responsible for pete and his own family should have their own case worker early in the novel pete encounters a young boy who emerges from the woods and is discovered in the yard of a local school the boy is malnourished and poorly dressed he lives in the forest and up the mountain with his family pete decides to bring the boy benjamin back to his family and so begins a saga that almost spirals out of control and brings pete to the brink of disaster the family are separatists and religious fundamentalists who see the government as their enemy their beliefs lead to tragedy this novel creates an atmosphere that conveys a portrayal of a time the early 80's and a place montana the lyricism of the language stands in sharp contrast with the despair of the lives it portrays an outstanding read especially for anyone interested in american life especially in the west","556":" this book is about more than a social worker finding and helping some kid in the woods it goes all over the place sometimes a little more than just depressing and a lot of character who just appear out of nowhere so i kept turning back pages and saying what lots of stories left unanswered literally the book doesn't end could be left open for sequel or maybe the author's point at the end life goes on i have to say it kept my interest and overall i enjoyed it but i will be loaning it out with a warning sticker this book is","557":"i felt disoriented the whole time i read this the writing was very choppy and i couldn't warm up to it at the end of each chapter there was an interview the novel got into gritty subject matter which i didn't mind at all but i just couldn't deal with its choppiness others might have that same problem or they might not characters were okay but difficult to know other than pete this is one that the majority of readers have rated far better than i did you might agree with them so if the synopsis interests you give it a try","558":"read this book it's pete dexter meets cormac mccarthy meets denis johnson it's worthy of a cohen brothers adaptation smith henderson is a force to be reckoned with","559":"\"he was frightened for her and what was about to happen to her and felt the fullest burden of the fact that he was indeed a thing that had happened to her too and was happening to her yet and would be for a long time to come \"pete snow is a good man despite that fact he is in the vortex of a tornado those close to him are flung far and wide battered and bruised by the briefest of contact his relationship to his larger than life father is nearly nonexistent when his father dies he learns of it when people start offering him condolences his brother has recently whacked the crap out of his parole officer and is on the lam his wife sleeps with someone purposeful with the intent of watching pete walk out the door his daughter is on the verge of womanhood with a slutty mother as a role model and a father more interested in saving other people's kids than his own it is tragic to watch a man who wants to do so much good creating so much havoc there is also cecil a teenager pete is trying to help out of a bad situation but ends up lying to him in the course of trying to help him pete persuaded him to trust him no easy task and then threw it all away at the very moment he had a chance to save him sometimes we get expeditious when we need to slow down we need to take the time to convince rather than be deceitful unfortunately life just throws too much crap through the fan for us to always do the right thing we make mistakes and then there is pearl and his son benjamin when benjamin stumbles into town undernourished and in tattered clothes pete has a kid where the needs are so obvious even he can't screw it up or can he let's circle back around to the wife beth \"the loose beauty about her the way her smile cracked across her face her wide lopsided curls rigged into a bun that seemed liable to topple down reminded him of a tooth about to come out a button about to fall off everything about her always on the verge of falling down or out made a body want to screw her heart out even now even after she'd cheated on him and even though it still hurt like a purple bruise he could see falling into bed with her just a look at her the beer eyebrow cocked her condescending grin she said his name plain even that ached \" beth is the type of woman a man wants to be in the backseat with beer breath making a plume every time tongues touch rollicking down country roads hearing the gravel pinging in the wheel wells and your heart beating like a loose ball bearing in your chest \"the whole backseat a rolling cart of near to fuck \" she will make you forget yourself stomping on your compass in the process she will knock your center askew permanently from true north she will make you batshit crazy pete's not that dissimilar maybe just the male version he still goes out with buddies when he needs to forget gets drunk ends up with women he wouldn't give a second look to if he were sober his father was a force of nature in the county ruling without holding office and casting an umbrella of protection around his sons that evaporates the moment he breathes his last there is a whiff of landed gentry about pete even though he tries his best to cast off any association with his own name he expects women to want to sleep with him and generally they do as a social worker doors open for him that may have as much to do with his last name as it does with his own persistence he denies who he is and yet he can't be who he is without the father he had one of those conundrums most of us have them to varying degrees his wife moves to texas taking their daughter rachel with them pete is too passive letting it all happen it is only after they are truly gone that he starts to get an inkling of what he just gave up his wife moves in with a trucker anybody ever heard of the expression ass grass or gas nobody rides for free well i'll let you decide which one beth provides the problem is rachel is blossoming just turned fourteen and the revolving door of men that come through the house start to pay more attention to her than they do to beth rachel feels the power she also knows something critically important about her mom \"because her mother's heart was wyoming it was wyoming hard and she was days and years and maybe forever from a good man \"pete picks up with mary a fellow social worker and product of the system she spent most of her life in foster care and bears the scars...\"he reached across the table and got her wrist a pair of hairline scars there too he rubbed the groove they made he didn't think at all about why she'd done that it was the past \" pete is too worried about the present and not keeping an eye on the rearview mirror where the past is coming up fast if the past is not dealt with and placed in a box wrapped in ribbon and notated with lessons learned then it is still just knocking around in your brain waiting for a new place to land it all lands hard when rachel runs away from home rachel picks up with a man a boy really playing pimp with dyed black hair and a penchant for manipulations she gets busted doing something she thought was impossible to contemplate no she volunteered nothing but her name rose snow she was a whore did they get it they could put her in jail for all she cared they could go ahead and shoot her in the head for all she cared pete finds rachel rose just to lose her again he sees enough of her to see the stark reality of his own failures he ran a race with his daughter but he took too many detours and by the time he caught up with her she was past the tape and beyond him pete snow is a good man i rode in the passenger seat with him for 467 pages through the big sky country of montana to the dusty plains of texas and through the rain soaked city streets of portland i can attest to the fact that he is a good man flawed sometimes tilting at windmills but ultimately trying to make a difference protocol becomes a harness that when it is finally flung aside allows pete to finally start make a difference the pearls that i mentioned early a man and a boy bound together through the religious madness of their wife mother might be the final redemption for pete i stepped out of my office door the other day to see if in some whiskey laced moment of craziness i had hung a shingle out people come to me with their problems i dispense wit and wisdom and sometimes with smug satisfaction feel like i've actually helped people reading this book and watching pete fumble around good intentions surrounding him like the dust devil around pigpen i realize that i rely too much on logic it is a cold science right and wrong are black and white so many elements that we slice and dice away from a problem are the very things that make us human when i should be listening i'm too busy pondering resolutions before offering solutions i would be better served to offer compassion i'm not a priest social worker or a psychologist but i am a person who can help if i'm going to help i have a responsibility to make sure i do it in a way where i'm helping them more than i'm helping myself 4 5 stars out of 5 if you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews visit http www jeffreykeeten comi also have a facebook blogger page at https www facebook com jeffreykeeten","560":"one of the best books i've read this year the characters were well developed i cared and worried about each of them the world was at once intimate and grand all of the troubles the protagonist went through are the troubles that plague america and much like the auther henderson i'm optimistic that america will be ok no matter how messed up it is i never once felt bored in this book which is an accomplishment for a book of more than 450 pages even when it wasn't action packed it never felt navel gazey and although the book never prominently featured a person of color i never felt like it lacked empathy for humanity maybe because it beat up all of its characters equally henderson has done a marvelous job with his first novel i hope this only means more stellar work in his future","561":"extremely well done and very impressive","562":" freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose in fourth of july creek an unflinching look into the complexities and contradictions of liberty justice and freedom for all - montana style but first a word of caution readers who feel compelled to seek out likeable characters or who shun stories with an overriding bleak vision would be well advised to skip this book it is unrelentingly dark and full of moral ambiguity at the center of the novel is pete an unlikely long haired social worker in tenmile montana who has made a mess of marriage and fatherhood his recalcitrant brother is on the lam and he can't even count his friends on one hand he describes himself this way to his ex wife \"i take kids away from people like us \"when a pre teen partially feral boy - benjamin pearl - crosses his path he becomes involved in the lives of the boy and his mistrustful father jeremiah a paranoid survivalist who believes in the end of days and the evilness of the government \"the devil i know how he comes with cans of food and fresh clothes and coloring books \" as pete tries to help jeremiah and benjamin and another out of control boy cecil the son of an abusive mother his own daughter dives into the underbelly of an uncaring and evil world as one of the boys disappears into the system and the other into the montana wilderness the realization comes to light that \"these absences were twinned in pete's mind as if the one could not be solved without the other and he harbored the absurd hope that the revelation of the one would reveal the other \"fourth of july creek has a lot to say about a lot of issues where is the thin line between those who want to help and those who shun society's help is protection always the right thing if it means sacrificing liberty and being forced into faulty institutional venues are we - quite literally - our brothers' keepers do we have a right to legislate - or even interfere with - those who live outside of the norm even if they choose a life of paranoia the writing is confident - brilliant in places - but not for the faint of heart as an interesting aside smith henderson a debut author wrote the emmy nominated super bowl commercial \"halftime in america\" featuring clint eastwood","563":"this is the second best book that i have read this year right behind the son this was the first novel by smith henderson from the very beginning of the book i knew that i was going to love his writing he describes every detail so well that you feel like you are there and when you walk away from the book the characters and details stay with you this was a story about something most of us never want to deal with but should become more familiar with the main character is pete snow he is a social worker in montana in the 1980s basically he works for cps or a cps like organization and seems to have a good heart and wants what is best for his clients even though even he realizes the endless cycle and hopelessness of most of the kids he works with i read one review that described him as dazed by the infinite creativity of sexual abuse but blessed with the dexterity of hope he keeps struggling to make damaged families work that sums up pete snow to me what makes this whole part of his life so interesting is that he is a flawed human being himself he saves or tries to save others but he can't keep his own family together he left his wife for cheating on him and he has a bitter teenage daughter whose story is intermingled throughout the book he lives in a cabin without electricity showers at the courthouse has a brother that is wanted by the law has a drinking problem and the most poignant moment in the book to me was when he said to his wife i take kids away from people like us the story takes place mostly in a small town in montana but through his attempts to find his teenage daughter that has run away from his wife's place in texas pete finds himself in seattle on many of the streets and places that i know well his daughter 14 falls into a life of prostitution after she runs away and pete is desperate to find her throughout the book it is interrupted by a dialogue between two unknown people talking about the harrowing plight of pete's daughter the main story is about pete's most challenging case that involves an 11 year old boy who wanders down from the woods to a school playground pete was called by the school police when this happened pete had to return the boy to his home in the woods and this is where pete meets the boy's dad a survivalist named jeremiah pearl this begins a conflicted relationship between these two loving but troubled fathers both of them wanted to save their own child from the evils of the world jeremiah is ready for the tribulation and ready for a race war he begins his own war with the government by putting holes in the president's heads on coins and slipping them into the system he was a fascinating character he is highly influenced by his wife's distorted and crazy view of christianity and anti government paranoia he is obsessed with tangled biblical prophecies this is part of the dichotomy of these two fathers as pete is a godless atheist social worker works for the government our hero pete is determined to serve this family no matter what or how crazy they seem i liked that he found good in jeremiah and his son when others in our society usually write off people like this in disgust pete spends his time trying to win jeremiah's trust before he ends up dead from a confrontation with the government this book explores issues of poverty religion drugs relationships government interference all issues that can be difficult to read about but i could not put this book down and even after a week i'm still thinking about this book and thinking about the ending which i won't give away the questions that need to be answered are will pete reunite with his daughter will jeremiah survive what will happen to his son what has become of these two men's spouses great book and i look forward to smith henderson's next book","564":"an odd read still not sure about how to rate or review this book not sure the plot is actually all that interesting even though the description sounded good while i did not hate this book it was just not that memorable","565":" i was really looking forward to this book but was very disappointed the beginning was great it pulled you in with a very dramatic scene however most of the story was hard to get through it did not hold my attention this book was narrated from a couple different perspectives which turned out to be pointless and i feel played no part in moving the story along or impacted the main character in such a way that it just had to be included when there was about one hundred ages left it seemed as the story was going to pick up it got my hopes up but was a complete let down as well as the conclusion of the story","566":"i just wrote down no no i hate in my journal so i can't remember this","567":"listened to fourth of july on audio good readers which is why i finished the book the female voice reminded me of reese witherspoon in walk the line some of the scenes in the novel are far fetched stereotyped but the protagonist is well rounded the story compelling","568":"a thumping read not a part of the us those not from there will ever see or live and so unique as well as well written well plotted and very well brought to no ending thanks for this","569":"loved this book a flawed father pete who is a social worker in wyoming as well as analcoholic and separated from his wife is able to keep the job because no one else would want it he becomes entangled in the lives of desperate families and their children it is not a happy story but it is a very very good story","570":" a co worker recommended this book i checked it out on amazon i have this unfortunate habit of looking at the one star reviews to see why people don't like it what struck me was how many people didn't like it because it was too depressing perfect for me i bought it based on the strength of the one star reviews and i wasn't disappointed it is an extremely depressing story filled with characters who are messed up and dysfunctional and unhappy and barely surviving right on the edge and it's an incredible story another thing i liked was that there are multiple story lines while most of them were mostly resolved by the end some of them were left wide open i look stories that don't finish with everything wrapped up in a nice package so that's it if you like stories filled with massively screwed up people and that don't necessarily end everything nicely this is a book for you","571":"a fantastic compelling and well written book that easily deserves its 5 stars","572":"one of the better debut novels i've read in some time","573":"i read this primarily because it's set in the area where i live the geography was off and that bothered me it was a decent book but not nearly as wonderful as i had hoped","574":"didn't finish it was such a bummer","575":"choppy to read moving back and forth from locales and characters","576":" it is near impossible to review this book without giving away a piece of plot that ruins the experience so let me say this this long book will not feel log enough and will discuss it with anyone who will listen when you are done there are parts that are truly disturbing but real perhaps what people call grit but this was truly one of the best books i've read all year my heart ached in good and bad ways i am so glad i didn't judge this amazing piece of modern humanist literature by a summary that made it seem male centric and trite","577":"more 2 1 2 maybe it's just my mood but ugh i wasted time reading this","578":" i picked this up off the new books shelf because it was being reviewed heavily in the papers it didn't sound like something i would enjoy - a seriously damaged social worker dealing with horrendous family situations in montana - but i gave it a try and did appreciate the complexity and depth of the story even if few of the characters were likable one writing technique that bothered me was the constantly changing \"voice\" of the writing the chapters skipped among the story of pete snow the social worker and his runaway daughter rachel or rose her chapters were sort of like interviews but with her not there strange","579":"this book took so long for me to read i never really felt like picking it back up again as a social worker i was also a bit stunned by his lack of boundaries with the pearl's","580":"pete snow is a wonderfully complex character one of the most believable and real characters i've read recently while he is heroic in his job as a social worker saving children from their destructive parents his own daughter has run away and is arrested he battles alcohol his most intriguing case is that of the pearls 11 year old ben and his religious fanatic father who meander around the countryside as pete slowly earns their trust federal agents from the fbi and atf get involved pete slowly learns the truth about the pearls and tries desperately to save not only ben but jeremiah as well an excellent novel with wide scope and well developed characters","581":"best book i've read this summer so far","582":" pete snow is a social worker in a small town called tenmile in montana the novel opens with snow handling a messy family dispute with courage and kindness right away drugs violence ignorance and cruelty take center stage where they remain for the book's entirety pete snow seems to deal with failing families pretty well but it is not long before the reader finds out that snow's own domestic life is riddled with failure his drug taking wife has run away to texas with his daughter who doesn't like him and pete himself drinks an alarming amount soon though the narrative gets complicated pete is called regarding an almost feral boy from the mountains named benjamin the son of an angry survivalist jeremiah pearl although pete befriends the boy and his father he cannot protect them from themselves the fbi gets involved and an all american story of freedom ensues the novel is reminiscent of faulkner in some ways troubled characters inevitable conflicts beautiful subtle prose i was reminded too of cold mountain dismal tragic ultimately not without hope and profoundly true","583":"the storyline and the writing pulled me into the book it was hard to put down which was surprising with the very flawed characters great book","584":"after more consideration i'm downgrading this one to 3 stars","585":"i couldn't finish it got to around page 100 and there still wasn't anything that compelled me to continue all that is good about this book is the story premise as advertised by the publisher which is what drew me to this recent novel but henderson takes the premise of a montana mowgli and tries to make it boring dull and generic for the reader the prose is uninspiring and lacking with feeling for the protagonist i already forgot his name this is clearly a brainchild of a creative writer who either has had little real world experience or and i think the latter is more correct he has had lots of experience but doesn't realise that the creative writing style robs his experience of all power like a microwave robs food of 97% of its nutrients creative writing is microwaved literature and fourth of july creek has as much nutrition as a frozen chicken pot pie henderson's compulsion to add adjectives to 5 6 of the nouns also doesn't help his case but what really ticked me off is his use of swearing for the fuck of it i don't know if he thinks it will make his novel avant garde or something or maybe he's trying to represent a realistic montana but to the reader it just comes off as immature and makes salman rushdie's first novel grimus look like one hundred years of solitude despite its flaws if fourth of july creek was a woman it could sure use a little bit of that d despite all the above i'm strangely optimistic for smith henderson he seems to be able to identify the kinds of stories that people will like and whether he knows it or not he is in a position in literature to be for montana what john steinbeck was for california but once he's in the kitchen with all the ingredients he goes straight for the microwave without taking the time to check the internet to see how he can fry it in olive oil or whether a little bordeaux at the right moment will enhance the flavor as a result a story that could have been the most exciting and interesting novel of the 2010's is rendered as generic as the rest of this decade's literature if henderson happens to read this i would tell him that he should hang out in europe for a spell read some literature in translation and maybe drink a few more drams of whiskey on a weekly basis than he already might do otherwise i will probably never take the time for his writing again","586":"one of the best books i've read this year","587":"i didn't want this book to end it's ivan doig's west with a contemporary view and great characters","588":"compelling story great writing","589":"i will first say this the writing is incredible for a first time author that i give much praise however as the storyline progressed i found myself becoming less interested and more concerned when the end would be happening that's all","590":" the two stars is purely personal taste i'll say that first because this is a very technically accomplished novel the sense of place is fantastic the writing is varied and evocative and the characters are compelling in a repulsive kind of way i like how human that makes them the fact that none of them are really likeable though they are capable of doing good things my one criticism is that this might be a bit long it felt like there were too many convoluted storylines going on the real emotional meat was the social worker benjamin dynamic juxtaposed with his daughter rachel i wanted more of that angle","591":" i feel mislead by the blurbs such a big part of the boom involves pete chasing after his runaway daughter and a lot of it is told from here perspective about the drug use and promiscuity and eventually straight up prostitution and it's just not at all what i was expecting or looking for if i wanted to read about a teenaged runaway's descent into the lurid underworld of underage prostitution i wouldn't have chosen a book that claimed to be about a social worker dealing with a paranoid apocalypse hungry father living off the grid","592":"i might actually give this a 3 5 very hard to read i struggled to finish it but in the end i feel it's a well written depiction of a difficult world","593":" i think this is a clear case of overhype i listened to the audio which seemed to go on forever but probably is the only way for me to have finished it i liked the angle of the story being told from the perspective of a social worker but this type of book just gets me all riled up about what's wrong with rural america ignorance child abuse religious fanaticism neglect alcoholism divorce distrust of government gun violence prostitution lawbreaking survivalism drug abuse everything i hate tied up in one tidy package granted it's a lot of what's wrong with urban america too but no matter it just makes me want to go running and screaming to canada or some nice reasonable eu country i have never been to montana but if it is anything at all like it was portrayed in this book i will count my blessings to never set foot there","594":" i don't know why i found this book so captivating from the start but i did while reading it i seemed to forget that the novel is set in 1979 early 1980's as there are several historical events to help readers set themselves in the time period for me much of the story line could have taken place in present day america because the themes of dysfunctional families destructive behaviors and anti government sentiments still ring true in the current social climate pete snow the main character is a social worker caseworker for the department of family services or child protective services in tiny backwoods tenmile where he keeps a multitude secrets about how families function and often their dysfunctions through his work i honestly came to believe that he wanted the best for his clients one client in particular clyde becomes pete's pet project throughout the novel he hopes to reform the young man who doesn't want to reform himself or realize the kindness given to him pete holds several secrets too first he is a functioning alcoholic which made him a sort of anti hero for me during the course of the novel second he failed as a husband and a father his estranged wife beth is just as bad as he is although her problem seems to be drinking and drug use his daughter rachel or rose as she prefers to be called gets caught up in her parents' destructive lifestyles taking on her own destructive journey literally and figuratively through adolescence i wish her story would have been better explained or at least resolved at the end through his work pete becomes involved in a form of anti government conspiracy led by backwoods mountain man jeremiah pearl who has his own dysfunctional family and shady past into which pete becomes drawn in to partially due to his own curiosity pete attempts to help pearl's young son as a caseworker benjamin through whom he discovers the father's past pete's main problem is that while he is desperate to help benjamin and uncover pearl's mystery he loses his family his estranged father dies his brother goes into obscurity and his daughter goes off the grid in a quest to escape her mother's lack of maternal instinct pete is out of touch with reality rose rachel snow's story seemed to parallel clyde's story as both spiral into obscurity attempting to take on adult lives which they cannot handle with their lack of resources or social training the young people's stories were heart breaking and hard to read at times jeremiah pearl is part prophet part minuteman part lunatic the scary part of his character is that there may well be jeremiah pearl's walking around in this world jeremiah's character is one whom i never fully figured out and perhaps that's the author's point that readers are left wondering about this mysterious man and how he may change america's future the novel left me with many questions as to what happened to the characters which made me feel like perhaps i didn't pick up on enough hints throughout the novel even though i took notes yes i am that book nerdish perhaps that was the author's purpose to leave his characters into an unknown future","595":"this book came highly recommended to me it sounded so good the plot was good but i could never care about the main character pete for me to enjoy a book i need to care enough about the main character so i care what happens to them i didn't care what happened to pete as you can see by how long it took me to read this rambling story","596":"well written but i didn't like the story","597":"loved it when i was reading it and then 100 pages in or so i just lost interest found the main character inconsistent i guess but man can henderson write setting like nobody's business","598":"a broken marriage a distant daughter and a pernicious relationship with a potentially unhinged survivalist and his 11 year old son and yet beauty i it's hard to find beauty one would think in the world of pete snow pete is a social worker in rural montana -- a constant witness to the heartbreaking effects of family dispute sexual deviance drug abuse and neglect he offers reason and some stability to these ugly encounters or at least he tries to despite the unraveling of his own life -- a broken marriage a distant daughter and a pernicious relationship with a potentially unhinged survivalist and his 11 year old son and yet beauty is there it's in smith henderson's vivid descriptions and wonderful imagery of the mountainous landscape its surrounding dusty towns and their broken inhabitants it's in his rich language lush and poetic that reveals the harsh realities of poverty isolation and desperation and reminds readers of the fragility of human connections and the trust they thrive on every character in this book is flawed but fully aware of their frailties and perpetually in search of redemption therefore engaging and somehow likable in their own way","599":"best book i've read so far in 2015 no question it wasn't always pretty but boy howdy was it well written do yourself a favor and add this one to your summer reading list","600":"i simply adored this book the characters were rough and the plot heart wrenching but it was riveting i couldn't stop reading or thinking about it","601":"i didn't finish it i got through about 120 pages before i gave up i kept waiting for the story to start all the protagonist seems to do is get drunk","602":"i think i'm actually angry that i wasted time reading this fucking book","603":"could not put it down i especially liked the authentic intermountain vernacular you have to live in the mountain west to embrace it same goes for appalachia","604":"very hard read but very well written","605":"a stunning powerful book that i could not put down pete snow is a 31 year old social worker in a small isolated montana town the kind of protagonist it's easy to idealize as he tries with compassion and courage to save children from drug addicted parents from violent pimps from the kinds of desperate and ugly situations we don't even want to think about but pete snow has problems of his own a sad and shattered birth family a brother on the run from the law an alcoholic and drug addicted wife a teenage daughter on the streets a drinking problem of his own there are several stories here the most powerful that of benjamin an 11 year old boy and his paranoid anti government religious fanatic father jeremiah the intense story pulls the reader along the characters deeply flawed are none of them all black or white even the most disturbed have redeeming qualities reasons for why they are as they are even in the most dismal situations there is a hint of something positive no happy ending to the story no light at the end of the tunnel but just a glimmer of hope an outstanding the beautiful work by a masterful author","606":"i really wanted to like this book there is no denying there is something compelling about it but it drags on and on too long for my liking maybe it was some of the subject matter very dark for my taste by the way the story was moving along i was concerned how it would all get wrapped up and in some instances i think for good reason","607":"interesting not as strong as the reviews indicate but a worthy read nonetheless","608":"survivalists good writing","609":"hey friends read this one it's realllly good","610":"this book is the 1970s story of a social worker in a rural area dealing with cases concerning a sexually abused boy and a recluse survivalist family while also trying to cope with his own runaway teen daughter despite the depressing premise the story managed to be interesting suspenseful and to have a satisfying ending","611":"not sure what the fuss is about it was fine","612":" i don't mind depressing and i can enjoy a good anti hero a lot of reviews state that as the problem of fourth of july creek i as a guardian ad litem for my county recognized the truth of the social work aspects portrayed in this novel and agreed that sometimes a wrong option can seem the best option i don't know why this ultimately didn't work to me too disconnected i'm not really sure why this was set in the late 70s early 80s and i despise when it makes no sense to pick a decade like that i also didn't enjoy some of the narration switches i think others have touched on this more eloquently but the strange interviewer rachel rose question and answer sections should have been cut from this book most of the characters are interesting pete cecil that dog scene still makes me blanch jeremiah pearl benjamin others were less so the rachel rose storyline was the weakest henderson's characterizations are well done i just think everything else was a bit of a mess it's a little like we've been partying too hard with pete or maybe beth or their daughter lots of things are happening we've met a lot of people but nothing ultimately matters","613":"i found this a bit of a depressing read as the main character pete snow a social worker in america strives hopelessly to protect his client's children whilst at the same time undertakes an equally futile search for his runaway teenage daughter having been equally depressed by my previous read i need something a lot lighter 6 10","614":"social worker pete snow has a lot on his plate he's got a divorced wife and fourteen year old daughter a brother who's violated his parole and a caseload a mile long helping kids get out of desperate situations however a new child has just shown up benjamin pearl son of the notorious off the grid end of days survivalist jeremiah pearl jeremiah is known vaguely around minnesota mostly because of the appearance of a number of strange coins that all have holes gauged through the heads of the presidents pearl's work as a commentary on the value of federal currency and his feelings about the current president the newly elected ronald reagan as pete becomes involved with benjamin and his father his family life goes all to shit and there's an assassination attempt on reagan and suddenly the manhunt for the pearls is on not only is there a gripping plot throughout the writing was excellent i've seen comparisons to cormac mccarthy and i can see a bit of his style here but this book isn't any more difficult than a typical summer read that is if fucked up family situations and dangerous separatists are beachy summer topics for you if not no worries but it's a damn good book a well written page turner and possibly the best i've read from last year i still dig station eleven a whole lot 4 5 5 so let's err on the side of 5","615":"honestly this book is a 1 5 star just who cares really the storyline was eh and the writing was eh the whole book was eh","616":"dear sweet jeebus i really wanted to finish this book truly i was even cool with hating every single character with a seething intensity hey even the ham handed approach to subtly scripted characterization and relationships was tolerable with alcohol what i could not manage to overcome was the utter bleakness and sense of what's the point of breathing mood it left me in after every valiant attempt to continue hell maybe it got better three pages after my last attempt to keep reading my bad if it did i was too busy sobbing and trying to dig a q tip into my ear to swab the film of dejected misery from my brain but that's just my take on it have a go it makes ethan frome read like a hallmark christmas movie script good luck","617":"love the montana setting of this book as well as the artful writing also there's something about the character here a hard up social worker with a rich father who's living poor and has never quite left behind the binge drinking and emotional turbulence of youth","618":" while i was intrigued by the basic premise of this book i found the constant shifts in voice disturbing and completely unnecessary most of the book is written in third person from the perspective of the narrator pete but unexpectedly it shifts into the 2nd person and then there are imaginary conversations with pete's missing daughter it's just an unnecessary jumble that leaves the reader with whiplash also while most of the secondary characters are believable enough i could never quite believe in the utter stupidity of pete's character he is a college educated man a professional a caring person but his treatment of other men in authority is the behavior of an uneducated out of control idiot who has no insight into human behavior and how to deal with difficult people i also had trouble believing that he could afford to spend so much time with the reclusive pearl nor could i fully fathom his motivation for following this man around like a star crossed puppy henderson's use of language is a delight he employs a vast vocabulary and when he stays on track his prose flows he has also uncovered the ugly underbelly of the challenges social workers face his story is set in the 1970's so one might assume that social workers had more time to spend per patient but i doubt any social worker has ever enjoyed the freedom to travel and spend money that henderson has given to his protagonist","619":"just finished this last night best book i've read in a long time if you like mystery stories of folks with crazy messed up lives and can tolerate a bit of violence in your books you should definitely read it i can't wait for him to write another book characters are so well developed you find yourself completely entangled in their lives and wanting so badly for them to overcome their strife and make their lives work","620":" i loved this book however when i first began reading i almost put it down because i thought this was yet another book on back wood americans and frankly i've read enough on that topic luckily i continued and what ensued was a dark and beautiful story of unlikely empathy the character development of the two protagonists was grotesquely human the people you thought you wouldn't like become the ones you feel for the most and this is why i rated this novel a five this story is not for the faint of heart though the lives of the children and youth you only hope are just made up but most likely somewhere out there in the world someone is probably going through exactly what took place in fourth of july creek","621":"this book was really hard to get into i started really enjoying it about 3 4 of the way in very vivid often gut wrenching maybe just over my head","622":"the book was just ok i didn't particularly like the way the book changes voices and styles between the protagonist and his daughter i didn't particularly like the subject matter and the way that things fell apart throughout the entire book","623":"fourth of july creek by smith hendersonsimultaneously beautiful and ugly having children makes you no more a parent than having a piano makes you a pianist michael levinemy friend derek described this book by saying this book is beautifully written but it's making me feel dirty all over if grunge was a book genre that's what i'd call this one very very grungy i couldn't have said it better the writing is so beautiful and eloquent even though the harsh lives of these characters are very ugly and grim this dark gritty story centers on the underbelly of rural montana we meet a small population of uneducated sordid alcoholics and junkies who live a life of salacious debauchery and raise their children in ramshackle squalor and filth if you could airlift appalachia's poor and destitute to rustic montana throw in a lot of sex and drugs the characters in this book are the people you would meet pete snow is a child services social worker trying to rescue abused and malnourished kids one of his young clients is the son of a religious survivalist who is extremely suspicious of the government and convinced the rapture is going to occur any day you quickly learn that pete's own life is even more screwed up than most of his clients pete is a good well meaning person and i had a lot of sympathy for him but he is self destructive lacks common sense and has terrible judgment he's also a drunk and an absentee father who failed his only daughter his estranged wife is even more of a mess an alcoholic sexpot who is growing envious of her daughter's budding sexuality yet pete leaves his vulnerable daughter to be raised by this sad hopeless woman instead of focusing on his own child pete spends all of his time driving around rural montana trying to rescue feral children trapped with dysfunctional abusive parents while his daughter's life slowly circles the drain the writing is so beautiful and picturesque even though the subject matter is very unattractive which i know sounds like a dichotomy but this talented author somehow makes it work","624":"this book was recommended to me as one of the best books of 2014 i anxiously awaited for my copy from the public library personally i didn't enjoy the book the main character pete is a social worker in rural montana during the 1980's life is terrible there drugs alcohol and rampant sexual abuse even the dog gets molested there are 3 story lines throughout the book and pete is the central character in all 3 first is a case pete is in charge of involving a teen named cecil the second and focal point of the plot is with jeremiah peal and his family and finally pete's daughter rachel rose which is told in an odd qu0026amp a form i found pete to be unbelievable in all 3 story lines he is an alcoholic social worker who forges case reports blows off work for weeks at a time without anyone noticing but takes an odd and unexplainable interest in the pearl family evening camping out with them for weeks at a time to earn their trust which really didn't make sense because they already accepted the handouts of clothes and medicine that pete left for them additionally pete travels to the hometown of the wife to gather more information i just thought the entire situation was absurd i won't go into any more detail because i don't want to spoil any plot lines this is one of those books that will probably win a lot of awards with critics while the average reader is left scratching their head","625":"so depressing it was well written but just so hard to read mostly because the depiction of the child protection authorities and the children they are supposed to protect was so grim and helpless and hopeless well almost hopeless","626":"interesting and well written however not my type of story book too depressing and disturbing","627":"gripping excellent novel gritty and thoughtful hard to believe it's the author's first set primarily in rural montana at the turn of the carter to reagan era this tale centres on a social worker pete snow young but already fraying at the seams trying to provide some benefit to his assigned charges he also struggles with the mess of his own personal life things reach a head as his estranged wife leaves town with pete's teenage daughter while in his professional life pete tries to get involved in the life of a libertarian religious loner who has taken his family to live in the wilderness","628":" the kindle version had some misspellings that i found jarring i think my review may move to 4 stars after i've thought about the book and it is discussed in my book group my initial reaction is primarily due to how sad i found this story of pete snow pete's an alcoholic social worker employed by the state of montana he cares about his job and the kids but it's hard to make a difference and he's a failure with his own daughter one of the primary storylines involves pete's attempt to help benjamin who lives with is father jeremiah in the wilderness jeremiah is anti government and trusts no one another involves cecil his mother debbie and sister katie debbie is a druggie cecil is abused pete makes lots of mistakes and then there is pete's daughter who is a runaway pete was pretty much an absentee dad and the mother was pretty unstable this is a very sad story with minimal hope that any of these troubled souls will ever be happy or stable","629":"that was some epic awesomeness a debut of such heft and scope that it will takes days to come down from the writing is so confident in itself and never derails into nonsense sometimes i like a tidy ending but other books are so much about real life and hurt and pain and hope that to have an ending would be like a death here people live on easily the best novel i've read this year","630":"i didn't love this found the daughter storyline interfered with the rest of the story and was a distraction","631":"i just can't this is a story about children in distress and i don't think i'll ever get over the block i have about reading stories about that it's too bad the writing is wonderful","632":"this book was intriguing i genuinely enjoyed about half of it and was dragging my self through the other half but those sections threaded through the book the part about pete's wife daughter dating life were mind numbing but the rest was lyrical and raw and compelling this is a very milktoast review i'm glad i finished it and would recommend it with some reservations","633":"read this a little while back and just cannot get it out of my head it was fiction so good i can't seem to get back into fiction give it a shot it's like faulkner had he lived in montana it's a big fucking dark novel full of fascinating and haunting beauty","634":" a depressing but can't put down book pete snow is the penultimate non hero who is far and away his worst enemy but you can't help but root for the guy anyone within the department of family services has to be a little crazy and pete is no exception especially when it comes to his own family there are times its like watching a scary movie and you yell at the screen for the hero to not open that door that's what happens in this story i caught myself begging pete don't open any more doors from mysterious mountain men to total dysfunctional families this one has it all","635":"for me one of the best books of 2014","636":"a strange intense read","637":" though this is a book about several hardscrabble intertwined lives it has wonderful and imaginative prose pete a montana social worker has a daughter who has disappeared but at the same time he keeps reuniting with various client children who pass through his life and leave their mark he is community advocate a great parent and a drunk the reader jumps from one scenario to the next ultimately despite his flaws he is a lovable guy though a bit all over the place at times it is a memorable and unforgettable story","638":" this is definitely the sort of book that you want to discuss once you have completed it while i didn't love it i am glad to have read it as it left me with the desire to pause and reflect on the many and there were many characters in this book i am left confused and wanting to learn more about the hugely favorable reviews of this book what was it that made them feel that fireworks should come shooting from the pages after wrapping up this read i just didn't feel that way this was a tale of many tales and of much sadness i was waiting for some sort of climax and it never came that said i felt connected to each character and wanted to learn more maybe that was the point of the book","639":"to be clear this is not my usual kind of book it's gritty dark and incredibly bleak at times but the language is stunning and there are so many images that i won't be able to get out of my head for a long time","640":"excellent readreal life characters and story line the author gives us many points of view to consider well written and held my interest to the last page","641":" this is a depressing book it is well written and compelling but there is little if any joy in it a social worker who is an alcoholic is separated from his wife also an alcoholic and drug user and their daughter the story follows the social worker as he attempts to help numerous families in a rural part of montana in the course of the novel the social worker comes in touch with fundamentalist christian survivalists with children who must be removed from their families for their own good the novel shows the dangers of acute use of alcohol acute use of drugs this is a stark portrayal of america at the beginning of the 21st century","642":" the title of this novel is the metaphor for the book the fourth of july is not just a national holiday it's a living things that flows in ways we can't always control it's a novel about the limits of what government should demands of its citizens balanced against the choices individuals make just below or maybe just above is a compelling story about families and relationships set against the bigness of montana you can read it as a good story well told or a treatise about what we owe to our community","643":"brutal and bleak and i loved every single sentence of it","644":"i think this might have been a very well written book because i kept on reading it even thought the subject matter was overwhelmingly dark and difficult the characters range from merely dysfunctional to profoundly disturbed and they are very well defined the situations these folks find themselves in are dismal and often violent for sure not a 'feel good' book however as i said i did keep reading it so there is sure something there","645":"i found the subject matter painful but i had to keep reading","646":" this book was a struggle for me it's a period piece early 80s set in an uninviting location rural montana about unpleasant things deteriorating society and its impact and that's the whole point the problem for me was i read this one when i needed something totally different coming off a few other disappointing reads i enjoy being exposed to non traditional writing styles and appreciate just how unabashed and unforgiving the book was at times but the sidebar chapters kept removing me from the story and then i had to find my way back into the primary storyline and often found it lacking perhaps this book would have been an ideal choice at a different time but for me it was exactly the wrong kind of book to read at the most inopportune time","647":"this wonderfully written first novel pulled me into the lives of everyone in the story set in the 1980's it is definitely a true precursor of things to come that did the audio version was beautifully done and kept me on edge as to what would happen next to everyone in all the intertwined storylines","648":"smith henderson's first novel shines a light in some dark places the frustrating main character pete snow tries to juggle reaching dysfunctional families in remote montana in the early 1980s while his own family speeds out of control henderson illustrates the grinding cycles of poverty alcohol abuse and child abuse and how the system's solutions can be arbitrary and damaging pete snow runs across a family whose patriarch jeremiah pearl is paranoid anti government and off the grid snow gets seduced by the mystery surrounding pearl and unraveling that story keeps the novel gripping despite the frustration with snow as he is on the brink of losing his own family and as other children in crisis seem to slip through his fingers","649":"golly this is a great book prior to reading i somehow had the impression that fourth of july creek was simply a crime thriller with an interesting setting and some positive critical buzz as it turns out smith henderson's debut is an epic tragedy of rural america that reminds me of denis johnson claire vaye watkins and cormac mccarthy set at the start of the 1980s in the mountainous wilderness of western montana this novel is about an eventful year in the life of a social worker named pete snow social work seems like such fertile ground for dramatic and episodic storytelling that it's odd that there isn't more pop culture on the subject henderson has done his research and he convincingly relates pete's routine of home visits court appearances and pick ups drop offs to compliment the range of domestic problems he faces in his work pete has an impressive share of his own binge drinking a brother on the lam after viciously beating his parole officer and separation from his wife and teenage daughter pete's troubled daughter rachel provides the parallel narrative running through the novel her chapters are presented as stylized questionnaires a risky literary decision that ends up working beautifully instead of becoming a gimmick after pete picks up a filthy and malnourished boy found lurking around the school his path crosses with that of the child's father a paranoid apocalyptic conspiracy touting patriarch named jeremiah pearl pearl is an intriguing and frightening character especially in our present era of domestic terrorism but henderson imbues him with increasing complexity and humanity as the book climbs toward a shocking revelation at its conclusion fourth of july creek is a novel that manages to be downright addictive while telling its story at a near leisurely pace some of its magnetism is due to the vivid sense of place in henderson's native montana some of it is due to the rugged poetry of his prose and dialogue a great deal comes from its gloriously messed up hero pete is one of the most compelling fictional protagonists i've ever encountered and i'm holding out hope that henderson uses him in some sequels aside from some insignificant quibbles about female characters and the piling on of hardships this is an overwhelmingly good book i recommend pairing it with preparation for the next life for a sobering examination of neglected lives in the countrysides and cityscapes respectively of the united states","650":"i wish i could subtract half a point for the resolution of this big ambitious and true novel it was the only part where smith henderson seemed to back off a little too far to offer some redemption but i'm rounding up for all its other virtues fourth of july creek is compelling in concept a social worker gets in over his head trying to help the child of a man who's become a symbol of resistance against government interference henderson treads the line where religion meets political paranoia meets the ragged frontier of the poor following an alcoholic child protection worker confronting his own failings as a parent the novel exposes the enormity and variety of neglect as well as the flaws contradictions and goodness in the system set up to help kids and their families it also exposes the twisted roots of fanaticism that take hold in the mountain west as a volunteer with the homeless and children of families in transition i appreciate the way henderson has portrayed the various players in the system and the variety of ways children are neglected he uses them to illuminate a seldom seen world rather than simply color the plot about the libertarian fugitive so far this is my favorite read of the year and a definite contender to follow anthony marra's a constellation of vital phenomena as this year's debut of the year","651":"i was slow to get into this book but once i did wow it is hard to like the books characters as flawed as they are a truly troubling story but an interesting read nonetheless i was however sadly disappointed in the ending maybe it's an author thing but i like closures with my books","652":"i read to chapter 9 and couldn't finish it if you want to read hopelessly depressing stories about unlikable people living hard lives in the american west go read annie proulx's short stories about wyoming her stuff is as profoundly beautiful and meaningful as it is depressing and is not nearly as clunky and boring as this book","653":" this book was incredible the writing was amazing and with every description of the town i felt like i was there i could imagine every person and feel like i had met them and experienced their company every character is so troubled and flawed and normally i find it overwhelming when the story is so dark but his writing made it more relatable and realistic the ending was delightlfully frustrating but i think rather perfect in execution overall i can not recommend this book enough i was completely immersed from the moment i started reading","654":"3 2 this book was very challenging to read at times some of the description got down right gruesome petes job as a social worker in rural montana in the 80's made me wonder how much things have changed since then you felt for the characters especially cecil and benjamin pearl pete also redefined the word functioning alcoholic to me i recommend reading if you dont mind depressing books set in the 80's in rural montana","655":"perty good read","656":"this is an extraordinary first novel pete snow a 31 year old social worker seems to be failing at his personal and professional lives overmatched by the evils of the world drinking way too much three stories are interwoven the failure of pete's marriage and disappearance of his daughter the tragedy of a family infected by drugs and the story of jeremiah and benjamin pearl can pete save any of them himself","657":"audiobook mixed feelings about this one generally excellent use of language though every once in a while the prose becomes self conscious and overwrought and there are some truly cringe inducing similes i really enjoyed the primary plot and found the writing there to be taut and compelling the secondary plot is entirely unnecessary except as a ham fisted metaphor for pete's failures as a father as contrasted with his dedication to other peoples' children it is intentionally unresolved in a way that seems simultaneously coy and like the author just didn't quite know what to do with it a very solid effort though and i would probably chance another smith henderson book audiobook reading by macleod andrews is excellent","658":"a dark tale with sad overtones that ring true for today how fucked up people are a very good book for a first time author i really give it 3 1 2 stars i found myself caring for benjamin and katie but pete you just want him to get your shit together and grow up it's a book about how parenting can really screw people up for life","659":"original and excellent","660":" i liked this book but not as much as i expected or wanted to this is the problem with buying a book from a first time author who received a lot of hype the hype gives you high expectations which clouds your reading experience it's a good book i say this sometimes in regards to male authors and i don't know why i say it but i feel like this book is more for men which is fine there just weren't any female characters or any characters that i could latch on to in this book i don't regret buying it or reading it and i may even read a second book if he writes one but i don't know that i'd recommend this to many people","661":"sad violent difficult read pete snow is quite a leading character","662":"such a good book it was wise and dark and hopeful this book had me appreciating my social worker friends all the more","663":"loved this","664":"actual rating 2 5","665":"i hated this book the story was horrifying terrible sad and very damp and dirty i can't believe i read it until wee hours every night until finished i had no idea where i was going i was scared moved and can not stop thinking about these children and families these men and women pete's prayer i cried heavy burdens are carried somewhat released this book has torn a hole in my heart who are you henderson smith to write this first book am stunned","666":" social worker pete snow of rural montana tries to help a malnourished boy that stumbles onto a local school playground and discovers the boy's father has hidden their family high in the montana wilderness he is paranoid mistrusting of any authority and believes the world will soon come to an end he displays a propensity for violence and yet pete is drawn to them and to their story even as his personal life is unfolding in tragedy around him this book was a sucker punch i was not expecting it's henderson's first full length novel--a mind boggling fact when you turn the last page of this book the characterization is among the best i've read this year pete is a fascinating person to follow there is innate sadness to him and to this story it's a heavy heart breaking book but a good kind of heavy like camping when it's cold and raining not exactly comfortable but not unpleasant either i can't wait to read what henderson writes next","667":" the tragedy of the common man that is one of the themes and the most important to my mind of fourth of july creek often we see tragedy in classical greek or shakespearean terms great persons who suffer great reversals of fortune that reverberate out affecting great numbers of people even entire nations but tragedy does not require such greatness of personage or such extensive consequences and tragedy is not always one single event tragedy can be an entire life the life of an ordinary person and that's what's disturbing most of us know that we are ordinary that our lives are ultimately of little consequence to anyone outside a small circle of friends and family and yet even in this smallness of the ordinary tragedy is still possible fourth of july creek is an epic tragedy of the american everyman it is the story of poverty family strife despair and apocalyptic religion in montana in 1980 and 1981 told through the lens of the life of pete snow a social worker three separate yet interconnected stories unfold in fourth of july creek 1 pete's search for his runaway teenage daughter rachel 2 pete's attempts to help the two children katie and cecil of a drug addict and 3 the primary narrative pete's interactions with another social work case that of benjamin pearl a young boy and his father jeremiah pearl a backwoodsman who lives off the land with his son a conspiracy theorist a bible thumper who is sure that the world is about to end and a man suspected of being a domestic terrorist there is also a tangential but still vital to the overall plot story line involving pete's brother luke's run from the law after he luke assaulted his parole officer the author smith henderson strips bare the psyches of pete and jeremiah the two men are completely naked psychologically as we readers learn who they are and what drives them at the deepest levels what makes them the men they are the emotions are raw powerful and overwhelming rarely have i seen a writer like henderson who is able so thoroughly and successfully to excavate the core of his characters the novel is much more a story of pete and to a lesser extent jeremiah than it is a plot driven narrative but that is not to denigrate the novel to the contrary it is all the better a novel for the powerfully honest revealing and unceasingly fascinating tales of these two men fourth of july creek leaves the reader emotionally spent it packs an amazing punch as we readers continually are mourning and weeping or hoping and rejoicing with pete as we are stricken with horror at one cruel twist of fate and left in fear of the unknown futures that pete and jeremiah face this is a novel that is not soon forgotten i cannot praise henderson's talent as a writer enough he is one of those writers who after reading his book one says to oneself damn this guy can write i mean really write his skill is especially evident if one has recently read a typical novel that is entertaining and even good but that is not great that is not powerfully moving it's not just that henderson is a skillful storyteller which he is but it's that he possesses that most rare of talents among writers he is able to write fiction that is true while henderson's story and his characters may exist only on the pages of his novel what he writes is true all the same his writing is in that pleasingly paradoxical way of fiction more faithful to the human experience than almost anything one could read in non fiction telling the truth with fiction showing us what it means to be human giving us deeply authentic portraits of humanity showing us our very own humanity and helping us know ourselves and others better this is what henderson does in fourth of july creek henderson is an amazing talent i would recommend fourth of july creek to anyone and everyone and i will snap up his next novel as soon as it comes out spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert if you are looking for complete and total resolution you won't find it in fourth of july creek and that's because it is true fiction in the real world happy endings are exceedingly rare and neat and tidy resolutions of all loose ends rarer still so at the end of fourth of july creek we don't know for sure if pete ever finds rachel though the novel is hopeful in this matter we don't know what ultimately becomes of cecil and katie but again the novel does give us hope we see how jeremiah and benjamin's future might play out but we have no solid resolution to their stories either and here again henderson leaves us with hope for these two and that's one of the aspects of this novel i liked best after passing through horrific tragedies we still have hope no we don't have any certainties but we do have hope still we do get some answers the most important of which is the answer to the mystery of what happened to the rest of jeremiah and benjamin's family sarah jeremiah's wife and benjamin's mother killed all of jeremiah's other children and herself at various points leading up to this revelation the astute reader will see hints that the family is dead but we are shocked to learn just how they died this revelation metaphorically knocked the wind out of me left me stunned and shattered although i had been growing a bit more sympathetic towards jeremiah who is really at least initially and for a large part of the narrative not a very likable character at all this revelation broke my heart for him and enabled me to see him his personality and the reasons for his actions in their true light one of the most valuable insights in this novel is its stark portrayal of the dangers of religious zealotry especially as evidenced in sarah i came to hate her more and more as the novel progressed and not just because she murdered her children which we don't discover until near the end of the novel but because she was so utterly convinced that she had the truth and that all else were wrong and she would brook no compromise or questioning and worse than just being unjustifiable convinced of a truth that was not true at all sarah acted on this delusion it was sarah not jeremiah who led the family down the path to destruction yes jeremiah went willingly but he could have been just a normal fundamentalist type if not for the unhinged zealotry of sarah a zealotry that cut herself and her family off almost entirely from the rest of civilization and ultimately led to the tragedy of her murdering her children and killing herself","668":"i finished the audio of this book a few days ago and i'm still at a loss to properly describe it the story feels epic it feels like it could become a classic it feels enormous and heavy and important but at the same time it meanders wyoms along in this very specific voice relating a story that is just a story the writing is like nothing i have ever read and i am loath to describe it intricate unique masterful writing one of a kind writing the narration could not possibly have been better though i found this depressing i would still highly recommend the audio the words and the worlds they create are magical this is a story you feel 5 stars","669":" i enjoyed the book it was all right i obviously did not see the same things as most reviewers i've read most reviewers have given this book 4 5 stars i am not sure what those reviewers saw that i missed it's a fine story but there were too many things that overshadowed my ability to truly enjoy this book 1 sections written as a qu0026amp a session were poorly constructed and took away from the central story the purpose was to create multiple voices but all it ended up doing was causing frustration every time a qu0026amp a section popped up all i could think was great now i've gotta stop the story to read about the main character's daughter ugh 2 numerous grammatical mistakes made for difficult reading at times i am not a grammar snob but i do have certain standards if i notice the error as i'm reading my brain immediately stops and says wait a minute did that just happen examples know and now mean different things shouldn't of wouldn't of are nowhere near correct this happened multiple times in the book and i wanted to bash my head against the wall every time it came up it wasn't used in a speaker's quotes so i can only assume the author does not have a grasp of verbs and how they work","670":"pearl is snow is himself is everyone we're all fighting the good fight some just have weird crazy ones while others have internal fights so sad so traumatic sigh","671":"this book is fantastic the entire book is an uphill battle for the protagonist pete an alcoholic social worker in montana who's trying his best to help families in need while struggling to hold onto what's left of his own shattered home i highly recommend this book as a can't put down train wreck of american life run amok","672":" a good big book humanity with all its flaws compassionately rendered the portrayal of street kids and runaways was new to me an eye opening introduction the question and answer interview chapters were unique and it worked for me who is the questioner who is the answerer i thought about this while reading adding a layer of complexity to my interaction with the story in the end i decided it was the storyteller having a conversation with a reader or maybe even the internal dialog between henderson's own author persona and his imagined perspective of a reader the last chapter felt like an opportunity to talk to the author to hash out those tricky feelings of betrayal that inevitably come when there is a not so tidy ending to a story","673":" this is an incredibly well written book the story is sad depressing and mostly bleak there's not much hope to be found in the montana wilderness where the story takes place peter snow is a social worker trying to manage a heavy caseload consisting of some very desperate cases pete is not a stranger to depression addiction and family dysfunction himself his very young daughter is missing and he's desperate to find her pete's cases include runaways abused children's and benjamin pearl whose in hiding with his anarchist father jeremiah pearl pete risks his life more than once attempting to help the pearls it is really a wonderful read there's not much joy but it's an insight into a world that i personally don't know much about","674":"started it as a book but did not do so well with it so tried the audio book i did not love it but can see how others could there were times i when i just wanted it to cut to the chase already lots of dysfunctional characters not that i have a problem with that but not sure all fully developed i did like the character rachel and in fact wish more was about her story","675":"the writing was good but didn't connect much with the characters or the story","676":" henderson has written a compelling first novel which justifiably garnered a lot of critical praise when it was published last year set in montana texas and other nw areas we follow the messed up life of pete snow a social worker who tends to the broken families of his area while also contending with his own henderson paints realistic humane and unblinking pictures of damaged struggling people despite my occasional winces at just how messed up almost everyone is you feel for them you feel you might know them maybe to avoid maybe to sympathize with their plights one particularly memorable character jeremiah pearl a dangerous religious right wing fanatic fairly leaps off the page humanizing pearl was not an easy feat but the author managed tragedy and difficulty follow poor decisions but people in the novel are also victims ... of broken families indifferent and often oppressive government predatory peers and difficult circumstance there are few happy endings for these people but thank goodness for my reading psyche at least a few bleak looking lives get second chances at one point weighed down by all the misery i nearly abandoned the book still i kept at it and am glad henderson writes in a modern sparely informal style which can sometimes seem as if he's taking the easy way out he'll rather abruptly move along the narrative by not bothering to explain or smoothly segue' from point a to point b but all in all it's not difficult to follow or understand and one is rewarded with vivid mental images of the people and places i both read and listened to this book moving back and forth between the formats as convenient","677":"exquisitely written original backdrop interesting and thoughtful story line well flushed out characters and totally absorbing memorable the best i've read in a long time highly recommend","678":"heartbreaking heartwarming dark and grim but still with human warmth protagonist pete snow is flawed and lost but still trying and caring and searching a remarkable first novel","679":"3 5 stars for this took me a while to get into this but then i really enjoyed the author's style of writing and how the different stories were told","680":"dark character study about a social worker in rural montana whose life is spinning out of control as he meets the delusional paranoid anarchist jerimiah pearl and his son grinding poverty child abuse and bleak futures characterize this book by nw writer smith henderson not for the faint of heart","681":"not exactly an uplifting story it does have its redeeming factors an all to human social worker named pete snow who struggles with his own demons as he works to save the children in his montana district henderson's storytelling style made me want to continue reading as snow searches for his clients and for his own daughter","682":"i didn't expect to fall in love with this book but the story of pete snow a social worker in the backwoods of reagan era montana pulled me in from the explosive opening scene from the portraits of families struggling with poverty and drug abuse the author wrests a surprising amount of hope the world they live in is unforgivingly harsh yet pulses with a raw searing humanity","683":" an achingly beautiful book about ugly ugly things pete snow is a social worker for the dfs in tenmile montana in the early 1980's the area he covers is vast the families he tries to help utterly broken pete snow is about as broken as all of them but always seems as hell bent on saving them as he is on destroying himself there is a steady stream of hapless and hopeless characters in the book drunks drug addicts lost souls vagrants prostitutes politicians criminals lunatics and ranchers but my favorite characters may be the non human ones the montana wilderness its cliffs and crags and creeks and mud how it withstands the endless assaults by loggers and miners while maintaining it's pride and beauty the way it can gently shelter someone or be a terrible threat even the weather is a character how many beautiful ways does he describe the rain the sleet the snow the cities and towns everything is living and breathing and the language thick with mid western dialect spoken by illiterates is so exquisitely crafted it goes straight to your soul there is also a story that careens forward with breathless suspense and in the end if not redemption then at least hope a magnificent debut from the man behind the 2012 'halftime in america' super bowl ad who knew","684":"kept waiting for the story to take off pete the social worker was a good hearted man pete the man was a complete loser the rest of the characters seem to follow the same pattern read the book to the end but wondered why i was putting in the effort","685":"what an incredible book great story centered around pacific northwest authors first published book and you wouldn't know it i was hooked from the beginning definitely some adult situations and language but sometimes you got to have that to make it real","686":"3 75 stars powerful grim and lyrical echoes of denis johnson in a pre apocalyptic setting","687":"i feel like it's tough to review this one the writing is exceptional but alternates from rambling stream of consciousness to choppy fragmented sentences this was jarring at times but it was clearly an intentional stylistic choice that fit the subject matter it's also not a happy book i don't need every book i read to be feel good but this one really strips humanity down to its worst and everyone in this book is either an abuser or the abused the book's protagonist is pete snow a flawed hero whose job as a social worker in the early 1980s rural montana gives him an understandably pessimistic view of mankind when pete is not rescuing children from their addict parents or bringing coats and diapers to the most destitute he sleeps around and drinks himself unconscious as pete tells his ex wife i take kids away from people like us pete's job draws him into the lives of jeremiah and benjamin pearl a father and son who live in the montana wilderness and possess great paranoia about the government and american society as pete tries to earn jeremiah's trust his own family begins to fall apart and he sees the appeal of a life off the grid","688":"not all of the characters worked for me but this novel is definitely worth reading beautiful descriptions of the setting in montana","689":"i liked this book more as i got deeper into the story there was never a point at which i disliked it but there were more instances near the beginning where the writing felt forced and overwrought or at times just awkward a character walking down a hallway and looking through an ajar door but the characters were interesting and often fully fleshed out and their stories were compelling i look forward to reading more from this author","690":"there were a lot of things i liked but i thought he overplayed the cursing the way everyone's life fell apart or was somehow desolate i think we all struggle but i think he focused more on the tragic maybe i'm sensitive because i work with these kids and families i have seen some ugly ugly things and i have seen some amazing things and people changing their lives","691":"meh i don't get the hype over this book i would recommend this for people into montana social work or paranoid survivalists","692":"a friend of mine wrote in a review of the book thief that it was too depressing a little hope goes a long way i would say the same thing about this story i listened to this on cd the sound production had a few quirks but i thought the voice acting was spectacular the writing was really good the imagery and flow of the language was beautiful the story was so dang depressing though","693":"another of the rare literary novels i can heartily recommend to every reader a bit showy at times and much too mccarthy like in his need to describe what people are eating and how it was cooked and how it smelled and looked and sounded but otherwise a great work of literature about obsession and loss and the damage parents do to children and children do to parents","694":"wyoming forever you could wyom all day and not make any progress to wyom was to go from nowhere to nowhere through nowhere to see nothing to do nothing but sit she is proof that there is nothing that cannot happen to someone that the world doesn't need permission that there is no novel evil it won't embrace","695":"this is one of those books that you become so involved in that you cannot let it go the book is filled with people that are not perfect by any means troubled scarred","696":"the idea of this book was good but i didn't like the way it was put together a long slow read","697":"this was extremely well written and just captivating unfortunately it didn't grab me until about half way i almost gave up at some points but i'm so glad i stuck with it not a happy summer read but the dark lonely sadness of the main character pete gives an interesting perspective of being both a parent and a cps social worker which kid do you take care of first and a cps worker in serious rural america very different than urban","698":"a gritty brooding novel chock full of havoc and complicated damaged people","699":" what a crazy nut case is pete snow but what a moral honest hard working guy is pete snow he's got real soft feelings but never runs from a macho fight i read books to be amazed by beautiful sentences to attach my self to characters who i worry about when the book is closed and to feel the satisfaction of a good plot this book gave me all that and the usual rough and tough wild man adventure i normally try to avoid every bit of this book was worth it smith write more give up the ad agency","700":"best book i have read this year","701":"loved it montana 1980 82 a time when the country was shifting into the reagan years the militia movement fueled by paradoxical urges toward both patriotism and hatred of the government was on the rise as were various crackpot fundamentalist christian sects in time these developments would give us ruby ridge waco and oklahoma city fourth of july creek gives us the earliest days the subtle changes in the zeitgeist which led to them all the main character pete snow is a really messed up social worker who cannot keep his own life or family intact but is still dead set on helping others if he had given half the attention to his wife and daughter that he gave to his mangy caseload he would have been a happy man but he gives nothing to them and everything he has to the people he tries to help and everyone pays the price a pretty common pattern in the real world as it turns out i appreciated too many things about the book to name here but one of them i will mention is henderson's ability to describe the crackpot religious convictions of the pearl family there is a way in which these paranoid prophetic ravings make a certain crazy sense when viewed from just the right angle from this vantagepoint jeremiah pearl is still a deranged mountain lunatic waiting for the end of days but he is also a real character not a caricature amazingly henderson even allows us to sympathize with him a little bit drugs alcoholism child prostitution abuse neglect incest bestiality murder none of this is pretty but pete snow despite his own pain grief and loss never loses hope and so neither do we highly recommended","702":"a very hard book to read with all the shattered lives in it the story line was compelling but the people in the story made me feel dirty and full of despair","703":" there's this twitter account i follow guy in your mfa https twitter com guyinyourmfa and about midway through fourth of july creek i couldn't help but think smith henderson could be that guy now don't get me wrong fourth is a spectacular book in many many ways and for being a debut all the more so but the critical reader in me was taken out of the story too many times by what i can best summarize as the extent of try i felt henderson put into the book two examples his decision to include second person in the occasional passages told from protagonist pete snow's pov see https twitter com guyinyourmfa stat and also the way he needed to make the rugged landscape of montana as emotionally over descriptive as he did as if it were an extension of his characters' feelings see https twitter com guyinyourmfa stat as i often do with new authors i'm interested in i read up about smith henderson before i read his book in this case that might have been a bad thing because i found out he works for an ad agency one for which he was part of the team that wrote the copy for that clint eastwood commercial it's half time in america see https www youtube com watch v nrrjx once i knew that i couldn't keep that macho style of writing from leaking into my head as i was reading knowing henderson worked on that project which is awesome yeah but i feel a tad overwrought too i could see so much of the same footprint in style here not saying that's a bad thing but for me there was too much of a yearning of i want this to be the next great american novel to make it so ps if you decide to read it consider buying a bottle of whiskey to imbibe as you do this book has the taste of a man who reads esquire written all over it","704":"this was a page turner there are two story threads revolving around a social worker from montana named pete in one his daughter has run away and in the other he is dealing with a rogue father and son in the wilds of montana the writing is wonderful the story is well paced and the ending is satisfying","705":"maybe 2 5 stars very well written but a very disturbing storyline that just did not do it for me","706":"really wanted to like this book started off great the story took a weird twist the book was all over the place not for me","707":"couldn't put it down","708":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed this book but got so frustrated at the ending i expected pete and rose rachel to come back together and to end the book mid sentence without a resolution frustrates me i'm not sure how the whole mary story fit in other than to show how messed up pete was and allowed him to get drunk with his friends and do stupid things pete was a very conflicted character and you really wanted to root for him to help everyone so the ben luke ending worked for me i guess i'm just a sucker for a hap i enjoyed this book but got so frustrated at the ending i expected pete and rose rachel to come back together and to end the book mid sentence without a resolution frustrates me i'm not sure how the whole mary story fit in other than to show how messed up pete was and allowed him to get drunk with his friends and do stupid things pete was a very conflicted character and you really wanted to root for him to help everyone so the ben luke ending worked for me i guess i'm just a sucker for a happy ending more","709":"sad and dark but definitely worth the read","710":"smith henderson is my new favorite author his writing reminds me of cormac mccarthy with the rural north as his backdrop this story of a social worker who needs a therapist of his own was worth the 480 pages the different characters were flawed raw and in your face this book to me was fantastic","711":"this book was pretty great i thought the characters were very well written they were so flawed but also likable the author was great at capturing the desolate setting and it paired well with pete's breakdowns downfalls and the pearls' insanity the interview excerpts at the end of each chapter were written in an interesting voice and i wish those would have been a bit longer or more prominent","712":"i was drawn to this book because it is set in western montana where i spend the summers and mentions much that is familiar to me in missoula however i tired of reading about the struggles of the dysfunctional main characters this is certainly not literature but passes as entertainment","713":"i read this book for book club spoiler alert humanity sucks the end","714":"an utterly unhelpful review an ugly and beautiful story lyrical and disturbing and thought provoking with just a bit of hopefulness i'm not sure just yet how i feel but i know i'll be thinking about this book for a long time while i try to figure it out","715":"wow dark gritty depressing and probably unfortunately all too real people like this exist making this a scary read the underground world pete's daughter got involved with the conspiracy theorists the over the top religious fanatics the people who harbor criminals and so many others as i was reading about jeremiah i kept thinking about the recent guy in the news who holed himself up in the woods evading police i liked the writing overall i think the author is a good storyteller who can make you feel for all involved but the end of the chapters telling another part of the story via interviews were a bit distracting to me also having main characters names both starting with a p pearl and pete sometimes threw me and i'd get confused and have to go back to re read parts","716":"i didn't finish it which i very rare i simply could not connect with the characters and finally decided not to continue i was well into the book but it seemed disjointed","717":"i wish there had been just a little less dysfunction in this book the main character pete is likable even with his flaws but too much else piles on and it all gets to be too much tenmile is not a place i wanted to spend much time visiting and the people were particularly unappealing so while the writing was good and the idea of the story was interesting for me it would have been better with some rays of sunshine mixed in to all that gloom","718":"sooo depressing i gave up because it is summer and i'm not feeling particularly suicidal suitable for disillusioned social workers potential terrorists schadenfreudists and burgeoning alcoholics","719":"a good read but one of the saddest books i have ever read","720":"loved this book","721":"it was very good very well written my only criticism is that the story was kind of all over the place i would have preferred if the author had focused on one storyline","722":"hard to read emotionally but worth it pete is a character you root for and against and i like them the most","723":"i was given a free copy of this book via netgalley in exchange for an honest review firstly i have to say that this was not an easy book to read on two counts the subject matter makes it hard to read for long stretches of time not helped in my view by the writing style it's a mix of prose and question and answer which jarred somewhat for me on the other hand the author has succeeded in depicting pete's world and this is what kept me turning the pages the story of the pearl family together with pete's search for his daughter as his world collapses is well told but the beginning didn't really suck me in as i'd hoped","724":"this was better than moby dick this was probably the best book i've ever read smith henderson is a demigod","725":"intense fascinating gorgeously crafted novel the only social worker anti hero i can think of he's completely badass and thoroughly troubled and all i wanted was to spend more time with him","726":"bar none the best book i have read all year smith henderson keep these books coming","727":"best book i have read in a long long time","728":"eh while i wanted to like this book i just had no feeling for it thus the 'eh' eh","729":"extremely well written however the book was simply not my style it was slow moving took a while for the story to develop and i did not resonate with the characters to some this book would be a 5 and could have easily been a 5 if the story had been within a genre story that had greater interest to me","730":"pity the unfortunate reader for the time spent reading this poorly written novel some of the worst figurative language i've ever seen published appears in this book the makings for a good novel can be identified but the author failed to engage this reader","731":"each time i was starting to like this book it got a little bit stranger the main character is likable for parts of the book but quite frustrating in other parts the author uses qu0026amp a dialogue to tell the story of the main character's daughter and it just doesn't work for me seems to be employed to show a level of uniqueness without really adding any benefits overall not impressed with the book","732":"wow that's all i can say","733":"stark writing gives way to brutal and rich imagery one of the best books that i have read in years heartbreaking with a thin wire of hope around what feels like a bleak cloud i was unable to put this book down the last couple of hundred pages for me more than a discussion of freedom i see this book as a search for redemption where there is no real possibility highly recommended but know that it is not a light or easy read encourage not to skim because of the rich but not dense prose every word and sentence has a place","734":"stunning polished complicated dark and yet hopeful i cannot believe this is a first novel i seem to only possess adjectives tonight","735":"good story about a social worker takes place in montana","736":"broken broken everyone in this novel is broken and in need of forgiveness","737":"stark tale of the horrible family situations a social worker encounters while trying to be a better father himself this read like leaving las vegas but with the love of two fathers as its focus and hope as its final outcome a tough pretty explicit read that was impossible to put down","738":"interesting writing style i didn't really care for any of the characters and one major story line was left up in the air","739":"another unlikable main character i'm reading too many of these lately i stuck with this one and i'm glad i did but can't rate it higher than a 3 i didn't need snow to be a holier than thou perfectionist out saving children one by one but he could have been a little bit less of a jackass his rant at an fbi agent made me want to punch him myself the descriptions of this book all focus on one of snow's social work clients a boy who with his father is living off the grid in rural montana preparing for the end of the world and attempting to avoid all of the devils at work in our day to day lives i was surprised how little of this book is actually about that character interesting story as that was the bulk of the book is about snow's life which frankly seems in worse shape than most of his clients he's drunk and violent on a regular basis including while working gets involved in a relationship with a woman that is not healthy by anyone's definition puts the minimum effort into being a father and seems to work a couple hours a week the side stories about his runaway daughter and a client he's removed from the boy's home are much more interesting frankly the ending of the book brought my rating up a bit it was a satisfying end to most of the story lines","740":"a solid 3 to 3 5 stars imo i read it quickly liked that the many story lines ended but found that the novel dragged toward the end","741":"this book wasn't as good as i wanted it to be it does get better while i don't mind reading books where i don't like the characters the fact that i didn't like the main character distracted me the point of the novel isn't clear until more than half way through and oftentimes i felt like there were few transitions between scenes the ending too doesn't tie everything up which is fine and i think part of the point","742":"completely engaging though a terrible accounting of lives i can hardly imagine found amazing heart in a horrible and inhospitable society","743":" i really tried with this book i normally give a book 100 pages which is more than fair to capture my interest i gave this one about 200 pages before i gave up it is rated so well i figured it was going to get moving soon it never did i hit my limit i wanted more if the story of the pearl family and less about the drinking habits of pete in the middle of nowhere montana in the 70's i'd like to give it the benefit of the doubt in that it must have eventually made the read worthwhile i just couldn't get there i did manage to at least make it halfway through the book thus not receiving one star i just didn't care a bit about what happened from that point forward","744":"smith clearly has issues with authority these issues are beautifully portrayed by his words pete snow is an early eighties family services version of jimmy mcnulty from the wire read this book","745":" some debut utterly readable from page 1 a true definition of the phrase 'page turner' on completion i let out a huge sigh pleasure relief amazement all those things the plot is linear but there are shoots and branches taking you away from the central character which weave in and back it has all the hallmarks of being the next hbo box set we look at life in small town montanan america through the eyes of a social worker who is as troubled and conflicted as his clients from his contact with a lost boy down from the mountains found walking through the town to the powerful and fulfilling denouement he and the reader is put through the wringer and how we meet extremist christians teenager prostitutes fascist groups backwoods folk small town daytime drinkers i wouldn't say all life is here but a fascinating slice of it is tremendous","746":"rural montana is the setting for this disturbing but beautiful novel about a social worker who tries to help children living in unthinkable conditions while dealing with his own demons including alcoholism and the collapse of his own family smith pulls you into the action with his unusual point of view and unconventional writing style it all adds up to a memorable novel looking forward to more by this first time author","747":"i didn't enjoy reading this one especially despite the solid writing and an exciting if not depressing af storyline ultimately i'm glad to be finished with it","748":"audio liked the narrator the plot was a little too lifetime movie ish for my taste","749":"wow i'm surprised there hasn't been more buzz about this book what an amazing novel dark depressing and yet manages to be beautiful somehow i'm going to be thinking about this one for a while","750":"uncomfortable not a pleasant book to read maybe it reflects too many of today's people or their circumstances so much depression it certainly isn't a pleasant read","751":"did not finished i wasn't attracted by the characters should be divided to 3 or more parts to keep me going","752":"best book i've read in quite some time well written i couldn't put it down","753":"this book wasn't my cup of tea i was interested by the primary story line but then the author veered into the destruction of pete and i couldn't figure out where it was going and i got turned off dnf @ 16%","754":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book follows the work and personal life of a male social worker the inescapable intertwinement of these roles and the choices we as humans make daily to trust assist betray forgive continue","755":" i went into this book with such high expectations i heard about it on the literary disco podcast which you should really be listening to and thought i would love it the plot sounded so interesting but i was very disappointed the novel seemed very disjointed to me and the main plot point seemed overrun by the two side stories i personally didn't feel connected to any of the characters other than benjamin and that was just because i wanted him to be okay it may have just been that the writing style didn't connect with me but i was overall sadly disappointed in this novel","756":"love this book so far my favorite of the year","757":"i loved this novel the excellent writing the deeply developed characters the gorgeous imagery all create the world perfectly this is a story of human pain fatal flaws heartbreaking parent and child interactions and just carrying on through the worst and occasionally the better of situations great writer for those who can read the darkest of stories and appreciate the sheer mastery of the telling","758":"heartbreaking","759":"i wanted to give this book a higher rating but i almost didn't make it thought the first half not quite sure the second half redeemed itself enough to warrant 4stars but pretty close","760":"there should be fireworks shooting off for smith henderson's first novel as it is a just cause for celebration this is not to say that the subject matter is exactly festive but the book is a triumph pete is a social worker in tenmile montana a place so insignificant it was named for it's distance from the nearest possible somewhere the folks he is charged with trying to help out need all the support they can get but some can't seem to accept any there are three main threads braided into this novel cecil is a troubled teen in a household where the biggest problem is his substance abusing layabout mother the two do not get along big time firearms are involved when eleven year old benjamin pearl wanders into town alone dressed in rags and looking like he'd been reared by wolves pete is called in to check things out following the story of benjamin and his family is the core here although a portion of almost every chapter is given over to the third thread rachel snow pete's daughter who has troubles of her own pete is the central element interlacing with the threads pete snow is basically a decent guy bloody far from perfect but his heart is in the right place he really cares about the people he is charged with helping and tries his damndest to figure out what the best thing is to do for each that it does not always work out and that he is better at helping others than he is himself are foregone conclusions the authorsmith henderson offers us a look at a place in america rural and sometimes not so rural montana but also a time it is no coincidence that the story is set in 1980 when the promotion of morning in america also encouraged the release of a lot of pent up insanity benjamin's father is a seriously scary survivalist his paranoia may at times have a basis in reality but his worldview is straight out of the lunatic fringe encyclopedia there have always been folks with jonathan pearl's particular flavor of madness but it looks like henderson is signaling what lies ahead a world in which entities like right wing talk radio fox news and any organization associated with the koch brothers foment fear 24 7 and offer a media route in which to legitimize lunacy ben's father actually believes when he sees jet contrails that the gub'mint is spying on him there is plenty more to that story but the political this is what is being unleashed element is quite significant although it is only implied the implications of freedom are given a look at what point does your ability to be free living a life of paranoia infringe on the rights of those who have not chosen the same path where is the line between legitimate desires for non interference and license to do whatever where is the line between society's right to protect it's children and parents's rights to raise children as they see fit we get a look at institutional limitations and extreme downsides even when those institutions are staffed by well meaning folks of course not every one is so well meaning we also get a look at the hazards to kids of growing up working class from screwed up homes children have a lot to contend with here ok now that i have made the whole thing sound like such a downer time to shine a bit of light in the darkness while pete definitely has his issues he is beautifully drawn and is someone we can cheer on most of the time anyway there are some good people in tenmile a family who fosters kids in need a caring judge a tonic to the extant horrors learning about the survivalist world is fascinating stuff even if these days we know more about it than we should have to the writing is powerful and stunningly beautiful a sample of lovely descriptive he liked the sunrise cafe for its coffee and smoky ambience and the way his arms stuck to the cool plastic tablecloths in summer and how the windows steamed beaded and ran with tears when everyone got out of church and came in for breakfast on a cold morning he liked how tenmile smelt of burnt leaves for most of october he liked the bench in front of the tobacco shop on the square and how you could still send a child to buy you a pouch of drum from inside with no problem from the proprietor he liked the bowling alley that was sometimes according to a private schedule kept only by them absolutely packed with kids from the local high school and the surrounding hills who got smashed on bottles of vodka

with civilization was particularly chilling henderson may be new to novel writing but he has already had some success with other forms i do not know if he had much success as a social worker a prison guard or a technical writer but he co wrote a feature film while at the university of texas dance with the one won a 2012 pushcart prize for his story number stations and the 2011 pen emerging writers award for fiction i guess he has emerged it should be known that you have probably seen some of smith henderson's work already without realizing you know that half time superbowl ad for chrysler with clint eastwood halftime in america henderson was one of the writers it ain't halftime this time henderson with fourth of july creek goes long and scores a game winning td there is satisfaction to be had in how henderson resolves the conflicts he has presented and even when his outcomes are not happy ones they are believable we have been treated in recent years to a wealth of top notch first novels fourth of july creek will fit in nicely with the likes of the orchardist the enchanted and the guilty one for example and it would sit very comfortably next to works by willy vlautin smith

of the best books i have read in a long time brutal but beautifully written","763":"i really wanted to like this book and at times i did but at other times i grew very weary reading it i found it somewhat disjointed and i just didn't love it","764":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here is it possible to read an entire book and not have one good thing happen to any character don't look ahead but i waited until the last sentence","765":" book review fourth of july creek by smith hendersonif i had to list my 10 best books of the last year or so the following would emphatically be on it probably near the front ben fountain billy lynne's long halftime walk kevin powers yellow birds and philipp meyer the son so having not read anything completely transformative in a while i wonder into my local bookstore to have an undirected browse i pull out a book in the new fiction stack and guess who shouts breathlessly from the front cover fountain powers and meyers not polite shouts either loud roaring hot adamant shouts here is a thing i think i tend to filter shouts with a good dose of skepticism but not from these authors not all three of them not at the same time so i buy fourth of july creek is the debut novel by a young us novelist named smith henderson i apologise in advance for what is to follow a tsunami of superlatives which is a little embarrassing reviewers should have more decorum language plot characters sense of place ending emotional entanglements interior dialogues story arcs unusual and compelling viewpoints including a recurring set of questions and answers from an unexplained and invisible character perhaps even the author himself as he made notes about the story and its characters all of it just all of it folds together like a great complex beautiful origami a near perfect combination of linguistic magic and combustive plot this book contains harsh stuff even though gorgeously rendered the story unfolds in the rural backwaters of montana in the early 80s around an alcoholic damaged and despairingly moral social worker named pete employed by the department of family services from amongst his daily horror lists of neglected and abused children meth or religion fucked mountain dwellers and trailer trash we follow a number of stories and subplots a deranged end of days fundamentalist and his terrified little boy forced to move from crevice to cave in freezing and inaccessible mountains while the father waits for the apocalypse undone by paranoia and the re living of a scene of a terrible family violence closely witnessed a damaged and warped teenaged son of a unredeemable crack and meth addict thrown hopelessly into the juvenile detention system leaving his tiny malnourished sister to the unprotected depredations of her mother and her friends pete's own teenaged daughter run away and untraceable lurching unrestrained into big city prostitution while pete drinks himself into oblivion to dull the pain pete's divorced wife mangled into grief and uselessness under cheap religious homilies and unexpectedly amidst the worst of people and circumstances henderson manages to rip open rents of courage and humanity and light illuminating the dark everywhere else holding this story aloft keeping it from descending to the cliched places into which a lesser writer would stumble and fall this is an unflinching and deeply caring look a world without simple explanations and without neat endings more hard than soft more cruel than kind but it raises itself up to a of a sort of hope an strange upliftment for the reader even as he averts his eyes make space in your tbr pile put this on top","766":" i 19m going to be honest here i originally picked this book up because i loved the cover design my eye always gravitates toward simple covers and this one was no exception the contrast between the pale yellow letters and the read background is great and i love how the text is the main focus unfortunately my enthusiasm for this novel wanes from there i wanted to like this novel i really did i thought the premise was very interesting and i was excited to see how the multiple plot lines intertwined throughout the story the setting itself was probably my favorite part of this novel how often do you read a book set in 1980s montana i 19ve never come across one besides this and i wanted to see why the author chose such a specific time and place to act as a backdrop for the story the major weakness of this novel was not in the ideas behind it but in its execution i thought that the writing was confusing and i frequently found myself wondering if i had missed something or even skipped over a page or two instead of adding interest and depth to the story the different plot lines seemed to get in the way of any development or progression in the book the pace was incredibly slow and most of the action that happened was quite dull it was not engaging or entertaining and i basically had to force myself to read a large part of the book any hope of redemption for this novel was lost in its unsatisfying ending overall i did not enjoy this book i definitely think it had some potential but i did not care for the author 19s writing style and how he chose to pace out the plot i believe that this is smith henderson 19s debut novel and i don 19t plan on reading any books he writes in the future my rating 0 0 2 out of 5 smileys would i recommend it to a friend no personally i would not however perhaps someone would enjoy it more if they found a greater interest in the characters themselves instead of the plot yours hollyhttp nutfreenerd wordpress com 2014","767":"book was pretty confusing in the beginning and got better towards the end was ok not a favorite","768":"i loved this so rich and interesting ready for his next","769":"an enlightening view on social services in rural united states","770":"writing style is poetic and very descriptive i was immersed in the lives of all the characters and the time period the action takes place in is a definite plus","771":" i had a reading ephiphany mid way through this book i did not enoy this book whatsoever but i kept forcing myself to read it as the book has received many positive reviews including from friends whose books reviews i usually agree with this was tortuous reading but i kept going thinking hoping that it would improve reading this was similar to donna tartt's goldfinch same scenario book that everyone raves about yet i found it to be painful reading my ephiphanic moment oh first occasion to use that adjective was realizing that i want my gritty painful and dark moments in books to be the result of war disasters genocide etc rather than as the result of stupid decisons made by adults pete a social worker living in montana faces some daunting cases he seems to care deeply for the children for whom he is responsible yet we quickly learn that he has failed to take care of his own daughter pete and many of the adults continually make poor decisions drink heavily use drugs repeat endure a tragedy then repeat again and they don't take care of their children i was reminded of the main character in goldfinch who continually makes poor decisions drug use and then seems surprised at his lousy life i wasn't sympathetic of pete the book was way too long some of the side stories were unnecessary and simply added more destruction and mayhem the pearl family story was interesting and the most captivating part of the story but i thought it dragged out for too long","772":"flat out amazing","773":"henderson is a very good storyteller and masterful at creating and building suspense injecting tension and clearly plotting the story with multiple points of view from original and interesting characters i wanted to read this book fast i was compelled henderson is visceral and squeezes every molecule into his sentences and scenes sterling narrative and authentic dialogue that rings true to the ear and heart this was fun and enjoyable to read although a fishing rod is not a fishing pole and he seemed to have fallen in love with evict do not compare henderson to cormac mccarthy tom franklin william gay steve yarbrough daniel woodrell larry brown or dennis lehane this guy is his own original and thank god for it","774":" warning you loose i'm bummed i lost my brilliant first review being a social worker must be one of the most thankless jobs in the world pete snow social worker has more challenging cases on his plate than one man should have to handle alone how do you help 6 kids living in the woods who need food clothing education love really need help but their dad does not want you to come near them and if you do your own life may be in physical danger how do you help the teen kid who keeps acting out the kid who keeps getting tossed out from home to home how to you try to tell him that if he keeps his behavior up of not following rules dis respecting adults completely that he will end up in a facility how do you have that kid see that if he goes into a facility as a teen he will most likely get worst and become a bad man how does pete sleep at night given his own problems his ex wife cheated on him that relationship is over she screams at him just mail a check your daughter needs clothes school supplies etc his 14 year old daughter is angry at him too that relationship isn't working all she seems to say to her dad on the phone is mom says to send a check pete is 'trying' to be involved and help his daughter happy to send the check but he wants to see her add support to her life good luck 'dad' the wife and daughter just moved 4 hours away to texas try to get your social work job done and be a father to a teen 4 hours away at some point he discovers the 'check' he sends is sure not going for school the daughter hasn't been in school she runs away at this point i wanted to run away too i think pete wanted to run a way he 'did' begin to drink an awful lot and hey he would engage in sex anytime he could anything to check out a little none of the family relationships in pete's life are easy flowing heck even a dog attack's pete a rottweilers jaws clacking at pete's hands that wasn't working either pete lives in a cabin with no electricity he doesn't seem to care that 'heat' in his house isn't working either so with soooooo many challenges for pete snow he's a man i wanted to cheer for my heart was breaking for him the guy was trying to make a difference its 'creative on the job training' his plate was over flowing he was amazing as this book was as this author is powerful novel at least one of the top 10 best i've read in the past few years rural montana small town community with 10 bars in town 4 cafes 1 courthouse a couple of pastors couple of churches a lawyer and memorable characters and a lot of people needing help","775":"finally i finished one of the many books that i started this year only to get halfway through and have it be returned to the library checking out e books is definitely saving me money in late fees at least i just could not get into the first half of this book how can one human being make so many bad choices in such a short span of time but the second half of the back grew a lot more focused with the disappearance of the main character's daughter providing a point around which the other very scattered plot points could finally hinge themselves so after three weeks trying to get through this book i read the whole second half in about three days if you have an interest in montana the seedy underbelly of the 80s or paranoid militant mountain men you might like this book","776":"great book it seems to cover everything and then some","777":"one of those exploration of human nature novels that revealed little and discovered less it started sad and ended sadder just kind of pointless","778":"hands down one of the best books i've ever read oh to go back in time and read it for the first time again henderson's debut novel is dark and gritty in all the best can't put it down ways but it's his writing style that slays me nearly every scene is so vivid so unexpected and so charged that you think you'll never forget it and then he goes and delivers another just a few pages later the hero pete snow is the ultimate tragic hero someone who resists categorization of any kind on the one hand he has made a total mess of most of his life alienating and hurting the people closest to him on the other hand he is filled with goodness and purity of intention the other primary character the mysterious reclusive and at times terrifying jeremiah pearl is equally tragic and the way that we come to understand and change our mind about pearl is another testament to henderson's incredibly storytelling power absolutely brilliant","779":"one of jo's favorite books f 2014 read her review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","780":"strong first book","781":"damn good writing smith henderson delivers cormac mccarthy prose with elmore leonard plot i can't wait for more from him","782":"social worker pete snow is immediately likeable as the only social worker at a department of family services in rural montana in the late 1970s most of his job consists of checking up on children in alcoholic drug strewn homes where weapons are more common than salt shakers pete tries to get the parents to shape up the kids to let him know if they are not okay noble you like the guy then you find out about pete's own home life which is not very different from his clients' and like them his relationships are brutal and fueled by rancor and drink he has a 13 year old daughter and you cringe from the start because you know no good will come of this and it doesn't henderson writes well about troubled children but \"fourth of july creek\" is so brutal and dark i don't know who it's for survivalists people who think social workers are hypocrites people who want to read about relationships more horrible than their own phillip meyer whose \"the son\" was one of my favorite books last year blurbs this novel which makes me worry about what he's working on next yikes","783":" yuck do beautiful words make despicable people more or less despicable the answer doesn't matter to me as the story was simply dreadful to be fair if you liked a heartbreaking work of staggering genius then you might enjoy this one the plot of this one was not a true story however i would call this a life gone bad in a morass of bad choices by the end whatever marginal redemption was there did not matter to me i finished it just because i had invested too much time not to finish not worth it","784":"great writer will read his stuff again","785":"ok if you like the sound of finger nails on chalkboard the whole book","786":"a rambling incoherent storyline that nonetheless contains richly drawn characters giving the reader a paradoxically intriguing and frustrating experience","787":"dysfunctional social worker tries to help a boy living in the woods with his family who believes that the apocalypse has arrived well written deserves four stars but i found the main character too flawed to fully enjoy the book","788":"my favorite book this year so far these characters will stay in my mind and i will enjoy thinking back on them awesome on audiobook","789":"this had so many five star reviews i had high hopes for it unfortunately it did not meet my expectations i found the book and most of the characters messed up and depressing including the main character pete while he is at the core a kind caring person his life is in many ways more chaotic than the families he helps i wouldn't say it was terrible but can't rave about it like others have","790":" the story itself although depressing was ok the writing was very choppy there was very little transition between location change of scenes etc i didn't really connect with the main character until i was half way through the book the segments with qu0026amp a with the daughter didn't flow with the rest of the book i never really understood who was asking the questions and then it felt like it wasn't rachel rose answering but someone else answering for her the really frustrating part for me was the grammar sentences that made absolutely no sense where common throughout the book the story was well developed but it felt like the book was very rushed pretty disappointed with this one","791":"i had read good things about this book but i personally didn't enjoy it i think the premise of the story had great potential but it was dysfunctional overload and a lot of negativity i just didn't like the writting style or any of the characters not a book for me","792":"sorry book i tried but it's just not working out someone else will appreciate you if you liked this book you might also enjoy the secret wisdom of the earthnothing gold can stay","793":"odd ending but i have no idea how a story like should end or whether it does at all and that's one of points i loved this","794":"reread still enjoyed it but maybe not as much as the first time i read it possibly because i knew what was coming 28 02 2015 loved it devoured it in practically a single sitting reminiscent of cormac mccarthy","795":"a bleak and rather grim read i enjoyed this book but felt it was overly long too much wyoming and that the ending was a little pat","796":"this was a refreshing read that challenged me to think in a way i haven't since college it's one of those you wish you could read again without knowing what would come next","797":"i easily was swept up in henderson's masterful lyrical prose there's more than just the western setting that this book shares with cormac mccarthy and for about 90% of the way through it was a joy to read unfortunately the ending felt simultaneously swift and drawn out too wrapped up with a bow yet ambiguous in a not so insightful way it didn't ruin the read though and i do recommend it for the bulk of the page length it just tempered it away from greatness","798":"tho the main characters are hard to like at the beginning of this novel with careful development the author manages to elicit sympathy and even empathy with them as the story evolves he really nailed the atmosphere of small town rural area montana with the conflicts of personal freedoms and individual rights","799":"gritty real life crazy our lives are full of these people whether we want accept it or not we may be these people","800":"loved this reminded me of e annie proulx","801":"i found this book to be too lengthy i liked the premise of the story and the authors writing but became bored when i reached the half way point some of the characters and relationships seemed immaterial while other could have been more developed","802":"wow what a terrific read i cannot wait for his next book he writes like ivan doig with an edge gripping story of unbearable sadness i could not put it down","803":" a lot of 'literary novels' are well written but don't have a plot that is worth following this one kept me turning the pages it's fascinating pete snow is a young social worker in the 70's in rural montana crisscrossing the state alternately rescuing kids out of dangerous homes chasing after leads of other kids gone missing or run away drinking and drugging himself just enough to frequently lose consciousness and going through his own family shit that constantly hits the fan no cell phones or laptops just his crappy car and some case files if he's lucky enough to have them on his person i can't remember if he has a gun in the glove box he might","804":" i'm no stranger to dark and gritty books but this one tested my willpower it is filled with violence not necessarily physical violence though there is plenty of that but rather the violence that occurs in daily life that people don't like to think about at risk children in the system abusive parents drug use alcoholism rape prostitution molestation teen runaways it is 467 dense pages filled with cruelty occurring time and again with no pause no intermission or opportunity to breathe there were times when i had to put the book down to take a break in an attempt to clear my mind the language is often beautiful \"the asphalt reflected blue and red and he turned around and hiked back up to his car\" \"their black city speech rushed by his montana ears like freeway cars...\"\"he felt pearl's silence like an open oven...\"while it was difficult to get through i still felt this is one of the better books i've read this year the characters were so well development and the pacing was excellent i never got bored or flipped ahead a few chapters i loved the transformation of pete snow throughout the course of the book i wonder how many reclusive anti government people are living off the grid in those mountains like jeremiah pearl he reminded me of the unabomber excellent debut can't wait to read more from smith henderson","805":"fourth of july creek took my breath away the storytelling was so stunning and so real i hated for it to end the way this guy writes is like listening to an old friend tell a story a story you cannot tear yourself away from his depiction of the montana landscape and the montana people is spot on i highly recommend this wonderful debut novel","806":"loved this one great voice and characters","807":" if i'm not mistaken i'm at work and too lazy to look it up at the moment smith henderson is a graduate at one of the most prestigious writing schools here in the country located right here in my own school the university of texas henderson is a great writer and his voice is already very developed here for his debut novel my one critique of the book is that at times henderson ventures from his own voice and dips into a hemingway impression that is really lackluster and out of place in the grand scheme of the novel and while i can't say i loved the book i do think it's at least an 8 10 and thereby satisfies my criteria for a five star rating if you want a bit of a summary without any major spoilers it is about a social worker a man whose job description involves helping others and their families who can't resolve his own family issues along the way there are several compelling characters my favorite being one of the most unique and intriguing characters i've read this year jeremiah pearl","808":"even though this is a gritty novel with characters who were tough to like it was totally engrossing and it was hard to put down this is henderson's first novel and i hope he writes many more his language is beautiful","809":"so many troubled and troubling characters and so much pain to go around in all of their lives well written but a tough read because of the subject matter children in the system and the difficult natures of most of the characters","810":"flawless haven't stopped thinking about it since finishing end of last year","811":"i read 90% of this book in one weekend mesmerizing i got so caught up in the story of a small town social worker in montana in the 80's he investigated kids whose parents are all kinds of messed up and those kids sometimes survive sometimes not and they're all angry and resentful and pete just keeps on coming around with food and diapers and blankets then his own daughter has serious problems the narrative goes back and forth between pete and his 13 year old girl who has a painfully rough time of it but there is ultimately a little hope like mr rogers said look for the helpers they are always there","812":"got a third of the way through stopped reading just didn't do it for me","813":" this well written novel is set in western montana and features a flawed hero a social worker who works outside the box to save and protect children from both family abuse and governmental bureaucracy while battling his own demons of alcohol abuse an estranged wife and lost daughterthe book is better than my above description mainly because first time author smith henderson makes his characters come alive pete snow is a children's services social worker who moved to the rural yaak valley after catching his wife cheating on him in missoula while the novel is often written from the perspective of snow's observations of abuse or neglect and the balancing of how to best to care for them the narrative sometimes shifts to the perspective of one of the children throughout the novel is snow's contacts with the pearl family hiding in the mountains a family with obvious similarity to randy weaver of ruby ridge fame snow tries to gain their trust with offers of medicine and food and not forcing interferencebut what makes this novel click is that the story of snow's work is interspersed with the story of his life great descriptions of isolated life in the yaak area of montana with tales of wild alcohol fueled times in missoula snow is clearly a hero in his work and the reader grows to like him he's fun but then the frustration with his alcoholic binges and the resulting effect on his personal life especially his runaway daughter eats away from that sympathetic portrayal another example of the real life nature is snow's relationship with a fellow social worker whom snow learns came to the system as a young girl who was as abused as much in foster homes as she was in her family she was my favorite character other readers will have other favorite characters and there is no fairly tale ending to this relationshipthis is a great book i recommend it without any hesitationthis is a great book that i recommend without hesitation","814":" this is a weird book i expected more action with the premise of a crazy survivalist going against the fbi but the book turned out to be the story of a social worker in small town america and the external and internal demons he encounters jeremiah pearl an anti government survivalist living in the montana mountains is just one troubled family he comes across and much of the book is also devoted to his own troubled family i think you'll get the most out of this book if you approach it looking for that story and not the story of an fbi showdown the overall pacing is slow and the writing is fine but not earth shattering it picks up about 250 pages in but it's a slow burn to get there","815":" wow started this book and i must say what a cast of very unlikeable characters so far in a land of desolation the land of desolation is montana in the year 1980 the year reagan became a household name and it's about a social worker and his meet up with what would today be called a survivalist you know the crazies preparing for end times when the one world government will try and take over and the money will be worthless paper money that is the folks that think the government is evil and trying to take away our freedoms the gun folk trying to live off the land the plot goes back and forth from the social worker peter and his own messed up life a cheating wife who takes his daughter down to texas and then we veer back to jerimiah the crazy mountain man and his family which is honestly the most interesting part of the book so far add in cecil a profoundly disturbed charge of peter's who keeps running away from his foster homes sort of a prescience book indeed in addition to be quite long and kind of gross here and there don't eat while reading follow up unrelentingly dark view of the world does anything good happen at all besides cecil going to live with his friends very sad i finally finished this book it is sort of hopeful by book's end thinking about this book i've decided it is possible i totally didn't get it i think it basically bashes government the feds and glorifies the individual hiding out surviving off the land which is the happy ending for quite a few","816":"i have had this book on my tbr list forever and finally decided to pick it up i am so so glad i did this is an example of the great american novel full of heart full of characters full of contradictions and questions and most of all full of brilliantly written prose i loved it hated for it to end if you haven't been on this journey i highly recommend it","817":"this is disturbing","818":"a hard book to read i chose a low rating because it was hard to read the story it seems to me to be scattered all over the place to much drinking and way to much drama and dishonesty i lived in wyoming for a number of years and i don't believe that the book gives a true picture of the state and the people there i realize it's just a story but keep it close to the real thing","819":"i enjoyed the references to indiana and how this book illustrated how quickly life can turn","820":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a book i felt had no real point the main character pete snow is an alcoholic the book doesn't really explain what caused him to become an alcoholic or why he checked out on his wife or why he never really seemed to want to spend time with his daughter she seemed more like an after thought instead it focuses on a troubled kid named cecil and what he goes through though what real point he has in the novel besides telling the story of a troubled youth which is pete's charge is unc this was a book i felt had no real point the main character pete snow is an alcoholic the book doesn't really explain what caused him to become an alcoholic or why he checked out on his wife or why he never really seemed to want to spend time with his daughter she seemed more like an after thought instead it focuses on a troubled kid named cecil and what he goes through though what real point he has in the novel besides telling the story of a troubled youth which is pete's charge is unclear then you have pete's daughter who seems to be begging for someone to just care pete refuses to take her in when she begs him to but when she runs away suddenly he's devastated instead of focusing on why she ran away or how he failed as a parent by seeking counseling going to aa trying to turn his life around he keeps doing what he's always done why the author felt the need to tell rachel's rose's story i also didn't see the point i guess to just tell what she went through and how she left one bad situation to flip flop through others while 'keeping her kindness' which also seemed silly since she didn't bestow niceness on her father later in the story when he chased after her or set gangsters on her pimp ironically he seems to want other peoples messed up children thinking of adopting katie or mountain boy ben why he's so invested in pearl and his boy isn't clear either besides they seem to have an intriguing backstory also the setting of the story seems to read as a little hick town where everyone is horrible parents besides one family which pete uses to stash kids at that need a home the whole story reads as hopeless more","821":" my opinion of this book is that it was filled with too many good books there are so many characters in it that i would have liked to know their full story the story of jerrimiah cecil debbie rachel beth luke pete's father's story even the story of el and wolf would probably be an interesting story all in all the story was good i just found myself wanting more information touching on all these interesting and troubled people for me just left me confused and wanting the rest of the story","822":"wonderful book about mistakes self compassion raising children and religious extremism most importantly a raw and thoughtful take on what it means to journey through life doing one's best through hardship this book kept me engaged surprised and emotional as it followed the story of each person's life","823":"whoa great read one of the best books i have read this year","824":"3 5 starsi wanted to like this more and perhaps it's the author's fault for creating such believable characters but for me they were characters that weren't especially likeable and were hard to muster up sympathy for","825":"i agree that the writing was beautiful i won't repeat the story but will say is that the heart of the book to me was the fact that pete snow was so damaged himself that it gave him the ability to empathize in a nonjudgmental fashion with those around him and the children in whose lives he became involved he was damaged but not broken he sees people as they are and accepts them and tries to tailor a solution they can live with dark as it can be the darkness is necessary to see the light the book wraps up nicely with a sense of hope for his future and the future of those he interacts with i really needed to sit with this story before jumping into another book something i rarely do like a film that stays with you and keeps you thinking about it for weeks this book will stay with me too","826":"a well written book raw and real but i think i need to read something a little less depressing now","827":"started out really good by the end i was weeping and just blown away probably a little gritty and the characters i came to love will be too flawed for some to accept i assume my favorite from 2014","828":"the review made this book sound quite interesting about a part of americana that we don't know until there's some sort of uprising or disaster the story begins as good fellow pete snow is quelling a family battle in the wilds of montana the outskirts of tenmile in the yaak wilderness a few pages later we see him try to rescue an 11 year old boy from a family situation that is sub human all's looking encouraging in spite of the depravity of the people pete is assigned as an agent of the department of family services then pete takes a break to go visit his wife and daughter in missoula in the ensuing chapters we learn that pete is not the sterling character he was pictured to be in the beginning we learn that he came from a very rough family and that his brother luke recently out of prison is one step ahead of the law then the wife takes the daughter to texas where the wife shacks up with an acquaintance leaving the 13 year old daughter to fend for herself amidst drunks and pedophiles pete in the meantime stays drunk but managed to hook up with a woman in his missoula office who is horribly scarred physically and emotionally from her years as a foster child beaten raped starved abused etc etc and in the meantime his daughter is begging him to let her come back to montana and stay with him as she fears for her safety amongst the depravity she's been forced into he refuses every single page seems to wallow in worse filth and human depravity than the previous page and as our hero pete was increasingly shown to be less than the hero we thought he was i saw no redemption for the story and quit after about 1 4 of the way through so far as the actual writing i agree with those who said the story lines were difficult to follow as the writing was choppy and the story lines jumped about the interviews with the daughter interspersed at odd points also detracted from the flow of the story and didn't make sense really i will not be reading more from this author","829":" when i read the capsule description i was not the least bit interested thankfully the book is so much more than a plot summary it is a lyrical gorgeously and painstakingly written masterpiece one of the hallmarks of great books is whether it keeps coming up in my brain long after i've read it no it's not uplifting and you root for pete because he is a very caring yet flawed man and one thing it is not is boring despite the fact that it falls squarely in the literary fiction genre it is riveting and you don't want to stop reading","830":"i honestly couldn't finish this book i listened to it on audio and believe i was on chapter 9 when i abandoned it i had little idea what the plot was except just complete sadness and misery i'm surprised at all the rave reviews i guess it just wasn't my type of book","831":"just finished this 466 page tale in less than a week and i agree with the jacket endorsements that it is an incredible first work by smith henderson as a social worker his main character pete shows us the underbelly of american lives that we might never wish to see in heart wrenching sagas some seem destined to never pull themselves out of the swirl yet hope abounds in the human spirit and the reader at least this one finds an emotional pull for each character including pete who struggles with his own demons","832":" so many people asked me what this book was about you would think i could have settled on some stock response by now the only consistency between my attempts at explanation has been to speak very little of the actual characters or plot and instead to ramble on and on beginning sentences with well i think maybe because while this book is obviously about a damaged man trying to do right by a variety of endangered children one of whom is his own it's a book that seems more concerned with questions than answers even as the novel reaches a satisfying if not open ended conclusion so i mostly tell people this book is about big ideas what is freedom and what does it cost us what and who are we responsible for in our lives what does it mean to seek salvation and does anyone ever really find it and while i never talked about the plot much when i was describing this book to people i honestly couldn't put this book down i was always eager to see what would happen next fourth of july creek was truly enjoyable to read it's fast paced the prose is strong and stays with you as you're going about your day and although it deals in some very heavy subject matter the book isn't defined by its darkest moments","833":"a very impressive and well written debut novel for this pnw author although it read quickly and was engaging throughout i feel that the three main character storylines and development even though they overlapped and intersected were too thin and sparse which left me wanting to know more and with the same question well why over and over again","834":" the are hardly ever any books that i read that i will recommend to my husband and bug him until he reads it and fourth of july creek is one of those rare gems i picked it up the first time last summer but this is the kind of book you need to be able to comprehend fully what you are reading and i had a hard time with it back then because i was more in the mood for light reading come the second time and i finished it within three days not going to say much what it is about because the best way to enjoy this book is with a blank slate and not knowing too much what it is about","835":"disjointed in parts mainly the awkward interviews with rachel but still an intriguing read i found myself very taken in by the plight of this story's anti hero henderson's blurring of the characterizations of the so called good guys and bad guys fascinates","836":" the american west has long been a haven for people who want to be left alone and those who despair of society but loners and misfits aren't always alone sometimes they have families and those families have children children who may be loved or who may be barely endured but either way they can be children who are not cared for pete stone is a social worker assigned to a vast territory in the northwest corner of montana of sparsely settled pockets not of civilization but of people he's like a lot of those people his marriage is broken his teenage daughter is sullen and doesn't get much attention from a father with a demanding job and he drinks a lot his successes trying to help children and listen to the adults purportedly caring for them are few but he still plugs away at it between other hard luck cases pete is called when a wild child appears at a school one day even in the pre computerized days of the late '70s and early '80s the dawn of the reagan era it's unusual for a boy in such a state to have no records the boy benjamin doesn't consider himself neglected he and his pa live in the woods off the land headed up toward camp benjamin's father warns pete away obviously willing to shoot him that father is jeremiah pearl who knows the end times are coming his dearly loved wife saw the signs coming and had the whole troop of pearls including all the babies leave indiana and head for the woods where they might have a chance to survive pete leaves foodstuffs and clothes in a niche in the woods sometimes things get taken the distrustful pearl gradually doesn't quite trust pete but accepts his help and then him in between spells when they spend some time traipsing through the land pete's wife leaves montana for texas where there is a chance of a man taking care of her and their daughter and their daughter realizes she's got nowhere to go so she leaves and it's about as blandly dire as one would think the sections where pete tries to navigate the system through several states trying to find a young runaway daughter shows how easily children fall through the cracks of a social system set up to protect them and shows the heartbreak of parents who love their children but don't know how to take care of them so do the sections where that daughter rachel becomes a child of the streets whether it's parents who can't handle being parents children forced to grow up and fend for themselves people who believe what they are told or people who don't believe the evidence in front of their faces henderson's debut novel is filled with innocents who wonder about what has happened to them or who cannot handle what they see going on most of the people in the novel feel helpless about what they see whether it's a small town judge heartbroken when reagan wins a female social worker who was an abused child or a federal agent who regrets the choices he has made about the only people who don't feel helpless are pearl and his son pearl is a combination of just about every paranoid black helicopter fearing loner who have inhabited the crannies of northwest empty places for decades he's also far more than that and the dull despair that sometimes enshrouds henderson's people is a great contrast to this character who searched so hungrily for something to believe in and chose wrongly henderson's novel earns its humanizing heartfelt climax and coda both because the scope of the characters' journeys are so well drawn and because the little details are so right this is a highly political and social novel that is tightly anchored to its characters and setting to have carried this off with no preaching or screeching is a remarkable achievement and an uplifting reading experience","837":"i'm not quite sure why this book gets such good reviews i hated it","838":"so i loved this it drew me in right away a social worker carrying the burdens of his own demons a paranoid survivalist and his eleven year old son hiding in the mountains of montana dysfunctional families deeply good people the worst of humanity and blurred lines between them i could not put this down this is not by any means a feel good novel at the same time it didn't leave me gutted although the subject matter can be tough to take part of my response is no doubt grounded in my deep love of my home state a place this author clearly gets but also it's just damn good writing beautiful and true characterization no seriously i know these people beautiful and true sentences a gripping plot and plenty of questions with no easy answers more than worth the price of the hardcover i'll want this one to last","839":"i wish i had the option to give this one a 4 5 i liked everything about it except it dragged a few times however i gave it a five because i liked the writing and the story was fresh also the ending wasn't a pat answer to the conflict i like that","840":"couldn't put this down the story and the lives that the characters lived were haunting makes you appreciate the things you have in life","841":"brilliantly written debut novel i didn't want this book to end and at the same time felt like i was watching a train wreck one of the best books i've read this year henderson could very well find himself short listed for a pulitzer","842":"i feel torn about this book it was compelling and well written but i had a hard time liking any of the characters and the structure seemed a little gimmicky at times three stars may be a little low but a couple days after finishing and i already don't remember a lot of it so it's not sticking with me which is a bad sign might have to sit on this one a bit before i commit","843":"i couldn't get into this book there is just too much child abuse and neglect to wade through","844":"a big bruising beautiful debut novel about a handful of hardscrabble lives in early 80s rural montana these wounded souls full of anguish but never giving up completely on compassion feel fully realized and the writing is simply astonishing not flawless but pretty damn close","845":"worst waste of time ever such a downer and a hugely clunky writing style my ladies book club made me read it","846":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i don't really understand all the hype over this book it was an interesting story but the writing was a little superfluous and confusing at times and there were just a few too many things that didn't make sense to me how in the world is pete just disappearing for days at a time with jeremiah and or running off in search of rachel and no one at his work seems to notice or wonder where he is how does he end up hiking for days with jeremiah when he supposedly just went to visit with them bri i don't really understand all the hype over this book it was an interesting story but the writing was a little superfluous and confusing at times and there were just a few too many things that didn't make sense to me how in the world is pete just disappearing for days at a time with jeremiah and or running off in search of rachel and no one at his work seems to notice or wonder where he is how does he end up hiking for days with jeremiah when he supposedly just went to visit with them bring something to him silly details but when i'm wondering about stuff like that it tells me i'm not that into the story jeremiah is the most interesting character and i ended up really liking and caring for him whereas i just kept getting frustrated with some of pete's behavior and what the hell happened at the end so he's supposedly wanted by multiple federal agencies but ends up living in the backyard of pete's brother who is also wanted by the law did they escape work out some of agreement i don't get it i'm conflicted about how i feel about this book started to give it 4 stars but really it was just okay so i gave it 3 more","847":" this book has it all in terms of messed up america alcoholism mental illness dysfunctional families anarchy paranoia religion religious fanaticism government at it's finest really the list could go on and on not many authors can weave a story with all these elements and make it so seamless brilliantly done for a first novel it has been over a week since i finished the book and still i find it creeping into my thoughts i wonder about the different characters their struggles and their lives i wonder how they are today","848":"the characters and imagery in this book are strong however i kept thinking throughout the book that each of the individual stories felt disjointed and i was never fully certain what the focus of the book was overall the stories are interesting but they didn't feel well connected and in the end seemed a bit anti climactic","849":"this book hit me as it explored a time on our history of deep mistrust of others and of the government it questions freedom with yourself your family your job and country all of the above is quite lovely but the book struck me on such an emotional level i would not be surprised if some could not find anything likable about any character","850":"absolutely brilliant i was swept away by the characters and also the scenery it tackled heavy matter without being preachy or making me feel downright suicidal i really look forward to checking out smith henderson's other works one observation i know this took place in the 80s but was douching such a big thing then i mean really","851":"470 pages feel like 47 000 pages life is too short for poor writing and worse editing","852":"i realized after i added this book to goodreads that i was in an unusual situation because the author is my goodreads friend what if i don't like it and have to give it a bad review on goodreads i asked my husband i'm sure he will appreciate the honest feedback my husband said so here it is josh aka smith my honest feedback 5 stars well done","853":"there was so much happening in this book and i really liked where all the story lines were headed but it seemed like only one of them was wrapped up while other parts were left hanging the characters were great and i did enjoy it i just wish more was explained","854":" i spend considerable time choosing which books i'm going to read this one really caught my attention first novel by the author 1980's in a hardscrabble part of montana plus a tough social worker trying to give destitute kids a chance right up my alley pete was initially very appealing as a character who would go the extra mile for his clients although i empathized with him i could easily see why he was so hopeless at love jeremiah pearl a paranoid survivalist was interesting in a perverted slimy kind of way i was introduced to a bleak backwoods that was home to religious fanatics who could not save their own young ben jeremiah's son and pete's client tugged at my heart strings as did another client katie i yearned to know more about the cloningers who selflessly welcomed foster children into their lives i felt that the narration was tedious uneven and disjointed the notes about rachel which were enmeshed at random times in the story were distracting repetitive and annoying there were too many tangents that were not at all compelling pete's behavior and work schedule were often unbelievable his brother luke managed to show up at just the most opportune times hard to swallow whereas others found the prose glorious i found it overworked and excessive did he strike a kitchen match against his jeans and drop it on the ground and did the flame hasten into the trailer the inside light up like stacks himself had flipped the switch and did fire dance in obscene chemic colors as the polyester curtains went up in green and cerise flashes like magicians' smoke this and dozens of other descriptions just felt awkward to me the kids emptied out toys from the closet for katie to partake of who the hell ever heard of a child partaking of toys i am disappointed that i spent my time reading this 500 page book which ended with a fizzle i initially had doubts that maybe i had missed something really important thus was unable to find as much meaning as others then i decided that this book was in desperate need of clarity and an aggressive editor","855":"2 5 stars the first half of book which is 240 pages or so was extremely slow paced lots of stories and background information that didn't end up relating to the overall plot or ending of the book in the second half of the book the plot finally started going somewhere moving faster however it wasn't enough to make up for the almost pointless first half","856":"great debut book about wyoming and the types of people who live there and are drawn to it child abuse survivalists dea fbi etc","857":"fourth of july creek is a story of a social worker and his trials and tribulations at work and at home this book deals with some very real issues and some of the things these characters go through are really rough it was a very good read and ended well","858":"this is probably a tour de force however i could not yet beyond the opening chapter too raw for me","859":"holy shit","860":"beautiful writing but too dark for my liking depressing","861":" 3 5 stars this is a grit lit novel focusing on a flawed social worker trying to help children and families in rural montana in the late 1980's the good a strongly evocative sense of place complex and flawed characters interesting questions raised about parents' freedom to raise children how they see fit vs society's obligation to protect its children the not so good a dragging plot that took me until about 70% into the story to have a sense of where it was going a writing style that switched between overly verbose and distractingly short and choppy few redemptive moments which made the book feel bleak i would recommend it only if the premise or genre sounds interesting to you otherwise it'd probably be a drag","862":"what a book to start the year off with it was dark gritty depressing and there's no happy ending here in fact there's really not much of an ending at all the first half was tough to get through it was rather boring and i considered putting it down the second half was much better but again it was so dark and depressing that i wouldn't say i actually enjoyed it","863":"an insight into the life of a social worker and those he serves impressive first novel just not my cup of tea","864":"pete is a social worker trying to help other families which is a bit laughable when he himself and his own family seem the most screwed up of all he has an ex wife who cheated on him to intentionally hurt him and then promptly turned vagrant drug addict alcoholic he has a 14 year old prostitute for a daughter who ran away from home and whom he cannot find pete himself is a raging alcoholic liar always getting in fights impulsive and childish social workers should be trained to present themselves at a certain calibre and pete seemed both unprofessional and uneducated there are frequent chapter breaks throughout fourth of july creek where questions are asked in bold and then answers are provided mostly from the point of view of rachel pete's runaway daughter it was a little confusing because of the changes in writing from the first person to the third person at first i thought these breaks would be epic to the book and revealed at the end in a big surprise like maybe they would be the questions put forth to rachel during a court trial but no all that i can surmise now is that they were supposed to be the voices in my head as i read read the rest of this review and more of my reviews at www bookwookie ca","865":"possibly the best book i've read ever it knocked me out","866":" a heartbreaking raw trip through rural montana as told by a family services social worker who may be as lost as the children he is trying to save the prose is beautiful the story disturbingly credible and characters well developed most assuredly the reader is drawn into a story of dirt poor uneducated dysfunctional mountain families with drugs alcohol playing their usual roles as destroyer of families with innocent children being the victims the only book i could compare it to is winter's bones painful to read but stories like this one need to be told whether in ozarks west virginia or any of the major urban centers in this country this is smith henderson's first novel and won multiple prizes","867":"read this book a social worker befriends a rural boy and his father while attempting to piece together his own broken family i rarely re read fiction but there's no doubt in my mind i'll pick this one back up in a few years this is up there with the enchanted for top fiction of the year for me","868":"smith henderson's first novel fourth of july creek is the best book we've read so far this year in so many ways the story henderson tells here describes an american experience most of us never have to see -- but should far from big cities or either coast his characters are the poor and working poor in sparsely populated towns that few escape and no one ever moves to his book follows a montana social worker in the early 1980s all week ron charles who reviewed the book for us was looking for opportunities to slip back into these pages and follow the trials of this rural social worker the greatness of \"fourth of july creek\" stems from henderson's ability to subtly tie the struggles of one ordinary man to the broader currents of american culture both its blessings and its evils the result is a story that is simultaneously intimate and grand written in a style athletic enough to capture a spectacular range of harrowing events these may be the end times for jeremiah pearl but they're just the beginning for smith henderson read ron's review here http www washingtonpost com enterta","869":"this is not a happy story but oh it's spectacular","870":"i'll admit it i don't do well with unreliable narrators that may be what's holding me back from giving this a higher rating i enjoyed the book but it wasn't gripping the characters were well drawn and the plot left me wanting to know what happened next that i'm sure was the whole idea","871":" structurally speaking fourth of july creek is kind of a mess morally speaking fourth of july creek is a series of utter debacles resulting in sheer disasters for almost everyone involved and yet the book never gets tiresome or aggravating never succumbs to nihilism or despair this is almost entirely due to henderson's skill and poise henderson is a neutral observer here moved by the beauty of the landscape and unfazed by the ugliness of fate and mischance and bad decision making by his characters he's able to sustain a lyrical tone in depressing circumstances and capably interjects humor and pathos and suspense where they're needed read the full review at http davidabramsbooks blogspot com","872":"this was interesting held my attention but it never grabbed at my emotions not bad but ultimately forgetful","873":"this was a painful read about the underbelly of the families and case workers involved with family services at times touching at other times revolting the characters in need as well as those in a position of authority put on display bad behavior that they either don't even recognize as such or that they don't even acknowledge","874":"well written too much going on","875":"this book started really promising and is i accept well written but after the first 100 pages i didn't like the characters it didn't go where i thought it might and i just wanted to get to the end to see if it picked up","876":"enthralling visceral heartbreaking a beautiful grim novel it doesn't pull punches i was stunned the whole time stunned by the characters stunned by the landscapes stunned by the language stunned by the construction it takes place in 1980s western montana it follows social worker pete snow who's life is just as broken as the families he encounters it reads like an hbo series true detective and i mean this in a good way each chapter has a wonderful beginning middle and end","877":"i wanted to like this more than i did some good tc boyle ish characters living off the grid in rural montana and well written but i didn't feel as much connection with the protagonist's relationship to his daughter and liked the connection between that relationship and his social work but felt like it could have been stronger and do more showing than telling","878":"dark with flawed human alcoholic characters very good at getting you inside the heads of the main character social worker in the small towns of montana and his runaway daughter nice wrap up of the lives of the main bad characters anti social mountain man and his son very atmospheric","879":"best book i've read in a very long time i'm almost afraid to read another","880":"it took me half the book to get used to the writing style which annoyed me for quite a while a good story but not really my thing overall i did like the ending on this one though","881":"this book has a suspense that makes you want to finish it but i didn't care for many of the choices the author made about the characters and story lines i wouldn't recommend reading it","882":"started like a 4 or 5 star book but the 2nd half went nowhere and only his creative writing saved the day","883":"thought provoking troubling but beautifully written a compelling story","884":"pretty remarkable book brutal at times amazing how well the author was able to move from f'ed up crisis to f'ed up crisis across characters without it getting tiresome or unbelievable i think it is because the characters are deep and believable even as they do some unbelievable things the main character pete is a great everyman sort of a bad ass troubled social worker in montana in the era of reagan's america he is quite a writer excited to see more of what he does this one would be a great movie","885":"what a ride i almost quit reading within the first 100 pages as the stories were about sad instances that never had hope but then the magic started messed up people living in god's country montana how can that be i laughed when on page 435 there was a short sentence then there's trouble cripe the whole book is about trouble i look forward to more of smith's work","886":"this is the best fiction i've read so far this year astonishing debut novel","887":"i have mixed feelings on this book the good i loved the story line about the pearls and how pete spent time with them and took care of them and ultimately how their story ended up in a positive way i also liked how he seemed to rescue his relationship with his brother the bad the storyline about his wife and daughter was interesting but i think unnecessary i really didn't like the writing style the narrative changed perspectives and was sometimes written in a vernacular and sometimes not even if it was from the same character's point of view the sections from his daughter's point of view written kind of like an interview were really weird i hated the ending how it literally ended without finishing a sentence ugh that whole story line was a waste of space in a 460 page book","888":"some authors start small and work their way to their defining works over the course of their career think john irving what about a guy like smith henderson his debut novel is stylistically unique expansive shocking and a great read unique language fascinating characters where does the author go from here i'm wondering","889":"engaging read by first time novelist smith henderson i tore through this book in 5 days it's not a pretty topic messy u0026amp gritty boy does this author know how to write","890":" i have absolutely no idea how to write about this book it's a wildly ambitious genre hopping first novel with a straight up whiskey swillin' deer huntin' rough and tumble brawlin' long haired loose woman lovin' alpha male social worker at its center imagine a less funny doc holliday but working for child protective services as in most westerns the men in this book are all either loyal none too bright fuck ups corrupt bureaucrats or misunderstood outlaws the women are either emasculating psychopaths or whores mostly whores including the adolescent girls there are white supremacists and conspiracy theorists and a foster kid who tries to sexually pleasure a dog there is also a teenaged kinda goth pimp in seattle really there is a ghost town with an abandoned hotel and an arsonist parole officer and maybe the unabomber there are plenty of grisly horrific things happening to a lot of missing children and a murder mystery that kind of sort of unfolds as the focus of the story about halfway through and if you're thinking this sounds kind of fun you're not wrong i plowed through this novel in a day ish fourth of july creek is a fun read in spite of or maybe because of the preposterous clenched jaw hard boiled tumbleweed subject matter henderson is a good writer i struggled throughout to muddle outwhether i was supposed to find his tale to be dark comedy commentary on violence and misogyny because let me be clear if this novel is not intended to be enjoyed straight it's maybe the most mind blowingly misogynistic things i've ever read in sum the experience of reading this book not unlike watching a cormac mccarthy scripted episode of sons of anarchy pretentious entertaining trash with a superb pedigree that makes you feel very dirty for enjoying it","891":"i finished reading henrderson's masterpiece to the sound of the fourth of july fireworks exploding in the distance what henderson has created is a glorious work of fiction examining freedom humanity and the american way the pearl family and pete snow will stay with you for a long time as will the honesty of the storytelling this is a modern classic","892":"good storytelling i was captivated all the way through but i didn't like the writing trick of using present tense to tell something that happened in the past nor did i like the hero of the story","893":" an astonishing read painful and without answers pete snow is a deeply flawed man yet what he offers as a eulogy for one character that they tried something he knows is patently false is his own saving grace his empathy is not forced nor is it limitless i felt completely drawn in to the world henderson creates on the page with its pockets of poverty bureaucracy survivalist apocalyptic mania heavy drinking friendship and places the world just grinds up children i don't recall another book with a social worker from child protection services as the protagonist since paid servant which might have been memoir it's a fertile vein for etching out a portrait of america as it is now","894":" this was a gripping story right up to the end the main character pete snow is a likeable social worker with a huge district in montana and a lot of personal problems he becomes involved with a reclusive millennialist through trying to help the man's young son who shows up in town malnourished and inadequately clothed one day the main reason i didn't give this book a higher rating is that the story of the millennialist and pete's personal problems get such big build ups that the ending feels abrupt and completely anticlimactic still the setting of montana in the late 70's early 80's the drinking habits and personal foibles of many of the characters the impossible burden of keeping sane while taking care of kids in terrible circumstances the paranoia of the federal government at the time of president reagan's shooting it all combines to make a really great read","895":"it's hard to say just what i am feeling after finishing this one there were so many times i just wanted to give up there is no fun and very little light here but brutality and heartache abound characters are not sympathetic or appealing the setting is harsh almost psychedelic at times and the situations repugnant why did i read it you ask the writing is compelling for one thing and even though i did not like the characters i kept hoping for redemption perhaps it was there after all but not in its usual form this is the kind of book you want to discuss in order to make sense of it","896":" not quite a five star book but closer to it than anything i've read in a while so i'm rounding up i loved henderson's voice and the way his setting and characters felt so true to me i didn't quite grow up in the wilds of montana but rural minnesota isn't so far off in some ways and everything was just familiar enough to make me relate henderson also managed to write a book where all of the characters were deeply flawed without making any of them unlikable which is one of my main pet peeves with books that deal with drugs criminals sex workers etc everyone had real problems but also so much humanity that you could understand how they had gotten that way even if you didn't excuse it i also really enjoyed the sections about rose rachel and the different technique he used for telling her story they were just experimental enough to be interesting but not so much that they felt contrived not an easy read but a worthwhile one this would be an interesting choice for a book group discussion","897":"the audiobook was fantastic the story was intriguing but a little too much fbi paranoia stuff for my liking","898":"i really did not enjoy this book the first half it felt slow and plodding that being said in the end the book quickly turned into something i couldn't put down this debut author does a fabulous job of developing the main characters and left me glad to have read this novel","899":"impressive writing especially for a first book regional accents plus convincingly accurate socio economic influenced vocabulary and phrasing the story is as harsh terse and unforgiving as is the language and writing style in which it's told reader learns to lower her his bar for what serve as satisfactory outcomes in this modern tragedy","900":"great novel one of the best books i've read in 2015 the language captures the freedom and vast natural beauty of the northwest juxtaposed by the pain bondage dislocation if its inhabitants wonderful characters early 80s but timeless feel glad i read this on the kindle since the built in dictionary helped with terms of northwest flora looking forward to his next book","901":"i don't really understand the hype on this book it was a good story but not something i would the recommend i wanted more from the story and it just felt a little drawn out","902":"started off wonderfully but by page 150 i'd been worn down my too much darkness and too many weak subplots hell of a beginning though","903":"best book i've read in 2015 so far what can i say that it seems impossible to be a debut that he's a born storyteller that humanity and psychological insight shone through like a bright sunrise after a long pitch black night that it was just too compelling mature well written to put down that these kind of books is exactly why i'm a book freak no no need just read it 5 5","904":"fucking loved this book great pace thanks for the recommendation @nolan","905":" this might could be my best read of the year it falls into the genre of dirt poor rural isolated communities presented so beautifully that you can't help but immerse reminds me a bit of winter's bone the writing is exquisite and i'd love to read it again on an e reader just to look up every word i didn't know it's a sad story a hopeless story a story of trying but not succeeding but it has amazingly beautiful moments and the exposure of gut humanity is triumphant in a way that hits you where it hurts and where it feels good the way he uses words is simply incredible wyoming just whyoming","906":"whew loved this book but it was really hard to read at times very real human sad and inspiring at times","907":"3 5i'd have to say that this book is almost very good almost gripping almost gothic almost great characterisation it gets tantalisingly close but never quite achieves what it sets out to do i sometimes find with first novels that the authors try to cram as much in as possible and over extend themselves and the story and it this case its 100 pages over where it should be the narrative as it plays out is fine and it keeps you wanting to turn the next page however some decisions taken by snow and pearl seem out of character but are needed for dramatic purposes and one of my pet hates is the use of convenient coincidences that again are use tools for dramatic effect and to move things along all in all a good read and i'll look forward to smith henderson's next novel","908":"exquisite characters a plot that is at once incredible and yet entirely believable in its rawness and a gift of language one does not see often i couldn't stop reading this book dying to know what becomes of pete his family the pearls and other people who enter your life and your mind as you read fourth of july creek read this you won't regret it","909":"i really loved this book the writing is eloquent yet down to earth the story line took a little while to grab me but the writing held me over until i became immersed in the characters and their stories although the story is a little bleak it is heartwarming and feels true i highly recommend this book and agree with the hype and buzz that has surrounded it's release","910":"well written and interesting but i just never understood the main character","911":"this was a hard book to figure out the characters were likable and not flawed human but sad","912":"wow this was such a freaking great book i didn't want it to end the subject matter is a little heavy but that's what makes it great such a cast of characters and top notch writing can't wait for hendersons second book this is a must read enjoy","913":"brilliantly written and horrifying a social worker living in rural montana is as troubled and messed up as his clients if real life hadn't gotten in the way i would have read this in one sitting","914":"all the hope and despair of our benighted nation it's that good","915":"i was excited to read a book about a social worker in the early 80s but i was kind of disappointed by the book i felt that it really dragged in the middle and gave too much attention to describing the scenery which didn't do too much to further the story for the most part but it really picked up in the last 150 pages or so","916":"some of the most wounded characters i've ever encountered heartbreaking but difficult to put down","917":"i have no idea how to review or rate this book giving it three stars is the easy way out every single person in this book is miserable and seriously flawed yet i couldn't stop reading it even though it made me feel physically ill at times the writing is genius in many areas but the story is just so unhappy i'm not saying it is not realistic it is so based in reality that it makes you uncomfortable so don't read this or read it but don't say you weren't warned","918":"atmospheric unsettling i loved the setting and narration the way the threads of this story were woven together","919":"this book tossed and turned all over and never quite landed on one continues plot that i could be interested in i didn't care enough about the protagonist to give a fig about his life i would much rather have closely followed the people he helped as a social worker very well written though with some awe inspiring sentences","920":"i liked this okay but i didn't love it and i really wanted to love it and i need to find a new way to express this it was an interesting enough story but it was too long and there were too many disconnects for me i think this will make a great book group read because the disconnects why pete in particular did some of the things he did will make for great conversation i didn't like or connect with any of the characters except maybe benjamin still have a lot to think about here","921":"it didn't quite live up to the reviews but a strong debut novel","922":" my first literary introduction to the yaak river valley in nw montana was from rick bass who describes a beautiful but harsh sparse and rugged landscape that molds the psyche of its inhabitants gently a proverbial putty that fills in the character gaps transforming rejects into a fully functioning citizenry smith henderson's tenmile montana uses these same terrains to do quite the opposite a harsh tempest that plunges characters from the edge of eccentric behaviors and beliefs straight into the pits of despair derangement and occasionally full fledged psychosis this one isn't an environmental essay but the guts are ripped out and left for the vultures to come scavenge just like rick bass does in his lessons concerning bears wolves and the bitter cold gusts blowing in from canada the plot while complex rewards the reader who can triangulate the story line by being swept into the life of pete snow a less than perfect social worker trying to find his way his life is falling apart not even allowed one step forward for every two steps back just when you think his life is tossed crap salad the author juxtaposes even worse lives parading even less structure or sanity yes some slide into those corners because of bad choices but others are innocent bystanders simply born into the insanity they must get out surely not so fast while some will find the subject too bleak and depending on your normal reading material quite disturbing beware this isn't your traditional nicolas sparks love story i found myself fully engulfed in the tale despite the retching places it goes very well written taking several angles of attack in both style and viewpoint it certainly stretched the comfort i can sometimes find in reading allowing access to the good bad and evil within almost every character despite the intimacy with crackpots you still find reason to cheer for almost all parts of almost all people well most of them not light not fun not uplifting but a tremendous first go by an author who probably had sleepless nights screwing with these characters on the page","923":"this was a good book i think it might be better than i am rating it but reading a little life has kind of ruined other books for me for awhile in fact i am three books behind on the goodreads challenge and i think it is due in part to not being able to really get into a book since reading a little life","924":"this is not a book for the faint hearted it's gritty grim and chock full of raw emotion and flawed characters... just like real life","925":" pete snow is an unlikely but good hearted dfs agent who is charged with the care of some pretty interesting families in the small montana town tenmile near 4th of july creek the most challenging being the almost feral benjamin pearl who is living in the wild with his fanatically religious and apocalypse preparing family most namely his father jeremiah pearl trouble is brewing as pete's marriage implodes his young teenage daughter becomes a runaway his brother evades his parole officer and his own alcoholism looms large there's not much freedom near the creek named after independence as poverty abuse corrupt officers substance abuse and other tough conditions wreak havoc in the lives of most every character here and right from the start you fear things will not be going well i did like this book though it was sometimes a bit too graphic and often bleak underneath it all runs the slightest trickle of hope that imperfect people just trying to get by will possibly be able to do the right thing 3 5 stars almost 4 except i would not pass it along to everyone which is my 4 star criteria","926":"i'm not quite sure how i managed to read through the entire thing the pace was a bit slow for my tastes and some of the characters difficult to relate to but this depiction of poor rural montana in the early 80s is filled with questions about freedom the american identity and the meaning of family the story follows pete snow a social worker assigned the territory in the wilds of montana one day he meets benjamin pearl a boy who appears half feral and malnourished as he tries to develop a relationship with benjamin and his father a paranoid survivalist named jeremiah he comes head to head with the fbi his own assumptions about his life and his responsibilities towards his family at almost 500 pages this is a long read for today's standards but it is ultimately rewarding not everyone will have the patience to witness the development of pete and the pearl's relationship but if you do you'll especially appreciate henderson's rendering of the wild often threatening montana wilderness verdict a good read if the themes interest you prepare to invest some time","927":" before we get into this i just want to address what seems to be a pervasive misconception in the entertainment industry not everyone in the south is a child abusing doomsday prepping maniac no really i promise you it is statistically almost impossible for this to be the case i say almost because dear god i am horrible at math and i have no idea how to even begin to do statistics but whatever anyway... so yeah fourth of july creek it's a huge novel in every sense of the word in that it's incredibly long and tries to encompass so many different story lines that the final product becomes less than the sum of its many many parts read the review at https culturitis wordpress com 2015","928":"what a heartbreaking entertaining story so well crafted all the people you don't want to meet you meet in this book all the folks you glance at and then look away you can't here you must stay focused and this reader wonders what i will do the next time i cross paths with someone quite out of my social sphere and then there are those who dedicate their lives to helping the down trodden what is their story it's here the sorry ass tales of living that life and what can happen to the down trodden can also happen to them","929":"nowhere near as good as the hype 2 1 2 stars really","930":"strange writing stylestrange writing styleinteresting story idea but i'm not sure if it worked here for me the writing style was very disjointed and disconnected not sure who was narrating the short interview segments at the end of each chapter ending leaves you hanging i really wanted to live this book so i kept reading even though at times i wanted to give it up","931":"an exhausting andheart wrenching ode to those whotry and try and try","932":"disturbing engrossing well written incredible","933":"this is a triple decker heavyduty novel and i will not comment on it any further i refer to the reviews of will byrnes jeffrey keeten and paul bryant and you will know all there is to say about it the protagonist is about the most screwed up hero i ever read about the novel totally depressed me but i recommend it anyway for those who like to see what can happen in the life of a flawed social worker trying his best to do something meaningfull for assorted creeps in the boondocks of montana","934":"the way he crafts a sentence can bring me to tears with the sheer beauty of it","935":"well written and engaging but also depressing if these characters reflect even a small percentage of our population this nation is in a world of hurt","936":"this book will haunt me for a long time it's so beautifully written and moving yet so compelling i could not put it down it's an emotional investment and heartbreaking and well worth all five stars","937":"very slow to start but eventually pulled me in completely","938":"this is one of the best books i have read in a long time the story captivated me the writing intrigued me the endingfloored me to tears almost i've met some of the characters i've been some of the characters i needed to find out how itfinished but didn't want it to end this writer is like hemingway faulkner steinbeck only up to date","939":"oh goodness this book was long i was immediately drawn into the story but quickly lost my desire to read the main character goes from admirable to detestable in a matter of pages and never really manages to redeem himself there were far too many off shooting storylines that didn't quite fit and weren't tied up as a warning parts are also very graphic but those parts were not surprising as i'm married to a social worker","940":"a very well written but extremely depressing book i hesitate to recommend this one to a lot of people","941":" one of the best debut novels i've read in years i couldn't put it down the vision range and scope remind me of robert penn warren's classic all the king's men here the political backdrop is the early 80s and the beginning of the reagan administration the nascent crack epidemic post vietnam fallout and subsequent rise of homelessness are all set against a stark and rugged montana landscape narrated from the pov of a flawed social worker pete snow the novel captures the cultural climate of the early 80s beautifully and complexly the characters are well rounded the narrative feels organic at all times never forced or pedantic and trust me the topics are ripe for that pitfall but henderson is too good of a writer to force the issue fourth of july creek deserves serious consideration for a pulitzer or national book award it's that good but it's also right up my alley so pardon me if i'm gushing too much for your tastes if you like dan chaon especially await your reply claire vaye watkins's battleborn cormac mccarthy's the road and robert stone you'll love fourth of july creek","942":" a landscape is drawn out to the sound of a needle playing over a dusty record as fourth of july creek begins the book reads as an aged cinematic following a social worker in the state of montana flawed by human contradictions only wanting to do right by the world he fell into while taking every wrong step on the way piecing together stranger's families while his own family is lost among the winds henderson pummels the reader with frustration of main characters overflowing your empathy tolerance by the chapter the weight the protagonists bare is yours to share while the solution to all hurdles range from casting heavy shrouds of alcohol to blur the lines or reality or punching bloody as the world turns down and your own thoughts become strangled in the mix and everything in between to make it through this life the story takes the reader to dark places of not only the society we thrive and wither in but of the recesses of the mind and a sense of cabin fever paranoia forth of july creek is not an easy read to take in but read as a car crash you cant help but watch as the wreckage slams forth the metal contorts over itself and at the peak of the chaos crescendos into a peaceful silence","943":"this is one of those books in which i wish goodreads had a ten star rating system as i am torn between 3 stars and four stars gritty down to earth writing style that reminds me of someone but i can't think of who joseph heller or john irving perhaps at any rate it is a good story albeit a little too long plus it feels unfinished in a way maybe that's a reflection of our lives on going i found that the whole rose rachel interview interludes to be confusing however","944":" smith henderson joins the likes of paul harding and kevin powers with this intoxicating and thoroughly engaging first novel written in clear concise prose and an enthralling tale to boot fourth of july creek is the best book i have read so far this year it focuses on social worker pete snow who gets caught up in the business of jeremiah pearl a disturbed survivalist who squeezes an existence out in the montana wilderness where it goes from there i will not say it is a most impressive piece of writing and i look forward to more from henderson","945":" an audacious unruly mountain of a book and pretty close to a great one in reagan's america a social worker attends to his rural montana flock runaways speed freaks backwoods recluses an unhinged u0026amp surprisingly sympathetic survivalist u0026amp his feral son meanwhile his own life is coming apart at the seams u0026amp his country is leaving behind his off the grid clients \"creek\" is messy rule breaking storytelling haunting moving in the spirit of cormac mccarthy russell banks even faulkner it's an enthralling gamble that almost always pays off","946":"an astonishing book a riveting cast of likeable yet deeply flawed characters populating environments that pop with lucid detail add to this the satisfying conclusion that the whole thing hurls itself toward and you get a solid 5 star read","947":"it dragged i finally had to stop reading","948":" it took me a while to get into this one and i still think the author could have edited a good 50 pages off the first half but once i did get into it i was pretty hooked pete is a troubled alcoholic social working living in a small town in montana he comes in contact with several families dealing with dire situations including a malnourished boy who wanders in to town one day pete soon becomes embroiled with this boy and his survivalist father in a situation that becomes more and more dangerous meanwhile pete deals with the implosion of his own family when his teenage daughter runs away from home and into her own dangerous world reeling back and forth between pete and his daughter's stories as well as the stories of the people pete works with smith henderson weaves a rich interpretation of their lives good characters a compelling story and well written","949":"wow this is how it's done","950":"in this stunning debut novel set in the early reagan years we follow pete snow an obscure social worker in tenmile montana who covers vast rural areas as he tries to bring aid to the deeply troubled and abused children of parents living on the edge at work pete is kind helpful and competent even in the face of unbearable situations however off the job he is as soul wrenching as some of the people he is charged with assisting although he was raised in privilege pete is estranged from his impassive father and his wayward brother luke who flees town after punching his parole officer in the face pete separated from his wife beth after she cheated on him and lives in a cabin outside of town without electricity or gas taking showers at the courthouse he sees his teenage daughter rachel sporadically rachel wonders \"why does he help these other families when i miss him so much when i need him here why does he have to be the one \" one of the families to whom pete tries to bring comfort is the family of anarchist jeremiah pearl whose paranoid proselytizing has caught the attention of the fbi pearl is a menacing figure who keeps his malnourished 11 year old son benjamin on a tight tether away from society pete is able to forge a tenuous relationship with pearl and learns that his wife had visions that she believed signaled end times relying on these visions which alienated them from their family the pearls sold their possessions converting the proceeds into bullets seeds and gold packed up their six children and began to live off the grid pete splits his time between tending to benjamin and searching for his own runaway daughter who abruptly left her alcoholic mother's home in waco the story of what happened to jeremiah's wife and other children is slowly unveiled and devastating when it's finished as is the story of rachel's descent into the life of danger that meets teenage runaways henderson sets his novel in the wild beautiful and dangerous wilderness west of glacier national park the people who live here do so because they distrust the government \"some even objected to the delivery of mail\" and want to live free even if that means a struggle the book explores the tensions between freedom and community and individual rights and collective responsibilities henderson tells a story that is both intimate and grand with characters that are unforgettable","951":"so beautiful smith henderson is just an incredible writer he knows all the words and just through the syntax and cadence of his writing he transports you right there into the complex and messed up life of a social worker who is escaping his life in a small backwoods town in montana henderson's narrative becomes cinematic a page turner without giving up any of the poetry","952":" i still have about 40 pages to go on this book and i'm both desperate to read them and dreading this story coming to an end it's sitting on my desk mere centimetres away from my hands and i'm at work so if i can't read it i'm going to write about it and give it the 5 star rating that i think it deserves i don't think this is a book that i would have picked up without prompting or recommendation because it looks like a crime book is a new release and i've never heard of smith henderson before but it was discussed on the podcast literary disco which if you haven't listened to you should investigate which has introduced me to a number of wonderful books that i would otherwise probably have never noticed fourth of july creek is set in montana in the early 1980s and follows a couple of story lines that flow from the central character pete snow pete is a social worker who works with poor rural families in a tiny little town he has a dropkick brother who is constantly being chased by a parole officer an ex wife who has taken his teenage daughter interstate and gone off the rails and a series of clients with problems largely stemming from their poverty and the abuse that accompanies it his daughter goes missing he ends up getting entwined with a god fearing reclusive lunatic well kind of who at various times sees or considers paul to be the antichrist and there's an ebbing sense of foreboding that runs through the pages i kept expecting a twist - a murder a body a shoot out - something we go from following his daughter as she gets caught in a no good spiral being battered from place to place to the fate of the families he works with the development of his relationship with a colleague and the motley characters that flit in and out of the forest and live on the borderline of society this is one of those books that is satisfying for so many reasons not only is it un put downable it's a really really well written book there are sentences that just made me pause and put the book down to digest them and complex characters that you both love and want to strangle it's beautiful and engaging writing and the characters are believable and wonderfully drawn there are no perfect heroes and no straight up evil it's all a hashed mix up like real life i thoroughly enjoyed every page i don't want it to end this is definitely among my favourite books of this year if not ever","953":"this utterly fantastic novel one of my favorites of the year is about a social worker named pete snow in the early '80s in rural montana when he meets a kid who seems to live in the woods with his father -- an ardently anti government roughneck -- he does his best to empathize with the kid and his father amidst his own troubled family life he's left his cheating booze addled wife and soon his own teenage daughter runs away this is a novel that will stay with you long after you've finished","954":"i didn't actually read this in one day apparently i forgot to enter it as currently reading complete review later very well written really interesting characters dark scenarios flawed people realism","955":"after reading a scathing review by friend of mine i looked at the synopsis of this book and was intrigued thought to myself that it can't be that bad it wasn't terrible and if i could give it 3 5 stars i would think about it there are moments where i was pulled in and interested and moments where i could have cared less i don't know that for me if this book really pulls off all that the raving reviews say it does some maybe others just felt overdone i was more compelled by some of the side characters than that of pete but i couldn't hate him either if the books sounds good to you read it you may find some worthwhile things if it sounds like a maybe it probably isn't worth your time","956":" i'd give this 10 stars eleven i just slammed the cover of my kindle when i finished it and that's not easy to do i'm in awe of this book i feel like a bumbling idiot trying to describe it and no i'm not crying or anything but i could because this novel has a visceral pull that is truth itself dark yes but hopeful too running is a theme specifically running away there are many masks and facades lies attempts to avoid or re create a reality that is usually less shitty than the new version one to re read","957":"the story was good but the ending could have been more satisfying also the writer needs to cool it with the sentence fragments","958":"beautiful writing set in lincoln county montana of the 1980's felt very familiar not a light read but compelling and moving loved it","959":"this is a depressing book about damaged people who undergo endless indignities if you enjoy the suffering of others this book is for you","960":"well i was all set to dislike this one guns anti government extremists and a questionable narrator ugh right but i ended up really falling for this there was something very refreshing about they henderson captured the male relationships in this story both the complexities of pete main character and his daughter and his social worker clients as well as extremist jeremiah pearl and his 11 year old son the writing was great the plot engrossing an unexpectedly great read","961":" fourth of july creek pete snow a social worker with a heart a social worker who has as many issues as his clients but through his own pain through his own attempts to make things right through his misguided career pete is in everyone of us this is a very strong book that has no slow points most books i read of over 450 pages have those parts that you slog through not here every sentence has a purpose and there are no sections that you race through because you can only read landscape descriptions for so long you will see yourself your neighbors and your life somewhere in this book very well worth reading move this one way up on your list you'll be recommending it to friends and thinking about pete well into your next read","962":"one of the best books i've read in a long time","963":" several people recommended this book to me so i had high expectations the book failed to live up to them if i'd picked it up without having heard so much about it i might have liked it better the protagonist pete is a social worker in rural montana he works with dsyfunctional families his own marriage has fallen apart and he has very little contact with his own 13 year old daughter pete himself is more than a bit of a mess among his other failings he drinks way too much he is estranged from his father his brother is an ex con on the run from his parole officer a boy wanders into a local elementary school when the principal tries to restrain him the boy bites him social services is called and pete shows up the boy is dressed in rags and reeks of body odor pete tries to clean him up and buys him new clothes he then offers to take the boy home the boy guides him they meet up with his father daniel who is a right wing christian who believes the federal government is evil daniel initially distrusts pete pete tries to win his trust father and son disappear into the wilderness leaving pete to return to civilization by himself pete originally thinks that the father is insane but gradually he learns that federal law enforcement is searching for daniel and it becomes evident that daniel's paranoia may not be wholly unreasonable pete also realizes that daniel may be a better father than he himself is","964":"my favorite book i've read recently up there with all the light we cannot see though very different from that novel it's the perfect mixture of style and substance with an endlessly entertaining thought buoyed by inventive yet grounded writing highly recommended","965":" all the accolades this book author has received only makes this work more disappointing the book is 470 pages long and i keep trudging on expecting it to be building up to something rewarding but they all end weakly pete works for the department of family services in rural montana during the reagan era his daughter runs away his brother is in trouble after beating up a police officer and he gets stuck on the case of the pearl boy who lives up in the mountains with his dad the stories all have wild herrings henderson goes deep into each of the many side stories and they all fizzle out i was uncertain what genre it was because it builds like a mystery except nothing truly mysterious happens the book is clumsily put together in trying to throw a theme of these poor hopeless families and the kids that are caught up int he crossfires but instead of inducing sympathy it just leaves a cloying taste of sentimentality that a clueless author can reach there is some good bits of prose describing the rural scenery and despite it's clumsy plot the pages flew unfortunately the story just didn't land","966":" an excellent work raw unflinching and wholly unsentimental portrait of an underclass that is often if it is written at all written about with literary condescension abandoned children paranoid survivalists less than social workers who try to help both and the world of underage prostitution would not on face value make for a compelling read but this is it is because it is clearly written from a true place unlike many other such books that come out of some intellectual project or ideological comitment the humanity of each individual shines through and montana wilderness as well as depressed urban scene are made alive with exacting language this is hyper realism at its best an american roberto bolano if you will as such it is hard to believe that this is a first novel i am betting that henderson is not one of those many one book talents out there deserves more hoopla than it has gotten so far","967":"great five star book that sunk to 2 midway some great writing though","968":"excellent book challenging topic easy read","969":"nope not for me cringeworthingly crude at some parts altogether difficult for me to get into","970":"it's not often that one can describe a book as social work fiction but that is what this book is this book is also highly recommended for those with or without a bsw msw it is the story of pete snow a social worker working solo out of tenmile montana and his fractured family and his attempts to make everything right for both his clients and his family i was originally going to give this book four stars but then the ending happened and it was just right a truly good read","971":"i enjoyed the basic premise of this novel however the writing style just didn't work for me it was confusing to follow and made the plot seem like it was moving incredibly slow overall this wasn't a great read for me","972":"so well written and such great promise but he let you down","973":"the writing was a little choppy in an effort to be cool which it didn't need to be also he wrote the book of revelations a few times and the book is singular an editor should have caught this","974":"i did not like any of the characters in this book so i found it very hard to like the book as i read it i tried to remember what made me want to read this book because i did not enjoy reading it at all","975":"outstanding despite being bleak fourth of july creek is an amazingly lyrical novel smith henderson is a gifted writer his language is masterful and he has crafted a completely immersive compelling story i'm so sad that it's over","976":"if you fly in the rarefied air of literary awards you may have caught smith henderson's name a few years ago when he won a pushcart prize and a pen emerging writers award a 41 year old advertising writer originally from montana henderson has published a few stories in literary magazines that like exotic birds are known to exist but are rarely spotted those days of obscurity are over his first novel \"fourth of july creek \" is the best book i've read so far this year on a gamble that seems sure to pay off his publisher is releasing 100 000 copies and he's working on a tv adaptation the product of more than a decade's work this richly plotted novel is another sign if any were needed that new fiction writers are still telling vibrant essential stories about the american experience in so many ways the story henderson tells here describes an american experience most of us never have to see -- but should far from big cities or either coast his characters are the poor and working poor in sparsely populated towns that few escape and no one ever moves to for these people who spend every cent they earn a layoff an illness even a car repair bill can collapse a whole family and the ones most violently upended by those misfortunes are children pete snow the protagonist of \"fourth of july creek \" knows such children well a social worker in montana in the early 1980s he belongs to that class of municipal servants who show up as the police handcuff a raging father or the medics zip mom's needle marked body into a bag while the sheriff carries a gun pete wields his clipboard armed only with free diapers and soup cans he stares down proud angry parents who are contemptuous of big government but hungry for government aid dazed by the infinite creativity of sexual abuse but blessed with the dexterity of hope he keeps struggling to make damaged families work one day he has to remind a young mother that her baby can't feed itself another day he's got to convince a faithful man that sin didn't poison his wife and none of this often futile work takes place on anything like a predictable schedule the law may dawdle for months over what to do with an addict but her little girl needs a safe place to sleep tonight the social worker is a tempting figure to beatify and god knows these low paid overburdened people deserve all the veneration we can give them but henderson who once worked at a group home for juveniles is too fine a writer to set a wooden saint at the center of his novel instead he gives us a flawed and wounded hero pete may save others but he can't hold his own family together he's left his adulterous wife and bitter teenage daughter and now lives in a cabin without electricity he showers at the courthouse when his no good brother appeals for help pete tells him \"will you just get back in your truck and go \" the endless labor of patching up desperate strangers provides a comforting way to ignore his own derelict life as he drunkenly admits one night to his wife \"i take kids away from people like us \"like those other ad men turned novelists peter carey and salman rushdie henderson knows how to create the sensation that we're being propelled through a story that's just as poignant as it is frightening infused with psychological complexity and lush with the landscape of the northwest the novel barrels along with the chaotic demands of pete's job and family from crisis to crisis to quiet scenes of despair at unexpected moments the narration shifts briefly into the second person placing us right in pete's life and that larger story is interrupted by snippets of dialogue between two unnamed figures talking about the harrowing plight of pete's daughter it's a complex structure that could easily grow unwieldy but henderson choreographs these parts so masterfully that the novel is never less than wholly engaging pete's most challenging case which becomes the story's focus involves a scurvy 11 year old boy who wanders up to a school playground and speaks \"in the clipped cadence of a pow announcing at one point that he'd renounced his citizenship \" returning the boy to his home in the forest pete meets the boy's dad a survivalist named jeremiah pearl and so begins a perilous relationship between these two troubled fathers each trying to save his own child from the evils of the world pearl -- \"tribulation ready race war ready\" -- seems at first a spooky gothic creature slipping silently through the woods spending coins with holes punched in the presidents' heads but illuminated by henderson's sympathy this tortured zealot becomes both victim and villain an endlessly fascinating character caught in the confluence of personal tragedy and america's darkest fears here is the millennial complex in full bloom the craziest most poisonous expression of anti government paranoia fueled by a corrupted brand of christianity obsessed with tangled biblical prophecies pearl announces \"i am dynamite\" and hunkers down with his guns and his gold the last thing he'll accept is some godless social worker trying to tempt his children with the devil's medicine but pete is determined to serve families wherever they are no matter how loopy they may seem and in a similar way this novel is engaged in the hard work of understanding people we usually write off in disgust pursued by the four horsemen of ignorance poverty drugs and illness who wouldn't think the apocalypse is nigh as pete's personal life spirals out of control pearl's radical break from civilization offers an alluring kind of solace a relief from his complicated failings but can pete win the anarchist's trust before he sparks a deadly confrontation with government officials who suffer from their own brand of paranoia all week i was looking for opportunities to slip back into these pages and follow the trials of this rural social worker the greatness of \"fourth of july creek\" stems from henderson's ability to subtly tie the struggles of one ordinary man to the broader currents of american culture both its blessings and its evils the result is a story that is simultaneously intimate and grand written in a style athletic enough to capture a spectacular range of harrowing events these may be the end times for jeremiah pearl but they're just the beginning for smith henderson from the washington post http www washingtonpost com enterta","977":"kept my interest the entire length of the book wonderful","978":" your caseload is brutal and will get worse as the holidays steadily advance on the poor deranged and demented debut novelist henderson smith has written a tale about rural america that is both bleak and suffused with a bone dry wit most of us do not have any reason to deal with the department of family services in our state but in my job as a psychiatric pediatric rn in austin i have my fair share of in and out of state hook ups on the phone or they come to us here in the outback bergs of montana pete snow bachelor of social work drop out of the master's program is the go to person for the most extreme and sometimes most dangerous cases involving crises and sometimes threats to life an alcoholic whose partying wife has left him and taken their teenage daughter pete has a pretty sorry excuse for a personal life except for his loyalty to a few friends and the hard cases he works in his work pete gets the job done his tools are his clipboard and pen and if the law shows up with a gun he uses his wiles to disarm them usually his clients are typically poverty stricken and lawless and dependent on the system that they resent the children are the ones that pete wants to help the most the often innocent and vulnerable that are headed for a lifetime of institutional living to his irresponsible wife he has said i take kids away from people like us his daughter has run away while in the care of his ex and now he is desperate to find her while still invested in his work at home in the meantime he is shutting out his brother an outlaw on the run snow's no hero perhaps a flawed anti hero he should be more jaded than he is but that is snow's endearing quality he just never gives up on his daughter or his cases these absences were twinned in pete's mind as if the one could not be solved without the other and he harbored the absurd hope that the revelation of the one would reveal the other the two cases he struggles with are cecil a violent and sexually deviant son of an abusive parent and a feral child named benjamin who lives in the wilderness with his anarchist survivalist father jeremiah pearl pearl is already a living legend haven taken american coins and punched holes in the presidents' heads the coins have made their way around pawnshops and collectors jeremiah spouts an extreme christian dogma that may be dangerous to himself his son and the world at large including pete it becomes evident that pete snow is compelled by his isolation and connection to the fringes of society he lives in a primitive cabin no electricity in tenmile and showers at the courthouse they put up with snow's eccentricities and the way he pushes the envelope because his compassion and dedication is consummate and tireless this is a sweeping tale about tough human questions such as what freedoms are compromised for assistance for food clothing and essentials what price do people pay to meet maslow's lowest hierarchy of needs is it fair to force someone with crushing demons into a society that demonizes and crushes him even more can you effectively help others when your own life and family is falling apart the big questions of sovereignty safety family and the pursuit of well individual liberty is well wrought and teeming with moral ambiguity smith henderson knows his geographical areas he is from montana and participated in the michener writer's program here in austin where part of the novel takes place this confidently written brutal take no prisoners tale does not read like a debut novel i know that smith worked at a juvenile group home a superb place to gather grit for this kind of story to study the characters of children living outside of societal norms it is well plotted focusing on character but building to a nail biting conclusion","979":"fourth of july creek by smith hendersonpete a falling apart on again off again drunk montana social worker encounters an nearly feral 11 year old with a bad case of giardiasis named ben and his survivalist father and forges a bond of sorts with them pete would like it to become friendship but the father jeremiah pearl is paranoid maybe insane trust beyond the most tentative is impossible between them no matter how pete tries to help the pearls with food vitamins and medicines clothes jeremiah sees him as the agent of the occupation zog for those who don't know zog stands for zionist occupational government which some survivalists see as the visible manifestation of the jews' takeover of america jeremiah is always waiting for the black helicopters to swoop down on him everything he sees or hears is a sign of the arrival of the antichrist the impending apocalypse the hidden controls a satanic government and a damned people impose on the few remaining pure what happens between them is scary pete's life away from the pearls is heartbreaking his ex wife is a good time girl who lives on a diet of drugs alcohol and short term sex her daughter rachel runs away partly to escape her mother's boyfriends partly just to get free of her mother this is a very good book by a talented young author fourth of july creek is breathtaking and heartbreaking 4 8","980":"rough characters each and everyone a reality check for some of us some bits of this book were tedious it seemed to me he was not that passionate about finding his daughter but yet he seemed so passionate about the care of three other young ones","981":"i loved this book so much i'm not sure exactly how to explain why i loved it the way henderson portrays the poverty and desperation of his characters is so heartbreaking and real as a reader you cannot help but loose yourself in the lives of these very fallible and broken individuals","982":"i did not enjoy this book supposedly it was one of the 100 notable books for 2014 i found it very disjointed and hard to follow","983":"i'm going to throw out a few cliches here heartbreaking beautiful sad real amazing i usually read books that don't require a lot of thinking or even a great deal of feeling this book made me think and feel deeply and that wasn't always comfortable the astonishingly stupid choices of pete and rose and basically all the other characters was hard to read but totally worth it","984":"henderson takes your breath away occasionally makes you roll your eyes with some almost too too creative writing but the story the characters the setting the urgency of the pursuit of the main character's runaway daughter his frustration with the families he's trying to help especially with a father and son who won't come out of the woods paranoid survivalists wind up this book into one you cannot put down one quibble there are no good women except a foster mom we don't meet no wife or mother does well by her children or spouse no girlfriend is true i hope tom bissell my writing teacher at portland state now off to make his fortune reads this book it's what he told us to write give it everything you have smith henderson has certainly done that","985":" i received a copy of this book thanks to the publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review i have had to let this book digest for 24 hours after finishing it before writing my review to let my thoughts and feelings settle around it it was one of the most conflicting reads i have read for a long time i swung between loving the sheer brilliance of it to struggling to even place what was going on at times it's not an easy flow read let's put it that way set in the mountains valleys and close knit communities of rural montana in the early 1980s fourth of july creek is a dark powerful debut novel about a young social worker called pete who struggles to hold together the lives of the most dysfunctional inhabitants of the town of tenmile as his own life begins to fall apart pete is a social worker placed in a really difficult community setting his cases are not easy ones and quite frankly he's got a really tough job he's a complex character i could not connect with him until the latter half of the book he evaded me in the first half as i struggled to grasp what he was really all about he drinks a lot and seems to be his own man not terribly accountable to anyone with the work that he does we don't hear of a boss or supervisor it's a bit like he is free wheeling in the job doing what he wants when he wants everybody is raving about this being a brilliantly written novel now being really honest whilst the writing is clever and unique i struggled at times to grasp what was going on i had to step back many times to re read and process how what was being written related to the scenario on the page sometimes there was so many words around situations that i got lost in the writing and missed the message i am hoping that makes some sense pete has a couple of major cases to manage all very complex ones this is not a book that lifts the spirits or the mood it's dark brooding sad depressing even this is life in rural montana frankly it's not real great for some people there is poverty violence sadness ruin drug abuse child abuse yup it's all here the joy of being a social worker aside from pete's work we get to follow some of his own family issues again they are not easy ones and have much complexity to them the writing style changes through the book also which can be disjointing around his family situation when his daughter is speaking it's written like a qu0026amp a format like she is being interviewed by an unknown face and responding i got it but it's a big switch from the wordy fluid writing around it it's like reading more than one book at at time it does all click together eventually but you really have to stick it out i enjoyed the second half of the book a lot more once we got into more detail around the families and their situation that pete is trying to help he goes beyond the parameters of his job so we know he has a good heart but he's the most unlikely of helpers he puts himself into some fairly risky situations at times and it's mostly thankless the story behind jeremiah pearl his family and his touting of religious scripture that the antichrist was alive and well in the world and that everyone was someone to be feared was really good this is a family caught up in a cult like mentality around end of the world prophecy and scripture it's incredibly real and gritty the way it's portrayed and some of the outcomes for this family are just darn horrific and terrifying but it's an interesting storyline within the book i also found the journey that pete has with his teenage daughter was good especially once we started to see things from her perspective to see how she was living and how she saw the world it was raw and powerful in summary overall i found this book quite hard to read i know it's got a lot of rave reviews but for me it just did not flow and took up too much thinking and processing and reviewing to enjoy it fully i think many will love it and many will not for me it was a not","986":"pete snow you will be hard to forget","987":"this is five stars because the author made me care about a wingnut conspiracy freak who let his child suffer all manner of exposure and misery because of his lifestyle and beliefs it's five stars because the writing was some of the best i've read this or any year it's five stars because it was the kind of book i could sink into and be lost definitely file on the favorites shelf","988":"wow and my book friends know i don't say wow about a book all that often incredible writing i could see all the characters in my mind's eye and i worried about them when i wasn't reading not for everyone a lot of dysfunctional lives in this story but what an incredible story it was in many best of 2014 lists and it deserves to be there","989":"rarely have i been so moved by a novel so beautifully constructed that it gave me the false impression that it was written effortlessly stop what you're doing and read this important book","990":"so sad to give this just 2 stars i just did not enjoy this read... and kept hoping that the next page...or the next page... or maybe this next page would start to wrap things up or tie things together... but it just didn't happen and i could not scrape together anything beyond apathy for the characters in this story i just did not care about any of them... and still am wondering why the heck the reader had to suffer through the affair between pete and may... what the heck was that about and why didn't it contribute at all to the story cut that stuff out and the story was still the same this was a fabulous and vey descriptive explanation of what is the life of a social worker like ...do not read this if your heart and soul are set on that career... i really felt like the author knew that line of work inside and out i m sad that i never could get a grip on any feeling for this story","991":"i can't stop thinking about this book i want to but i can't","992":"set in the wilderness of northwestern montana social worker pete snow attempts to gain the trust of a survivalist and his son while at his own family falls apart","993":"pete snow is a social worker in wyoming his territory is incredibly large he is divorced or divorcing with one teenage daughter the book is primarily written from his perspective though many of the chapters have a small section from the daughter's rachel rose perspective the story is set in the 1980s to be blunt pete is a mess he is an alcoholic his daughter runs away and takes up a life of prostitution one of the children he sponsors ends up in a juvenile detention center prison the sister of that child is removed from her mother's care the day the mother is arrested in a dea raid this same day pete is arrested this mother who turns out to have abused her son the child in detention dies in jail of a heart attack pete is also trying to help benjamin pearl and his father jeremiah pete frequently asks about the pearl family members and finally realizes they are dead it turns out that mrs pearl killed all of her children except for benjamin because she thought they were possessed by satan turns out they ate ice tainted with listeriosis just to add to the mix pete is also estranged from his father who later dies and extremely annoyed with his brother luke who ends up hiding from his parole officer who is later killed by benjamin because benjamin thinks the parole officer is going to hurt pete the story is actually quite interesting it just in my opinion meanders too much and could have done with a heavier editorial hand see the paragraph above for an example i ended up not liking anyone and feeling very sorry for most of the families and people with whom pete interacted i pray to god that the social worker system in wyoming was never as bad as it appeared to be with pete as an employee","994":"well written and engaging but man so bleak too bleak","995":"it's a beautifully written book some breathtaking risks with language there are gradual shocks in the plot that you should see coming but don't","996":"this book was really hard for me to finish i almost quit reading it several times i only kept going because it received such rave reviews by so many people i really liked the first quarter of the book i was drawn to the characters and was interested in what would happen to them i sure found out every single character descended into the most bleak and depressing life circumstances ever alcoholism check daughter runs away and becomes a prostitute on the street check mental illness check sexual abuse in the foster care system check nobody was spared i can understand and even expect a lot of grim happenings in a book about a social worker and the horrors he sees but when his own somewhat normal family life turns out to be worse than many of the cases he works it's just overkill it was depressing and not in a way that makes you feel like you've learned something about life or the world and are better for it just in a way that leaves you wondering why you kept going back and opening the book because it's just draining i know i'm in the minority but i'm giving it two stars for the good beginning but no more for the way it finished","997":"loved this though it broke my heart the writing is beautiful and sparse i was so caught up in this story i rushed through 250 pages last night i finally had to stop because i couldn't keep my eyes open another second it has been a while since i have felt such a strong pull to find out what would happen","998":"disappointingwhile i finished the book and found it interesting i was expecting a lot more based on other reviews it is hard to get really invested when you don't actual k y like any of the characters or care what happens to them","999":"just too depressing didn't get past the first 100 pages","1000":"70's montana social worker does his best dealing with the problems of others while his own life is falling apart","1001":" i would give this book 3 1 2 stars if the rating system would allow as a social worker pete has seen and done it all this book chronicles his life as it spirals out of control and gives a gritty and realistic portrayal of the stress involved with such a job my biggest problem with this book is that the story needed to be tightened up a bit it was all over the place and the continuity of the story was lost the author did a great job breathing life into his characters however and i am looking forward to reading more by him in the future","1002":"pete snow is a walking contradiction as a social worker for the department of family services in montana he spends his working hours trying to rescue troubled and often neglected or abused children he is preternaturally kind patient helpful and non judgmental but off the job we see that pete is no stronger than the people he is charged with helping perhaps he has such empathy for them because he is just like them he is an alcoholic a failed husband and father he is estranged from his own father and brother he is in short a mess anguish seems to be his natural default emotion we meet pete in a family scene where a young girl is nearly drowned by her father it turns out that the father is pete his unfortunate daughter rachel lives in a household with two dysfunctional alcoholic parents she really needs a social worker to save her but she is not so fortunate eventually the parents separate and she lives with her mother pete becomes just an occasional visitor to her life it should really be a surprise to no one when as a young teenager she runs away from home and begins a life on the streets much of the book in fact deals with pete's desperate efforts to find and retrieve his runaway daughter while most of the narrative is told through pete's perspective interspersed throughout are sections told in q and a conversation format with rachel we see her doing whatever she needs to do to survive on her own all of this though is just a subplot that helps us to better understand the wounded psyche of pete snow the main action of the book deals with pete on the job as he struggles against seemingly insurmountable odds to save three children a sullen teenager named cecil his sweet little sister katie and benjamin pearl the son of a backwoods conspiracy theorist paranoid survivalist named jeremiah pearl in trying to help the kids pete makes mistake after mistake and often despairs that he will ever be able to get them out of the awful soul wrenching situations in which they live eventually he does have some success with katie the little girl with whom he has bonded and in whom he sees perhaps a reflection of his own lost daughter her brother cecil is a much harder nut to crack cecil sabotages every move pete makes to try to help him until he too runs away and winds up on the street where remarkably enough he does find a friend soon enough though he runs afoul of the law and winds up in a nightmare juvenile facility from which pete works to extract him meanwhile a dirty scruffy almost feral boy wanders into town and into the school pete is called to deal with the boy this is his introduction to benjamin pearl the case that will consume his time throughout the remainder of the book through benjamin he meets jeremiah who is immersed in end times ideology he has a hoard of gold that he will exchange for buffalo head nickels so that he can deface them with anti government and anti semitic imagery these mutilated nickels have become very popular in the anarchistic backwoods of montana where they are collector's items curiously and against all odds a bond develops between jeremiah and pete perhaps pete sees a bit of himself in the man since he too feels that he has ruined everything in his life it seems incredible that this is smith henderson's first novel it is packed with eloquent evocative prose that describes in exquisite detail the grim hardscrabble lives of its characters those characters themselves are unforgettable they are beset with every form of human frailty and yet they have a dignity that is hard to deny at some point in the book there is a line about how all of life can be understood as casework as someone who spent all of her working life in the field of social work i found myself nodding at that sentiment finally henderson's writing reminded me of the work of another writer i pondered about who it was and finally it came to me richard ford he has the same kind of eloquence with a rather spare style i was particularly reminded of ford's canada that's pretty good company i think and this gripping story stands up well in comparison","1003":"after reading a lot of great praise for this novel i was really excited to read it i think it almost could have been written as two separate novels with that being said i found the story of peter and rachel the most compelling parts of the the novel","1004":"it wasn't the worse book i've ever read and i think the blame for my lower rating was i'd heard all the praise and was anxiously awaiting this boom moment where the book would live up to everything i wanted it was a fine story with a average hero dealing with helping others while his life is a complete wreck the poor hero just can't seem to catch a break","1005":"this is a really great book that taunts me to find a shelf any shelf to put it upon as far as the title of the book i came up with an alternate title alcoholic social worker works with some backward redneck types in small town montana while neglecting the needs of his family of course fourth of july creek works well also this really is an amazing piece of literature that i think would be a good read for any book lover the story is one of those that just gets under your skin so go find a copy and read it","1006":" i thought this was an amazing book the characters were complex and the dialogue spot on pete is a social worker in rural montana in the 1980s frankly this story could have taken place in southern ohio west virginia or any of the hollers of kentucky or tennessee peter's territory is vast he sees the worst of human nature the druggies the abusers the neglectful the indifferent he struggles to support and save these children when he can't even save his own family this a real and very gritty story the book relates a very american existence that most of us never experience the families are often the others in society the drifters the separatists the conspiracy theorists the isolationists the odd ones out i found myself completely drawn in by these family dramas and then sucker punched it is a bleak book but brilliantly written don't read it if you like neat little endings wrapped in a bow you will be disappointed but if you would like to immerse yourself in a fine piece of writing this is it","1007":"would've been a 4 5 but rounded up because the main character is a social worker like me enjoyed that the story kept me coming back for more and that the writing kept me engaged line by line also enjoyed that this isn't a social work story or a story about a social worker so much as it is an interesting story w strong writing that happens to have a social worker as the protagonist i try not to read work related stuff when not on the clock","1008":"well written with interesting plots that didn't quite come together for me felt like two novellas in one book although i understood the characters i didn't like them i know very bougie of me to want to like the characters ultimately depressing because they were such marginal human beings and i know there are probably many people like them in the world","1009":"good twists and dark turns social commentary nice summer read","1010":"this debut novel by smith henderson is really amazing the plot the characters the writing it's all first rate and absolutely compelling i could not possibly compose a review to do this book justice so i defer to ron charles' review in the washington post http www washingtonpost com enterta","1011":"i wanted to like this book but it really was a mix of what's going to happen next and utter boredom just like the show longmire","1012":"wow great first novel","1013":" i've decided to leave my catholic school girl guilt aside and stop reading books that do not grab me at page 99 i have decided to do just that with this debut novel that gets rave reviews and one i was looking forward to getting lost in there are some wonderfully captured scenes but overall the writing kept jarring me out of the story something about the way it is written a social worker whose life is as nuts as those he tries to help is an interesting premise but i simply do not care about pete and am not invested enough to see how this

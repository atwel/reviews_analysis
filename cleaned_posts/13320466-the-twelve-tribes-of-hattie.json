get into it","2":"if i had stopped at the end of chapter 1 i would have given this book 5 stars so well written so touching so human the writing has stayed at a 4 5 but the format of the book did not keep my interest and intensity each chapter is from another child tribe perspective and we get neither enough of their life to care or less of their life so as to keep the flow going i liked it but didn't love it although i bet there's a kick ass book in her future","3":"i liked the idea of each chapter told from another character's perspective yet the story lacked a thread tying stories together also out of 11 children not one was decent","4":"good book not a lot of action but a good read none the less","5":"much ado about nothing i feel like i have wasted a few of my precious hours here on earth trying to figure out for no reason at all why this book was written","6":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here excellent will read again the complexities of wife mother lover and child hattie august philadelphia jubilee floyd cassie bell alice billups franklin ruth margaret sala willie walter evelyn","7":"i am not a big fan of short stories and that is what i felt i was reading in reading this novel i did not like that to me the characters did not have a chance to develop as they only had one chapter each i think hattie's story itself would have been more than enough to concentrate on instead of having it all about her children","8":"amazing book of a women that has 12 kids and gets blamed for everything that happens in their life's each chapter is a story about one of her kids must read also rated number two best book in oprah's book club","9":"i would really give this book a 3 5 rating the writing is elegant inlanguage and description it almost felt like a series of short stories tied together by the strength and authority of the dominantcharacter hattie excellent debut novel","10":"beautiful storytelling but unrelenting sadness for the characters i thought the ending was abrupt","11":"this book gripped me from the start i would have loved a chance to hear more about some of her children but each chapter pulled me in and held me i am glad i read this after the warmth of other suns which educated me on the great migration much more than my us history and sociology classes throughout the years there was a lot of sadness in hattie's and her children's lives ayana mathis writes about it and everything else beautifully","12":"incredible series of vignettes that tells a powerful story of humanity's response to it's environment i'd love to write more but goodreads has placed an annoying popup on the screen for some stupid contest that can't be moved not well played goodreads annoying","13":"enjoyed fast paced but too shallow a result of the structure of the book really 3 5 stars if you could do that on good reads","14":"recommended by oprah and i did expect more from the book so much more could have been done with the story glad to have read it but not sure of who i'd recommend it to within my friends","15":"this oprah recommendation is really excellent great writing and storeis you won't want to put down","16":"interesting to read but the stories of each child pretty much had nothing in common but bad choices and pain despite the pain in the book i wasnt moved or inspired by their stories it was just sad","17":"i really liked this book and as this is ayana mathis' first novel then i am really impressed hattie's story and the stories of her offspring was truly inspiring and entertaining i recommend it highly","18":" for much of this book i thought it would be a 3 star book but in the end i'm giving it a 4 star rating why because the story grew on me the already pregnant hattie got married at 16 and left the jim crow south for the marginally better north and then she continued to have baby after baby her story and the stories of her family are sad and angry filled with sad and angry people initially i just couldn't connect with the characters nothing drew me into the story the characters sometimes try too hard to be who they are not sometimes hide their true selves under what they want the world to see often are harder and more flawed than we would like them to be and in the end they are altogether human the story jumps from character to character occasionally making me wonder \" who is this person and have i already met him \" and there are some i felt i needed to know more about they all tie together as part of hattie's tribe the writing is very good especially for a debut novel it is descriptive but not overly flowery i could see through the characters eyes things that i could not have seen through my own this is not an uplifting feel good kind of story and it is not filled with action and adventure but in the end it comes down to family i am glad i read it thank you to the publisher for providing an advance reader's edition for my review","19":" spoiler alert i had heard a lot about this title and was pleased to find the audio book at the library i was prepared to enjoy it very much it was interesting but it left me wanting so much more the characters and situations were fascinating but i felt that i had invested days in hattie and her family and never really got to know any of them the book felt more like a collection of short stories a series of people who lived in various places during the decades from the early 1900s to 1980 the family tie seemed contrived and artificial i wanted to believe that i was getting a glimpse into the lives of the people who migrated to northern cities at the turn of the century that i was being granted a view of the their tribulations triumphs and everyday activities but the author clung to such typical characters and situations the womanizing and unambitious husband the stoic and determined mother who buries her first born and her heart and struggles for the survival of herself and her children the drug taking musician who turns out to maybe be gay the drunken soldier who abandons his wife and child the emotionally damaged boy who takes joy in causing pain to others the promising young girl who turns to parties and bad boys the desperate girl who chooses an unhappy but wealthy marriage the mentally ill daughter who cannot care for her own child where did all of this come from there were individual incidents explored in this book but i got no real sense of the household other than the fact that it was bleak and loveless no laughter or light yet hattie was raised differently and i can't believe she didn't make an effort to provide a hint of gentility did hattie not instill anyone with the spark that might make them capable of breaking free of the poverty of their youth was hattie so incapable of love that she personally damaged every child she had clearly the answer to these questions is yes but the author does not tell me how or why each vignette was lacking the details that would tell me how that person ended up in that situation one daughter met and married a doctor how did that come about","20":"the chapters are very disconnected because each one concentrates on a different character the characters never connect into a cohesive story i ended up putting it down after reading more than three quarters of the book i felt i was wasting my time on a story that was never going to come together","21":"beautiful writing descriptive and very much captures human experience some slow parts and at times disjointed many layered story which is a strength but in a few instances the loose ends don't seem to be all tied up complex in a mostly very good way","22":"i received this book from a goodreads firstreads giveaway i'm not a fan of short stories and never really have been mostly i dislike them because the beginning of a book is always the hardest for me learning and remembering names characters locations etc i prefer the meat of a novel and short stories usually don't have any meat they are snapshots of a time in a character's life this novel felt like a series of short stories each chapter was about another child of hattie's but that child was very rarely if ever mentioned throughout the rest of the book not one child was in a sibling's story so during each chapter it felt like starting all over again learning the character etc and one chapter was not enough for me to connect with the character there wasn't a point in the book where i really cared about what happened to the character because i knew they wouldn't be mentioned again if you enjoy short stories this novel is well written there is power in the author's language and i would try another novel written by her out of this one though i wish there had been more connection among the characters","23":"a great american novel ingenious setup to get many very intense stories all together the writing takes you right into these scenes in philadelphia and the south as the 20th century zooms by i hope mathis will publish more soon there are certainly some underlying plot lines read the first two chapters at least they are phenomenal","24":"while the writing was strong and each character grabbed you individually i missed the connections usually established in a novel each chapter stands on it's own as a short story and you do occasionally re visit another family member here and there the strong links i would expect between family members especially these who struggle so are not made or explored","25":"i gave it 4 stars not because i was particularly taken with the content but the way mathis portrayed the characters in each chapter i will have a much more coherent review up soon because my thoughts are all over the place","26":"collection of stories about each of hattie's twelve children each chapter is the story ozone or more of her children somewhere i read that this is an allusion to the twelve tribes of jacob from the bible like the bible the chapters are not in chronological order curious to hear more about this and other allusions at book club this week","27":"i really didn't like the way this book was organized each chapter tells a story about one of her kids but doesn't give much background or closure stories were sad and compelling though","28":"another book that i was expecting great things from considering it was an oprah's pick it is the story of hattie and her children spanning quite a few decades from 1920's onwards it was her struggle to raise a huge family moving from the south to philadelphia after the great depression with a husband who was useless to her other than getting her pregnant i felt that the characters were not developed as strongly as they could have been giving more insight to the reader for their actions they all seemed to have a hopeless air about them with no room for improving their circumstances at all","29":" fifteen year old hattie shepherd leaves her home in georgia and migrates to philadelphia with her mother and two sisters hoping for a better life what she sees in her newly adopted home state astounds her blacks and whites walking side by side a black woman looking at a white flower vendor man in the eye and not getting attacked when she accidentally drops one of his arrangements no black cowering when a white person passes by etc this more thankful life is what she wants and yet she ends up getting married to a good for nothing womanizer and bearing eleven children still the birth of her first two children twins brings a new kind of hope into her life until she loses both of them to pneumonia six months later this tragedy changes her so much that none of her following nine children ever get to see hattie's warmer loving side through twelve different narrators the twelve tribes of hattie captures hattie's and her family's lives spanning decades between 1923 and 1980 this book had received plenty of hype after having been picked by oprah for her book club i haven't had much success with oprah's picks the few i did read turned out to be sob stories that i couldn't appreciate much i wanted to read this one however for many reasons one i generally enjoy the literary device of using more than a few narrators in a book this ploy when done well gives me the feel of multiple perspectives into a situation two i really love the cover of this book unfortunately this book served to convince me further that my luck with oprah's picks may not change anytime soon the twelve tribes of hattie while well written and filled with a motley of characters that were as different as possible disappointed me with its poor handling of its many narrators when the book opens hattie is trying to do all she can to cure her babies of pneumonia her methods were more quack like and not effective enough after a devastating few pages where i hoped deeply that the babies would come out of it she lost them that was a beautiful first chapter after that the book stopped working for me in a chronological manner we follow her other children some of whom are branching out into their own futures but everyone still had a foot in their past and plenty of impressions about their mother and how she didn't love them enough but still loved them dearly hattie was supposed to be the link between all these chapters but i didn't feel her to be a strong enough presence to knit the stories together without any core character to be invested in and with the diverging nature of the stories and rarely any follow ups later in the book my attention waned besides i didn't feel the same intrigue in any of the chapters that the first chapter had one thing i did love about the book was how well the author showed the passage of time in the african american community between 1923 and 1980 that was a dynamic and radical period even in american history you could almost see the change in perceptions initially there is a lot of mention of racism but as the stories go on it happens less and less the narrators towards the end of the stories had a lot more freedom than there ever was initially some of the characters work initially as the help in the homes of many white families but towards the end the characters themselves have hired help many events of historical importance show up in this book some prominently others subtly still despite its plus points the twelve tribes of hattie was ultimately a disappointment for me","30":"i loved and hated this book it was an incredible look at the impact of poverty poor healthcare availability discrimination mental health challenges and just the struggles of a poor family in this country we call ours it's angela's ashes and glass castles with its own twists and turn","31":" this is not going to be a great review so i will just say i loved this book i'm not even sure why but i loved it i think because it showed the hardships of those who were part of the great migration how their lives turned out how their children's lives turned out i loved the way the author let hattie's story unfold through the stories of her children i loved the way it ended for me the ending was ultimately hopeful and redemptive word of warning there is some rough language in parts though this isn't excessive and none of it felt gratuitous to me i felt it was appropriate for the character and the situation","32":"this book blew me away it's so beautifully written you really need to read this as if it's a book of related short stories told chronologically","33":"it was an easy read i did not like how each character had one chapter and never talked about again","34":"i started reading this book when i boarded a train to take me home after christmas four hours later by the time i arrived home i had finished it i really liked the way the book was laid out with each chapter representing one of hattie's children the writing is masterful and i couldn't put this book down i highly recommend it","35":"ayana mathis deftly crafts a series of vignettes each surrounding a turning point in the lives of the children of hattie an african american teenage bride who married beneath her through the lives of her children hattie's story unfolds in tragic beauty mathis' spare writing masterfully draws you in and should become as much of a classic on the great migration as lorraine hansberry's play a raisin in the sun","36":" i feel wrung out after reading this raw heartbreaking and bleak but so real and beautiful too other reviewers suggest it is more like a collection of short stories and is full of dysfunction and unlike able characters i agree that it will not to be everyone's taste however i see it simply as the story of a family and in particular a mother who did what she could with what she had in the only way she knew hattie and her family's complex and flawed characters were written with such authenticity that i was totally absorbed in their lives i was left wanting more however this unfinished feeling seemed deliberate suggesting that life will go on for these characters for better or worse","37":"in a way i thought of this book as the fiction companion to the warmth of other suns with so many characters over so many decades it was sometimes a little challenging to keep everything straight but as a series of stories of the ways that the great migration impacted families lives it was really lovely","38":"it's good to be reminded to take a step back from daily activities to love and nurture your children","39":"phenomenal storyline you won't be sorry for reading this one","40":"this is a selection for one of my book clubs hattie has moved from georgia to philadelphia in 1925 part of the great migration each chapter is about a different one of hattie's children at different points in time none of them seemed to have very happy lives which i know is true of many people one of the main things i like about reading is the ability to travel in other shoes other lives and other places but sometimes it's not very enjoyable","41":"i was expecting something a little more faulkner esque with intertwining narratives but ultimately i'm glad mathis kept the narratives chronological but otherwise separate each fleshes out hattie's children's lives and in doing so fleshes out hattie herself","42":"deeply moving story of hattie and her children","43":"character development was lacking very powerful ending if you didn't fall asleep in the middle","44":"this is a very difficult book to rate i think the writing was very good and the idea of using a different point of view for each chapter was interesting and powerful having said that it made for a very disjointed book with a lot of open threads left i have a difficult time when storylines are not resolved i'd be interested in reading her next book i think she could be a writer to watch in the future","45":"depressing no wrap up at the end felt as if each chapter left you with questions","46":"terrific book no wonder oprah recommended it","47":"3 5 stars i enjoy novels in the form of loosely connected short stories and this one was no exception the author does a wonderful job of forming the characters and i enjoyed catching glimpses at earlier characters as i moved through the book hattie is the character that truly strings all of the narratives together it is her influence and detached sense of duty that makes all of her children who they are after escaping from georgia to philadelphia with her family at the age of fifteen she struggles to raise her nine surviving children always dreaming of owning a house of her own we learn who she is by how her children view her the subject of the great migration is interesting in its own right and seems to be well represented in mathis' story certainly a book worth reading particularly for readers with an interest in twentieth century historical fiction","48":"i tried to lower my expectations for this book so that i wouldn't be disappointed by all of the hype surrounding it but i was surprised to find myself enjoying it very much i had also wondered how such a short book could adequately give the perspective of so many characters but it succeeded admirably i love the author's writing style with not a word wasted","49":"extremely well written the stories of each of hattie's children weave together and each chapter is like it's own short story as you work your way through the tribes you do get a sense of who hattie is and of her relationship with her husband august but i also found that with each chapter i really wanted to know more about each character and about the way the family interacted with each other than was presented here and although the ending is hopeful the book sort of just stops and you are left thinking that you need to turn the page but there isn't one to turn to","50":"i liked this book it was a little heavy but honest and real well written too","51":"this story was another good one to listen to each of the 12 stories are one of the members of the family they used different voices for each story it was interesting how different each perspective of the history of the family was i got sick of oprah's picks after a while she seemed to choose the same type of troubled women stories this one was a little different","52":"this book started off very strong adn grabbed my attention it has some great writing i love the details metaphors etc the end is very strange and in 1 sentence a connection of hattie's learning through life is revealed to me the end was too abrupt","53":"i thought it was okay not the best book i read but hattie is not really a likable person as a result of her issues i found it difficult to really get into the book the book was very well written","54":" three stars i would not call this book extraordinary as i've seen noted i would say that it is an ordinary book about an ordinary family living in an extraordinary time i think the author missed an opportunity to provide a better foundation for understanding the times that resulted in the seemingly spontaneous mass exodus of southern blacks' to cold northern cities where little opportunity awaited i would truly like to understand that hattie herself is a figure that stands alone and i was left wondering why she didn't seek some solace and comfort from other woman in her world i ended up respecting her but not understanding the emotional path she chose","55":"interesting but not one i would recommend to others","56":"riveting this book grabbed me pulled me in and didn't let go until i had read it in its entirety after reading the first chapter i became confused about what had happened and what was happening until i realized that hattie had had more children after her first two babies died it seems as though the children who followed philadelphia and jubilee were unloved physically and mentally that they were flawed emotionally and doomed because they felt that they had never known their mothers love love it seemed to them was a difficult thing to come by in their lives hard to obtain and hard to keep however the very love that they felt was denied them ultimately saved them","57":"it was fairly well written but the family was so dysfunctional that it was a downer","58":"i enjoyed most parts of this book but got bogged down during some of the chapters i lost interest and skipped ahead","59":"enjoyed the stories of hattie's children tribes and learning the family saga as told by her children interesting way to spin the storyline spent mother's day afternoon reading the story thought it was appropriate to read about a mother on mother's day","60":"i enjoyed the read but there was so much heart break","61":"one woman's life revealed through the lives of her twelve children heartbreakingly beautiful as only a hard life written by a masterful storyteller can be","62":"this is about the hard life of blacks in the north after wwii it is not a happy story","63":"at first i was put off by other reviews that i read and i delayed starting it but once i got into the book it took me 3 days to finish it and its honestly not that bad","64":"i loved the writing style and i actually enjoyed the feeling of having several short stories had the book spent the last chapter tying everything together it would've been a perfect book i wanted a little more even an epilogue might have helped","65":" probably 3 5i enjoyed this at only 207 pages it was a quick read i must admit i only read it because it was an oprah bookclub selection i did like the approach of telling the stories of 3 generations of hattie's family through different family members in different decades it was well written characters were flawed but treated with compassion but it wasn't the equal of toni morrison or alice walker which perhaps is an unrealistic expectation but hey this was an oprah pick i was expecting a little bit more","66":" i really enjoyed this book though i allowed others' reviews of it to discourage me in my first attempts at reading it the individual tales of hattie's children and a grandchild are presented as chapters moving forward through time and each could easily be read as a stand alone story i found this book most compelling for its honest portrayal of the many issues that exist within the context of family i also thought the prose was lovely and easy to read i essentially read this in one sitting after i finally committed to it","67":" this has some wonderful description and vivid imagery that makes each character seem vividly real and relatable and yet there is never enough about each character to make this feel like a cohesive novel instead it reads like a character sketch of various characters all connected by being children of hattie it is a story many many people can tell of migrating from the south to the north and one that is both sad in that it shows the difficulties black people faced and continue to face because of slavery and is uplifting in that the characters have hope for a better life beyond their disinterested parents and history of oppression it shows how it is possible for oppressor to affect more than a single person but a whole culture","68":"wonderfully written i would rate this book between 3 and 4 not a fan of oprah but took a chance on this the characters had few redeeming qualities but were fascinating while reading this book i had the same feeling as i had while reading lolita loving the writing but hating the people i look forward to more of mathis' writing","69":"it's hard to rate this but i gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because i wish the different chapters about each of hattie's children had been combined into some type of synopsis to bring things together","70":"the book was okay i felt a little incomplete","71":"set in 1923 hattie shepherd 15 leaves georgia and settles in philadelphia she marries august a womanizer and low life and we see her life as shes bears 11 children this is a story of courage in the face of adversity at every level imaginable pick it up you won't be able to put it down","72":"this was ny times bestseller and i did not care for it much i found it to be very disjointed and somewhat repetitive in its theme","73":"incredibly touching stories of a strong tough woman and the children she gives birth to hattie's life is harsh her parenting style is harsh as well because she needs her children to be prepared for the hard world each voice in the book has his or her own life experiences to share making this a complex excellent book","74":" 3 5 starsi love books told by different perspectives this one is twelve different chapters each told about one or more of hattie's children with the last one being from the perspective of her granddaughter sula some are narrated by hattie herself while others are told directly by the child due to the format of each chapter this novel could be looked at as a series of short stories however the reader will gather more insight on hattie with each telling the stories are told chronologically from 1923 to 1980 i very much enjoyed the format of the book however i continually desired more from each chapter short story if you enjoy historical fiction especially from a multicultural aspect you should read this one an oprah's book club choice this would be a great discussion book for book clubs as well","75":"really good hard to read watching people make bad decisions but nuanced and complete descriptions of the characters and the consequences of withholding affection would recommend to anyone","76":"approach this as a series of short stories instead of one long narrative i was expecting the author to tie it all together in the end but that did not happen overall i enjoyed this book","77":"although there was quite a bit of dysfunction in this book the concept of devoting a chapter to each child was awesome then again whose family is without dysfunction engaging read","78":"very well written and sad the formal is interesting and different recommended","79":"i should have known while i really enjoy reading historic fiction and books about ethnic groups i seldom have liked the books promoted by oprah's book clubs they are just such downers i read almost 70% to 75% of the book before i finally just gave up i liked hattie and august i even liked some of the kids but it is a series of barely connected short stories each about one or more of hattie's twelve children the twelve tribes i might have been able to hang in there finished it and given it a better rating if it'd been a typical novel i can read sad depressing unhopeful stories but this book just didn't make make it for me","80":"i enjoyed this book quite a bit my real rating is a 3 5 i like how each child's story gave a glimpse into their mother's world i was not fond of the ending each character was complex in their own way the author's style reminded me a little of j california cooper who is one of my favorite authors of all with a little work mathis can become a masterful storyteller i would have liked a better glimpse into august's world and hattie's too in light of her sisters","81":"3 5 stars would be perfect for this book for now it's only 3 it was a good interesting read but i feel like there wasn't enough closure or coming together towards the end will maybe reconsider the star rating in the future","82":"the writer nailed down emotional responses now she needs to work on communicating some joy we were never shown any bright spots in their lives and even with such over powering sadness we needed it","83":"i enjoyed the audiobook so much more than the written version","84":"great writing you can feel the characters and their suffering a great book","85":"book review posting on youtube tomorrow","86":"such amazing writing but i didn't love the structure of the book it was a little off putting that each chapter was devoted to one or sometimes two characters that you never heard from again it seemed more like a complication of short stories about the life of hattie i did enjoy it but i also wish it had more climatic elements to it","87":"the book was okay but it really didn't keep my interest","88":"eh okay nothing to write home about parts of it were pretty good others not","89":"gripping i laughed and i cried as i met each one hattie's 12 tribes are her children each has his her own story and takes us through the 20th century in america would recommend to anyone","90":"i loved how this author writes it was intriguing and engaging i didn't give 5 stars only because it was pretty sad i wish there was a little more hope and good things woven in it and i wish the author would have made more connection between the characters but i do understand that was kind of the point great author i read an article about her and her mother in real life and it gave insight about different aspects in the book","91":"disappointing the writing is good but feels like half a story not enough to even find a character to root for other than sala in the very end 2 5ish","92":" like many other reviews have stated this is a tough book to rate i read it in just a couple of days so it definitely kept my interest but the story is told through a series of short stories it connects you to each of hattie's children for one snippet in time and then you are left to make assumptions on what their life was like before and after that period there's no denying that i liked this book and the common threads of hattie and august were enough to make me care about each of these children","93":" i was pleasantly surprised by this book when i first read it i wasn't sure i liked it i have followed the discussion here on goodreads which has been outstanding very thoughtful thnking people on the site the construction of each character was very moving by mathis brilliant how she told each pov and how she carried each of them through their trial and tribulation in the great migration i loved that we had to wrestle with loving some being confused by some and hating some of the characters sometimes both at the same time i have enjoyed the questions asked and them being answered by the author i loved how there were times where i couldnt wait to open and read other times i couldnt wait to close the book it was so sad i enjoyed the questions answered by the author i have set my dvr to record super soul sunday and i can't wait to watch the interview i think you are a delightful person ayana","94":"this book was great a beautifully powerful story of a mother's trials and tribulations after the great migration this book was beautifully written and almost painful to keep reading at times experiencing the things this mother and her children went through great read","95":" i'm too tired for a lengthy review but i really enjoyed this book it can be a tear jerker so make sure you're in the mood for that it's a tale of a woman whose life didn't turn out how she wanted it she's a mother of nearly a dozen and this book tells brief stories of many of her children and gives insight into hattie from different perspectives my only complaint is that just as i became really interested in a character their chapter would end and that was the end of that character for the most part in other words the stories didn't intertwine quite as much as i wanted them to but the stories she tells are really interesting i recommend it i read it really quickly while traveling","96":"i enjoyed this book but it seemed more like a collection of short stories rather than a novel the stories of the children were not really interwoven except for the common theme of failure and disenchantment","97":"ok this is the third time i have written this review it wont be long this time i'm tired of writing the same thing something going on with site in a nut shell i didn't like the book too much doom and gloom well written but not very enjoyable to read on gray january days","98":"i was captured by the first chapter of this book disappointed as i read further the book did not transition well from chapter to chapter or character to character it did not make connections properly between siblings i was hoping for something similar to the color of water by james mcbride","99":"enjoyed story would love to know what became of the kids","100":"was well written and moving at times but left me wanting something more","101":"really interesting read i saw the author on oprah's show and she really drove to read the book because of her passion for the story i love books about strong women each chapter told you about each one of her children their lives struggles love and heartache it told the story of hattie and her unemotional love for their children despite her not so happy outlook on her own life","102":" i didn't want to like this book because it is so full of pain and heartbreak but i ended up loving it i loved the style of writing and how each individual voice comes through i also feel like there was so much storytelling happening that it was easy to miss the snippets of tenderness inside the hard and unhappy hattie i felt so much compassion for her and respect for her strength i am looking forward to delving into some of the symbolism from the bible not a happy story but a very well written book","103":" me and oprah we should be reading buddies barring her franzen love i tend to enjoy her selections and it's really lovely that she's bringing quality literary fiction to the wider public the twelve tribes of hattie wasn't consistently amazing and i wasn't surprised to learn that this was ayana mathis's first novel there were a few points where i thought i'd quit but i'm glad i stuck with it through the end the last two chapters especially pushed it up from 3 to 4 stars ayana mathis is a writer that i want to keep my eye on though there were some glimpses of quite extraordinary writing the short story format of this book might turn some readers off but i think it's a great rec for people who like multigenerational family sagas or african american historical fiction","104":"a powerful and provocative read","105":"incredibly powerful writing poetic lyrical yet with sufficient character development and the plotting to keep the story moving forwards it's relentlessly bleak the joy is in the writing","106":"i wasn't sure where this book was going for the first two chapters but i found i was drawn in and could not put it down as i read on hattie is a young black woman who relocates from a town in ga to philadelphia in the 1920's she struggles her lifetime in the face of constant adversity to bear 11 children each chapter deals with one of a couple of her children ayana mathis has a gift of telling a bit about each character and their perspective of hattie allowing you to find by the end of the book that you know her well it is a heart wrenching book and it shows that love is not always displayed through overt affection","107":"i hated this book i didn't finish it it's depressing and poorly written my god someone give that woman some birth control or some help in picking better men","108":"it was a very sad book i liked the writing but not an uplifting story at all i enjoyed hearing about all the tribes hattie's children but found myself wanting to know more felt like there was much more to their stories besides just a chapter","109":"this book was more like a collection of short stories than a novel of course there was a common thread running through it tying the characters in the family together hattie the mother she does not appear in every chapter but each chapter is the story of one of her children this book is sooooo well written it is literature at its best the words themes metaphors etc i don't give it 5 stars because i would have liked to see the chapters merged at the end with the characters interacting or their stories coming to resolution i don't care for the format in which she wrote but i did love her writing","110":"not what i thought it was going to be it was okay but not great interesting enough for me to finish but i came away with a meh feeling","111":"what an amazing powerful book so beautifully written hattie is such a strong character and her children tell her life through their lives i loved how we learned about hattie from each of her children her legacy lives on","112":"so disturbing yet such a part of our nations history","113":"great book but disappointing ending worth the read","114":"not sure if i liked the ending although the fact that it felt there was none made me think about it more","115":"interesting writing format different voices at different time periods the book doesn't follow any one character in particular but a chapter of a character at one period in his her life this format was interesting but at times confusing interesting stories nevertheless","116":"this was an extremely well written collection of interconnected tales about a mother and her children vividly depicted in this searing work is the bond or the lack thereof between a mother and her children ayannis mathis wrote a deeply heartfelt and emotional novel i was left speechless after every word every sentence","117":" i gave this book 3 stars because i cannot decide whether i loved or hated it the main character and her story about her and her family's migration and her struggles raising 11 children from a man she despised was interesting of course however i disliked her throughout the entire story up until the very last page i particularly did not like how every child's life was written in short stories and in the end nothing came together besides the fact that they all ended up miserable it was definitely a well written story and it was captivating and i can see all of the things the author was portraying about the racist times and poverty etc i'm just not sure i enjoyed its gloominess oprah sure likes dark stories","118":"i didn't like the stories or the protagonists in the stories which is unusual for me with this type of book maybe if it was not an audio book i would have enjoyed it more i did not finish the audio book","119":" i loved this book it opened my eyes to the struggles of a family very different from my own yet so engaging at first i thought a collection of stories would be hard to follow but you can see characters develop over the years and their impact on each other the writing is amazing i would stop and re read sentences just as i savor a rich bit of chocolate on my tongue e g and the light coming in as though the sun were lemonade pouring from a pitcher i was impressed by how ms mathis created different voices for almost every chapter for example the pace and vocabulary of the chapter on franklin in vietnam is unique from all the others the author gets inside the head of each character and shows us their flaws biases and the factors that shaped them just as an aside i could not help but think how the narratives might end differently had the family had access to good health care philadelphia and jubilee would live ultimately changing hattie's life for the better six's burns would be tended to with less ostracism bell's tb and cassie's psychosis would be caught early and managed indeed the cost of inadequate health care is ultimately higher than a doctor or hosptial bill and stretches to the third and fourth generation","120":"i totally loved this book i loved this author's writing style great job for a first novel","121":"loved each of the vignettes about the characters for completely different reasons interesting portrayal of african american culture beginning around the time of the great migration through to the 1980s ish the structure of the novel made it difficult to remember how each of the siblings were linked by their experiences during their childhood overall fave was probably floyd also enjoyed bell but the portrayal of hattie as a woman unaccustomed to and uncomfortable with tenderness u0026amp uncertainty was spot on u0026amp reminiscent of many many women i've met before","122":"a well written novel full of imagery and great character descriptions but so sad and tragic i don't regret reading it but i wish i had been better prepared for it mentally","123":"began this as an experiment to see how it would be to read with oprah's book club so far not very connected to the book club and already finished the book the book brings us the children and one grandchild of hattie and we see how messed up their lives are partly at least because of hattie's parenting i wasn't very into the sections about hattie's sons but wasinterested in the daughters largely because through them we see so much about hattie she wasn't a bad mother or an uncaring one just a woman struggling in terrible situation to do the best she could she did love them though not always good at showing her love consider for example her ambivalence at giving away her baby or at escaping to baltimore with the man she really loved or the way she forgave her daughter and spent those days sitting by her hospital bed like her children hattie has been damaged by the circumstances of her life but she struggles bravely onward to be the best she can","124":"very interesting read not an easy read because each chapter has its own flashback and characters ie hattie's children and their lives but as a first novel i think its wonderful","125":"i found the story telling a little disjointed","126":"pretty bleak i kind of wanted to shake everybody in the book all of the time","127":"i really liked this book u0026amp took my time being on my kindle still getting used to it each chapter introduced one of hattie's children u0026amp each had their own story their own difficulties but one thing remained constant the respect love for their mother hattie never got over her loss of her twins u0026amp i felt at times this made her a little aloof to her other children i would recommend this book","128":" the book is written with each chapter devoted to one of the children and grandchild of hattie and august shepherd at first i thought it was a device to string together 12 short stories it seems that way since most stories barely mention other family members but hattie and her influence is a part of each the chapters are presented in chronological order but at different times in the lives of her children they span 55 years from 1925 to 1980 of hattie's life and we get to know her through the eyes of her children i am trying to decide why each chapter was included the story begins during the great migration - which depicts a time when many southern negroes left the south for cities such as philadelphia where this takes place looking for the freedom and opportunity denied to southern blacks some found it and some did not","129":"beautiful heartbreaking and a page turner","130":"i felt like there was no resolution at the end i loved the story but expected all the loose ends to come together in some way at the end i felt like we were left hanging","131":" i just put down the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis and i am so overwhelmed with emotion the twelve tribes of hattie is an amazing fictionalized memoir of the shepard family with hattie as the matriarch it also happens to be the newest oprah's book club 2 0 pick and it's outstanding hattie is a woman with many children and a not so wonderful husband august each chapter is told by one of hattie's children through their individual stories the reader learns about hattie and august the individual child as he she grows into adulthood etc and how everything fits together as a whole for the full review visit love at first book","132":"well written chapters not so well written book the great thing about it was you could read a chapter at a time put it down u0026amp not have to remember anything when you picked it back up this book could be read a chapter a month u0026amp you would still retain the gist","133":"a lot more profanity and sex than i would ever care to read plus it was a very depressing book not uplifting or inspiring definitely wouldn't recommend it or read again","134":" beautifully written forest gump esque history of the great migration with 11 of hattie's children instead of 1 forest gump heart wrenching and overwhelmingly depressive master understanding of human nature would have given 5 stars if there was even an inkling of hope in this novel but hope was squashed right out of the story","135":"ugh each person's story as grim or grimmer than the one before as a reader of a depressing novel you want to at least have something or someone to root for i tried but couldn't find anyone except maybe maybe maybe six","136":"a story of the twelve children of hattie there is a chapter devoted to each child each time i would start to get really interested in the story the chapter would end and it was off to the next child so for me i felt live i never got to finish a story each chapter is written well and it felt like i really got to know the characters but i never felt like i could finish their story","137":"excellent book hard to believe it is a debut novel will suck you in from the very first page","138":"beautiful writing and the original structure applied to the genre of a family saga kept me enthralled despite the heartbreaking fates of the characters in this book their stories were compelling despite almost all being tragic i also loved the way each chapter captured a moment that wasn't always about the character it was named for a truly surprisingly gratifying read","139":"probably a 2 5 for me i can see why others use the term heartbreaking to describe the book as all the characters are deeply flawed and dealing with some heavy issues but i also didn't really like any of the characters or feel too connected to any of them which might have to do with the structure of the book each chapter focusing on a different member of the tribe and in a different time period this one will fade from my memory banks pretty quickly","140":"i truly enjoyed this novel i liked the way each chapter told an individual's story hattie had her chapter and each child or children had their chapter some of the stories were heart breaking but the story was well told one of my favorite issues is the fact that i grew up in germantown and in fact lived my life from age 2 to until 36 on tulpehocken street when she mentioned locations that i was well aware of it drew me even deeper into the story i could see these folks so clear the homes they lived in the neighbors etc i look fowared to reading another ayana mathis novel","141":" this is basically a book of short stories with one character in common hattie the first and last chapters are told from her perspective the ones in between are about her children with a jump in time for each hattie's story starts when she moves to philadelphia as a teenager we don't know much about her before that we get a sense of who she is but frankly i didn't like her very much her kids have dysfunctional sad lives and we aren't told how their stories end the version i read had notes by oprah as if she's an expert on books after reading some of her notes i didn't bother she highlights passages only to state the obvious","142":"3 5 stars i really really liked this book i loved the way it is written with each chapter as a moment in time following a particular character i really like that layout in a book reminds me of recent alice hoffman books like blackbird house aside from the way the book is written i really enjoyed all the stories and how we were able to see how each character related to hattie and how their interaction with her shaped their personalities and subsequently their future and i really liked hattie i'm sure i'm not supposed to like her but i foujd myself feeling sorry for her a feeling sympathy for her rather than be disappointed and frustrated with her i would recommend this book highly the only reason i don't give it more stars is because it really is very sad and i can see how it might be hard for people to handle reading the book","143":"rated this book amazing in spite of the last chapter","144":"didn't finish it never got into it another sad novel about oppression poverty and racism","145":"i liked the stories within this book but they felt disjointed and at the end i wanted to know the endings to many of them i felt like many of the stories had no closure since the characters were not brought up during later stories","146":"what a promising story what a bad delivery no connection between the characters nothing is explained and everything is confusing what a waste of time and what bad execution very nice wording and writing but total lack of structure and organization i do not understand what is it doing in the oprah collection","147":"the stories in each chapter were fine the only constant in the book is hattie herself but hard to follow her storyline as well since this was for book club i had to sit down and write out who was who because otherwise it is easily forgettable","148":"loved this book up until the last two chapters one woman's life seen through the eyes of her children a chapter for each sad and poignant portrayals of what it was is like to be black in america in the 1900's beautifully written feeling a little unsettled by last chapter will need to reflect some on it","149":"rarely have i read a book where i hate every character in it but this one is my number one wonderful writing so good that i actually hate all of the characters took dysfunction to a whole new level but i turned the pages to read more because it was so well written each character's life was a clear example of text book family crisis in a world of individual and group denial i love and care for people but always knew i would not make a good interventionist this book verified that for me","150":"enjoyed each story wished the stories had linked up a bit more","151":"the interconnected story lines trace this family's history from 1923 into the 1980s told in a series of episodes focusing on each of hattie's children snapshots of her family's touching tragic and at times tumultuous history are spliced together into a complicated album each character has a unique but familiar voice a testament to mathis's talent as a writer with poignant snapshots and contextual snapshots the twelve tribes of hattis is beautifully written and worth a read","152":"loved this book each chapter is a snapshot of one of hattie's children her plight as a mother and a woman was powerful and true","153":"i didn't like the flow u0026amp structure of this book","154":"hard to rate this book it was very disjointed no plot just a series of different experiences like looking through windows into all these different lives lots of hardship it was quite sad","155":"an interesting story of many many dysfunctional people it left me feeling very sad that they were all unable to show their love even as the story closed","156":"i was over half way finished with this book before i just gave up i hated every character and there was no promise of liking the rest","157":"this book should come with a box of tissues i really enjoyed it and look forward to discussing this book with others it was interesting to learn how the different children viewed their parents","158":"two words debbie downer i really tried to like this book bc i was intrigued by the idea of each chater being told by a different child of hattie bt every chapter each child was so depressed angry and screwed up that it was just hard to read after awhile it seemed like none of the characters had any hope or joy to their lives maybe it was my mental state but i wasn't up to reading a book where i just kept getting so frustrated and saddened by the characters","159":"if you don't like short stories i wouldn't recommend this book every chapter has a new subject one of hattie's tribes and we get a glimpse into the lives of each of hattie's children who also provide updates about hattie's life along the way there's not an overarching plot that will lead you a tidy ending just the motivation to see how the sins of the mother and father played out for each child great writing interesting characters but be warned not a very uplifting book","160":"i should have known better than to have read an oprah book club book dear oprah just because a book is about black history doesn't automatically make it a good book characters are pathetic and so stupid you want to shake them poorly developed story line","161":"good story examination of how past experiences can shape who we become of course tragedy makes hattie closed to her offspring except in those rare moments when she does show emotion she is definitely an assertive protective type i agree with the recent ny times book review the novel really is not about the great migration but it is about people one of my favorite subjects","162":"i really wanted to love this book but i wasn't really all that taken with the story or the characters","163":" i don't know how to rate this book i read it straight through and the story and the charaacters were compelling without addressing the bigger sociological poltical psychological picture of which the author did a fabulous job i was disappointed to be so caught up in the life of one of the characters one of hattie's many children and to never hear about them again although the book gives a brilliant portrait of hattie each chapter is about one of her children the reader gets totally caught up in their lives but as the book moves on in time and to another person you never get to hear again about that character as a consequence although the author tells hattie's story well you are left frustrated by all the multiple strands of people's lives that never get woven back in","164":"the people in my life have their flaws for sure but they are by and large good people they try to be good citizens neighbors and parents these people do not exist in the world of hattie and her children they are all pretty miserable human beings that are ruled by their desire for sex alcohol gambling whatever hattie herself is so grief stricken at losing her young twins that she is unable to show any love or affection to all the other children who come her way while the writing is good i hope that in the african american community this is not the norm i certainly don't think so and that those brave african americans who were part of the great northern migration in the early 1900s found life more satisfying and were able to engage in more meaningful ways","165":" very thought provoking story of a mother who didn't know how to let herself love her children after losing her twin infants and the results of that on her surviving children's lives it seemed to me that hattie never forgave herself for the choices she made even though hattie comes off very abrasive i really found myself liking her i really had a desire to give her a hug my biggest complaint with this was that each chapter focuses on a different child or children at various years and when the chapter ended i was left wondering what became of them mathis did a wonderful job at getting you interested in each if their stories only to leave you hanging the writing was amazing wish goodreads had 1 2 stars this would've been a 3 5","166":"there are a few great stories a few lousy and a bunch of mediocre in this collection of 12 tales about an african american woman's 11 children and 1 grandchild growing up throughout the 20th century some nice vignettes realistic stories of life but because of the reality of them they are rather grey and underlined by a little hope and a lot of ongoing despair not my cup of tea","167":" the story of an african american family held together with a mother's grit and monumental courage there are moments in ayana mathis's multigenerational saga where i was blown away by her insight her compassion and her tremendous skill as a writer these are little moments interspersed throughout the novel and which sadly do not add up to enough to make me remember the book as the great work of fiction it is setting out to be the structure of the book is too disjointed the characters too hard and unlikeable as a reader i sympathized with nearly everyone but i didn't root for any of them and by the end of the fifth character's story i was ready to be done with the entire family i sense that what mathis is trying to achieve might be more immediately apparent to me if i were african american from a large family or from a different time period but i think her twelve tribes of hattie ultimately lacks the kind of universality that would allow all readers to come into her world","168":"a moving story spanning one family over decades original narrative structure where each chapter is narrated by a new family member compelling and poignant","169":"great audio book it was rather depressing but i still liked it very much","170":"every chapter is self contained and heartbreaking hattie finally redeems herself at the end but at quite a price loved it","171":"this book had no direction it made it very difficult to know who who u0026amp what was going on a timeline of life events would of been nice i felt that this book was a waste of my time","172":"following the story of hattie and her 11 kids from different povs this book provides a good example of 'what it means to be black in america' without victimism here african americans are not goody two shoes perfect examples of human beings who turn to be just tokens objects plot devices to showcase racism no ayana's characters are complex well built human beings with their own set of flaws and prejudices so we have the flawed and prejudiced hattie who suffers a lot raising her myriad of children and standing her husband's infidelities all her energy is spent feeding working and taking care of the kids so there is no space for affection and the family suffers from it but it is far away from recriminating hattie for not being a perfect woman on the contrary it empathizes with her without being too apologizing still strict moralists won't approve at the end the message that stayed with me was that shit happens it sucks but let's practice forgiveness and rise to life's challenges really it is one of the most inspiring books i read lately without being saccharine or patronizing it also interested me how sexually liberated the average mid century african american woman is if this book is any indication","173":"this book is beautifully written i love love love how all the characters back stories are interwoven into this wonderfully crafted novel definitely a must read oh i would suggest though that you get the version without the oprah notes they were pointless and unnecessary","174":" the audio book version was well narrated this is a series of chapters with the story of and from the perspective of each of hattie shepard's children the writing was descriptive but with the focus on character development of the children that when taken all together develop the character of the mother hattie i was a bit disappointed the children's lives were interesting but not captivating and each chapter seemed like it just sort of fell short at each end do like how the character of hattie was developed more completely through the chapters on her children and that's likely what the author wanted to achieve","175":" this absorbing tale portrays the struggle of a family over time centered around the main character of hattie the mother of this large clan each section tells of a different family member spanning from the early 1920's to 1980 hattie is a product of the great migration that brought southern blacks to the north in the quest for a better life the various members of her family are beautifully brought to life as complex and nuanced individuals as they struggle with heartbreak disappointment and the search for an authentic self","176":"clever structure with 12 views of hattie's migration from the south to the north during the great migration each view was a child she had 11 plus one grandchild's perspective in just about each viewpoint i found a connection i could relate to even as the experiences of each were not similar to my own life experience the heartache the deceptions thrown on one as well as the ones we incubate and spread the fleeting insane idea the relentless pawing at your physical and mental well being the bond between child and mother the wanting the best for one's child even when one knows one can't provide it i did find some parts of the stories trite in the delivery however and really even the structure an easy sad read","177":"it had a lot of potential i would have like more character development good first book and will read more","178":"my reading this was inspired by seeing ayana's interview with oprah and that it's part of oprah's book club 2 0 this book reminded me to slow down i'm a fast reader to really appreciate her descriptions and word choices ayana's truly talented the atypical structure and approach where each chapter is a different person or set of people left me wanting sometimes in comparison to a typical chronological plot unfolding approach but i also appreciate how it lets the reader create her own possibilities for the questions that arise out of unknowing the characters that came through ayana are deliciously complex and you also get a bit of insight into her own growing up with a mentally ill single mother truly enjoyable and one of those books that totally carries you away i slurped it up in just a few evenings","179":"i loved attending a book club meeting in pittsburgh to discuss the twelve tribes of hattie while some members of the club hated hattie i felt nothing but sympathy this was a woman whose fate was sealed when she became pregnant as a young girl i feel that being unable to save her young twins changed the fabric of who she was she spent the rest of her life afraid to become too attached to her other children for fear they'd be taken away the proof in the pudding was when her young son was severely burned and almost died the hardest chapter for me to read was the one where she gave her baby daughter to her sister she almost changed her mind but then gave the baby to her sister to be raised by her sister that lived down south hattie's husband was out of work perhaps this was an act of courage and compassion so that this child would not suffer i was also amazed by the fact that hattie and august had a tremendous love life and what sent him to the streets was her lack of emotion during the rest of their lives even her lovemaking was more animalistic than intimate each of her children paid the price for the choices that she and august made sadly not one of them was happy i can't wait to see what ayana mathis comes up with for her next novel","180":"solid read interesting format","181":"what a remarkable story by first time author anaya mathis we journey with hattie shepherd and her disconnected family as they fight for a connection with her the story opens with her newborn twins philadelphia and jubilee's death from pneumonia as if the death of her children weren't enough hattie's comes to realize that her husband august reveals himself to be a cheat and a piss poor provider so hattie finds happiness with another and leaves august and goes to baltimore but as fast as she leaves she returns memories from her past quickly begin to prick her heart you see when a sick heart is longing for another it's hard to love the ones you're with but it's easier to become cold hattie's children began to feel that coldness which moved into her heart and they began to resent her will they come to terms with the fact that their mom cannot love them is it too much to ask children to understand that you are preparing them for the hurt in the world that is sure to come mathis writes a beautiful but sometimes heart wrenching story of overcoming life's challenges very interesting story of family crisis love and pain missy4 5 book markaudiobook review","182":"another winey readers selection mixed reviews at book group i thought it was pretty good not a good choice if you like uplifting","183":"interesting life of hattie","184":"i must say his book grabbed my attention from the beginning i am thoroughly engaged in it finished finally ms mathis did an outstanding job with the way the book is written yes i found myself relating to the characters as well as finding myself within the page s as if i was there on the seen hoping u0026amp looking for more from hattie u0026amp her tribe","185":"jeez one felt the writer maturing with the characters","186":"mathis acknowledges the importance of toni morrison on her development as a writer and it's clear in this book it captures the many burdens of a woman who settled for a man and whose strength courage and love of family are made clear to the reader but are not always apparent to those around her","187":" short stories about a family in philadelphia the stories with hattie as a central character grabbed me more than others i wish this had been a novel taking us through hattie's life even though her life seems to be mostly about her children dying so i didn't care for the structure david bezmogis did the interlinking stories about a family thing better in natasha and other stories plus i wish publishers would stop trying to sell us short story collections as novels i assume publishers think most readers won't pick up a short story collection but calling it a novel makes readers expect something that isn't there disappointing but here's the positive thing that struck me most about twelve tribes the author does a great job of writing discrete scenes she slows everything down for a few tense moments somehow making them seem as vivid as if they'd happened to me there are scenes in revival tents at a segregated highway rest stop on an island in vietnam during the war that i feel like i'll remember for a long time 3 5 stars i'll read whatever the author does next","188":"a little explicit for my taste","189":"this book never got started for me characters that were interesting were introduced and never really developed further it was disappointing for all the oprah hoopla","190":"what makes a five star book i've been wrestling with that question since i finished the book last night the writing was superb i had a hard time putting the book down and couldn't wait to get back to it the story was compelling i understood the motivation of the characters these are the reasons i gave the twelve tribes of hattie five stars on the other hand i didn't relate to any of the characters in fact i found them frustrating and deeply sad i waited for a glimmer of hope and never found it what should that do to a rating i don't know","191":"the twelve tribes of hattie alfred a knopf 2012 references hattie's 11 children and grandchild that she later cares for as her own from our first introduction to hattie we sense that her life is going to be filled with heartaches and difficult situations we also sense her strength and intelligence yet these qualities never seem to be enough to elevate hattie in chapter one hattie suffers the loss of her her twin babies philadelphia and jubilee and this event haults hattie's evolution she felt their deaths like a ripping in her body page 13 her life is chronicled by the births of nine more children and little else read more at http thekeytothegate blogspot com 2","192":"not what i expected more like connected short stories than a novel excellent writing looking forward to more from mathis","193":" my mind wrestled while rating this book initially i thought \"right in the middle\" because of the push pull sensation i felt the entire read hattie's push for a better life while bound by the persistent pull of her devastating loss sadness and resentment hattie's love hate relationship with august the children's push to find personal growth yet constrained by the profound pull of hattie's influence over each one of them the overall strength in choice vs weakness in choice i ended up giving it four stars because it's a very thought provoking vividly written and human read i found myself longing for one of hattie's children to cling to their mother's early hopes and dreams--to take hold within their own life rise above the adversity but didn't see that happen ultimately we are all responsible for our own happiness but the environment we are raised in has the intense power to control our minds and define how we see ourselves after i finished reading i hugged my son so tight kissed him and told him how much i loved him...i really wanted hattie to provide this security and comfort to her children for their happiness and hers i'm opting for a story of inspiration for my next read","194":"a really strange book","195":"while beautifully and bluntly written in places this whole novel is a chore i love a dark story and i love reading about struggle and i actually don't like happy endings but all of hattie's 9 children suffer there is no joy no hope the small bits of happiness are so slight that it makes the whole story more depressing also for a family with 9 children they are so disconnected i understand that a lot of that is due to hattie but i just wanted to see more of their lives together rather than as separate chapters some very powerful writing here but i would have liked fewer stories that were more developed it is a very quick read","196":"every book that oprah recommends seem to be dark and depressing so i knew to expect it in this book as well the first two chapters were so despairing that i nearly quit reading something i never do i did complete the book and while it was far from uplifting it surely kept me engaged the despondency desperation and dysfunction of this mother and her eleven children nearly kept me awake at night with sadness it would seem that of all the characters included in this book one or two could stumble upon hope or joy but it was not to be time for a fun light happy ending book","197":"great writing still pondering on this book","198":"gave up reading halfway through book","199":"heartbreaking beautifully written though","200":"i thought this was a very interesting book that journeyed the life of woman through her children's life experiences","201":"i enjoyed this book but feel it would have been better for me if the story was tied together more","202":"if i could do zero stars i would i usually love oprah books but as much as i tried i couldn't find anything i liked about this book i don't know that i've ever actually been this disappointed with something i've read usually every book has some redeeming qualities i so wanted to like it u0026amp stuck it out until almost the end don't waste your time or money on this one","203":"i wanted to like it i got in 4 chapter deep before i could no longer force myself to carry on this is the second book i've ever given up on","204":"this was very well written but so sad that it is really hard to read","205":" a good solid story about a dysfunctional family over the course of several decades each time period is told through the eyes of hattie her husband her children or a couple other characters i was a bit worried when i saw it was an oprah book club pick because i associate that with sappiness chick lit but it's not it's just an ordinary decent read that happens to be by a female black author oprah's influence got her name out better than any other marketing could have done this is a good travel book which is what i used it for each chapter is almost self contained and if you don't remember all the details from one to another it's okay because the passage of time within the story brings its own confusion and lack of resolution","206":"stopped after four chapters the writing was good but it was very heavy and became repetitive","207":"i am not impressed u0026amp found parts of this book to be vulgar i do not need to have details of urinating in the woods or scenes involving fights written about to the greatest degree some may find this book entertaining but i did not","208":"sadness pervades this novel but there is lots to love i liked the way it unfolded as a series of vignettes and i found its portrayal of motherhood provoking and interesting","209":"i liked the book not raving about it i feel mathis could easily spin this book off to give us more character insight about each of hattie's children i didn't like the fact that there were only hints i wanted more","210":"it was pretty good a little hard to follow with so many different chapters but ok i wish there had been more said about hattie in the last chapter than there was which would have tied all of it together a little better i think","211":"'the sun rose like an angry orange ball could be another earth another earth just like this one all up in flames the upper sky was still a dark layer of purple clouds floyd turned the key in the ignition and thought i should hang myself like judas '","212":"i don't really know how to rate this book parts of it are beautifully written but i can't say that i liked it the characters are tragic and sad the presentation of each character in a different chapter made the telling disjointed just as i'd get caught up in one character's story the chapter would end","213":"more short stories than one cohesive novel this book is a beautifully written and compelling and speedy read we meet hattie shepard and learn about her through the trials and tribulations of her children over 30 years i only wish we could have seen what happens next with some of her children","214":"i can't even adequately express my feelings about this book i saw hattie represented in both sides of my family my mother and mother in law i also saw myself eye opening i realize my journey is an old one","215":" this was a beautifully written book it got only 3 stars from me because i'm bad at books of this type you are not going to see any overarching plot here or at least not a complex well built one rather shows you the life of a matriarch of a family through the stories of her 12 children it hops many many years and tells some heartbreaking stories but it just wasn't my type of novel highly recommend it if you are interested in family stories 20th century african american life or beautiful writing but don't come in looking for a well crafted plot line","216":"i liked reading about hattie her husband eleven children and one grandchild good writing the downside for me is that individuals' stories are mostly separate from each other and there isn't a lot of time to develop each character","217":"not sure how i ultimately felt about this book i definitely did not like the format that it was written in and i felt that she could have lengthened some of the character's stories we'll see what book club discussion brings","218":"i absolutely loved this book ayana did a remarkable job of telling the stories and capturing the thoughts and emotions of each character i have read the book more than once and often go to a particular chapter that i can identify with to learn and re learn the moral this writing puts me in the mind of toni morrison and i think in and of itself is an awesome triumph as tm is my favorite author to date","219":" bottom line i wanted to know more about hattie and her family ayana mathis has written a very solid debut novel that introduces many intriguing characters we come to know them through their individual chapters but we rarely get to see them interact as a family the backdrop for the chapters is the great migration but i didn't feel i learned enough about how this changed or didn't change the characters lives in an ongoing way i e what happens to floyd or bell or cassie hattie lives with heartbreak in many forms but we don't get much insight into her internal emotional life as i said i wanted more i look forward to future books ms mathis and i hoot she lets us into her characters lives more fully","220":" review first published on my blog http memoriesfrombooks blogspot com hattie shepard is a child of the south at age fifteen in 1923 hattie leaves georgia to seek a better life in pennsylvania she marries a man named august with hopes for a bright future unfortunately that does not come to pass in addition her firstborn twins pass away because of a lack of medicine hattie goes on to have nine more children and works hard to instill in them the discipline and strength she feels are necessary to survive in a challenging world the twelve tribes of hattie as the title suggests follows the stories of hattie and turn by turn her children to some extent reading each section is like reading an independent story the characters carry over from one to the other however the focus of each is so definitely one character that the commonality between them seems less relevant unfortunately because of this structure i found myself not being able to really vest in any of the characters or develop that sense of emotional connection by the time i started to feel a connection the section ended and i felt like i moved on to a brand new story each of the individual stories in and of itself is sad and depressing so at the end i am left with a set of depressing stories not really something i want to spend time with i am glad to be done and ready to move on","221":"i enjoyed this book very much i really felt for hattie and all she went through what a hard life she had a must read","222":"this book was okay i didn't really like how the author was all over the place with the characters and i couldn't understand the order that she chose to introduce a character and their story","223":"i went to hear ayana mathis speak about this book at the national book festival here in washington last weekend sept 21 she read from the first chapter when hattie's young twins philadelphia and jubilee have pneumonia then talked about the book about hattie she said that she raised her kids to be tough and not expect too much because she didn't think the world would be kind to them yet she still loved them desperately with hattie she wanted to create a character who was difficult to access and hard to love she explained that the reader would have to harness his her creativity and imagination to love hattie","224":"stories of one woman's family of 10 children started in 1923 in philadelphia and how they moved on and spread out the loose connectivity of the stories seemed very real to me sometimes people don't look back a lot many tales were depressing but sometimes i could feel very real hope and often the sheer tenacity of the characters was inspiring","225":"i wasn't sure how to feel about this book an interesting look at a mother through the eyes of her children it becomes clear what we do not share with our children in our words and what we do share through through our actions all the while a mother does the best she can is it ever enough","226":" i waivered between 2 3 stars besides the first chapter and the last page i find nothing really redeeming about the book each chapter is about one of hattie's children the time of the chapter in hattie's life fluctuates with no sequence hattie herself is unlikable and all of her children are discontent in their own lives sometimes directly related to hattie and how they were raised i think the author waits to the very end to explain hattie's behavior and even then hides it under a cloak of strength which i disagree with it would have been strength if she stayed in a marriage and life she didn't want and overcame it by being positive and giving her children al she had in this case strength would have been leaving and not blaming others for everything wrong in her life i know it was well liked by many maybe i missed something oh and as for the great migration this book is not about it not even mentioned except for hattie's own travel","227":"i really should trust my gut in the future i will if oprah recommends a book it's guaranteed i will not like it the turn off for me came in the second chapter two men slipping into the trees to admire and drool over each others genitals is not my idea of a good book","228":"these stories were too fractured for me again this was one of those books i really wanted to like but i could just never get in to there are some heart wrenching passages and some stunning language at work here i just wish it could have come together into something more immersive","229":"this is more like interconnected stories than a novel and in that way it's very uneven a couple of chapters are excellent and could exist as standalone short stories unfortunately a few of them are very weak and the last two are downright boring although in the final chapter you do get a little insight into hattie's character and that was nicely done kind of a mixed bag overall but i'd be interested to see what she does next","230":"i really wanted to love this book i tried and tried but it did not flow for me poorly developed characters and nothing to hold my interest i was disappointed","231":"it is hard to say you like a book when it tells a bleak story i did find it an interesting look into what it is like to live and stay in s an unfavorable state of life it also is a good example of how growing up in an unhappy unloving home affects you for a life time","232":"three and a half stars form me this reads as a series of short stories albeit each one reveals a bit more about the matriarch hattie the backdrop of american history and the place of african americans in it was deftly described","233":" i'm still trying to figure out the meaning of this book i think that's the word i like the potential for hattie with sala but i can't say the same for her other tribes with the exception of maybe two of them i get that the setting is major and the fact that hattie started so young and assumed an iron fisted role to keep them going not everyone knows how to be tender i'll have to look up other thoughts to see if i get it i did like the format writing style except sometimes it was confusing or i forgot something said if i wasn't really into the chapter and then sometimes i was frustrated something wasn't said outright but i understood that was the style so i wasn't annoyed that i was frustrated does that make sense","234":"this was a good book but a bit depressing i liked that each chapter was one of her children's story i didn't like that they were told randomly at different ages and there was no follow up on how their lives turned out i always like to read a book that has closure and this book didn't but it was well written and i felt very connected to the characters","235":"beautifully written but relentlessly sad stories of siblings suffering from depression mental illness tuberculosis and other ailments","236":"didn't like it at all typical depressing oprah book","237":"for all the acclaim this book has received it was very poorly put together seemed more like 12 short stories that were slapped together with the use of one main character thrown in the mix to make it a novel poor character development and the book never managed to provide an accurate snapshot of this family","238":" i usually love a cross generational family saga watching the historical references change and characters react to each other in family across generations here though i have a problem with hattie the matriarch of it all i'm not sure how her closed and unforgiving behavior is supposed to illuminate the stories of her and her children and what they do or don't become no demerits for sentimentality here i read it all the way through with interest though as the characters and their journeys are engrossing enough in the moment and i believe it left its bits and pieces behind with me in the way that a good book does","239":"loved this book i could not put it down i loved how conflicted all of the characters were the author's writing and descriptions of them completely drew me in","240":"i finished and i don't know if i liked the novel or not i liked that it was set in my home town i maybe liked a few of the speakers i liked that each little section could have stood alone i just didn't understand why the relationships had to be the way they were many characters were unlikable i'm still thinking about this one","241":"liked the content and the format i can see how people would have liked more character development but with twelve tribes it would be tough","242":"pretty good for a first novel but i thought it was rather formulaic as though mathis had a checklist of possible subplots and life situations that the children could be involved in sexual abuse check mental illness check etc they did not seem to be connected very well to each other or to hattie but maybe that was intentional","243":" this book was a big disappointment to me i heard about it on oprah and thought it sounded interesting it is a series of short vignettes each about one of hattie's children through these narratives the reader learns about hattie as well as her children it's a good concept but it just isn't fleshed out enough to be satisfying i truly don't feel that i know or understand hattie and i certainly didn't get enough information to really know her children the most difficult thing for me was that every single story about hattie's children was depressingly sad and rather horrible i'm wondering why even one of her children couldn't have had something good happen to them this is not a book i would recommend there is no historical interest of significance and the characters are sketchy enough that they do not become real","244":"i really enjoyed this read the way it was written could stand alone as a novel or separate as a collection of short stories a wonderful accomplishment for a first novelist a fast read where words flow off the page in vivid detail i believe oprah's 2 0 format is an interesting twist and one that will be the next trend we see with e books","245":"an excellent read and who would have thought the twelve tribes represented hattie's children","246":"very well written i enjoyed the pacing and the glimpses into the individual character's lives while still telling one story","247":"overall this was a decent book however i think i would have liked it better if it didn't seem so disjointed each chapter seemed like it's own little story some of the chapters were interesting and i wanted to know more about the characters but once i got to the next chapter they were gone most never to be heard from again","248":"we first meet hattie as a teenager while she's young and fresh although she's already been through a lot by the end of the book we've met a lot of hattie's children with their triumphs but mostly with their mistakes hattie by the end of the book is a weary woman who has done her best for her children but was too tired and beaten by life to show them joy","249":"i loved reading but i wanted more after reading a chapter and wanted to know more about that character and forced to move on to the next felt like i only got snippets of hattie's life and i sometimes had a hard time connecting the stories and left me wanting more","250":"some powerful writing but the stories were just depressing a book you feel like you are supposed to read rather than one you enjoy reading","251":"amazing that is all","252":" i may upgrade this to 5 stars amazing but i just finished it and am still ruminating lots of good stuff here really interesting links to song of solomon by toni morrison weird little echoes and bits of info that link the two hmmmm says the teacher in me mathis has a wonderful writing voice even when she's just regular she's interesting and smart when she pulls out the stops she's amazing the chapters are almost like individual short stories and it's fascinating to see how the backdrop and expectations change for each of hattie's children as time goes on the first loss was devastating to read about and the long spiral of how that loss affected hattie and family throughout the book was the backbone of the story i didn't have that awwww feeling when each new chapter started that some many voiced stories provoke i think my favorite was bell's and my least favorite was cassie's or maybe franklin's but each one had a voice and a personality that made it unique the conclusion hmmmmmm very interesting gutsy worth discussing so happy our library had it","253":"superb novel by fellow graduate of philadelphia high school for girls i will be following this wordsmith","254":"this was a hard read with the strange structure i had a hard time finding the novel cohesive also no one was really likable it was difficult for me to sympathize with hattie especially she truly does have a lot going on but she was just so rough some of the stories were quite harsh and i really wanted to know more about others i guess to me the book was too disjointed","255":"wow what an amazing book the story of hattie as told through the eyes of her children each chapter from a different perspective you slowly gain insight to understanding hattie her life and her children i also really liked that each chapter was told from a different time period as in addition to becoming a part of hattie's life you also get a sense of what society was like","256":"i'm not a reviewer but i know what i like wonderful read","257":"i good enough story i'm not fond of books that are divided by intersecting stories especially when each character only makes one appearance the writing was fluid but not really remarkable and the author's purpose was obvious oprah's selections are usually very dark and depressing and this novel is better than most","258":"i had such high hopes for this book but i was underwhelmed","259":"whoa first word that comes to mind is tragic from the first chapter there is a sadness that hangs over the book for someone like me it was unsettling but i kept turning the pages i was looking for the silver lining some glimmer of hope it never did manifest and maybe that was the point i really enjoyed ayana mathis' style i would recommend only to others who like tragic stories actual rating is a 3 4","260":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book although it is hard to imagine life as hattie it certainly makes you pleased you don't have ot read the full review at ourbookclub","261":"this book is phenomenal i found it disturbing that the main character had so many children however the writing was absolutely beautiful ayana mathis's use of figurative language is compelling i absolutely loved the ending highly unexpected i could 100% relate to the protagonist's feelings and why she chose her actions i am stunned that this is the author's debut novel i certainly will read any other books hopefully many she produces","262":" i should remember to leave my expectations behind when i start a book i don't want to say too much about if my expectations were met or if i was disappointed but i will say that i read this book in one sitting which isn't an endorsement or criticism it is definitely worth reading and although the content and writing style couldn't be more different than a jennifer weiner book i had the same feeling reading this as when i read one of those i must get to the end no matter what i think the end will be the characters are so alive tangible to the reader and that leaves me feeling satisfied no matter what happens in the book that being said i am over the idea that something whether it be a book or a film can only be taken seriously if it is serious and heavy we need more humor in our daily lives the world we live in can be a dark and lonely place and i think things that make us laugh should be honored as much as if not more than the things that leave us feeling whiplashed or just plain punched in the face","263":" i always find it really refreshing to read a story that is set out slightly different from the norm it makes be excited to continue reading no matter what the topic and it makes it harder to guess how it is going to end this story tells the depressing yet interesting tale of hattie's tribe of children it very cleverly shows you who they are and then by default tells the story of hattie herself i don't know how accurate it is but in parts it is heartbreaking and i found myself really wanting this poor family to finally cut a break it seemed like each and every one of them was doomed to struggle their entire life but despite the bleak tales of the family members the mathis is a master storyteller it may not give you warm and fuzzys when you read it but it will definitely keep you turning the page","264":"it's more a collection of short stories than a novel there's a short story about hattie and then each of her children and a grandchild i found myself wanting to know more about some of the characters and not very interested in others but once the author moves on to the next child of hattie you don't see the previous ones again except as they appear as characters in their siblings lives which is to say not much i felt like as soon as i became invested in a character the author moved on to someone else those characters i did become attached to though wow that is some great writing","265":"ayana mathis reminds of toni morrison and alice walker what a dynamic debut i am always intrigued by the plight of black women mysterious strong smart misunderstood","266":" to me this was an ok book not great not good just ok the 1st chapter or two started out pretty interesting but then i noticed that most of the following chapters and stories seem more like a short story basically taking you briefly into the lives of hattie's children what's going on currently in their lives and bits of reflections about their mother and father but then you don't get to learn more about the children i wanted to know more like how they got to where they are in their lives why they think the way they do or why they are afraid of this thing or that or if they're facing a conflict how did they finally resolve it or is it really resolved i mean what eventually happened the characters are just thrown out at you and then you get bits of flashbacks about their lives and then that character's story ends and you don't hear much else about them i can't even tell you who is the oldest or youngest of her kids i lost track of them and why they're really important to the story and to the overall picture of hattie i mean one of the kids wasn't introduced until near the very end of the book as i said this was an ok read but to me the characters and their stories never came together to make sense just too many loose ends for me to really enjoy the book","267":"took me forever to complete this novel in stages it was a compelling story but it just didn't hold my attention","268":"the format of the novel was a bit of a challenge although each child and era was a story of itself it didn't lend to a fluid story i would have liked to see how the stories connect as family stories do we are not separate","269":"good story about life of african americans in 50's 60's at least one woman and her kids life story was entertaining but sometimes felt disconnected some characters were talked about for a chapter and then barely spoken of","270":" i picked out this book in indigo because the name hattie instantly jumped out at me my maternal great grandmother was named hattie she was a relatively gruff german woman who lived to see her 101st year she and her husband built their house in pembroke ontario early on in their marriage and she lived there until she was nearly 100 a clear sign of just how stubborn and self sufficient she had been i mention her in this review because my hattie turned out to be just like the hattie in ayana mathis's debut novel and i loved that it was interesting to wrestle with the fact that on the one hand i did not like this fictional hattie but on the other knew why she was so unlikeable she lost her two twins to pneumonia very early on in their lives which greatly changed her and felt drawn to her because of that hattie's story is told through her children and one grandchild the chapters are laid out as separate stories devoted to each child and judging from many other reviews of this book that format has proven to be very off putting for some readers many people have expressed frustration in not being able to get to know each character properly or they've felt the layout gave the stories a choppy quality i will chime in and say i loved this format because it was like a jigsaw puzzle in order to learn about hattie i needed to piece together the bits and pieces i learned about her through her children this was a thrilling task for me mathis's writing is at once both poetic and arresting she captures the highs and lows of the great migration in a way i hadn't yet encountered there is a certain tone of authority to her voice that made me want to read on in earnest she truly has a wonderful style and i hope to hear more from her in the future i'm glad i read this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fairly easy read that still can't be put in the fluff pile thanks to its beauty and social significance","271":"good writing just get into a character and the author moves onto another of hattie's children so a bit unsatisfying from that perspective","272":"depressing depressing depressing each and every story because that was what it was stories weaved together fragments of life the after effects of a mother's tragedy life with little love money might be difficult to come by and life is hard but no love to show what dire consequences","273":"i really wanted to like this book but it was just so depressing and read like a bunch of short stories loosely tied together","274":"wow it took me a minute to read this book i put it down and read books in between it i finally finished it's read like short story about the children the was writing was good overall not a bad book just not what i expected","275":"excellent first novel w' vivid characters story told against backdrop of traditional southern blacks vs those who migrated north for a better life more like linked short stories than a fully integrated novel but it works","276":"i've read other reviews that have slammed this book as depressing hattie as too cold and the stories as too disconnected but i really enjoyed it i did wonder what happened to hattie's children after their chapters ended but i enjoy characters that stay with me and leave me wanting more the writing was clean and crisp hattie reminded me of my own grandmother who had nine children who survived to adulthood and lost several others during infancy and struggled with limited income and a drunk womanizing husband i guess i read hattie as a more sympathetic character one who struggled with the intimacies of motherhood but still worked hard to provide for her children the best that she could","277":" in 1923 fifteen year old hattie shepherd swept up by the great migration flees georgia and heads north full of hope she settles in philadelphia to build a better life instead she marries a man who will bring her disappointment and watches as her firstborn twins are lost to a preventable illness hattie gives birth to nine more children whom she raises with grit mettle and no tenderness she vows to prepare them to meet an unkind world their lives tell the story of a mother's courage--and a nation's journey from racial bias a captivating and gritty story told from hattie and her children sides that demonstrates the influence of parents love","278":"heartbreakingly beautiful both hard at times to read and hard to put down","279":"this book is just like the reviews i read very hard to review it is a series of short stories each one about one of the children it came together better than i anticipated but gives you little closer overall a very good story of the difficulties of life for this family","280":"i really liked the form this wasn't written in that kept me engaged and reading it's a somewhat depressing book though","281":"the writing is solid and each situation chapter ties up neatly the themes are repetitive and after a while the stories fall a little flat","282":"i liked the writing in this book the author is obviously very talented the book is divided into almost short stories each one focusing on a different family member of hattie's i liked some of the vignettes better than others some of the stories were really sad but painted a vivid picture of what growing up poor in philadelphia would be like","283":"found this to be very disjointed with and unsatisfying ending","284":"i'd say 2 5 stars i thought the writing was very good but the unrelenting sadness and broken relationships wore me out one character says it's not like i don't know i'm doing wrong or like i'm powerless to stop myself i just do what i'm going to do despite what it will cost me every character lived that sad thought for 243 pages","285":"this book is most certainly sad but nonetheless a great read i think what made it most interesting besides the wonderful writing was the different stories of hattie and her children in the various times periods and stages of their lives the book spans 55 years and i think the reader gets a much better understanding of hattie through each story than her children ever did","286":"easy to read in a single sitting this novel follows hattie who as part of the great migration moves from her native georgia to pennsylvania and starts her family the novel progresses through the 20th century and reflects the different challenges faced by her brood as they come of age","287":"ugh i cant feel good that a mom who beat neglected and distanced her many children expects redemption because she commits to raising her grandchild maybe i missed something","288":" this is oprah winfrey's most recent book club 2 0 pick i am not convinced it should be that at all the twelve tribes of hattie is an average collection of short stories it has been forced into the form of a novel to suit the author's vision rather than the story's needs hattie is 15 when she arrives in philadelphia with her husband august they have left the south for a better life the first harrowing chapter shows such promise as hattie's life with her new born twins begins each chapter after that is a story told through the eyes of her children quite simply there are too many children for this to work properly nine of her children survive and the book spans 60 years there is never enough time to properly invest in any one character the blurb promises a 'searing portrait of twentieth century america from the revivalist tents of alabama to vietnam ' and there are elements of this between the pages but it isn't a novel i understand the author's intent was to show us hattie through her children's eyes but the book feels unfinished the twelve tribes of hattie is saved by mathis's powerful style and storytelling talent 2 5 5","289":" i wanted to like this more than i did something just felt a little off like it the author the narrative was trying too hard i missed a sense of flow and direction perhaps because each chapter was about a different child but that doesn't usually cause a problem i enjoyed olive kitterageu0026gt and it was if anything a more difficult read this book had the benefit of family to tie the individual stories together and present differing povs of hattie it is a powerful story and i think we will be seeing great new works from mathis for a long time to come","290":"i would rate this as a 2 5 but that is not an option so i opted for 2 stars due to the structure of the novel i really wanted to love this book because i think ayana mathis is a good writer and many of the individual stories were so true to what i know but the overall novel just did not work for me and not to spoil the ending but by the time i reached the ending i did not feel any connection to hattie's children i would definitely read other works by ms mathis but this book does not go on my list of favorites","291":"not my normal selection well written and i enjoyed that technical aspect would like the story to have come full circle it left me wanting","292":"this is a very well written book where the character and life of hattie are revealed through the stories of her children who each sadly fail to see the fierce love she has for them from it's incredibly tragic beginning to its open ending i was gripped mathis writes lyrical prose and conjures a story spanning decades which describes the struggles and prejudices of life for poor black people through events which befall hattie and her family","293":" snuck in one more book to my 2014 read list but i'm almost wishing this wasn't the one while there are some beautiful passages contained in this novel it is still painful to read yes it may be unfair to give a book only 3 stars because i simply didn't enjoy reading it and for no concrete reasons but i am this was difficult to finish but i did nonetheless in the acknowledgements section at the back of this novel the author mentions her gratitude to toni morrison she is the author i thought of at multiple points throughout this novel the characters remind me of morrison's characters because many are broken and desperate and sad and without hope however the characters in 'the twelve tribes of hattie' didn't have the strength that morrison instilled in hers it's almost like this novel is a simply retelling someone else's story i'm not saying the author doesn't have talent because she does but i didn't grasp anything memorable from this read and am only left with a taste of someone else's despair i will be interested to read some of her future works though as i am curious to see how she will grow","294":"hattie was hard to like but easy to identify with the readers were ok but didn't keep me entirely engaged with the story despite the dramatic story","295":"excellent very well written reminded me style wise of toni morrison and anne tyler beautiful book","296":"a story of the great american migration hattie leaves jim crowe georgia for life in philadelphia in the 1920s she bears 11 children and each one of them had issues to deal with isabel wilkerson's book the warmth of other suns is a nonfiction book dealing with the same issues interesting and sad my father grew up in west philly at the beginning of the 20th century and watched it go down hill","297":" i think this book was over hyped as an oprah selection told in chapters focusing on a period in each of her children's lives i don't think it ended up giving you a good picture of hattie the most powerful scene to me concerned her sister and brother in law while they are on a trip up to see hattie and are approached by several white men while stopping for a picnic lunch i did like her writing style but felt she fell short in drawing the stories of the siblings together and making connections","298":" i am so conflicted about this book i downloaded a sample after i heard oprah rave about it and by the time i finished reading that sample chapter i was sobbing i absolutely could not wait to purchase the rest but for all my enthusiasm up front by the end it was an absolute struggle to finish it when i finished it i just sat there and thought that's it i get that each chapter was another of hattie's children's stories and i enjoyed those stories but they never really intersected enough to give the book cohesiveness or build a strong plot hattie was even oddly absent from some of the chapters and the jumping around from decade to decade made it even more difficult to follow i regret that i had such high expectations perhaps i will pick it back up someday read it again and have a totally different experience with it but for now i feel oddly deflated","299":"i absolutely loved this book it was reminiscent of toni morrison for me great characters i loved each one in their own way especially hattie a powerful first book i highly recommend this book it would be a great selection for book clubs as there are so many powerful passages and perspectives to discuss looking forward to her next novel","300":" this is an amazing debut novel that begins with a tragic loss when hattie is seventeen years old the background and character of hattie shepherd emerge as the novel progresses through chapters featuring her children's lives and memories hattie is strong hattie is flawed and hattie raises her children in a culture unknown to most of us in a perfect literary world each of these chapters will become a novel reminiscent in style and quality to the wonderful novel olive kitteridge by elizabeth strout this is a book that is a brilliant portrayal of a woman and her family i am not an oprah fan but i do applaud her for bringing this book to the attention of those who don't normally read literary fiction","301":" there has been a lot of buzz surrounding the twelve tribes of hattie as it is one of oprah's book club picks and destined to be a bestseller as a result so is the hype justified hattie shepherd is part of the great migration moving from georgia to philadelphia in the mid 1920s hoping for a new start in life aged just 17 the story of her new life begins with the tragic death of her twin babies philadelphia and jubilee who had ironically been given names of promise and hope reaching forward names not looking back ones surely she has already had her share of tragedy but no there is a lot more to follow as she gives birth to nine more children whose lives are equally imbued with sadness and it is these eleven off spring plus one grand daughter further down the line who comprise her twelve tribes there is much to weep about a womanising preacher marital difficulties tuberculosis gambling confused sexual identity mental illness a diversity of dysfunctionality in order to survive the harsh reality of her life hattie hardens her heart and gives the impression of having no love for her off spring but you just know she would be there for them in their hour of need indeed this is more a story about motherhood than the great migration there are so many characters and the novel's structure almost a series of short stories vignettes about hattie's children unfortunately prevents a really deep understanding of characters and their motivation having said that it is beautifully written and a very impressive debut novel","302":"i really enjoyed this book it was interesting to read about the struggles of family and the different lives lead by each family member from different perspectives","303":"although she obviously has talent i found myself somewhat bored the characters were very dark and unfinished the story seemed fragmented i couldn't finish the book i was hoping to feel a connection but instead felt lost there isn't enough written to really feel connected to the characters i wanted to love the story first of all it's oprah selection and second the story line is interesting too bad it was written poorly i think this writer will become amazing and i will continue to read her material","304":"this was hard to rate the writing was powerful and compelling not to mention quite beautiful in parts but the structure of the novel bothered me each chapter tells the story of a point in time of one of hattie's children across a very long span of time think 40 years it's interesting but it leaves the narrative feeling disjointed and disconnected and a bit unsatisfying characters are explored in depth once and only sometimes revisited again in any significant way it felt more like loosely connected short stories than a novel","305":" lyrical luminous compelling \" hattie wanted to give her babies names that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in georgia so she gave them names of promise and of hope reaching forward names not looking back ones \" -- ayana mathis the twelve tribes of hattiewhy did i absolutely love listening to ayana mathis's stories about the children of the great migration the twelve tribes of hattie was it the lyrical prose was it the subtleness of storyline and character development was it the amazingly great narration of adenrele ojo bahni turpin and adam lazarre white or was it all of these and more as the goodreads synopsis aptly put it these stories are \"beautiful and devastating ... wondrous from first to last--glorious harrowing unexpectedly uplifting and blazing with life an emotionally transfixing page turner a searing portrait of striving in the face of insurmountable adversity an indelible encounter with the resilience of the human spirit and the driving force of the american dream \"i wish i'd have said that recommendation a treat for all who enjoy extremely good captivating storytelling i want to listen to it again \"half of what's wrong with people today is that they ain't got no place to go that makes them peaceful \" -- ayana mathis the twelve tribes of hattieoverdrive mp3 audiobook edition 10 hours 16 minutes","306":"excellent writing and character development","307":" i really was excited to read this book and i liked the premise of it but it was somewhat incomplete and disjointed i would have liked to know more about each character instead of the little vignettes of each that were given and the information that was given wasn't enough kind of like the feeling that you get when you're trying to see something that's out of reach and you just can't get enough of a view to get a clear picture there was also some sex scenes i could have done without especially since that was the only information about that particular character as if that was what defined him and was all that was important","308":" i really can't decide what i think about this book which in some ways makes me think that there is more to this story than i can see overall to me it was the story of a mother doing the best she can in the face of terrible tragedy her children want more from her than she is able to give and many of her children are down right unlikeable in the way they blame there mother for the poor decisions they make in their own lives to me the story was about how all children want their mothers to save them from tragedy and despair but really a mother's job is to walk with them along life's path the parallels to our faith journeys adds depth to a somewhat disjointed and unsettling story","309":"powerfully written with well drawn characters the weakness is personal to me this book reads like a series of short stories that are tied together by hattie i like novels and this is a collection of stories with connections that if they were clearer i would have found the book more enjoyable i liked hattie","310":"interesting read but quite depressing 3 5 stars","311":"i liked this book but not as much as i felt i should after all the rave reviews the writing is varied and well done it was the story jumping around so much that i had trouble with","312":"i really liked this book all the characters had interesting stories all of them were damaged in some way it was very toni morrison like without all the abstract metaphors","313":"captivating read although i felt some of the stories on each child too far fetched to be realistic none if the children seemed to inherit the strength of character their mother had perhaps it was telling you her character was so strong it squashed any chance of the children growing up normal or maybe it was saying how much children need to know and be shown they are loved who knows worth reading to explore and thought provoking","314":"read this book in one sitting could not stop thinking about the characters and connections so read it a second time the chapter about 'bell' induced gut wrenching sobs both readings the women were well written the men less so was a little pissed that i'd been tricked into reading a book of short stories loved it anyway","315":" i enjoyed the premise of the book each chapter gives us a glimpse of each of hattie's children i enjoyed their stories but i would have liked to have more of hattie's perspective weaved into the story as a mother hattie's story and that of her children hit me in places i wasn't expecting when you become a mom you start to see your own mother in a different light you see that she has an inner world and a past that you will never truly have access to -- that she is a complete human being apart from you who had her own dreams and her own challenges we hope at least i do that in years to come our children's memories of us reflect the depth of the love we have for them","316":"fantastic sorrowfully beautiful hattie's 12 tribes are her children and each chapter is an expose of a specific time in that child's life this is not a traditional warm and fuzzy my kids turned out so great kind of story this is a heart breaker that is told from the kids' perspective as well as hattie's it is so beautifully written that it is poetic the reviews on the back of the book say it all it is breathtakingly written loved it","317":"absolutely exquisite book i still thinking about these characters","318":"exquisite writing extraordinary truths","319":"this book was strange but good i randomly found it through the library's ebooks and i had no idea it was an oprah's book club book or anything i had never heard of it and had no expectations so i was surprised when i started reading it it's told through 12 different chapters of all these people within the same family and there were times that i think that worked and other times it didn't there were moments that i felt the story was kind of disconnected or certain chapters didn't have a real ending i found the last two to be the most off when it comes to the book all of that being said the book was good and i was drawn to it and kept wanting to read it so that says something","320":"i love stories about a bunch of people and how they all come together and the author really is excellent at spanning decades in this style it did leave me wondering about all the individuals and feeling slightly unsatisfied with not knowing how some of the stories ended up hattie is a tough mother but there are such tender moments described in the story that i have to hand it to the author who balances both well","321":"the talent of this author in writing from the distinct perspectives of so many different characters is amazing the book however was depressing it was hard to believe such dysfunction in one family","322":"i got a few chapters in it seemed to drag granted it was an audiobook and i only got it from the library because its one of those cool playaway things maybe i'll try it again one day in real book form lesson learned audiobooks are not for me","323":"i liked it enough to want to get home get into bed where i do my reading and see what path this family was going to go along next","324":"well written but i would've loved more than one brief chapter for each of the children","325":"this young novelist knows how to get oprah's attention the characters adhere to a formula that is sureto make the list a worthy stab at the verisimilitude of the push and pull attendant with the migration north","326":"rather depressing each of the stories about hattie and her children for me the writing was not extraordinary","327":"i can't say i enjoyed this book the characters and their lives were too bleak for a verb like enjoy to apply but i admired it i don't generally like to read books about dysfunction and sorrow but it's a testament to mathis's ability as a writer that i never once considered leaving the book unfinished the twelve tribes of hattie is our local book club selection this month and i have no doubt it will inspire a lot of interesting discussion","328":" loved this book i'm surprised at the negative reviews it is emotional and depressing but i fell in love with the raw and honest characters i found myself truly caring about hattie and her family and feeling her pain and regret but admiring her strength it's not a light pick you up cheerful book but i found the brutal honesty and real life consequences of our decisions moving and relatable it made me want to wake my teenage kids up to remind them how much they are loved poor hattie thought her children knew but it's an incredible example of how we all show and accept love and happiness in different ways and the sacrifices we make for those we love","329":"i loved it it is a bunch a short stories woven together by the fact they are all the children on one mother i didn't really get the end of the book until i read an on line article living through my mother's breakdown by ayana mathis on glamour com it reminds me of the writings of rohinton mistry those beautifully woven tales of families and circumstance these characters will stay with me for a while","330":"i loved this book sad but also hopeful and filled with really interesting characters lots of great stories within it my only criticism for some of the characters i wanted more more about some of them but you just get really one chapter about each but somehow each story is really well pulled together really loved it","331":"i am not sure how i feel about this book it touches the life of hattie and each of her children at times i found this book really interesting and at other times i found this really sad and depressing how people screw up their lives","332":"mathis created a masterfully broad range of characters all emanating from the same mother what i loved was the variety of personalities the way they each adapted to and grew from their upbringing and the way that hattie's story is told within each child's keeping her as the centerpiece she captured the changing times of each decade giving a snapshot of the character at that moment","333":" i just finished the book and feel extremely sad it is very well written even though i am not sure that i like the many voices each chapter tells something of the life of one of hattie's children this is an interesting technique but it makes the novel feel more like a series of short stories each story is a very sad one and tells a little more about the person that hattie was through the eyes of her children the end comes abruptly and lets you wanting for some closure that relieves the despair that permeates the narrative","334":"i found this book simply amazing the depth of her characters their authenticity complexity struggles and fears had me unable to put it down with each narrative i did not want their story to end i can't wait for her next novel","335":"this book was very depressing i also did not really get the title of the book and i felt no attachment to the characters","336":"very different from what i was expecting such clear evocative prose that lays out the heartbreak and hope of humanity","337":"i enjoyed this book it was a fast read the author used a format similar to another book i read recently in that each chapter tells a portion of the story from the perspective of a different character in this case on of hattie's children the book touches on themes of poverty racism in the north vs south us homosexuality and religion each character has a unique and interesting story and as each chapter spans a different time the reader learns about the parents and the family as a unit","338":"the beginning of this book drew me in but as the book progressed i found it less than compelling there were some good passages and some interesting presentations of the perils of being a black family migrating to the north on the whole however i found the stories lacked cohesion and forced myself to finish the book in the hope that the conclusion would pull it all together it didn't at least for me","339":"i was expecting this to be a novel but it was actually interconnected short stories about hattie and her many children each story is set in a different year starting when hattie and her husband first move from the south to philadelphia and ending when she is an old woman mathis' writing is beautiful and she creates such a clear picture of all the characters","340":" arc courtesy of the publisher and edelweiss though i didn't read it until after the pushed up publication date this was readable but not worthy of the hype that is currently surrounding it i'm vacillating between two and three stars but am feeling generous right now as i reflect on certain chapters the disjointed narrative of hattie's family takes place over 40 years with each chapter focusing on the story of a different son daughter some were sincerely interesting and poetically told some were kind of boring leaving me with a sense of a flat character the last chapter was a mess","341":"too disjointed too many characters and not enough effort to interlink them together found hattie fascinating and the whole idea of writing about each of her children was also a good one i just felt it could have been better integrated somehow","342":"ayana mathis has one of the most beautiful writing styles of this generation bold statement i know gorgeous gorgeous prose that wind you through the heart breaking lives of hattie's tribe mathis eloquently depicts the plight of the human soul while showing that although we come into this world a unique spirit our generational blood line is such an influence","343":"this is an oprah book i stopped reading her picks a long time ago they were all so sad but this one was pretty good i skimmed through some slow parts","344":"the twelve tribes of hattie didn't appeal to me and i stopped listening to the audiobook","345":"the was another great oprah pick i rated it a 5","346":"life is not always what you expect when you make choices whether to choose one thing or one person over another your belief is that you've made the right choice the twelve tribes of hattie is about sexuality adultery life consequences circumstances and choices in 1923 hattie shepherd was just fifteen years old when she made the decision to leave georgia for a better life in philadelphia to start a family and become a wife her life was hard challenging and the decisions she made were based upon her in experiences of life these challenges as seen through the eyes of her children caused them tremendous stress dysfunction and unforgiveness followed them throughout their adulthood her children did not fully understand that she too was young and inexperienced to make these types of decisions but hattie did not fully understand that her inexperience decisions would cause indecisiveness in the development of her children a decision that hattie made came back to haunt her years later through the decision of her daughter ayana mathis takes us on a journey to how generational curses can and do greatly affect the future","347":"i almost stopped reading about 2 or 3 chapters into the book but i'm so glad i stuck with it these are more like short stories but all related and some of them are really powerful and amazing","348":" this book was frustrating for me i loved each character ad wanted to know more about all of their lives just when you get sucked in the chapter ends and you learn about a different child there is little connect between children and do not hear about them again after the chapter is done summary hattie the mother moves from georgia to philly she gets caught up in the wrong man august ad continues to live her life in poverty she has a billion children each chapter is about one of her children and where they are in one small part f their life i think the author is a brilliant writer if 3 things happened this book would have been my favorite 1 with such a strong title and christian influence i wish there would have been more symbolism and a connect to say the 12 tribes of judah 2 i wanted to know more about each child and what happened to then 3 stronger endinghopefully the author keeps writing about this family because i'm obsessed with them","349":"well written and interesting kind of lost me at the end","350":"i think this is an excellent first book for a young author i enjoyed reading it and glad that i did i also rate as 3 5 stars the excerpts from each child or tribe member was interesting but left me wanting to know more about them the other thing that bothered me is the fact that every single person is so damaged while i understand that difficult childhoods can cause damage there are so many people who overcome that and have happy productive lives but still liked the book","351":"disappointing it was a series of chapters about each of hattie's children rather than a good plot line of her life with them to me it was lacking as i did not feel involved with the family","352":" ayana mathis is a gifted writer but i really did not enjoy this book as much as i expected to from the glowing reviews i was really hoping to connect more with the characters especially hattie my parents were from philadelphia as well and stuggled through the depression also we had a huge family and very little money but my mother always gave us love and affection which didn't cost a thing i think hattie's tragic losses during this time pretty much altered and mostly ruined her other children's lives and this was so frustrating and sad to me she raised all of them like an automaton never giving them the love and tenderness they needed i guess she couldn't give of herself again after that kind of pain life is about choices we make too and she picked a drinking philandering gambling man for a husband and we see this same trait in just about all of her sons the women all seemed to be filled with serious emotional mental health issues some totally debilitating hopefully hattie saves one from the next generation at the end but the rest was just so very depressing to me","353":"what ok maybe i am missing something with this book i don't know there were some really great parts some really boring parts and some really huh parts view spoiler the biggest huh part being the end hide spoiler i don't know i just don't know i will let this review sit for awhile and come back and edit it","354":"what a great and well written novel i found myself trying to calculate hattie's age with each new chapter the stories of each child were wonderfully developed except for cassie i wanted to know more about what happened with them books that leave me wanting more are books that i feel are deserving of a 5 star rating","355":" a good first novel very well written it is the story of a very young black mother raising 11 kids in philadelphia starting in the 1920s and ranging to the 1980s each chapter is a story of the mother or one of the children no one has an easy life is the mother to blame while the device of changing narrator moves the story along there are characters you wish would get more than one chapter i mistakenly checked this out thinking it was a novelization of hattie the involuntary donor of tissue used for cancer treatment studies interesting read but lacks some overall societal viewpoint of the roles of race and gender during the times covered i bet the author returns to some of the characters in longer form","356":"really good book but i just couldn't quite give it 4 stars i would have liked more time with each character glad i read it just didn't love it","357":"i liked the well constructed and descriptive sentences as did oprah based on her highlights however i did not connect with the characters as much as the author wanted from me","358":"i'll be honest i was confused during the first couple if chapters with what was going on however once i got into it i really enjoyed it","359":"hattie's children did not grow to reflect what they could have there were so many disappointments it is hard to understand why the love and constancy that was in their lives did not give them more support hattie was not a hands on mother but she was stronger than she could have been in many ways","360":" hattie believed in god's might but she didn't believe in his interventions at least he was indifferent god wasn't any of her business and she wasn't any of his in church on sundays she looked around the sanctuary and wondered if anyone else felt the way she did if anyone else was there because they believed in the ritual and the hymn singing and good preaching more than they believed in a responsive sympathetic god this harmless thought of hattie shepherd unsaid and kept only in the silence of her mind is profound in its simplicity in trying to grasp the divine existence of god in connection to his seeming frozen relationship with his creations this is hattie's worn out spirit beaten in the depth of her consciousness for all the troubles as she comes to find justification and explanation to her strife filled life that extended even to the lives of her children it draws the line that separates men from the divine being underlining our incapacity to comprehend the abstract purpose of god as it shows the infantile state of our consciousness compared to the omniscience mind overflowing with transcendental love that carries us still through our lifetime of wailings the twelve tribes of hattie is an excerpt of this somewhat helpless and wretched condition of man against the mysterious power that governs destinies ordinary in so many ways but made extraordinary by ayana mathis' vivid illustration of reality painting the intertwined lives of the shepherd family flooded with lifetimes of tribulations and isolations as if defenselessly being washed away by an unstoppable strong gush of water that destroys everything in its path this novel which centered on the life of hattie shepherd appears like a collection of short stories that serve as a new testament for modern people the new tribes of god searching for salvation amid the bleakness of despair in the sea of hopelessness death as the inevitable end of life appears in the novel as hattie's beginning as her story culminates with the lost of her precious babies a seeming violent act of nature that strikes a trauma in her killing the joy in her young life an ominous beginning that seem to mold the lives of her children as it is a single event that defines a generation of family as hattie becomes destiny's unconscious conspirator in preparing her children to the different roles that they are about to occupy in the world this nature's designation justifies the beginning of an event and the resulting end of an action taking place simultaneously in the linearity of everything but appears invisible as it is overshadowed by the elaborate designs of our intertwined lives it is the same pattern ayana mathis used in the novel as the stories seem to be separated in between as it appears without sequential continuity yet manages to combine the stories as one novel through the constant apparition of hattie's spirit in their lives ","361":"somewhat on the fence with this one it started out pretty slow for me and i had a hard time merging the individual stories in my head about a third of the way through it picked up though and i got more into the book but it never really became great for me just okay","362":"honestly i thought it would be a really good book but it just ended up being ok","363":"i received this book as a christmas gift and was eager to read it after a good review in entertainment weekly the book is one of the on trend novels via interconnected short story here a series of short stories focusing on hattie a black woman who moves from the deep south to philadelphia in the 1920s each of the chapters short stories is titled with the names of one or more of her many children or grandchildren beginning in 1925 with the infancy of hattie's twins and ending in 1980 with a young granddaughter i liked the book a lot in the beginning but less as the novel went on the first story was heart breaking and beautiful the next few were compelling but i eventually began to tire a bit of this family where every person seems to have had major issues and nothing ever seems to go right overall i do recommend it but it can be a tough read","364":"i wanted to like this book because i saw the author interviewed on oprah's super soul sundays a while back but the ending lost me completely i enjoyed the build up but when i got to the end it was very disappointing i'm not sure i recommend this","365":"excellent read each character is deeply formed and expressed impossible to leave it without having a sense of what these people have lived and that is after all the point of all of this we're up to isn't it","366":"the book didn't get going for me until 1 3 of the way in glad i stuck with it read some reviews that i did not agree with in the end i didn't feel these were disconnected short stories rather they were the 12 tribes of hattie well done ms mathis","367":"this is a well written if incredibly depressing saga of an african american family in the twentieth century relentlessly tragic from the first pages nothing good ever happens to these people and just when you think it can't get any worse it does the prose is nice though","368":"started out so sad i almost put it down permanently am so glad i didn't no spoilers from me","369":"hattie's story really begins in georgia when she is 15 and fleeing with her mother and sister her father's blacksmith shop has been taken over by white men who have murdered him they escape to philadelphia where hattie sees for the first time whites and blacks intermingling it is there that she meets august and loses her head for one night foretelling the rest of her life she gives birth to twins named philadelphia and jubilee names she believes are not part of the past but part of the future both contract pneumonia in the days before penicillin and succumb to the disease for the next 56 years until 1980 we walk through hattie's life through the lives of her progeny each of them seems to be born under some kind of a cloud or some failure they can't overcome racism emotional and mental disorders alcoholism gambling unfaithfulness are part and parcel of their daily lives they must be subservient to a cruel class of whites who demand absolute obedience and when successful they in turn abuse their own servants this atmosphere places a heavy burden upon all of them sometimes too heavy to bear responsibly hard as she tries hattie's children fail to appreciate her efforts and see her as \"the general\" lacking in tenderness doing only what is necessary yet it is hattie who holds this family together through all its trials guides and comforts them in her own way nurses them in sickness provides them with food and shelter managing the meager allowance she often is given by august the story tells a tale of racism sexual abuse poverty faith humiliation illness and adultery hattie's courage and quiet guidance is often misunderstood for coldness she too is prone to outbursts of anger and misguided ways as are many of her children she too makes foolish decisions for which she repents her life is one of unappreciated sacrifice the reader is left to wonder if the travails visited upon the family are the results of their environment the world they lived in or of their own personal failures and or genetic inheritance the lack of civil rights during most of her life the lack of life saving drugs the lack of equality shaped all of them in different ways they earned their livings in the only ways they could find acceptable and profitable some were more honorable than others the humiliation they had to swallow as others swallow water was difficult to read about and difficult to put into the context of america how in g d's name did such egregious behavior against a particular group of people continue to be acceptable for so long in an enlightened world how did they manage to submit to the mortification to which they were subjected how did they conceal their shame and their fury some were unable and paid a heavy price it is through the brief lives of the twins philadelphia and jubilee floyd hattie's musician son who is also gay six who is frail and scarred from a terrible accident who is subject to uncontrollable fits of violence who then becomes somewhat of a charlatan minister her daughter cassie who hears voices telling her to do irrational things cassie's daughter sala her grandchild who finally breaks through hattie's rigid persona alice who is often medicated by her husband because she is haunted by visions of tom a man who once abused her brother billips who is described as somewhat limited in capability belle who has tb and who tries to commit suicide when her boyfriend walter leaves her by discontinuing her medications and starving herself who also engages in an affair with the same man lawrence with whom hattie had an affair and a child causing an irreparable rift between them ruthie known also as margaret who was the love child of hattie and lawrence ella who was a child hattie couldn't care for properly because august was out of work and so she gives her to her well to do sister pearl and franklin who is married to sissy who is father of lucille is stationed in saigon and whose drinking gambling and womanizing are the ruination of his life and his marriage these are all common threads throughout the story it is a sad story about faith in the presence of hopelessness conquest in the presence of enemies bravery in the presence of danger on every front and incredibly foolish decisions often based on a lack of knowledge and or self control in this book as in many others today the woman in the home seems to be the stronger influence the more stabilizing factor the one with the most responsibility for instilling values the men often go far afield of expectations and often excuse their own stupid behavior until there are dire consequences","370":"this book took me a month to read the first chapter reeled me in but i became a little disenchanted with the second and third chapters so i put it down when i decided to pick it up again i was once again taken in by hattie and her children overall a really good read if somewhat heartbreaking i really felt their pain and at times really identified with their individual journeys i'm really glad i read it","371":"this book was such an easy read though i had to reorient myself with each chapter i was captivated by the storytelling and the lives of the characters it is quite well written and left me wanting more this would make a fantastic bookclub pick","372":"the journey of hattie and family spans from 1925 1980 it's about a woman in search of a better life the novel has alternating chapters between hattie and her 11 children and 1 grandchild in the opening chapters we learn that hattie loses her young twins to illness hattie never recovers from the loss of her babies and so begins the heart wrenching story of hattie and family this novel left me with a range of emotions","373":" lovely and provocative writing but the slice of life character chapters were disconnected hattie's choices and how they affected her children each is the subject of a chapter and her relationships with them are clarified somewhat in the last chapter you might want to read it first but it's too little too late my 3 stars are really all about the writing which is beautifully descriptive read it before or after wilkerson's the warmth of other suns the epic story of america's great migration","374":"after finishing the novel what struck me most is the lack of character development while i thought each individual chapter was written there was no real progress made for any of the characters i wish that there had been more interconnectedness","375":"i found this book to be just ok did not live up to all the hype some chapters characters were much stronger with more compelling writing than with others this unevenness made it seem as though different people wrote the different chapters not very cohesive","376":"in actuality not novel but a collection of short stories though mathis developed highly complex characters it was frustrating to only get a small portion of their stories i kept wanting to know what had happened to the children after also i would've liked to see more of hattie as well as the family dynamic as a whole each character's story was incredibly isolated from the family","377":"for the most part i enjoyed each child's story but i felt like it didn't add up to anything at the end it was relentlessly depressing can i say that but she can certainly write","378":"description off amazon in 1923

courage and the journey of a nation this just doesn't seem to be my month for books everything i've picked up i've really wanted to love because who picks up a book to hate it but everything has been so so and this book is no different when picking it up from the library my first clue it wouldn't be a favorite is it's an oprah book club book those books rarely have a good effect on me don't get me wrong i didn't dislike the book i just didn't love it i had a surge of feelings and love for the character hattie right away i just connected to her the narratives of her children though were hit and miss with me and at times i just found the book boring i understand and appreciate the concept of where this book was going and its meaning it was beautifully written unforgettable and full of significance but i just kept grasping for something more that just wasn't there which led me to give it the star rating i did","379":"a beautiful story about a family beautifully told","380":"i was expecting more considering this was an oprah read i didn't really enjoy it that much i stuck with it though and read it all i really didn't like how it skipped around in time because it confused me a lot also i didn't like how it just ended","381":" thought this was a bunch of short stories loosely tied together but it wasn't it seemed to start out that way and i'm not fond of short stories but it was actually the story of hattie from 1925 to 1980 the narration was mostly through her eyes and sometimes through her children's eyes but it moved along through time and kept the story riveting not sure if i liked hattie but i certainly sympathized with her not sure if i liked all of her children either but it's really hattie that the reader gets to know and reluctantly at least for me admireayana mathis the author writes beautifully she weaves words like a maestro conductor her characterizations have depth and the plot has tension and creativity a slightly different kind of a book but one that shouldn't be overlooked","382":"there are some powerful scenes in this book i could almost smell the smells and feel the textures although the main characters of the chapters were related their stories could each stand alone i enjoyed reading this","383":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i became interested in this book because oprah had selected it for her book club the twelve tribes of hattie is a sad and emotional novel outlining the journey of hattie's life hattie has experienced many losses disappointments and responsibilities

know each child as well as learn more about hattie as emotional or sad as the story is ayana mathis does leave us with a sense of hope at the book's conclusion the book does show that life is an unpredictable journey not a destination it's not a happy story but one definitely worth reading more","384":" the twelve tribes of hattiei read this book with my office book club and was very pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed this book i've been reading a lot thus far this year about motherhood this fictional mother offered a perspective with which i have no experience however it helped my better understand and empathize with the decisions that my ancestors have made for their children hattie is a beautiful strong and troubled mother who started having children very young and had to live with the tragedy of her their loss simply because of ignorance a simple and inexpensive medicine could have saved them but when you think back to that time how many children died because of ignorance whether its that of the parents or the community as you learn about each of her children you see their different personalities and experiences the author brilliantly captures multiple personalities and lifestyles through the eyes of one family over a 40 year period you will truly enjoy this book and with an endorsement from oprah it can't be too bad","385":"i enjoyed it so much i'm reading it again i will probably give it that final star after i finish it one more time","386":"wonderfully written and very moving this emotional tale of a family written over many years was a wonderful read hard at times to read due to its extreme emotional nature but very good at the same time","387":"a great read once you get through the initial hump of the first few chapters","388":"raw and no nonsense mathis shows the pain one family can have through race and poverty through bad choices and the best choices we can make still between the sad stories of loss there's a lot of love to be found","389":"difficult read but important readi feel there was a main story line and that the stories made a lot of sense together although about many different characters","390":"very depressing i feel very sad for all people who live have lived such tragic lives","391":"a powerful book but it seemed to just end mid story","392":"i enjoyed the e book on the ipad but i was very upset to miss pages and paragraphs from the downloaded book who do you talk to in order to remedy the situation i'm tired of missing sentences over and over again in my downloaded novels this book was particularly offensive in that regard can you just download the book again at no cost i'm off to the apple store to figure it out","393":"this book was ok but a little depressing each of the kids had a different take on their mother but none of the kids was functional in society i enjoyed some of the chapters but i would not read this book again","394":"by a brief introduction to each of hattie's children in the various chapters of the book we were able to piece together the fabric of hattie's life she had a lot of strength and resilience as she faced many tragedies and disappointments over all the stories were too sketchy to be fulfilling and didn't even seem to be related except for the fact that we knew they were all hattie's children","395":"this is the story of hattie and august shepherd and their 11 children and granddaughter each chapter deals with one of the children at a specific age and point in time ranging from 1923 to 1980 a vignette of sorts so you don't get any closure or information on how that particular person turned out the entire family is crazy and i doubt i would have read past the first chapter if this wasn't for book club here are my notes on the 12 tribes contains spoilers 1 and 2 philadelphia and jubilee 1923 hattie marries august because she is pregnant and never really loves him the twin babies die of pneumonia before their first birthday an absolutely heart breaking first chapter and i almost stopped reading altogether hattie never recovers from the loss of her first two children a recurring theme 3 floyd 27 yrs old a womanizing musician who falls for a young man but denies himself his happy ending4 six 15 yrs old scarred from a childhood burning accident has religious and violent fits hattie sends him away to preach for a summer when he almost kills a neighbourhood boy he is one of the few children that hattie mentions again at the end of the book she says that he turns into a womanizer and a fraud 5 ruthie 1951 another baby and the daughter of the affair with lawrence hattie runs off to baltimore with lawrence but she is gone all of 15 hours 6 ella 1954 6 mos old this chapter largely talks about hattie's sister pearl and her husband and their journey from georgia to take the baby to live with them there are lots of references to jim crow and the treatment of blacks and the resulting fear and anger although hattie does what is best for her child i really stopped liking her or at least feeling sorry for her at this point she is so proud and never lets august forget that she married down 7 alice 25 yrs old wealthy married to a doctor chapter deals with her planning a party for her entire family to celebrate one of floyd's performances she thinks she's better than everyone else and while she has definitely gotten out of the poverty that consumes most of her family she is still miserable absolutely consumed by guilt over what happened to billops when they were children to the point that she sees thomas everywhere 8 billops 23 yrs old dating alice's maid and working hard to get out from under her thumb abused by thomas as a child 9 franklin 1969 a soldier in vietnam this chapter is in a completely different tone than the rest of the book the only one narrated by a man scenes from the war are interspersed with stories from his courtship of sissy 10 belle 1975 dying from tb but refuses the help

finds out the truth scene in the department store belle doesn't speak to her mother again until she saves her and brings her to the hospital at this point hattie and august have been married for 50 years and there is hope that they will finally get the house they've been saving for that whole time 11 cassie 1980 serious psychological issues hears voices this chapter is very short and deals with her being committed to the hospital 12 sallah sp 1980 10 yrs old cassie's daughter being raised by hattie and august at the end of the book hattie is 71 yrs old and still raising children august is 74 yrs old and sick hattie goes up to the altar to stop sallah from taking god she sees this as losing yet another child","396":"the entire story seemed incomplete too many pieces were missing","397":"didn't feel the characters were developed enough for me to like any of them only ok","398":"i just cant get through it the chapters dont tie together and im not enjoying it so im giving up after 4 chapters","399":"this is really more of a book of short stories than a novel but they are all good so much sketched in with the most evocative details","400":"i definitely want to read again wasn't sure i liked it that much at first then couldn't quit reading and was sorry when i finished i was drawn into the characters and loved the pictures that the author drew of each one's life felt like i was right there with them so many times intense","401":"mathis writes of the abuse poverty u0026amp oppression that results in family dysfunction to the extreme with the author's skill and passion her characters endure sadly there are no rays of hope or success stories among hattie's children and the reader like hattie is left with the realization that it takes more than a generation","402":"this book is a family history of sorts it begins with hattie shepherd leaving the jim crow south for a better life in philadelphia hattie's hope soon turns to despair after the loss of her firstborn children spanning the years 1925 to 1980 the book follows hattie's children and one grandchild her twelve tribes each chapter concerns one or two of them as they strive to find a place for themselves in the world though she is not the central character in all the chapters hattie's influence is clearly evident throughout it is her mothering or lack thereof that shapes each child saddled with a feckless husband she must raise her children in crushing poverty devastated by her loss and faced with the relentless demands of caring for a growing number of children she focuses only on providing their most basic needs of food shelter and clothing and preparing them for a world that she believes will not love them and will not be kind \"hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman - perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind\" 236 unfortunately hattie's own spirit of hopelessness infects each child with the poverty of hopelessness as evidenced in the paths their lives take one child is a closeted gay another child becomes a fraudulent preacher one son is sexually abused another son becomes a gambler and a drunk one daughter suffers from a mental disease another daughter attempts suicide despite hattie's failings as a mother a discerning reader will find it impossible to hate her as one of her daughters says \"mother was never tender \" but \"mother has always done what's necessary\" 220 whenever one of her children is in distress she does come to their aid even if that child has done something which hurt her more than she can find words to express 215 and which makes even the child believe she is undeserving of her mother's forgiveness 190 hattie too was a victim of circumstances \"fate had plucked hattie out of georgia to birth eleven children and establish them in the north but she was only a child herself utterly inadequate to the task she'd been given\" 236 furthermore she is not able to cultivate her inner life as one of her daughter's realizes \"mother was a beautiful young woman the house was too plain too small to contain her i understood she had an inner life that didn't have anything to do with me or my brothers and sisters\" 221 when hattie tries to escape and find some personal happiness she is unsuccessful one of her daughters observes \"she'd never seen any joy in her at all hattie had been stern and angry all of bell's life and it occurred to her that her mother must have been unhappy most of the time\" 201 her husband perhaps best summaries hattie's life when he thinks \"there were too many disappointments to name and too much heartbreak\" 106 hattie admits her shortcomings she tells one of her daughters \"'i never did know what to do about my children's spirits i didn't know how to help anybody in that way'\" 215 hattie's sister gives the following description of hattie \"hattie had never been easy to love she was too quiet it was impossible to know what she was thinking and she was angry all of the time and so disdainful when her high expectations weren't met\" 127 a daughter uses almost the same words \"how stoic and constant mother was how seething and unfathomable secretive and quick tempered\" 201 in the end hattie admits \"she had been angry with her children and with august who'd brought her nothing but disappointment\" 236 but suggests she is leaving that anger behind \"'but i've been mad all my life and i finally figured out that i couldn't keep carrying that with me it's too heavy and i'm tired'\" 215 anger \"hadn't served her when she was young and wouldn't serve her now\" 243 she may also have time to show tenderness \"she patted her granddaughter's back roughly unaccustomed as she was to tenderness\" 243 it may have taken hattie 55 years to change but then human beings do not change easily especially if they are as proud as hattie i do not choose books because they are recommended by oprah in fact i often choose not to read them if they appear on her lists this time however i'm glad i overcame my initial reluctance this is an excellent novel especially considering it is a debut work the story it tells of people \"wounded and chastened\" 111 can be bleak but the book is beautifully written with a definite lyrical quality the book may take the reader to dark places but as hattie says \"'everybody's been there'\" 215 and we can learn from those visits please check out my reader's blog http schatjesshelves blogspot ca and follow me on twitter @dcyakabuski","403":"very quiet moving novel that kind of sneaks up on you primarily focuses on the messed upness of a woman and all her numerous children in various stages in their lives","404":"this book started out a little slow but was well worth reading it is a good book","405":"we never read about hattie in the first person but rather learn about her life through the perspectives of her children and grandchild woven tales in chronological order bring depth and dimension to a strong and powerful woman whose priority is always her family great book","406":"i enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would it was almost like a book of short stories but it all tied back to hattie each chapter was about a different child although a few were about hattie and so some were more enjoyable than others so while i prefer a less disjointed story i did like it","407":"both touching and troubling the twelve tribes of hattie provides a glimpse of life during segregated america not typically portrayed the north","408":"read like a book of short stories liked it","409":"i often choose to read books to see what all the hype is about this was one of those books i loved it mathis writes beautifully and in such a way that i felt i was with each of the characters i enjoyed how real these stories were i enjoyed the book's sadness","410":"this book was amazing but the ending left me wanting more it wasn't bad i just wanted more i suppose given the way the book was written there was no logical way to end the book i imagine the character's lives just continuing on the characters that were developed were developed amazingly and i loved seeing the different children's perspectives of their mother","411":"brilliant moving","412":"apparently i am not literary enough because i do not understand the point of this book at all i guess the twelve tribes of hattie are her 11 kids plus the grandchild at the very end this book started with a few characters lead you through about a day of their life always a crappy life and then abruptly would switch to the next few characters i never knew which character was one of hattie's kids until halfway through their story when there would be a reference to hattie there never was a time when it was stated how my kids hattie actually had until about the last chapter and i still couldn't tell you their names this book jumped around and never really finished anything all of the characters were crazy or sick or troubled or whatever and nobody ever had anything good happen to them in 60 years ugh do yourself a favor and skip this book","413":"as much as i loved the writing style in fact i thought the writing was fantastic i couldn't give this book 5 stars because of the ending i enjoyed each of the characters and their different road in life i just felt like the ending didn't bring it all around and make enough connections i would still recommend it but i can't add it to my favorites","414":"this book examines the life of an african american woman from the south who raises her family in philadelphia we see her through the eyes of each of her children in addition to her own perspective liked the ending","415":"this was very good it is all about hattie's eleven children and their hates loved jealousies addictions and careers the viet nam segment was especially touching she loved her children and her sisters but could not express her feelings her lack of sharing her emotions reverberated through her family for many years affecting her children and then her grandchildren","416":"i thought the book was interesting different from what i normally read i only wish ayana had put the tribes together at the end so we'd know how they all ended up still good read","417":" once again oprah has chosen a real downer of a book that focuses on dysfunction and not much that is redeeming in her latest book club selection rather than being a novel this was a series of short stories focusing on various children of hattie's i didn't find much to like about any of them but i did feel sorry for most who got pretty poor mothering from hattie who rather than show love and kindness focused on keeping them alive i suppose that is all she was capable of but i would hope that one doesn't preclude the other i kept reading in the hopes that it would somehow all come together but it never did","418":"this book tells the story of hattie and her family starting with hattie's struggle to keep her twins alive and ending with her struggle to keep her grandchild from going down the same path some of her own children followed the novel takes quite a few twists and turns tells many interesting stories and sends readers into the depths of the family's lives there are many very good things about this read but the one thing that makes it a difficult read is the way it's put together the chapters follow lives of different family members and it is often well into the 2nd or 3rd page of the chapter before it's clear where the person you're reading about fits into hattie's life if it ever becomes apparent at all this is definitely cumbersome and frustrating and it led me to wonder why exactly so many people have touted this book to be such a phenomenal read this is a three star read at best three stars for the content of the various stories not for the flow of the entire book overall","419":"draining and sorrowful","420":"this is a story of a black girl from georgia who moves to philadelphia with her family to escape the discrimination of the south she is 15 when she gets pregnant and the boy two years older offers to marry her twins are born and die of pneumonia very early in their life this is devastating to hattie this is a story set by circumstances and a woman who ends up raising 9 children in a stern and angry manner she stays in a marriage out of convenience and the story details the issues each of her children experience as a result in the end she mellows and helps the children she is able to help and focuses on her one granddaughter determined to do well by her","421":"good read","422":"most of the chapters could stand alone as short stories the unifying thread is hattie whom we get to know mostly through the eyes of her adult children","423":"sweet melancholy book about a woman whose life was seemingly set in sad motion from the start and she couldn't undo any of it","424":" i thought the prose was really good mathis' ability to build strong characters was certainly hinted at but there were too many people and too many ideas for me to figure out what she was ultimately trying to say with the novel by the end you see the cracks in hattie's very solid and tough veneer but not enough light shines for you to take away much more than that her life was really hard i also don't understand why the family house was on wayne street instead of wayne avenue every other philadelphia detail seemed right enough","425":"i was disappointed in this book the premise was truly intriguing following a woman who leaves the south during the early years of the great migration for a better life in the north and the fate of her children through the years on the plus side ms mathis' love and command of the english language is on full display she weaves word pictures brilliantly so that you can see and smell the scenes on the down side and this is a serious down side the story structure is to say the least odd it opens in the early 1920's with a tragedy chapter 2 is called 'floyd' and takes place more than 20 years later my 1st reaction was who the heck is floyd this continues to be a problem throughout the book characters appear with no immediate explanation as to their relationship to the other characters and then just as quickly disappear sometimes to never surface again making matters worse there is not a single major character that is not so severely flawed as to make them completely unsympathetic the awaited redemption of anyone never comes and there are at least two chapters read characters that felt haphazard and superficial","426":"i am fascinated by the history of slavery and the strong black race that had to endure i cannot fathom the idea that one human is treated so horribly by another human this book seemed to have no flow i couldn't keep track of what was going on and who was who i just assumed being an oprah's pick that this would be good i didn't bother to look at reviews ahead of time lesson learned read the reviews i was just trying to get through the book i didn't finish read previous reviews for better judgements","427":"very difficult subject matter poverty hopelessness despair penned accurately and with integrity","428":"i think ayana mathis is not quite in the footsteps of toni morrison but her allegory of black history is ambitious her writing is precise and the series of portaits makes it an easy read more life could have linked the characters and more details could have shaped the ambiguous figure of hattie but over all i enjoyed the book and will keep an eye on the next ones","429":"i really enjoyed this story the main character's story is told through the eyes of her children but she also tells her own story with powerful conviction","430":"spoilers ruined the ending the book was ok","431":"parts of this book were interesting parts of it not so much","432":"$24 95 reading ayana mathis' epic debut the twelve tribes of hattie i could not help but think of the poem \"a dream deferred\" by harlem renaissance poet langston hughes 1902 1967 what happens to a dream deferred does it dry uplike a raisin in the sun or fester like a sore--and then run does it stink like rotting meat or crust and sugar over--like a syrupy sweet maybe it just book review the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathisthe twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis knopf 256 pages $24 95 treading ayana mathis' epic debut the twelve tribes of hattie i could not help but think of the poem \"a dream deferred\" by harlem renaissance poet langston hughes 1902 1967 what happens to a dream deferred does it dry uplike a raisin in the sun or fester like a sore--and then run does it stink like rotting meat or crust and sugar over--like a syrupy sweet maybe it just sagslike a heavy load or does it explode hattie mathis' central character and her family left their home in georgia as part of the african american exodus to the north during the great migration six million blacks moved out of the rural south to the northeast midwest and west from around 1910 to 1970 twhen their exodus began slavery had long been abolished yet african americans were still very much bound segregation discrimination and physical violence prompted blacks to hope for better lives in urban centers like chicago and new york city some may have had families in those cities others set out with uncertainty knowing no one but desperate for better lives the dreams of many were fulfilled as they found jobs and discovered new avenues open to them the dreams of others as hughes lyrically laments were deferred thattie belongs in the latter category in 1925 she and her husband august live in philadelphia where they rent a house and where august works long hours hattie gives birth to twins philadelphia and jubliee appellations \"that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in georgia...names of promise and of hope reaching forward names not looking back ones \"the names she chooses for her children are significant philadelphia represents their new home the city of philadelphia hattie has high hopes for her family's future in this great city the name then carries with it all of hattie's optimisms and dreams the name jubilee evokes echoes of the african american juneteenth celebrations that marked the end of slavery the first celebration occurred june 19 1865 in the north hattie's children are free and do not have to worry about seeing august beaten as hattie once saw happen to her own father in philadelphia hattie is certain that her twins will have opportunities she did not have growing up in georgia when the twins become ill with pneumonia at seven months old hattie's world is shaken she tries to lessen their cough with eucalyptus but the plant is difficult to find in philadelphia when hatties finds the plant she has to buy it this feels so wrong to her back home in georgia a eucalyptus tree is located directly \"across from hattie's house \" such a stark realization leaves her bitter especially when she cannot save them what happens to a dream deferred for hattie losing the twins is earth shattering she feels as if a part of her died with philadelphia and jubilee hattie and august go on to have other children but hattie is never the same after the tragedy for her other offspring to survive in the world hattie must harden herself so she can harden them if they are to survive in the harsh world of the north then hattie must be a survivor she will hold them at arm's length if it means they will reach adulthood she will close herself off from them if it means they will grow strong mathis then chronicles the lives of what happens to hattie's eleven children and one grand child her twelve tribes when we meet each of hattie's progeny in wholly intimate chapters they are all on the cusp of something grappling with identity homophobia abuse and jealousy mathis also illustrates through these chapters how hattie's children see her as cold bitter and sometimes hateful although hattie and august grow apart she still stays with him even after she has a baby by another man and runs away she is bound to august and stays by his side through affairs and economic hardships like the twelve tribes of israel hattie and her children are a family that endures trials and tribulations their survival is a testament to hattie the twelve tribes of hattie cuts to the quick mathis employs incisive gritty dialogue that lodges itself deep in the hearts and guts of readers she can be elegantly precise yet equally coarse and raw showing an amazing range of talent for me mathis' other characters pale next to hattie the author provides fascinating windows into hattie's psyche through her twelve tribes mathis is by no means using hattie to represent all african american women who left the south to make new lives in the north instead mathis is re presenting one possible story through the character of hattie mathis wants to show the gritty underbelly of a family who took part in the great migration with all the sufferings and ordeals such an epic journey would entail hattie's dream of a new life did not go the way she had hoped it would hattie's was a dream deferred that festered crusted over and dried up surely hattie would say her heart rotted and stank perhaps she exploded from the pain hattie had to survive so her children would what a heavy load she carried","433":"i liked the different chapters but not sure if it flowed all that well","434":"good story telling diss appointed by the ending it just seemed to drop away","435":"the ending was a bit of a letdown i do feel bad for the family they have a lot of psychiatric issues","436":"depressing but interesting gave me a different perspective on the great migration","437":" i usually bypass the option to add comments but this time i'd like to chime in reviews of this book seem mixed i loved it and i was surprised that i loved it because though i love oprah i usually find her book club endorsement to be a detracting factor this novel works like a collection of stories with each descendant of hattie given room for their own individual journey these are troubled journeys pronounced family poverty and family struggle shapes each of them differently and there's lots of damage done why did i love the book because it's about the most honest raw and true to life telling of adults trying to process the injuries of their early lives and it broke my heart on a technical level i also thought she did an amazing job producing each character in his or her own unique voice but not in a way that interfered with the need to see the common bonds the length was just right and the time given to thread hattie's experience throughout made it that much more impactful as a whole","438":"i really enjoyed this book by the end at first it was really hard to get into because it felt more like these interconnected short stories than a novel the author tells the story of each of hattie's children chapter by chapter the child is introduced somewhat developed and never heard of again once i decided to approach the book as short stories it was more enjoyable","439":"enjoyed this book although it is incredibly heartbreaking it is essentially a collection of short stories narrated by each of the twelve children of a georgia born african american woman the daughter of slaves that sought refuge in philadelphia in the early 1900's following the death of her twin infants at the age of fifteen the protagonist hattie falls into complete despair angry at the world with a special contempt for her lazy no good husband august coincidentally she and august can't keep their hands off one another resulting in twelve children each of whom struggles with the same demons as august u0026amp hattie lust greed alcoholism drugs and psychosis a beautifully written story but don't read this if you're looking for a happy ending","440":"the quality and storyline were wonderful yet the format left me wanting at each chapter's end this could be the mark of a good writer but i found it more irritating than artistic the characters were strong overall i just wanted more","441":"this book tells the story of a woman hattie and her eleven children and one grandchild hence the twelve tribes the story was interesting and kept me wondering how each child's life would progress every new chapter covered the significant life experiences of one of the children and it kept me engaged in their lives however each character's life was rather depressing the whole read reminded me of thoreau's quote about leading quiet lives of desperation","442":"reminiscent of jasmine ward's writing which i love this too i liked very much","443":"i don't want to read this because of oprah i swear lol","444":"it starts to drag too much mid way through the book making it hard to keep my attention","445":"interesting book fairly depressing can't imagine having 12 children and the daily suffering of living through the 1920's the book captures how many parents were back then not very touchy feely they were just trying to keep a roof over their heads and figure out something for them all to eat just the very basics and living day to day many people are living like this today most of us forget how very lucky we are and that we all try to make it a better world for our children the best way we know how good book","446":"i wanted to like this book i did like several chapters but found it disjointed hard to figure out at times and didn't really care about the characters","447":"i read the first chapter and was hooked second chapter starts out interesting then goes into not one sexual act but two one being bisexual why do authors think they have to do that did not finish the book sad","448":"3 or 4 yes or no interesting well written but it read like a series of short stories rather than a novel hattie was an interesting character and the overall theme was deep but depressing","449":"writing was good i wasn't crazy about the story could not relate to the mother at all","450":"ugh how to rate this book it was so eloquent and so skillfully written but it was hopeless and depressing not enjoyable to read at all in the end i'm glad i finished it but getting to the end was rough","451":"interesting story i felt like just when i was getting interested in the plots of each character they were taken from me and replaced with another several years later i was interested in each story but once the story moved on the reader is left wondering if s he'd hear about the character again and s he doesn't however like i say it was interesting sad it just left me wanting more but in an unsatisfying way","452":" the twelve tribes of hattie is more a series of linked short stories than a novel and while i don't experience books like this too often i almost always enjoy them when i do this book was no different - i enjoyed it tremendously and the format of linked short stories was a fantastic way to tell the story of hattie's life through her children even though the book is ostensibly about hattie's children it turns out that their stories just serve as a vehicle for the reader to get to know this family overall and to get to know hattie better and more clearly as each story goes on the book begins with hattie losing her firstborn twins at a time when she is very young poor and married to a man she hardly knows this loss absolutely rocked hattie to her core and although she had nine more children the loss of those twins was something she felt deep in her soul every minute of every day for her entire life hattie broke my heart because after the loss of her twins she wasn't able to love the rest of her kids in the same way it was almost like she wanted to show them that love and affection that she knew they deserved but she kept them at arm's length - for fear they'd leave her too or to teach them the harsh ways of the world i'm not really sure - and every one of the children suffered in some way because of her inability to give them what they craved from her mathis is an excellent story teller and although she tells the story of this family in a nonlinear fashion the format really worked for me the reader gets a fully realized picture of this entire family by the time the book is through and it became kind of a game for me to make connections between characters as the chapters went on - figuring out the birth order who got along with which of their siblings who was still living at home when certain events took place things like that the writing is effective and while mathis doesn't use flowery language her prose is very beautiful at times i really enjoyed the twelve tribes of hattie while it's on the slim side the connected short stories really worked for me and i felt deeply for the main character and her children i connected with them in a way that was unexpected given the nonlinear format of the book definitely give it a try if you like unconventional story telling fantastic characters and an emotional story","453":"12 tribes of hattie is not as you might expect as i expected specifically about the title character instead it is about her 12 tribes her children the title i assume is borrowed from the biblical story of joseph as he and his brothers are considered the 12 tribes of israel as in the biblical story there is family strife and hardship in which the family alternates between fighting each other and joining forces ayana mathis has wonderful language and introduces us to each child in a manner that will pull at your emotions from sadness to pity to confusion and hoping that someone will make you smile each of the chapters is about hattie's children from infants to adults from birth to death none of the chapters are actually about hattie herself they all focus on one or a few of the children and mention hattie as it relates to mothering that child you could argue that ruthie's chapter is about hattie but without the baby hattie never would've went to baltimore in the first place none of the chapters are about all of the children although a few are about two or three for instance six's accident occurs in the presence of his sisters ms mathis' approach struck me because intentionally or not it conveyed the message that as a mother you no longer have your own story you are now the back story for your children this is a great book club discussion especially for mothers aside from the literary aspects of the book my group also talked about how mother's should can and do relate to their children how does the way we raise our children affect them as they grow up what does and doesn't matter what's it take to stay in a marriage i love a book that comes off the pages and wants to be part of your life this book does that coincidentally i went to a funeral for a woman who had 8 children soon after finishing this book more on how her children's message reminded me of hattie's story is on my blog just piddlin' http slackermomof4 blogspot com 201","454":"this book had so much potential but the characters were incomplete each chapter was about one of hattie's children each child was more dysfunctional than the one before was it all hattie's fault the author seems to think so a disappointing read","455":"didn't get past chapter 2 maybe it was going to be worth it maybe not","456":"excellent book i had to go back and look at each chapter when i was done did things really turn out the way they did for hattie and her children","457":"i haven't been so engrossed by a book in a long time","458":"maybe more enjoyable as a printed book i found the audiobook difficult to follow in places and most of the stories not that interesting","459":"richly drawn characters very emotional another winner for oprah's book club","460":"brilliant writing and magnificent storytelling one of my favorite reads of 2016 so far","461":"i finally got around to reading this powerful collection of related vignettes centered around a woman named hattie and her children i found the first couple of brief stories a little less interesting but those that focused on hattie were beautifully crafted heart wrenching and profound","462":"i just finished this book and it was okay i could maybe bump it up to 2 5 stars parts of it i really liked the concept the difficult life of hattie revealed by through the stories of each of her children grandchildren however i never really felt like i got to know any of the characters fully and the book was somewhat disjointed as it switched from narrator to narrator","463":"like many other reviewers i had to think really hard about how to rate this book i enjoyed it i didn't necessarily love it but it is a good read most of the complaints that i've read regarding the book is that there is no plot the lack of a plot in this type novel is not really an issue for me because this is really a character study character studies do not necessarily involve a moving identifiable plot it is more about defining characters i generally like character driven novels so this really fit for me initially i did find it hard to really immerse myself into the author's world after the first 20 25 pages however my interest really picked up when the author introduces interesting characters i did find the writing somewhat dry and i think that this may have been the problem with the first several pages though i read this book following a toni morrison novel i also thought that some of the character development was somewhat cliche and i wish that the author had introduced more interesting obstacles in the character's lives overall i enjoyed and will definitely read more from this author","464":"if i was rating the writing and the characters i would give this book 4 stars however it almost feels like each chapter is a short story loosely connected by the main character of hattie i would have liked the book a lot more if the stories were more closely woven together also i had high expectations when i started this book so maybe that's part of it too","465":"a depressing story about the different ways a mother can lose her children hattie lives a hard life of poverty never having the time or inclination to show her love to her children in any other way besides keeping them alive she loses two children through natural death in their infancy and as the story unfolds over the years the reader gets to watch her lose other children through secrecy mental illness physical distance and emotional distance at the very end of the story comes a glimmer of hope that hattie can change and help a grandchild in a way that she failed her children but that story is not told this was not an enjoyable read i did not like any of the characters i also did not like the way the story was told having hattie as the main character but each chapter being told from a different indirect perspective with leaps in time the lives of this family was the story with each chapter being a random window for the reader to glimpse the family through leaving the characters undeveloped and the story incomplete however this is the author's first book and i see promise for her future writings","466":" listened to this as an audiobook the writing itself was good and i liked the almost short story structure each story involves one of hattie's children or hattie herself about 3 4 of the way through though i found myself wondering when someone was going to end up happy and normal it never happened although we are lead to think that hattie is going to finally get it together and save her granddaughter from the fate of her mother aunts and uncles not sure what point the author was trying to make the northern migration was bad having 11 kids is bad religion is bad drinking and promiscuity are bad all of the above","467":"quick read i'm trying to get into the fiction genre despite the reality of dysfunct families this was a good pickup great narration but arupt end kinda disappointed the storyline doesn't get its punch into midway through the book as well","468":"enchanting i read it in great gulps within 24 hours family life history inner demons joy grief the great and the small struggles of life highly recommended","469":"solid writing lines that made me pause but it felt like a collection of short stories not seamlessly tied together left wanting more","470":"i cried laughed held my breath was mad smiled some whew","471":"i hesitate reading this for two reasons 1 i wasn't sure i wanted to read an upsetting book about race and 2 i usually don't go for oprah books i am so glad i read this book this is some excellent writing powerful and unapologetic while the story draws strength from the black experience in america this book is really about what it means to survive in life sometimes physically but most importantly psychologically i guess oprah has to be right sometimes","472":"quite moving somewhat disturbing novel of a black woman who has to leave georgia while young because her blacksmith father is jim crowed out of the neighborhood the northern destination is philadelphia where hattie's long life continues married young to a man who can't keep it in his pants once he's out of their home she loses her baby twins to illness despite her heroic attempts at keeping them alive she never gets over that loss but she bears and raises numerous children in poverty and hardship and without a great deal of overt affection but with a great deal of strength all but one of the large number of children are fathered by her never steady working always gadding about town husband he can be pleasant and charming when he's home and he seems to care for his children but his sense of responsibility and initiative to provide for his family are lacking without hattie's ramrod strength and she makes some very difficult sometimes heartrending decisions to provide for her children i don't want to imagine the possible outcomes along with hattie's story the stories of each of her children and a grandchild are cleverly structured into the narrative by and large the african american men in this narrative do not come across too positively mathis probably endures some criticism for this i think she's trying to tell a no holds barred realistic story that is well worth reading","473":"a little confusing because each chapter focused on a different kid","474":"i felt like the author wrote a bunch of short stories and combined them to make a book it seemed like an endless read","475":"finally finished it was ok but not sure if i would compare her to toni m perhaps it was too real too gritty for me","476":"i wasn't sure how many stars to give this book this is really a book of short stories i found no reason to keep reading after the first couple of stories in fact some of the stories were down right boring but hey oprah loved it so if you've liked other books oprah selected for her book club you might like this one too","477":"very well written beautifully constructed","478":"i thought it was just ok the writing was good but i would have liked to see more intertwining of the characters it bugged me how separate they were which may have been the point if you grow up in a household without a lot of affection you may not form family bonds","479":"didn't finish it","480":"i did not fall in love with this story it was a sad tale of a miscommunication between one generation and the chance to create change with a future generation i can see the silver lining that opportunities offer for the main character","481":"really i would prefer to give two ratings 4 5 stars for evocative language and characters that feel like real people and 1 2 stars for the mfa style that's too show don't tell insistent to allow for a real plot books like this don't feel like a narrative and i wish ayana mathis had laid out more of the the fascinating stories that this family held","482":"loved the stories from the perspectives of all the children of hattie sort of unbelievable that all of this misfortune would befall one family but enjoyed the storytelling and lessons learned","483":"this is a good one hattie her children and her tragic life each chapter tells the story of a different child and his her life struggle while keeping hattie's role prominent ending felt right","484":"couldn't get into it in fact i couldn't finish it","485":"this was a poignant story and well written the historical aspects were interesting however i read it over the course of several weeks and it was so hard to keep track of the characters and storyline it would have benefitted from a chart of characters and maybe a timeline of some sort for easy reference","486":"fleeing the violence and prejudice of jim crow georgia hattie arrives in philadelphia as a teenager and promptly marries a boy with whom she shares nothing but raw animal attraction thus they have a stunning number of children over the decades but raise them in an atmosphere of simmering resentment and frosty rectitude each chapter covers a different child sometimes decades apart which makes this more a collection of short stories than a novel it is certainly well written but lacks any really relateable characters since they are encountered only briefly and are not really likeable","487":"oprah thinks you should read this that is enough","488":"want more","489":"book club august 2013 each chapter was written from the perspective of a different family member a good and interesting format only one chapter left me shaking my head enjoyable read","490":"beautifully written but a heartbreaking story of the great migration as told through the lives of the members of one family each narrative revealing more and more about the lead character","491":"i should know not to get sucked in by an oprah book club label new debut author that i will not be reading again hattie and her mother and 2 sisters move from georgia to philadelphia during the great migration story begins with the death of hattie's twins from pneumonia a heartrending account then the book chronicles each of her 9 other children i did not like any of the characters womanizers gamblers fraudsters drunks and ne'r do wells each of them there was absolutely no happiness in this story while we can understand hattie's pain she never showed love to any of her other children if the purpose of this book was to show how depressing life can be it certainly accomplished it","492":"fast read and interesting i really enjoyed the authors writing style and use of descriptive words","493":"didn't love this book but still finished it some characters were written from a better perspective than others it seemed to lack a 'flow'","494":"4 5 stars u0026amp a first novel this was a book club pick that i may not have gotten to otherwise but found it well worth the read it touches on so many themes i suspect it's going to be a very good discussion","495":"i'm surprised how many people refuse to read a book because oprah has endorsed it i'm no oprah worshipper myself but i've found many of her selections to be good including this one not an 'upper' read by any means but who wants to read 'feel good' books all the time anyway i liked mathis's style of writing the individual chapters devoted to each character and did not care that they weren't revisited","496":" in ayana mathis' first book hattie's mother moved her family from georgia to philadelphia in the early 1920's to give her black children a better life hattie marries very young and has 11 children a tribe of twelve counting a granddaughter this is the hard gritty tale of what happens to them unfortunately it is a tale of drinking doing drugs gambling mental illness etc and troubled families and relationships the children feel that their lives are a reflection on hattie who they feel was angry rather than loving true the beginning and ending chapters rate 4 but most of the book rates a 3 do i feel this way because everyone has such a hard life does a book need hope or a promise for a better life does this story truly reflect the lives of children in the migration to the north this book is the second selection of oprah's new book club 2 0","497":"i wish half stars were an option in good reads i would have given this book 3 5 stars the author created interesting characters but each chapter focused on one character and read like a short story hattie the mother was the one thread connecting the stories but it was a thin thread the book was well written overall and very impressive for a first novel but i wish that the author would have included more complex stories about fewer characters","498":"while i wanted to love this book i just didn't that's not to say that i didn't like it but it was so heavy at times well written and entertaining but it started to feel like all those episodes of good times where they almost made it out of the ghetto but didn't the last chapter was probably the saving grace for me","499":"liked it so much more than i initially thought i would love her writing style and the format tribes they way she told her story beautiful tale overall cant wait to read the reviews and interviews with the author now to see the deeper topics i missed","500":"12 intertwined stories about hattie and her children usually not a fan of stories that don't have a flow from beginning to end but i enjoyed this some heart wrenching parts though","501":"every bit as good as the hype i have one minor quibble but i can't explain it without spoiling the plot don't read anything else about this book just read the book i read an interview oprah did with the author and although it didn't have a spoiler alert it needed one","502":"i loved this book but wth was with the ending i felt as if i had read many different stories that i would have loved to delve in deeper with them felt as if i were left dangling with this lovely book","503":"okay but mostly character study and not much plot","504":"i couldn't get through this read i will put it in the shelf to read later to see if it gets better","505":"whereby it is great writing sometimes toggling back and forth in time and character isn't favorable","506":"incredible tale of an incredible family","507":"2 5 starsright off the bat i was enchanted by ayana mathis' storytelling while reading the twelve tribes of hattie my heart ached for her as she tried every remedy to help her twin babies pneumonia however once i grew attached to hattie's character i had to put her on the shelf and start all over again in the next chapter where we met floyd again i got to finally attach myself to his character and then just as quickly as it started put him on the shelf too as we get to the next chapter about six it just doesn't flow for me this book is more like a compilation of short stories to make a book i waited on rating and reviewing this book to see if my feelings changed on it but just grew so frustrated with it she didn't know how to tend to her childrens souls but she fought to keep them alive and to keep herself alive","508":"the twelve tribes of hattie are the eleven children plus one grandchildren raised by hattie shepherd and not as i first imagined hattie's tribal ancestors this is written simply and beautifully and i enjoyed getting to know these characters and their stories each chapter is dedicated to one of hattie's children and the writing style varies but we get to collect pieces of hattie's character as well and construct the puzzle as we go along","509":"such mixed feelings about this book ayana mathis is an excellent writer quite poetic i love authors that can paint the picture in the story with few words you can picture the scene without them spelling it out and she does this well the novel however isn't very cohesive since i am bearing in mind this is her first book i can't wait to read her next novel","510":"inter generational african american dysfunctional family","511":"such an amazing book rich characters with dynamic lives just an astounding book i am a fan i hope ms mathis comes out with something else highly recommend this makes me rethink all the other 5 stars that i've given","512":"great book sometimes i hate when each chapter is written by or about a different character but this book flowed and tied everything in really well","513":"fairly good read dumb ending","514":"4 5 stars rounded up because the writing is so stellar i glanced at some of the poor reviews here trying to make sense of the 3 43 average rating the biggest complaint seems to be with the structure yes the structure is different than most novels it's akin to gloria naylor's the women of brewster place but i loved the aforementioned novel and believe a novel can indeed be made up of interrelated stories mathis's writing is beautiful and this novel is heartbreakingly beautiful","515":"good book well written but not an uplifting story although it does make you feel better about your own life","516":"how do we perceive our parent is what we see really how they are these are the questions that are asked in this book well written and it flows very well","517":"it was good there was a lot of obvious pain and deeply rooted if not obvious love by hattie very sad story of survival","518":"each chapter is devoted to one or two of hattie's children and after they get that one chapter they're mostly abandoned for the remainder of the novel each character has to be introduced and developed within the space of one long chapter never to be heard from again mostly once their time in the spotlight has passed i would have liked to hear about the characters more than once adding to the discontinuity are the long time gaps between chapters you get philadelphia and jubilee in 1925 followed by floyd in 1948 then six in 1950 and so on instead of a novel it begins to feel like a series of short stories that start in the middle with no beginning or end","519":" ok so i really wish you could give half stars because this would be a 3 1 2 for me although i loved the idea behind this story and it was interesting i just felt it was totally disjointed i have read books like this before that other people love but i think my brain just has a really hard time keeping everyone straight figuring out where we are in time frames and who is related to whom and how although i recognize that everyone was essentially a child of hattie there were other people often thrown in the mix that you sometimes went pages and pages before they actually identified who they were again i appreciated the creativity and some of the stories about each child were very captivating imaginative and deep but it felt more like an anthology of short stories that were very loosely connected which to be truthful may have been exactly what the author wanted but i am not a short story fan and so i probably would not have chosen this book if i had known that this was how most of it would read last as i say about a lot of books i read lately i didn't care a lot about most of the characters it wasn't because they weren't worthy but it was because the stories jumped around and ended so quickly that i never got the chance to care about them the only constant characters in each chapter were really august and hattie and well neither one of them was very likeable august was a disappointed cheating loser and hattie was a disappointed broken woman who although no one deserves to be cheated on really wasn't a lovable person just my two cents as usual","520":"a story of each of hattie's children slowly makes a story of hattie herself this makes it like a series of interconnected stories","521":"enjoyed this read a lot you must be able to enjoy a book with characters that weave together nicely yet have no closure","522":" read this for book club another one of those novels that seemed to be just a series of stories about family members these were just selected snippet of the lives of hatties many children none of which she could really demonstrate love and affection for as she was too busy working to keep their heads above water a husband who was out every night spending what little they had and only giving her more children they seemed to have a love hate relationship fight all day and make love all night not able to get enough of each other in either sense all her children were damaged in one way or another the ending seemed to have a glimmer of hope for hattie and her grandchild maybe this child she could really cherish and love beautifully written in many ways but sad and tragic this novel really never took off and flowed i think the segmented and unconnected anecdotes kept this from happening","523":"this is a hard book to read rate and review it's incredibly well written mathis' emotional and environmental descriptions of the characters are really spot on several reviewers have commented on the narrative form namely that it reads more like a collection of vignettes i think this works in the book's favor as it is not what happens so much as how people think of what happens based on the description and review what i wanted u0026amp expected out of this book was something like faulkner's as i lay dying or hurston's their eyes were watching god a book that transforms your perception of a sliver of life a time period or a culture that you only had assumptions about before in some ways mathis succeeds at this in a mixed up jumbled narrative we see people change or not people affected by their choices their environment but after reading it while i know a lot about these individuals i don't really know any more about the myriad of broader issues she touches on in these narratives any one of these civil rights vietnam homosexuality paranoid schizophrenia poverty adultery addiction cultural inertia hypocrisy in religion etc would have been worthy of its own book and really that list is why this is such a hard book the topics are simultaneously serious and depressing with depth in emotion but not depth in exploration it opens with a chapter about two babies dying and because of the book blurb you begin with no hope and it doesn't get any happier from there only the last chapter really the last few paragraphs give any kind of hope at all excellent writing was required so that readers didn't put the book down and just never get around to opening it again ultimately the book reinforced the idea that wherever you go there you are that's worthwhile in my opinion even if it wasn't what i anticipated definitely a good selection for book clubs but not for anyone not ready for a heavy read conclusion 3 5 stars","524":"this is actually a did not finish normally i would delete it from my shelves but i really wanted to rate this one in short i should have known better for a long time one of the guiding mantras of my reading was no oprah books and i'm sorry to report that oprah 2 0 seems to suffer from the same tendency to pick horrible books you know the ones inspiring books where one character usually a woman suffers horribly usually by losing a child only to somehow find some kind of miserable redemption in the end i read the first section of this one and just knew it would be one of those books life is too short","525":"if marilynne robinson and toni morrison had a daughter she would grow up to be ayana mathis","526":"powerful story give credit to the author for her first book this is one story that i could have skipped hard to read rough language story of a sad life for hattie and her children would not recommendto my friends","527":" i agree with some of the other reviewers in that this book read more like a book of short stories though i felt that the book was a good read i would have enjoyed it more if i was able to find out more about how the stories ended for each tribe i would have liked to know how bell's life turned out after she recovered or what became of ella i felt somewhat like the book was unfinished also i would have loved to have had just one of hattie's kids to turn out emotionally stable strong and made a real difference the world all in all i did feel it was a very good book and i'm glad i read it","528":"not a happy book an unhappy marriage a dysfunctional family children who can't escape the cycle a black family from 1925 to 1980 in philadelphia and yet i got into this book it made me think about life and death happiness and unhappiness having and not having the author makes the characters and the situations real","529":"i tried to get into the spirit of familial connections but it didn't pull me in","530":"starts in the 1920s and follows the matriarch hattie and her 11 children plus one grandchild with each chapter devoted to one or two of them feels wrong to say this was an enjoyable read since it covers some pretty troubling topics poverty abuse mental illness etc but i'm not sure how else to characterize it i enjoyed the book well written characters believable and well drawn but it just didn't particularly wow me","531":" a good solid read with some very moving chapters the strength of this book is also its weakness following so many 'tribes' of hattie means we get a concentrated slice of a character's life these are powerful but some are more captivating than others and while i appreciated the mastery of such a large narrative and the 'big picture' portrait of hattie's family and future influence it was also frustrating to leave the details of some of those incredible characters' stories behind and move on to someone new even if steeped in the previous stories in otherwords i would have preferred to stick with a few of her stronger characters and read all about their lives i guess that makes me a kind of narrative traditionalist of course if mathis had done this we wouldn't get to see the '12 tribes ' so in any case i would recommend it is a powerful book and mathis handles it masterfully but i do feel slightly cheated out of hearing more about my favourite characters who seemed to have more to say","532":" read this book as part of a book club selection was excited to read due to the great reviews garnered but while the premise was great - stories about a black woman and her children in the early 20th century - and the writing was excellent i had issues with the format of the book yes all the stories were well crafted but they were not woven together each was a stand alone some better than others but they left me wondering about the family and the child the stories just ended despite this review i would read another book by this author","533":"i hope it gets better tough to listen to their struggles","534":" 3 1 2 stars this is a character study in the style of olive kitteridge with different chapters told from the perspective of different interrelated characters as in a visit from the goon squad and we sinners among others much of the hype about the book stems from oprah's choosing it as part of her book club here readers will find a family history set against the backdrop of the great migration full of sick babies cheating husbands religion sick babies alcohol gambling homosexuality sick babies mental illness child abuse and sick babies not an uplifting tale it's one that highlights but unfortunately fails to shed much light on the contradictions that make people so human hattie herself emerges by the end as rather simple in her essential flaws what good were all the sacrifices she made for her children when they came out of it feeling so unloved by her that it consumes them the writing rather than the story is the strength here","535":"3 1 2 it's hard to live up to hype this story is told by multiple narrators connected to hattie by blood her children her sister her grandchild what i didn't get was a cohesive view of hattie just glimpses of her hopes and dreams her disappointments her strength her love the story begins with an experience that changes her affects her deeply and focuses her will for her children to survive surviving isn't the same as thriving what a price some of them pay to survive","536":"beautifully written some of the descriptions of the feelings and motivations of the characters leave you thinking 'yes i know exactly what that's like ' sometimes books surprise you and stop you in your tracks this is one such book","537":"this is the first book by this author and she is a good writer the story is about a black woman who moves to philadelphia with her parents for a better life but she marries the wrong man has 12 childrden and never seems to really love them of learn to care for them the book traces several of the children in the later years","538":"interesting a quick read however i wish there had been more of a plot instead of short stories about each of hattie's children","539":"really loved this book you dget to experience just a bit of each character leaves you wanting more","540":"i liked it but didn't love it mathis is a really good first time author","541":" in the twelve tribes the city is philadelphia and the family hattie her eleven children and her philandering husband struggle through fifty years of living none of them very happy hattie's and her children's stories reminds me of the human condition of wanting to be loved and noticed on our own terms this book tells the stories of the impact of when that yearning goes unfulfilled it also reminds us that love comes in many forms and the deepest love that a mother can offer can be missed when it isn't the form that a child can recognize i felt sympathy for hattie who is so overwhelmed by life this is a very quick and easy read it goes into all the characters separately at different times in their lives i became fully absorbed with each new chapter's introduction of another of hattie' s children hattie holds these short stories together so that they work as a novel as the fullest of the characters hattie bounces from one hard knock to another beginning with the powerful description of the death of her infant twins it's a wonderfully sensitive portrayal of the frailty of humans and the difficulty of being a family","542":"oprah was on crack when she picked this one","543":"this book was an overview of a family and various kids of hattie this book could have had so much more depth i feel that much of the story was left untold","544":"i am not sure what to say about this novel it is exquisite painful funny and a bit puzzling a lot like life i think the writing is clean and detailed with the author showing you what she wants you to see the characters seemed to me like someone that i could know or meet during the course of my life the plot reveals a common yet extraordinary set of experiences i will definitely look for ayana mathis's second novel","545":"i didn't find any of the characters in the book that i could actually like i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone nobody was relatable to me noone in this book had any redeeming qualities sad in a very lonely way","546":"mathis showcases the darkest moments of her characters lives to shine a spotlight on the strength of the human spirit there is little triumph for hattie but her grace and perseverance give this novel in stories its beating heart all of them were little lights sparks flying upward in dark places trying to stay alight though they were compelled toward ash","547":"heartwarming yet bittersweet i really enjoyed this novel from beginning to ending the only downfall is that the novel pretty much consists of short stories about each of hattie's children and the effect their upbringing had on them the whole story in general warmed my heart because she had always loved her children but she just didn't know how to show it or have the time in her eyes every chapter we get bits and pieces of who hattie really was even though i felt a little cheated after each chapter only because her children's lives were fascinating and i wanted to know more i was overall impressed with mathis' writing and the substance of the novel highly recommend","548":"a most beautifully written book i enjoyed it immensely reminded me of the sacrifices women give their children wether married or unmarried","549":"a mediocre read interesting but not super memorable or compelling","550":" this book gets to you after a few chapters life is a journey tough unseen challenges n road blocks but one has to move on what one can't move on from or move away from is the love of own's children hattie is just like one of us sometimes the instinct to survive becomes so much important that all else is lost protecting her family and keeping them alive takes precedence over everything else including expression of love but isn't it love that she has expressed differently not many understand heart breaking","551":" after suffering a devastating loss hattie tends to her other children and tolerates a drunken husband it is essentially a series of depressing stories the most interesting aspect of the book is debating hattie's character as a mother on the one hand she makes up for the father's shortcomings and unselfishly puts her children first but while i acknowledge her sacrifices including her own happiness i think she ultimately failed as a mother she lacks maternal tenderness and none of her children grew to happy adults maybe she had nothing else to give maybe she could not provide tenderness after losing her twins in the end it is all depressing","552":"i just finished this book i was very disappointed in it it took me long to read too many characters and the author never finished the story about each character the author is a good writer but i didn't like the way the story was written first oprah recommendation that i didn't enjoy","553":"this was too disjointed to be really enjoyable the characters are fine the story just doesn't hang together","554":"i was drawn to this book because of the oprah book club which is always my \"go to\" for list of good books that i ought to read i was right a twelve tribes of hattie of course im angry she looked at bell as though she'd have liked to shake her by the shoulders i probably always will be but i've been mad all my life and i finally figured out that i couldn't keep carrying that with me its too heavy and im too tired time will take care of it like it does everything else hattie shepherd i was drawn to this book because of the oprah book club which is always my \"go to\" for list of good books that i ought to read i was right away intrigued with the title the synopsis to prove the several reviews i have read and of course my excitement to find out how it is related to the twelve tribes of israel but then obviously i was wrong because the book is about spoiler alert and credits below a series of interlocking stories about each of the 12 people dependent upon hattie for love and survival across the 20th century from philadelphia and jubilee in 1925 to cassie and her daughter sala in 1980 their experiences also seem representative and at times too representative there is floyd conflicted about his homosexual desires six who represents the longing to find salvation in religion billups who was molested as a child franklin the alcoholic and gambler who ends up a soldier in vietnam alice marries well but unhappily and leads a sterile tranquilised life bell is self destructive cassie has schizophrenia one begins to feel as if there isn't a trauma that this family doesn't face as mathis whisks us from one crisis to the next just as a character starts to emerge we are on to the next a steady stream of shiftless men squandering money in bars and gambling dens while women struggle to hold families together http www theguardian com books 2013 if the characters drift the novel does not it eddies around the rock of hattie the woman who grounds her family's story and who will not be ground down by it as unremittingly bleak as her characters' lives are mathis has not produced a grim novel it is as much about our need for joy as it is about our struggles against bitterness written with elegance and remarkable poise the twelve tribes of hattie is rather like its heroine a bit withholding at times but memorable and with the hint of something formidable glinting under the surface but why the 3 stars rate well i value very much the spiritual inspiration i could always absorb from every book that i read i wanna be empowered and at the same time be affirmed of my faith to the one true god not that i could ever be swayed from my belief during the journey of the read i did picked bits and pieces of the optimism that i am wishing for learning from the triumphs and failures of hattie and the lives of her children whose existence are the very result of hattie herself from the twins to the granddaughter from the loss to the redemption the writer really did a good job in relaying her story despite the hasty way each of the children's story ended however towards the end when her life is indirectly compared with the sufferings of job a well know character in the bible and the way mathis somewhat broke that parallelism by changing the course of hattie well sala's life in particular that was the turning point of my disappointment the defiance and pride of hattie that i sensed at the end of the story crumbled down the wonder i have felt for her character and the book in general i really hoped that it didn't end the way it did and for hattie to have found the peace she had long been searching for because i honestly didn't think she had given the way she reacted in the end im sure mathis had her reasons and probably she didn't want hattie's story to be predictable and ordinary but the thought of imparting the attitude of detachment from god and our faith in him scares me not for myself but for other readers that may be in some remote way experiencing similar tragedy as that of hattie and her children don't get me wrong the book was amazing i just didn't agree with the ending","555":"loved how the story was told using all her children and covering the time span awesome read","556":"i enjoyed the characters and thought this was very well written i was hoping for more closure and follow up on earlier characters at the close she really captures you immediately it's a story of determination and much loss the last chapters are heartbreaking unfortunately i missed my bookclub conversation on this book it would have been a great discussion","557":"hattie raised 12 children two died as babies and one was a grandchild the books goes through each child's life starting with the two young babies who died of pneumonia which could have been cured by medication that she couldn't afford at the time each child details the difficulty in their life and how it ties to hattie good and bad but mostly bad the children describe their mother hattie as stern and not loving but they come to realize that she didn't have time to love them or maybe she just showed it in a different way hattie had a rough life herself and at one point cheated on her husband because she was fed up with his womanizing and going out with other ladies she came back to her husband after realizing that she would still be living the same situation if she went with her boyfriend i am not sure that i really learned anything per say from reading this book i did enjoy reading the different paths that each child took with their life and wondered what a book like that would look like for me what would my children say on how i have impacted their life","558":"beautiful and sad","559":"the novel follows hattie from georgia to new jersey over 50 years after the first two chapters she is seen through the eyes of her children or grandchildren while this is a good book i think that mathis could have followed through with the characters more i have too many questions about the stories of the children that are never answered as the book progresses","560":"this book got some pretty stellar reviews both in the press and from a few of my friends i liked the idea of getting the perspective of each of hattie's children along with her own version of her life and theirs so i picked it up seriously these are some messed up people we start with hattie's story which is complicated but understandable she married young swooped off her feet at age 15 by a smooth handsome sweet talkin' man she abandoned her wealthy southern roots and moved north to find hardship after hardship ultimately losing her twin babies to pneumonia she has a slew of other children each one more miserable than the last telling you their tale of woe in their own words there is no character development to these stories hattie is strict and distant but we never really know why we are told on the cover of the book to blame her distance on losing her twins but really each child's story is so miserable and screwed up you wonder why we are being subjected to this i am still wondering if i was supposed to feel sorry for this messed up bunch the writer gave me very little to go on if i am supposed to learn something from their misery she gave me even less this was just one sad sack tale after another","561":"this book was so very good you really feel for each character and of course hattie they are all so human i loved this book and oprah winfrey has never disappointed me with her book club picks definitely worth reading","562":"do not understand all the fantastic ratings this book received from big time reviewers i thought this book was extremely dark and depressing","563":"i finished the book but it was so very depressing each chapter told a story about one of hattie's children and i kept wishing that just one of them would have a happy ending hattie was angry and resentful the whole book","564":"just because oprah likes it doesn't mean i do too much of a downer sorry running for the comfort of john grisham","565":"hattie's story is told through her 12 children's stories each one like a short story heart breaking beautiful prose","566":"oprah has great taste in books i absolutely loved this one following a family from the great migration on into the 1980s it's totally enrapturing and beautifully written","567":"the stories of each member of hattie's family as well as hattie herself were intertwined well with a such a compelling and interesting story of heart ache and complex family relationships","568":"ayana mathis has written a stunning debut novel i was completely engrossed in all the characters and the rich writing style ms mathis draws you into the story with every page she writes the ebb and flow of the lives and miseries of each character is portrayed in a bold brute raw prose time well spent i am excited to read much more from ayana mathis","569":"the book was about her 12 children and one grandchild it was ok not that great each chapter was devoted to one of hattie's children each child had there own story concerning their life and hattie treatment it depicted how their struggles were as a child and the treatment of their mother overall ok book 3 5 stars","570":"feh it's without a doubt beautifully written in true iowa writer workshop style but the plot is thin and the characters tiresome after a while","571":"the beginning was so good however towards the end it got very boring","572":"i enjoyed this book but did not feel the plot came full circle i was ready to read another 200 pages or so and was disappointed when the book ended the author didn't fully develop her characters and once we were introduced to them we never heard from them again it did not have a satisfying conclusion","573":"i really liked the style of the book with each chapter primarily from the point of view of a different child","574":" i downloaded the audiobook on a whim it had been getting a lot of press and i figured i'd give it a shot it's always easier for me to squeeze adult novels non fiction in by listening to the audio versions instead of reading the print when i started listening i thought to myself i'm really going to like this one i was wrong the opening section is really strong i loved it and couldn't wait to hear where the story would go from there however as it went on my interest waned dramatically to the point where i wished the reader would go faster so that i could get to the end sooner it's not a terrible book by any means but it just didn't work as well for me as i had hoped i found most of the stories individually interesting but taken as a whole novel it really lacked cohesiveness for me bits and pieces were interesting but the overall story was flawed","575":"superb debut really mature writing and emotionally at times hard for me to bear stories of af ams migration north are so critical to the american experience rarely told recognize hattie sheppard in some of the women i knew when i was younger","576":"i think the crowning achievement of mathis' book is the manner in which she creates sympathetic characters that do despicable things in another set of hands hattie would be a bad mother for whom no sympathy was possible if there's one thing an audience generally can't stomach it's a bad parent but hattie's pain and struggle to be a mother to define for herself and her children what being a mother might mean and require is so palpable and understandable that you can't help but to sympathize with her is her way the right way to raise children in the sense that so many of her children do survive to adulthood you can certainly say that she accomplished her goals and responsibilities however that her children grow into being so stunted emotionally so flawed unhappy and broken seems to suggest that she failed on some level the story is a fairly simple one after losing her first two children to pneumonia hattie turns pretty cold and has nine more the story of their lives and their struggles is told over the course of ten chapters each focused on or from the perspective of one or two of the children the book really reads more like a collection of short stories with overlapping characters and blending themes the limited amount of time spent with each of the children each is really only given the one chapter to shine and then almost fully left out of the rest of the narrative is also to the detriment of the book as a whole but the rest of it is really quite strong mathis' writing never ceases to be beautiful and evocative with the possible exception of franklin's chapter which i didn't enjoy at all really and her understanding of character motivation is really quite impressive the core story itself is really the selling point of the novel watching this family and hattie specifically try to make do with their rather poor lot in life is really fascinating and says a lot about the manner in which the american dream might be a failed or impossible promise for families of color during the book's time frame from 1925 to 1980 it would be easy to nitpick at this book the narrative voice from chapter to chapter isn't different enough to justify each separate character focus mathis' diction syntax and tone don't really change too much throughout so you're left feeling like it's the same narrator even the chapters told in first person suffer from this perhaps the sprawling time frame of the narrative doesn't add as much to the story as mathis intended and there is an abundance of misery throughout the tale so much so that at certain points i found myself almost begging for a simply happy and contented character but in the end the major point to be made was that i couldn't put the book down with the exception of one chapter i never ceased to be interested and entertained by what i was reading in her freshman effort mathis has accomplished quite a feat","577":"although mathis is a wonderful writer the structure of this book doesn't help to develop characterization each chapter is a short story centered around one of hattie's eleven children the first and last chapters are the most powerful also there is often a huge gap in years from one chapter to the next a chronological narrative would have worked better even so this novel shows how one's emotional wounds and history don't scab over and heal","578":"really liked how the book was laid out i wanted to know more about each child's life made me think about how i come across as a parent great writing for a first novel","579":" this book has an unusual structure although each chapter is in chronological order each focuses on one of hattie's children at a different time of their lives it begins in 1925 with the birth of hatties' first children twins philadelphia and jubilee and ends in 1980 it is more like aeries of interconnected short stories which add up to the story of a whole family hattie and her mother and sisters escape from georgia after her father has been killed hoping for a new life in the more tolerant north as the family's timeline unfurls we can judge how successfully or not that has been achieved and at what cost","580":"the first chapter is utterly heartbreaking anyone who's a parent is going to struggle","581":"3 5 stars i loved the prose in this novel i loved the depth of the characters i struggled after the first few chapters to keep up with all hattie's children chapters jumped from child to child over huge gaps in years #popsugar oprah book club","582":"i like novels that are linked short stories olive kitteredge let the great world spin especially if the writing is wonderful and the characters intriguing kind of like a puzzle with pieces missing and you have to fill in the gaps but couldn't the author have made at least one of hattie's children end up with a happy life or even hattie it made for a really depressing read despite the spell binding prose even olive kitteredge ended hopefully","583":"this was amazing i will read anything she writes it was so real","584":" this book fascinated me the character the book is built around hattie is part of the great migration while she escapes the obvious oppression of the open racism of georgia she cannot escape the oppression of poverty in philadelphia it is a tough book to read but so utterly honest it gave me insights that will stay with me the saddest aspect is that dealing with constant poverty all of hattie's energy and being went towards the most basic needs of survival of her children she had nothing left over to put towards softer nurturing tenderness reading about the poverty of spirit her children suffered brought about by that upbringing despite hattie's best efforts is heart breaking the structure seemed to bother a number of people the only thing that bothered me was that i wanted more more about every character but maybe that is where much of the power of the book comes from","585":" although it was a quick read it felt like a chore the first chapter was compelling very emotional i think mathis definitely has some talent there were very affecting scenes scattered throughout the book but i was underwhelmed overall the premise and format are strong ideas i want to say that i would have enjoyed it more if at least some of the characters had been given more depth yet if i'm being emotionally honest i don't want to spend more time in her world are all of their lives really so desperate and sad are we supposed to believe they are redeemable but without the strength to pursue redemption if so i can see why she didn't expect readers to have the fortitude to work through more of her very heavy pages if not why doesn't mathis let us spend a little more time in the light in the end it felt forced 2 5 for snippets of great writing","586":"i listened to this book and was drawn into each character's life the beginning brought tears and i had a feeling that they wouldn't be my last they weren't","587":"knowing nothing about this book i enjoyed the short story like quality each story was well written and developed the characters but the overall storyline was essentially missing","588":"may book club selection powerful but one dimensional","589":"this book offer such painful insight into the human psyche that i think it's hard to describe it in a positive light it's dark which is precisely why i love it if you're prone to happy endings and feel good adventures this isn't for you but if you want to raise every hidden emotion to your surface and experience powerful and meaningful writing don't miss out on this one","590":"this novel is a series of vignettes interwoven and the characters descend from hattie for young readers it will be eye opening as to the treatment of blacks within and outside of the black society i found the story compelling although depressing","591":"i can't think of what to say but i know i will remember hattie for some time","592":"i had been reading a bunch of unexciting books the characters in this one really grabbed me and i loved each chapter and each person's story yes it's an oprah book but i read it because she's a graduate of the iowa writers' workshop","593":"this book is okay a beach read for a winter day however a nice weaving of family generational issues loss and success","594":"2 5 reallyi was not big on the short story feel of this book i did enjoy the story lines though wish it was a little more cohesive i felt left with a lot of unanswered questions and wanting to know more about what happened with various characters","595":"great book but it took me quite some time to get through it not sure why that is hattie is a deeply disturbed woman her issues are passed down to her offspring in a way that i see all the time very realistic book and i am glad that it ended the way it did","596":"starting with the parents and moving to each child these people live such sad lives this was a much sadder story than i had anticipated","597":"normally i don't like short stories but these clear eyed unshrinking portraits that never indulge in melodrama or bogus sentimentality or self pity or moralizing in which the hard characters remain true to themselves while still rounding off a few corners was marvelous i admit the oprah endorsement had me leery what a debut","598":"i had mixed feelings while reading this book it is really 12 short stories with a bit of overlap between the characters it was well written and compelling at times but i didn't have the opportunity to really get to know any of the characters or get very invested in their stories","599":"a very good book one of the best in the genre","600":"i must admit i was a little disappointed in how the book came to a resolve hattie shepherd was a hurt woman and her hurt passed down to her children and grandchild i think the author really wanted us to see the hurt through the main characters tribe but i would have liked to see it more through her eyes i don't really know if i cared for the book as much as i wanted to before i read it","601":"some excellent writing in a boring book","602":"the individual stories of hattie's children and 1 grandchild were well written mathis has given us a good glimpse into their lives but i ultimately wanted more view spoiler especially wanted to know more about ruthie and ella since we only met them briefly as infants hide spoiler this book was good but i think it could have been great with the addition of 50 to 100 more pages she gave us a sip of really delicious writing but then left me unsatisfied with the lack of details","603":"this was a great story the author's characters are unforgettable and in many cases heartbreaking i cannot wait for the author's next book she is a phenomenal writer","604":"mostly well written but depressing to have so many flawed characters i did love hattie most of the time i like the final chapter the best","605":"maybe i just was not in the right mood for this but all this book did for me was depress me the format of the narrative did not appeal to me with one chapter about each of hattie's dysfunctional children i've found i have a hard time getting interesting in a book that jumps around so much between characters and time period just not my kind of book","606":"wow i read this book for my book club i am glad we chose 2 books this month because i don't even know how we're going to talk about this book it was terrible if it wasn't read for book club i wouldn't have continued with it this was a depressing novel about a woman and her family during the great migration each chapter introduces a new child or grandchild of hattie's there is not much in the ways of character development and i have no idea what the point of this novel was in the end it doesn't have a good story line it was extremely disappointing and i just struggled through the entire length of the novel which is probably why it took me this long to get through it when i normally can get through a book quick quickly i found twelve tribes to be very dull and upset with the amount of death that this novel deals with i'm moving on finally","607":"3 5 to 4","608":"i loved the way it was written it was hard to relate to hattie wonder hiw diff her children's lives would hve been if hattie knew how to love herself and her family i didn't like the ending though","609":"in the first chapter we meet hattie and her two babies twins in fact philadelphia and jubilee hattie is young and newly married and her babies are sick she's determined to keep them alive but is ultimately helpless against the powers that be having no penicillin also didn't help including the twins hattie has eleven children and each chapter is devoted to one or two through them we learn of the person hattie has become a person without tenderness mean and angry in their eyes i've said it before i don't like short stories and while hattie is the common bond in each chapter i just don't like investing time into a character only to never hear from them again the version i read had notes from oprah with her favourite passages and a little blurb about what she liked i really enjoy when books include guides for reading groups it makes me think a bit deeper because i really wouldn't otherwise having oprah's explanations made me appreciate ayana mathis' writing a lot more once i saw that little circle indicating an oprah note i immediately paid more attention and re read the surrounding text all books should come with guides or is that just my laziness coming through again","610":"i thought this book was beautifully written i also found it to be depressing it is not a book that i would want to read again i also in some ways thought that it played a lot to stereotypes there was so very little almost nonexistent joy i felt very heavy after reading it i love books that make me think and take me on a journey this book just delivered me with very little journey to a place of darkness","611":"like most reviewers i had a hard time rating the writing is simple but beautiful and it reads like a collection of short stories i'm not likely to run around recommending it but its a good read hattie story is that of my great grandmother and this book gave more insight into who she is and a greater appreciation for her strength","612":" the twelve tribes of hattie is a quick and read and an engaging book it explores the lives of hattie's children each with their own problems that stem in part from hattie's mothering and in part from being an african american at varied times in the past 65 years the children have a variety of issues mental illness distinguishing two of the children one son floyd is a musician and a homosexual he is written about in a sensitive way it reminded me of reading giovanni's room by james baldwin so many years ago in baldwin's book as well as in the twelve tribes of hattie the author explains and writes about being a homosexual in ways i could understand she writes especially well about the conflict and passion floyd felt the most interesting child is six who at 15 is taken back to the deep south and while attending a tent revival is moved by the holy spirit and becomes an evangelical preacher each child has a story to tell and the stories though sad are written with compassion and insight","613":"i was a little disappointed in this book i had high hopes i found this book a little depressing i think i expected to like the characters a lot more and found the whole thing a little pointless it is really well written though and probably quite based in reality of the time","614":"oprah pick this book for her bookclub it was ok it's about change it's never too late","615":" the twelve tribes of hattie is overall a worthwhile read that chronicles the lives and relationships of a working class african american family in philadelphia over the course of roughly 55 years the family is headed by its stubborn tough loving no nonsense wife mother and grandmother hattie the novel is very intereresting in regards to the way that the story is told although hattie and her relationship with her husband and children remains the overall focus of the story each chapter also tells a separate story about each of hattie's children this way of telling the story is sure to refresh the reader's interest with each new chapter but the cast of characters can sometimes become a little overwhelming however the author does a good job of keeping the focus of the chapter very clear and the layout of the book is organized hattie's older children appear in earlier chapters and the younger children appear in later chapters overall the plot of the story is interesting and well constructed and the characters are well developed the ending however falls somewhat short of expectations the ending conveys a powerful message but never definitively concludes hattie's story","616":"hard to read such struggle for every character but i thought it was well written and worthwhile to read though not the sort of light book i wanted for a beach vacation","617":"powerful emotionally evocative and impressive","618":" this is a quick read it is a series of vignettes covering the lives of hattie's twelve children and a grandchild through various decades in time you learn about hattie and her life mostly pieced together through these stories each one is compelling and written in such a genuine voice of the character it is quite a remarkable book i am so impressed that this is the author's first novel she is sure to have many more and i will read them i really enjoyed this book but i did not care for hattie after the first chapter i understand what she's gone through and perhaps the reason why she is the way she is but i also know that there are people who have lived through similar circumstances who did not live the way she did and certainly not treat the rest of her children so poorly true i can't really say how i would react in the same circumstance but i still did not connect with her i did however feel connected to her children including the boys men and her grandchild even cassie in a way lastly and this is more regarding the notes that were inserted in my oprah 2 0 kindle version of the book i should never have read the notes while reading the book or at all there were so many more impactful and thought provoking passages than the ones chosen that i really questioned the selections did she really pick this one out of everything else in this chapter worse still were the comments really these are the 'a ha' moments and takeaway lessons from that passage i've always been an oprah fan but {insert quizzical look here}","619":"good read but very sad for my taste","620":"this oprah's book club selection was well written interesting and gripping i loved how it explored the issues of sex class race gender and sexuality within several generations of an african american family","621":"the first chapter nearly did me in i want to return this to the library with a nasty note attached granted i didn't go any further than the first chapter but i can fairly confidently say that unless your goal is to feel absolutely miserable and stain your pillow with tears stay away from this book","622":"heart wrenching poignant touching i cried at some parts tory told from hattie's point of view then from her children's through the decades very different lives all touched by one woman","623":"depressing view of what happens to the many children of a woman who is depressed and tortured by her life situation very well written very sad i think it tries to be redeeming in the end but it's not quite enough to fix it","624":"i loved this book it's more like twelve short stories about hattie's children but through each perspective you get glimpses of her whole life perfect book to read on the 50th anniversary of the march on washington","625":"okay book but for the most part completely depressing","626":"it was a good read but not as well written as i had expected worthwhile reading","627":"this was such a well written heartbreaking book of tragedy and adversity even though all of the characters are flawed to the point of being ruined you care just enough to finish the chapter and find out what happens the book is written in 10 chapters and revolves around hattie and her 11 children and one of the grandchildren each chapter focuses on one person's story so the book feels more like loosely collected short stories that span 55 years in the life of this family i especially liked how the author carefully wrote such monochromatic scenes everything is described as gray black neutral then suddenly a woman walks into the tent wearing a bright yellow dress or her brother shows up wearing a deep blue coat or the boyfriend is seen walking down the street with a flaming red flower in his lapel it's powerful in the same sense as the girl in the red coat in schindler's list","628":"the characters weren't tied together well enough to make this feel cohesive it was more like a collection of short stories all of which drew pictures of sad disappointing lives","629":"fascinating story well written some reviews think its too depressing but happy endings rarely exist","630":"this book reads more like a collection of short stories than a novel which suits me just fine it is glimpses into the lives of hattie's 12 children with themes of race prejudice poverty sorrow strength and reconciliation","631":"i liked this book okay it was sometimes a little difficult to go from chapter to chapter because each chapter was about a different child etc","632":"loved this book my only criticism is that there was nothing uniquely philadelphian about the story","633":"mathis taught me more about character development than any novelist in my recent memory story after sad sad story all served to shed light on hattie wonderful character development as well as a tribute to a strong african american woman as told through her children's experiences","634":"to be fair i didn't finish the book i got about 1 3 of the way through didn't like the depressing tone and then went and read reviews on goodreads and decided i didn't need to finish it that from the reviews it would just be more the same and i was done whew","635":"i liked the writing the author found ways to be eloquent and powerful while still managing simplicity of language i was left wanting more though i feel like i have only a cursory idea of who these characters are and was left with an incomplete picture of this family so i'm hoping there will be a subsequent book or books that will fill in some of those blanks overall i enjoyed reading it but the tie ins i was looking forward to never came","636":"the opening story is brilliant but the rest of the book didn't hold up for me too much dysfunction too much selfishness and meanness hard to invest 299 pages of reading to get to one scene of tenderness still i admire the innovation and some of the psychological and social truths","637":"brillant ayana's writing is so incredible it's impossible for me to believe this is the a first novel","638":"pretty good although i didn't get as much out of it as i thought i would i'm usually on board with oprah but not so much this time","639":"the twelve tribes of hattie has received a lot of buzz of late oprah named it as one of her book club reads and since then the web has been full of chatter about it so after oprah has spoken about this book what can i tell you it's difficult to describe this book it is a novel and it works like a novel - it has chapters it moves forward in time there's a main character hattie and supporting characters her family ...but it doesn't quite flow as you'd expect it to it's more glimpses of a family over a period of time starting from hattie as a young mother and ending as a grandmother it follows one of hattie's children for a chapter and then picks another you might or might not hear about that character again and if you do it could just be via a comment from another character for some you never know their fate - live or die happy or sad despite this mathis is a gifted writer and makes the stories come alive in your imagination you can visualise the children looking for love from hattie that's futile and how it's affected their decisions floyd looks for love from anyone while six tries to find the lord some lock themselves away in a loveless marriage or in illness it's all very haunting and not very happy this is a book you'd cry over but rarely smile during the read all the family suffer in at least one way - from hattie and august's move during the great migration to when the story ends in the 1970s this is more of a character portrait of hattie looking at her through her husband's lover's and children's eyes who is seeing the real hattie is it only her granddaughter sala is it none of the above i would have loved to read more about the great migration but like a lot of things in this book it's only hinted or glimpsed at as the characters focus on themselves and their family mathis' portrayal of her characters is really strong - to the point where i think i could recognise them - but sometimes i just wanted to be told the story straight out and have the ends tied up neatly some have described it as being like interlinked short stories but i needed to read it continually so i could try to pick out clues for what each child was doing as time went on this is ayana mathis' debut novel and i'd definitely be interested in reading more it's an ambitious first book i hesitate to say novel it just didn't follow that course for me that sometimes hits the target perfectly but occasionally left me wondering where the target was thank you to the publisher and the reading room for providing the digital arc http samstillreading wordpress com","640":" there was alot of hype about this book being that it was on oprah's bookclub an all so i took a stab at it and read it to start this is a somber book a book where there are no happy endings just dark and dire and hopeless in some parts you feel sad and sympathetic for the characters in this book and hope and wish that at some point life for any of them gets better but it doesn't it starts off with hattie losing 2 babies twins to a sickness that could've been cured had she been able to take them to the doctor and gotten a common drug that helps cure infection pneumonia the twins died of pneumonia and you just feel sick to the stomach that she's losing them you can feel her soul slip away with each last breath that the twins take and it makes you feel sad after the heartbreak of the twins her tribe starts to form 11 kids 1 grandchild 12 tribes of hattie however each and every one of her children has a serious dysfunction in their character they have lived life on the edge of barely having anything food was hard to come by clothes hard to come by sleep sanity love and vigor of life was just thin wisps of things dangling in front of them they all lived hard lives everyone of those kids were broken inside from a lack of love and happiness hattie was forever mad angry unresolved forever gritty and tough as nails she never gave any love to her children and they suffered greatly hattie believed that if she kept her kids alive that was enough but we as human beings cannot live on pure survival all of our lives we need tenderness love softness happiness and joy this family received none of that the only love and life hattie had and enjoyed she gave to another man she then snatched that away too when she felt as if living her life loving and being happy was too frivolous she didn't even feel comfortable being happy she was paranoid and guarded and didn't know how to love anyone back not even her flesh and blood her husband august was the complete opposite he loved and lived his life like he saw fit however under the brutality of hattie he did what he wanted and suffered the consequences later august loved the kids and showed his love as much as he could under the thumb of hattie it was hard to love but he enjoyed making a life and having all those children in my opinion he sought his enjoyment out of the house because he wasn't able to give what he wanted in his house the children wow they were something else they all had broken pieces inside of them and not receiving the love from hattie their mother broke them down as adults and individuals severely they were unable to cope with problems in life unable to deal with everyday stress unable to give love to others unable to even love themselves in the end each one tried to mend their broken spirits but some were more successful than others i felt truly sorry for this family but it's more common to see than not especially when there were so many kids the black family has roots very deep in surviving the times and many times the love is lost because we as a people don't have time for anything else but to survive life each day for the next in order to eat pay bills and sleep there is no room for love or happiness when the next meal is unsure where to sleep is unknown and if you will be able to make it to the next day is questionable it breaks you down so we all must try to give a little love everyday even though it may take awhile to get to a level of comfort it will pay off in the end i rate this book a 4 as somber as it was it kept me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what was going to happen next i would recommend this book to everyone especially single moms and large families or any size family who is having a tough time this is what you do not want to happen in your household it motivates you to do better in your life and how you project your love to others around you","641":" this is a beautifully told tale written in simple lyrical prose the tribe mentioned in the book's title represents hattie's children the reader learns about each in individual chapters telling about them i think the writer did a great job using this format it's not easy to create a whole character with meaning and substance in such a short amount of space the reader comes away from this book knowing each individual child and how their relationship with their mother hattie helped to form them","642":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here hattie is a seventeen year old mother of twins when the book opens desperately trying to save them but her struggles are in vain jubilee and philadelphia die within hours of each other hattie and august go on to have other children and this is hattie's story and theirs although the novel comprises a number of different stories each one relating to a different character or pair of characters it never seems disjointed each chapter is a snapshot in time from 1925 to 1980 the changes from hattie is a seventeen year old mother of twins when the book opens desperately trying to save them but her struggles are in vain jubilee and philadelphia die within hours of each other hattie and august go on to have other children and this is hattie's story and theirs although the novel comprises a number of different stories each one relating to a different character or pair of characters it never seems disjointed each chapter is a snapshot in time from 1925 to 1980 the changes from one decade to the next are striking although the novel deals with one family it can also be read as a metaphor for american life the novel is well written engrossing and despite its deceptively straightforward style deals with big issues such as racial discrimination and poverty there is an ugly incident involving the humiliation and abuse of two characters by a group of arrogant and nasty young thugs in the same chapter hattie has to give one of her children away to her well to do childless sister this book is a real page turner and i would give it 4 5 stars out of 5 more","643":"i did not really like this book but am glad i finished it i did like the end what a mess of kids what a strange combination of parents but then we do not chose our parents or do we anyways i have read this book and in various different ways it will continue to inform my life","644":"enjoyed this book good writing","645":"completed the book on december 9 interesting how author reflected the main character chapter by chapter interesting read that i relate to personally based on family and other connections during same era culture and migration can't wait for discussions to begin i'm interested to see what others thought of the book as well now learned not to spoil for others still reading good reading waiting to discuss thank you","646":"this book is basically a connected series of chronological short stories about the children of hattie shepard as a rule i don't love short stories they don't give me enough of any one character while some of the stories in this book are very compelling franklin and cassie which are both written in first person in particular i wasn't overly intrigued with any of them and didn't feel as if i knew what happened to any of them in a longer since as i would in a novel i was able to follow the lives of hattie and her husband august throughout the book but i never really felt as if i knew them either","647":"very enjoyable book hattie is a young black woman from the south migrated to the north she has 12 children and this is their story the only caution about this book is that each chapter is told from a different child's perspective i sometimes have difficulty with these types of books because it is jarring to shift views every chapter the book is good enough to make up for it but it's not my favorite style","648":"short stories some more entertaining than others but overall a good easy read","649":"i enjoyed this book the idea of the different narrators for each chapter was interesting and it gave a good picture of hattie by the end","650":"met ayana mathis at the new york state writers institute a few weeks ago she read from this book her first novel and i was hooked","651":"i have mixed feelings about this book it was well written and the chapters on each character were interesting i couldn't put the book down but was left with a feeling that something was still missing maybe because there were not enough happy moments and not much of an ending i guess i wanted a happier ending for this family","652":"while i didn't really love this book while reading it in the days after finishing i find myself thinking about it quite a bit especially the way the story was designed the writing was so so but the construction of the book telling hattie's life through the lives of her children and grandchild was really interesting and well done fairly depressing though it was i still enjoyed the way the story was told recommended","653":"this book is on oprah's book club list and i don't know why the story follows an impoverished african american family in mid 20th century alcoholism adultery physical and emotional abuse i wanted to give up on the book half way through but finished it hoping that at least one of hattie's twelve children would improve their life wishful thinking break the cycle people everyone has trials and struggles regardless of race and circumstance","654":"loved the book and all the characters only thing i didn't like was the ending expected something more or different it would be nice to read a book or story from her that tells more of the life's of the characters i would read them","655":"read it","656":"liked but it's been sometime since i read","657":"loved every minute of this book i do wish that we knew more about each child than one chapter more background on hattie and her childhood would have enriched the tale too i loved reading the oprah notes","658":"to write a collection of short stories so interwoven is a talent and the book is full of beautiful prose and interesting messages","659":"i would actually give this 3 1 2 stars but that wasn't an option i found the first chapter the most powerful shades of toni morrison a great first book by a graduate of the iowa writers' workshop","660":"normally don't like to be an oprah follower so i thought i'd read this as quickly as i could to get my own opinion this was truly a great book","661":"i thought this book was amazingly crafted and flowed from one narrative to the next it's quite tricky narrating a story from the pov of a mother and 9 kids but ms mathis managed to pull it off with mastery i love the way she wove hattie into the story of all her children and the way it gradually progressed from 1923 to 1980 i was able to 'read' the disillusionment hurt detachment and angst from all sides i must confess despite august's philandering i didn't find him to be terrible as such i suppose that's what made him real life often isn't about 'villains' but normal people whose mistakes and habits can erode love hattie was stoic and stalwart and i found her seeming 'indifference' to her kids both infuriating and understandable at any rate i give this book two thumbs up and recommend it to all","662":"i really wanted to love this book it reads more like a compilation of short stories about hattie's children who struggle to love her i enjoyed many of the stories as stand alone stories i also wish there were more of a conclusion so we find out what happens to all of the children who hattie struggles to love","663":"\"i try to find the beauty in things on dark days i sit in my armchair looking at clouds and i am awed at how rain is made \" this is a hard review to write even now hours after i've finished this book i'm still at a loss for words i could praise ayana mathis for creating such a broad variety of characters so different and yet so alike each other or i could criticize the novel for the sharp cut offs between the chapters and its complete lack of correlation perhaps i ought to do both this is a very brutal book and mathis shows her reader many different forms of unhappiness and misery in reality all of the characters are trapped by something the women are cornered by their husbands the men are addicted to gambling and drinking the children suffer from a lack of attention and everyone is haunted by the past the novel begins with a chapter telling us how hattie lost her firstborns two twins a boy and a girl this loss affects everything throughout the book as it changes hattie's ability to express her emotions and ultimately show signs of love to her children it ruins the marriage between hattie and her husband and so all of hattie's eleven children grow up in a house filled with shouting instead of hugs hattie is an extremely complex character ayana succeeds in portraying her harsh ways along with her endless struggle and her soft moments of grief \"maybe we have only a finite amount of love to give we're born with our portion and if we love and are not loved enough in return it's depleted \" my main problem with this novel is that it isn't built up like a novel it consists of a chapter about each of hattie's children starting with the dying twins and ending with a granddaughter the reader gets a little glimpse of a given character in a given situation as the novel jumps in time as well and that's it as i read the book one chapter of a time it felt more like a series of short stories connected by familiar names than an actual novel in some cases the chapters seem very superficial and rushed while other chapters feel unreasonably long i never really connected with the characters except for hattie who is the only consistent echo throughout the chapters it is such a shame because some of the characters were extremely interesting and would have benefited from a deeper investigation instead the novel just keeps in the surface of things","664":"very descriptive scenes and great writing overall didn't give it 5 because i would have liked to see more interaction between the characters it's more like a collection of short stories with characters appearing once rarely again except maybe in a mention here or there i would have liked to read more about how some got to where they were and what happened to them later on","665":"this story reads like a book of short stories which i'm not a big fan of each chapter is about one of hattie's children there were some chapters i wished would have continued on in more depth and others not","666":"i finished this book with mixed emotions i ended up being disappointed because i felt there was so much potential with this book it received three stars from me because of that potential i enjoyed it for the most part but i was just left hanging as a result of the underdevelopment of the characters","667":"this book had some excellent prose but it was too hard to follow and left too much hanging for me just not the style of book i enjoy","668":"grew on me about half way through writing comes across very authentic characters are like able and real but it's darn depressing","669":"http www thebookbag co uk reviews i","670":"a well written account of the children of hattie set in the 1920 to the 1980's each chapter accounts of a child of hattie their struggles and their relationship to their mother hattie is a woman that has seen her share of tragedy first chapter deals with the loss of her twin babies and maybe that is why she is not the affectioniate mother that her children lack if you are looking for hope and redemption this book does not offer it offers a hard look the human soul without any hope you do appreciate hattie and how she copes with what she has and who she is","671":"i usually enjoy different stories that are woven together but i had a really hard time with this one i found the stories to be too loosely connected aside from hattie and over the top depressing very glad to be done with it","672":"i wanted to know more about each character too disjointed for me but an excellent example of how depression neglect shapes children","673":"it was a great story but definitely a first novel it was kinda hard to keep up with the plot as it was broken in to many short stories the author seems to have great potential and i am waiting to see what she puts out next","674":"i would have preferred more fluidity in the storyline hattie`s children have powerful tales of trials and tribulation that confront who they are in their lives however this was a hard read because once you build a relationship with one character its over this is an intense emotional rollercoaster that will take you on a wild adventure and leave you dazed and confused","675":"hattie shepard's life is chronicled through intertwined short stories told through the perspectives of her many children much like other oprah book club choices this one is heartfelt and moving","676":"loved the writing loved getting to know all the characters gave it 4 stars and not 5 because their was no sense of closure at the end still wondering what happened to all hattie's children especially since some of the stories take place in the 50's and 60's and the book ends in the 80's she could have given us a glimpse of the earlier siblings lives when writing about the later siblings in the future excellent writing was definitely pulled into hattie's world","677":"this book is a great follow up to the warmth of other suns by isabel wilkerson which i read last month in 1923 hattie shepherd age 15 left georgia during the great migration and settled in philadelphia instead of finding the better life that she was seeking she married a man who turned out to bring disappointment after disappointment to her her infant twins died needlessly and she went on to give birth to nine additional children as she raised her children hattie felt as if she needed to prepare them for the difficult lives that she believed would mirror her own so she withheld tenderness and replaced it with the tough love that she felt would allow them to survive and thrive in an hostile environment the stories of the shepherd family reflects the conflicted world in which they were raised and the resilience of the family members brings hope to all of us","678":"really enjoyed this book written like olive kittridge each chapter is like a short story told from different character's voice","679":"i won this book from first reads here on goodreads thanks took a while to get the winning book but so happy to have finally gotten it reading this book was really something i will not forget for a very long time i loved the writers style and was just caught up in the story right away in 1923 hattie starts out moving up north to philadelphia to start a better life but of course she marries and then her life is never the same again i can see why this was a book club selection hope to see more from this author","680":"beautifully written but i felt more depressed than hopeful at the end not really sure why","681":"hope for a sequel i want to know more about the charecters in the book or what they were doing later years","682":"i liked all the different characters and how it was told from so many perspectives i just wished it had some happy parts dang this was one sad book","683":"almost like reading short stories instead of one continuous novel","684":"couldn't get into this at all read as very disjointed more like a succession of short stories","685":"enjoyed the book but not too fond of the ending","686":"movingthis was a well written story excellent characterization well paced with a tension that pulled you in a page turner it would have been a five star novel except for an abrupt end","687":"i listened to this book on tape instead of reading it and i think that actually added something to the book because they used multiple voices for the different woman in this book and one man's voice late in the book i don't know why i expected something different from an oprah selection but this followed the trend of telling a story of an african american family and their struggles through their connection to the titular female hattie the mother i just couldn't get into the story it never grabbed me my favorite line was an example of how descriptive the author was in her writing she had her nose so high in the air she could hear the birds farting","688":"it took me a while to get into it and figure it out i would have liked to have known what happened to ruthie","689":"how much can one family take","690":"this is closer to a 3 5 stars as it's beautifully written but so tragic in subject matter i liked how each chapter was devoted to a different character but you only caught a brief moment in each of their lives i know the before and after is left to your own interpretation but i'm left with so many questions and what if's","691":"3 stars isn't enough but at the end of each chapter i wanted more i'd read a book on each character i get the point though and know i'm being stingy with the 3","692":" this was a good fast read it was bittersweet it made me think about the fact that people do change and you cannot always tell what someone is thinking and feeling i say this in reference to hattie the books starts off with her as a young mother and ends in her old age it is an honest story showing us how she felt and behaved as a young women and the regrets and acceptance she discovered later i liked how she wrote about the children and the family dynamics much like any family in america whether people admit it or not","693":"this book is a page turner","694":"hattie was a mother to eleven children and one grandchild this story is told from the perspective of these children from childhood to their adult lives hattie experienced a difficult life and as a result her children suffered varying degree's of mental illness in adulthood well written clear and direct this book is not for those book clubs seeking happy endings","695":" a powerful book of dysfunction i honestly couldn't say i liked any of the characters in the book sure some of them had a redeeming quality or two but each of hattie's children and hattie herself were so flawed i know as a mother myself i don't think i'd have survived hattie's life suffering the death of two children giving away another child suffering the abuse and wandering eye of her husband having an affair herself one child a drunk another suffering severe mental illness hattie clearly didn't respect herself at all otherwise she'd have taken her children and left august long before and that translated into the various dysfunctions of her children not one well adjusted adult child in the lot","696":"beautiful writing the misery and suffering of hattie and her family makes it heavy going at times but then it is an oprah selection so i expected this however the writer's message saved the day for me","697":"one of those books that you wish could've been a little more polished esp in the end","698":"this book was solidly 3 5 stars at first it felt disjointed and i wanted more from one character or another but as i continue to read the author did a great job at tying hattie through each of her children and ultimately her grandchild at the end if you are looking for a book about the great migration look elsewhere the writing was powerful the characters believable and you find yourself in the end rooting for hattie","699":"oprah's newest book choice excellent development of characters truly captured the culture of the times good read","700":"ayana mathis'the twelve tribes of hattie was an emotional journey from beginning to the very last word of the book the dynamics in which she portrayed her tribes left many readers unsure about although obvious to me whom was hattie's 'twelfth tribe' hattie a courageous callous strong yet loving mother and wife left a lot to be desired she was described as a beautiful woman physically but life circumstances created an 'undesired' and 'unfair' portrait of her the author amazingly draws you into hattie's and the characters life with vivid depictions of the times and environment leaving no stone unturned current issues we face and struggle with today were very much apparent in times past - marital woes infidelity sexual identity crisis discrimination sibling relationships forgiveness mental illness poverty and suffering every reader will relate to some part of hattie and the characters even if it's just a micro inkling of that 'something' that will cause some comfort to know that 'there indeed isn't anything new under the sun' and at that point is when you will begin to understand hattie and not judge her so harshly however you have to remove your shades of judgment as you visit each tribe ...hang in there exercise patience the kind of patience you feel you deserve when you make decisions that were not very wise and pray that you are given another opportunity for a 'do over' as a mother i know we sometimes have to make decisions to 'the best of our ability' that those looking from the outside don't understand granted 'the best of our ability' entails many components such as our past experiences emotions education u0026amp the duty of the moment that many aren't privy too or would approve having been in need of 'grace u0026amp mercy' in my past present and days to come 'the twelve tribes of hattie' enlightened my remembrance of the new mercies god grants us every morning i purposely didn't disclose a lot of details about the book because i hope that if you haven't read it this review will entice you to do so and then come back and join the discussion i felt hattie was a complex character and the more i read the more i began to see the beauty in the picture mathis was painting but as the dots began to form visually for me the more i began to strike my presupposition of labeling her callous to realizing it was strength yet strange and somewhat foreign as i closed my kindle i became hopeful and was gently nudged to remember 'change is possible' to my bbc members and our facebook friends who have read the book please briefly share your thoughts of hattie or any of the other characters ~ katie bbc member","701":"a well written book filled with the sad stories of each child held together by matriarch hattie she is seen as cold by her children as she quietly struggles through the death of babies her ne'er do well husband physical and mental illness of other kids and a son at war but hattie marches on carrying them all and enduring","702":"great writing but it was really almost like each chapter was a separate short story and kind of hard to tie it all together","703":" the novel tells the story of each of hattie's children and one grandchild over a period spanning 1925 to 1980 with hattie and her husband august as the only continuing presence in each chapter beginning with hattie as a 17 year old mother of twins in philadelphia two years after her father died in georgie and shortly after her mother's death the story's early chapters remind the audience of just how late into the century jim crow laws were enforced the latter chapters illustrate how much change is still needed for the remnants of discrimination and inequality to be erased in contrast to many of the other reviews i enjoyed this book very much the chapter by chapter change in point of view emphasized the differences in the experiences of hattie's children more effectively than stringing the chapters together from a single point of view could have","704":"i really liked the style in which this book was written each chapter told through the voice of a different family member however i never became really engaged with the characters and didn't care what happened to most of them","705":"my heart broke and broke and broke again a wonderful book one of those transcendent pieces of fiction which can be more real than real life in places a very good debut","706":"it had potential but didn't pull through","707":" this is a beautifully written book about the hopes of the great migration and the unfortunate realities found in urban centers in the north and west the book focuses on the generation of children born after the migration and is quite powerful my only problem is there is no thread that connects all of the stories hattie is such a fascinating character and when her children's stories are connected back to her the book is compelling however when that connection is not made the story feels lacking and without heart i enjoyed it but think the development of all stories through their connection to hattie would have improved the overall structure","708":"a rather depressing group of characters and depiction of the lives they end up with","709":"difficult to review story told in a series of vignettes about the eleven children of hattie and various segments of their lives from 1925 1980 depressing book but i couldn't put it down","710":" it's 1923 and hattie moves from georgia to philadelphia with her new husband as part of new migration in hopes of a better life her story is devastating as is the stories of her 11 children and one grandchild who all wander off into their own tragic lives the novel is set up into sections for hattie and then for her children almost as separate novellas where the only common thread is knowing they are all from one family so many tragic stories but also foretold by hattie herself and ending with a better understanding of their harsh upbringing only occasionally alluded to within their stories even as the book ends hattie is determined to protect her offspring even in the haven of her church there are no happy endings here but rather a truth in the telling of what life can be i want to start over on page one but we can't really turn back","711":" i am mesmerized by ayana mathis's writing her characters come to life and jump off the page her writing is at once poetic earthy and poignant without being sentimental each chapter tells the story of a different child and somehow weaves tohether the story about an african american family that was part of the great migration from the south to the north i try to find the beauty in things sometimes i am overcome with it i have felt as though i were a single note of music a high c trebling from a singer's throat all shimmer and wing beat love that line","712":" i expected a lot more from this book i read the nook version and hated oprah's highlights throughout the book it was distracting what i really disliked about this book was the lack of follow through some of the short stories about hattie's children were interesting but once the story was over the author never mentions them again i would have liked to know what happened to some of the children for instance pearl how did life end up for her i wanted to like this book it's an era that interests me but i actually couldn't wait for the book to end","713":"so sad so does a mother's indifference mean that she end's up with all messed up kids i wanted to know more about what happened to each character","714":"a portrait of a woman painted through the trials of her children this book will begin breaking your heart on the first page but it's also a story of hope and survival","715":"great book the author is very talented","716":"i enjoyed reading this book the opening few pages are really gripping and immediately pull you into the life of hattie and her offspring the story follows each of the children featuring aspects of their lives each one quite different the book spans quite a number of years and details various parts of us history you really can't help feeling for the characters in the books and the hard lives that they lead if you like books about family life and relationships you will enjoy this","717":"i'd heard good things about this book but i just don't like it it's not a family saga epic as advertised it's a collection of nearly disconnected short stories the writing is ok but the characters are 2 dimensional the whole thing feel unfinished i can't recommend it","718":"did not live up to my expectations certainly not an uplifter","719":"rich descriptions reads like a collection of short stories rather than a novel with central threads","720":"sometimes we lose focus while struggling to take care of our children's physical needs we lose the importance of all the social nurturing affection that children need","721":"hattie is tough and her life isn't easy each chapter is devoted to one of her children or grandchildren and we see how each fares usually not too well i liked this novel but it's not uplifting","722":"good first novel with an interesting format really rather depressing but probably an accurate portrayal of that time period","723":"i enjoyed it but found myself wanting to know more about hattie's perspective throughout each stage of her children's lives highlighted in the book we get to view their life and mom thru them how different or similar is that to her views at that time her children mostly view her in the same light but how did she transform over the years as parents we don't stay the same and therefore end up parenting our children differently","724":" hattie the title character lives a hard life from the opening chapter when at 17 she is trying to deal with sick twin babies until the last chapter when in get seventies she is still dealing with ill children we are given a glimpse into a difficult life through the stories of her children we learn about hattie the difficulties she faces in being black and poor tinge each episode survival is key and one wonders where there is room for love within her i picked this book up because sian said i would like it i also needed a book i could read while outside by the lake luckily she had this book for me because the cottage has no books i finished it while at the beach i would recommend this to my mom she might like the stubborn refusal to give in that hattie exhibits","725":"i guess there was some redemption in the last chapter all of hattie's tribes are a bit off i really enjoyed the interview with the author on npr more than the book","726":"a very sad bleak story of a mother who had too many children and couldn't show them the affection and love that they needed and deserved as you find out it pretty much ruins all of their lives no spoiler this much you learn from the book jacket it made me sad but in a depressing way really great writer though","727":"thought provokingi gave this book 5 stars because it got onto my mind and wrapped around my soul what a beautiful story of one woman and how her mistakes and triumphs affected all of her children we never know how our actions affect people and this book kind've gave insight to that i would have liked to see how ella's life turned out but i suppose it wasn't tragic enough to write about i would recommend this book to anyone there isn't a specific type of person that wouldn't like this book","728":"i think this would have been a lot better if the author really focused on a few key characters instead of spreading the chapters into the various perspectives of hattie's children and grandchildren i wanted to know more about hattie there were real pieces of her strewn around the book and i wanted to pick them and see if i could get a whole hattie out of it it made it hard to connect with the book because i felt like i was starting over again in each chapter adjusting to the new character and seeing hattie through shattered bits of glass it was a good idea to write in this way but i don't feel it was done right the other characters detracted from the story and didn't come to the synergistic way it should have","729":"i think i could of liked this a lot it had potential i just didn't care for the way it was written like a bunch of short stories and they didn't connect much i don't know if i should listen to oprah when it comes to books anymore she doesn't really know what she's talking about","730":"well written but a little disjointed i agree with a lot if people it was more a series of short stories then a novel i found some of the stories were interesting and got emotionally involved with some if the characters but others i did not feel a connection there was long gaps of time and it left you wondering what happened in those lost years the book left you hanging at the end of most chapters as to what happened to the other characters you really never heard what happened and it felt unfinished","731":"an enjoyable quick read it is amazing the power of a mother's influence in actions and lack of actions","732":"i find it hard to rate this book because every chapter left me wanting more it was very much like a collection of short stories all related to one theme i liked the writing style of the author and the engaging characters though mostly they were never fully developed i look forward to another novel with more about some of these characters","733":" the reviews of this book on goodreads com which i never read until i've actually finished reading a book are brutal perhaps some backlash by booksnobs a category in which i honestly sometimes find myself and my strong opinions simply because this was an oprah book selection that label alone probably demands a higher standard though it meant nothing to me or my judgment of the story i fell into the novel easily in the first chapter but found the second chapter highly distasteful and by the third chapter was thinking it would be one to get through rather than to enjoy but then the subsequent chapters began to grow on me as if mathis was painting a picture that needed more time to develop fully the strokes on the canvas disconnected and without meaning until the fuller story began to develop several reviewers have commented that the chapters of the book each representing a different event in the individual lives of 12 of hattie's descendents were too disparate and left the book feeling more like a collection of short stories rather than a novel with a plot and continuity i agree with that sentiment to some degree but at the same time i found this representation to be true to life also hattie's story moves forward into the future beginning in the late 1920s and continuing through 1980 if i did the opposite moving backward through the stories of my ancestors both passed down to me and those i know from my own experience those stories too would be disconnected snapshots short video memories or imaginings of those people as individuals with their stories not necessarily flowing smoothly into those of other relatives each story and life can stand alone yet can also be threaded together into the fabric that makes the family itself mathis's decision to tell the story in this way seemed brilliant in my opinion and rather than viewing this as an obstacle to my understanding it allowed me to see each one as worthy of their own chapter each one representing a tribe if you will of hattie herself my only disappointment was the final chapter it lacks closure perhaps that in itself is a statement mathis is trying to make but i felt that hattie herself deserved to have the last word i suppose in some regards hattie's actions with sala in the closing paragraphs may have been an attempt at giving hattie the last word but she too deserved an entire chapter the writing is crisp clear and concise and mathis presents characters which are fairly developed especially considering the fact that she only gives each one a single chapter though a few are not particularly likeable and their actions and decisions are often irrational though probably realistic considering their circumstances overall this one is worth a read it probably won't leave the reader feeling good but it will give one something to think about and it does what most good books do tells a story the reader simply needs to connect the pieces together to see the big picture note in double checking the spelling on a few words in this review i am surprised to find judgement and judgment according to google as both acceptable spelling as well as likeable and likable hmmmmm no wonder i couldn't be certain i am probably seeing so many words spelled in various ways in print now that i am becoming confused in my old age just thought i would throw that out there interesting for all of us word nerds","734":"not one of my favorite books when i first noticed it was one of the oprah's book club titles i almost returned it to the library unopened because i generally find those books so depressing in this case there's a lot of darkness but enough light that i wasn't completely depressed and i was curious enough that i wanted to learn more so i finished it","735":"i was a little skeptical at first but ended up really enjoying this book it was a book about redemption in a sense a woman who was hardened and loved her children by raising them not necessarily expressing emotional love but got a second chance through her granddaughter ms mathis writes beautifully and vividly great job","736":"i loved how the book is set up as though it is a series of short stories all the stories are truly about hattie it reminded me of olive kitterage the characters were memorable and interesting really good book that's could not put down","737":"a great beginning and interesting characters the problem i had was this seemed like a series of short stories involving each of hattie's twelve children and the twelfth was not her child but her grandchild the chapters provided a shortened version with not ending for each don't know what finally happened to her very talented musician nor the preacher son or any of the others i borrowed this from the library based on oprah's book club recommendation and ended up disappointed left hanging there were many good stories with a lot of potential would the next step be a twelve part series to really dig in to the lives of each of the individuals in hattie's tribes if so that might change my thinking as well as raise the rating","738":"2 5 stars this just never clicked in with me i'd rather get to know the characters better with more continuity to the story the way this was set up i couldn't feel anything for this family although their situation was sad sad and no resolutions in sight for anyone","739":"this book surprised me into tears at the end not necessarily because of the ending itself but because it had snuck up on me and touched me the book is about hattie and her 11 children and one grandchild her tribes and their lives it starts when she is 16 and goes through to her 70s the stories within are told from different perspectives and skip large chunks of time i was sad for the pain her children were in almost certainly traceable to her lack of open affection or tenderness with them that aloofness get down to business ness is explained in the first heartbreaking chapter and just when you think hattie has built an impenetrable wall around her heart you get glimpses of her private life that show you the girl she once was the writing is lovely and the voices are distinct it's not a happy or easy read but i would definitely recommend it","740":"i think i would have liked this book a little bit more if it was called the five tribes of hattie mathis's twelve tribes refer to the main chartacter hattie sheperd's eleven children plus one granchild there is an elegance to her writing but she spreads herself too thin with this novel the chapters each of which represent a vignette of her children's lives read more like short stories than part of a novel in many instances the characters came off as flat and undeveloped hattie an african american woman is 15 at the time of her family's migration from georgia to philadelphia she is 80 at the end of the novel hattie's story is supposed to tie the chapters together but i learned very little about her character other than that she has an unhappy marriage and too many offspring there is so much tragedy in this novel that it was just unenjoyable to read and felt like mathis was trying to jump the shark with sadness","741":"this book drew me in right away the story centers around an african american woman hattie who leaves the south yet is still entrenched in it in many ways most chapters focus on the life of one of her many children and includes the date which really gave me a perspective of life in those times especially for someone of color i felt the whole story merged together nicely and flowed in a way that kept me connected to all the characters reminiscent of toni morrison the writing is superb i'm a sucker for any character driven book and this one was excellent","742":"this book started off good but because tedious toward the end it moved very slowly and was hard to finish","743":"one gets to know hattie's family in a deep intimate way as each member portrayed in the book shares a portion of their life story with the reader as with many of oprah's selected books this too is a sad story however i am glad i read it and enjoyed getting to know this family","744":" i give this book three stars reluctantly this is not a book about the great migration so ignore the fact that the publisher has tried to sell it that way the book is so disjointed it's not enough of a saga of one family there is some good writing here but there is some trite nonsense too and the biblical title is just annoying either so pretentious as to be laughable or just silly there aren't even twelve children after all but hattie is a complex hard working admirable woman just striving to do her best in the face of adversity it's possible that this author is trying something so deep that i missed it but in the end i missed it","745":"not usually an opra book fan her comments were unnecessary and fairly pedestrian but mathis wrote the story beautifully it was constructed to show time passing on a family and the lasting effects of our interactions","746":"so i was going to say the bluest eye is better which it is but this was good too in a different way the last chapter changed my sense of the book's quality a lot i do think there are parts in the middle that are needlessly obscure each chapter feels a little top much like the opening scene of memento and for no really good reason still very affecting and passionate","747":"as i read this book and when i finished it i thought meh it reads easily enough and barely held my attention with its character by character rotating chapters i have the belief that any book that portrays 'the black experience' reasonably well gets an automatic pass by the reviewers and attention from oprah and that's where i would place tttoh i never did figure out what the 12 tribes are presumably the children but i don't get the connection between that and 'tribes' i read the nyt book review on it it's compared to the grapes of wrath in its portrayal of the negro migration to the north in the first half of the 20th century i can see u0026amp respect that considered upgrading it to 4 stars but the migration isn't really portrayed in any compelling way it's more of a backdrop the contrasts and threads back to georgia are among the better dimensions of this book it's essentially a series of character portrayals though which i think is a format often seen in first novels you can imagine all the bits and pieces of assignments from intro to creative writing being assembled the characters too often fall into the same old african american stereotypes though the shiftless idle man the randy producers of countless children the escape to religion alcohol gambling nevertheless i liked my peeks into the negro world of 1930 40 50's philadelphia and the hazardous connections between northern african americans and their southern homes i'll leave it to others to determine the authenticity of those worlds","748":"i thought it was a page turner and loved the book i look forward to more","749":"the stories that comprise this book read like life it's undone there are no neat or sloppy endings life happens and some of us forgive remain scared grow hardy never forget heartache find moments of joy and or keep striving","750":"i listened to this read and i'll admit that i did not listen as attentively as required for all the drama and complexities that went on in this book it read more like individual monologues than a seamless story there appeared to be too many characters and storylines that didn't keep me engaged","751":" each chapter follows a different child or children from hattie's large brood most have some psychological issue which creates some tension and interest in their stories i enjoyed the diversity of the characters the way their stories reflected the times each story was placed within the context of a date from 1930 1980 and how we got to know hattie through the lenses of her children most of her children were not very likeable but the reader could develop some sympathy for hattie as a poor hard working african american mother who just wants to keep her kids healthy and safe","752":" a really good debut novel from mathis the format of several linked stories was reminiscent of olive kittredge and worked very well to tell the story of hattie sheppard and her extended family most of the stories were pretty dark yet still had a kernel of hope throughout them hattie provides the glue that holds the novel together just as she held the family together this book covers the gamut of human frailties from drug abuse to madness physical and sexual abuse to cheating lying and proselytizing each story could easily stand alone but taken together they paint a portrait of a highly dysfunctional family surviving some brutal and oppressive conditions as each story is told they show the versatility and strength of the various characters and the strength of hattie that shaped them a solid 4 star read","753":"this book made me laugh a little cry a little but mostly i was just in awe with every chapter and every character i look forward to reading more from ayana mathis","754":"sad and sorrowfulhattie's children grow to be sad despairing adults unable to obtain or even effectively seek love this book is a sad commentary on the effects of the lack of affection often seen in children whose parents are only able to focus on survival","755":"4 1 2 really","756":"the title of this novel is so interesting and really made me want to read it unfortunately having a new character introduced every chapter makes the reading choppy and just constantly leaves you wanting more it reminds me of picking up a brand new book and starting new each time a new chapter begins so far i am only giving this 1 5 stars that could change but there is going to have to be a masterfully written ending for that to happen happy reading i give up on this one i only made it 56% of the way through it is rare that i just put a book down but my to read list keeps growing so alas i am moving on happy reading","757":"loved loved loved the audio version however at its conclusion i felt as though i had missed something","758":"points deducted for being unceasingly depressing","759":"i liked this book a lot more than i was expecting it's definitely not a happy book but the characters are great and well developed considering you only really see each of them for one chapter in fact the entire book reads sort of like a collection of shorter stories woven together by some common threads i thought it was amazing for the author's first novel my favourite story was bell's i think","760":"i normally really enjoy books like this but i think the structure of the book sort of like short stand alone vignettes made it difficult to get into the story or care about the characters","761":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i found this book extremely depressing hattie at 16 begins this story in the bathroom desperately trying to save her twin babies from dying of pneumonia unsuccessfully each chapter of this book is a short story glimpse into the lives of her children in the years to come hattie stays with her irresponsible husband august who provides little help with these children either emotionally or financially history repeats itself daughters chose the same types of men sons are not responsible i found this book extremely depressing hattie at 16 begins this story in the bathroom desperately trying to save her twin babies from dying of pneumonia unsuccessfully each chapter of this book is a short story glimpse into the lives of her children in the years to come hattie stays with her irresponsible husband august who provides little help with these children either emotionally or financially history repeats itself daughters chose the same types of men sons are not responsible either hattie does not show any affection or tenderness to anyone throughout her life except her lover well written but no connection between chapters and depressing depressing more","762":"not overwhelmingly good but overall i'm glad i read it i just couldn't take how mean hattie was","763":" from the jim crow south of the first half of the 20th century to philadelphia this fascinating story follows the life of hattie shepard and her 12 tribes eleven children and one grand child their lives are varied and interesting as is hattie's through the decades the reader can draw their own conclusions regarding how good hattie is or is not as a mother one thing is clear she is steadfast anaya mathis's prose strikes the difficult balance between being clear and descriptive without getting so carried away that the reader gets lost her charaters cannot help but hold your attention whether you love them or hate them mathis does however seem to hold men in fairly low regard as virtually all the male characters are almost stereotypical being drunken unreliable gamblers who cheat on their wives and can't hold a job all in all a very good read","764":"the character development of these characters is masterful i connect with all of them instantly it takes me back to the people and circumstances of my youth this first novel is masterful","765":"this is a great book for a first novel could not put it down hattie tells of her twelve children and how her life is based in 1920 1990 very good","766":"i like it and it was a easy read with all the new charters entering one at a time","767":" as excited as i was to read this book it was such a let down i found most of the characters extremely depressing and very similar the ending was so abrupt and ridiculously inadequate i didn't even realize i had finished i ended a chapter on my ereader one night picked it up the next day to finish the book as i knew i was near the end reader said 37 pages left and there was no more the rest of the pages were full of acknowledgements and oprah discussion questions i felt completely gypped and wished i could retrieve the lost two days of reading time to dedicate to a more worthy book","768":"this book is about hattie's family and how her broken dreams and disappointment made her unable to show love this affects her children and their lives i liked this one specially how the writter tells the story having spoiler alert a different pov in every chapter","769":"interesting book can't say as i can blame how her children turned out on hattie but i can see why they would feel alone not my usual read but was glad to have read it","770":"didn't love this book stories were pretty much unrelated and about sad lives","771":" this book started out with a lot of momentum and instantly captured my interest however as it went on i became less enchanted the book is divided into twelve chapters and each chapter is told by or about one of hattie's 12 children though the book is well written and the premise interesting the structure makes it difficult to connect to the characters and to maintain interest in the story along with this i found that i loved certain characters' chapters and hated others and the book ended with several flat chapters that were some of my least favorite if this book had somehow managed to tie all the stories together more at the end of had simply ended with a chapter told from hattie's perspective i think i would have enjoyed it more as written now it ended abruptly and left me feeling dissatisfied","772":"i could not get into this book and give up on it sorry oprah","773":" twelve tribes of hattie is a well written and cleverly told story of hattie and her children but the book has some unsurmountable flaws at just 16 hattie is pregnant with twins suddenly and tragically she loses both at once and hattie is undone she and august have ten more children and each of their stories is told it is in fact a little like reading short stories of all of the children with hattie as the thread that connects each story to the other and each one tragic in its unique way and i tired of it i tired of plethora of issues homosexuality racism mental illness racism infidelity racism pedophilia and did i mention racism by the end of the book i'm just thinking for real every last social and mental problem in the world in this one little family really add to that the horrid constantly horrid portrayal of every single man in the book was there a single male with any redeeming qualities i don't think so that got old this book seemed like ayana mathis had one book in her to write and she was going to say it all it's really a shame because her writing shows such talent but it is lost in the scree","774":"i didn't care for this one it was almost a collection of short stories with its format being one chapter per pov but since hattie was a commonality to all it just seemed herky jerky and incomplete and overall it was depressing hattie was miserable and angry and her kids don't seem to fare much better the very end tries to sneak in a job like morality but it falls flat blah don't recommend","775":" i really enjoyed the writing though similar to a book i judged a little poorer 'red garden' takes one person's story at a time i liked that this looked into all the children of an african american woman their struggles in the south and north from the 1920s to the 80s i liked this because you were in one family so you got to see how shared experiences were perceived now how children were affected it also brought some stories full circle or at least got to 'check in' on someone you'd already read about the characters were not very likable but i rooted for them anyway as they struggled to find themselves and understand what love is and what family means i rooted for hattie too","776":"i really enjoyed this book but there's clearly something missing i was left feeling extremely unfulfilled and cheated","777":" let me preface my review with stating that ayana is a truly gifted writer her ability to portray a scene or a feeling with an efficiency of words is nothing short of brilliant however i really did not care for the overall structure of the book where each chapter was devoted to one or more of the children although each chapter revealed details about its character s and hattie the structure felt disjointed these are siblings in an overall family but very little of their familial interaction was described which i think further added to it appearing more disjointed","778":"this book was so rich so deep so beautifully written it made me think and imagine and connect on so many levels excellent read","779":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book the only thing i would ask for more","780":"absolutely wonderful one of the best reads i've had in a long time hattie's family is diverse and each has their own heartbreaking story even when it seems they have it all the ending was beautiful like the way poetry makes me feel things","781":"the plot was good but the book rambled a little too much for me","782":"really juicy writing but it almost felt like it was too much too much for one family like the author felt she needed to get everything in this first novel sexual abuse mental illness death etc and what is the author trying to say about hattie is she the cause of all of this destruction can she ever really be happy if her kids are not can any of us","783":"i thought it was baeutifully written i look forward to reading more books form this author in the future","784":" the book was slow and character driven but the author manage to create a very realistic cast of characters who in the last chapters left a haunting impression on me while i may not have loved the book enough to inhale it in a sitting it was a very good and worthy read the characters were well done both well created and developed the author created a very interesting cast of characters very flawed characters and there are ones i found i disliked but the author did a good job at creating a cast of very believable characters i did find that not all the stories connected together well while the ongoing theme of hattie and her influence on the children at the various points in life was there i found that the book read as individual short stories rather than a novel or a collection of connected stories there were times were the stories linked together but i found most of them didn't flow into each other which made for a choppy read the last two stories chapters in the book were both haunting and stunning and were probably my favourite part of the entire book it was the first time everything was truly linked to create a novel rather than interconnected short stories and the focus point for the last to stories was told wonderfully it got me interested in the book again after a few lulls in the book they also gave me a whole new outlook on the book as a whole and hattie as a character in the end i did end up enjoying the book quite a lot also on my book review blog jules' book reviews the twelve tribes of hattie","785":"just couldn't get into this one took it back to the library before i was halfway done","786":" this book was full of vivid description and imagery i could see every bleak situation in my mind's eye as i read each chapter i don't know if i enjoyed reading it as it was very depressing i've read depressing books written with the necessary dose of comic relief so by the ending i don't feel regretful for having spent time reading it personally i read books to take me away from my life they don't need to be uplifting however i do need it to be written in a way that doesn't allow the downtrodden characters' to be so rooted in their misery that they lose any appeal they may have to the reader i like characters with spirit and without a desolate inner self i can read about a character that knows their life is miserable but has sassy thoughts and snarky retorts overall it wasn't bad but it wasn't a book i'd read again","787":"i debated between 3 and 4 stars four stars for the writing 3 stars for the depressing nature of this book four won because despite the bleakness i still wanted to pick it up reads more like short stories than a novel","788":"really enjoyed this book would love to read more about each character the two that stood out for me were floyd and ruthie i was kind of hoping that ruthie ended up having a life like cee cee honeycutt i really didn't expect it to end so quickly good book need more","789":"not a fan there was no real plot to the book just about different people in hattie's life","790":"i really enjoyed this book the author's narrative style kept me engaged","791":"eh where was the ending good stories but plotless to me","792":"this was a very wondefully written depressing book to me","793":"average read some good parts but could have been better if the 6 or 7 tribes","794":"i almost gave it 3 stars even though the writing was good and the stories fascinating but as one reviewer said it never gained momentum you saw a slice of life of one of her adult children then another then another there was some connection between the children but not much where was the story i finally decided the story was about hattie no one else what happened to each of the children only serves to tell hattie's story i wish i had realized that at the start i might have enjoyed it more what tipped it into 4 stores for me was if you read my reviews you will have guessed it the ending it was consistent with the story so many authors don't seem to be able to end a book without tidying everything up painting it with a little rose coloring and it was extremely well written the characters were complex and believable","795":"to be honest i wasn't sure what to make of this novel the reader learns about hattie through stories of her children and granddaughter i felt the strories about her daughters were stronger than those about her sons but in the end it was the granddaughter that brought everything together i actually liked and appreciated hattie as a character and a mother she became one when she barely an adult herself and had to learn along the way with little support or help from her husband in the end her kids with the exception of the twins make into a world that is a little harsh and does not always accept them","796":"i know this was an oprah 2 0 pick but i couldn't get into it too many character's that just weren't capturing my attention i found it boring and read 3 4 then stopped and returned it to the library","797":"i was very dissapointed with this book it's not a novel it seems like a book of short stories not even really related with eachother the characters even hattie are not deeply established a total failure for me","798":"i gave this book a 3 star but probably was more of a 3 5 rating i like so many others loved some of the chapters in this book some of the writing was so vivid and well written however i felt like the author just left the reader hanging with most of the story lines the reason i gave it the 3 5 was because it put me in the mindset of what life is really like one person really only knows very little of others and we may never know what the outcome will be","799":"a beautifully vivid intricately detailed collage of chapters that feel more like short stories each one filled with pathos grit longing hope despair a beautiful haunting ode to the african american 20th century experience","800":"it was ok each chapter was like its own little novella but i felt like each chapter left me hanging i wanted to know what happened to each kid it was good not great","801":"drills down deep to a place where you didn't think words could take you reading this is like taking a powerful cure that could either heal you or kill you quicker than the disease itself","802":" hattie who can only be described as the central character of this story is the matriarch of the shepard family she is headstrong and fierce and her children mistake her ferocious approach to 'motherly love' for cold heartedness spanning 60 years this is by no means a conventional novel taking on the format of a collection of short stories interwoven by the fact that the pov character in each is a relation of hattie's normally but not always one of her children each story has a central issue which contributes to the building of hattie's character as well as to that of her husband august and their family it also takes the reader on a journey through african american history from the 1920s until the 1980s like any short story collection some stories are better than others but what i really enjoyed was how the stories tied together how they contributed to the building of a character and a family and therein lies the talent of the author","803":" 3 5 stars the great migration one african american family and others woven in interesting characters heart breaking happenings helpful insight i read this book as an audio book thus my problem with the book might be my own attention when listening to some audiobook production styles but for me the narrative of the book was underserved by the changing of character's perspectives just as soon as i got into the story from one character and attached to them as characters the book switched to someone else's perspective a broad view certainly but for me it left something lacking","804":"while this book was definitely not my cup of tea ms mathis knows how to write every story was pretty depressing didn't like the novel itself but liked the writing style and that's the only reason i have rated it 3 stars","805":"beautiful writing each chapter tells about one of hattie's children wish there was more maybe a future book oprah's notes in e book were unneeded skip them and just enjoy the stories","806":"after leaving georgia for a better life in philadelphia hattie finds herself desperately trying to save her baby twins dying from pneumonia life doesn't get much better for her she goes on to have nine more children the book devotes a chapter to each child and one grandchild the stories are heart breaking but i wished for more continuity a plot that would connect them to one another still a good read","807":"loved this book i ave not made a decision about hattie's mothering and must confess that by the end of the book i was a bit weary of her children's sorrows however i loved the characters and the images that played in my head while reading this book","808":" the twelve tribes of hattie should have been a richly character driven novel about hattie and the struggles of raising her eleven children and one grandchild each child takes a chapter to describe what it was like growing up with hattie as a hard working but unemotional mother and how she helped shape them into adults in a said period of their lives instead of the novel being an interesting perspective of these characters and the challenges they faced growing up poor in the 50's and 60's of chicago each character is miserable and resentful of their unhappy mother and childhood not one of the characters triumphed over adversity instead they all languished in misery sickness and depression blaming their childhood and unhappy mother as the root of their problems all the stories are disjointed and there is no conclusion at the end half way through the novel i just wanted to yell at hattie's children to take charge of their own lives and to hattie herself to get a grip and stop being so bloody miserable always blaming someone else for her troubles this book left me wanting to put them all into a therapy session and throw away the key","809":"this is less a novel than a series of short stories each focused one of hattie's children through all of the stories you come to understand the strength of a mother doing the best she can","810":"overflowing with life lessons and stories that will remain with you","811":"she's an excellent writer and i will certainly seek out her next book nevertheless i am a little surprised that i'm not as moved by this book as i expected to be","812":"hattie had a hard life and made sure each of her children did not have much in terms of expectations i short view of many lives and the difficulties endured well written","813":"i expected to like this book a lot more than i did but each character depressed me more than the next one no one had hope not even hattie she was just resigned u0026amp miserable the characters were well developed but all were just so sad u0026amp messed up this novel was interesting from a cultural perspective but as entertainment not so much","814":" twelve tribes won't sit on my 'favorite' shelf and i'll never re read it but that doesn't mean it isn't a triumph i'm unabashedly jealous of mathis' ability to write convincingly from twelve different perspectives about the same family each character is unique expertly defined and easy to connect to the most incredible part is she only gives herself 20 or so pages to introduce each one of them that in itself is awe inspiring while i didn't fall in love with story and it didn't haunt my every thought like truly great books do i respect it and i think it's a must read it should be on summer reading lists for adolescents and adults alike","815":" this book was depressing i felt such sadness for all the characters whose lives it seemed were destined for tragedy before ever beginning obviously one has to wonder what hattie's life would have been like if she didn't experience the tragedy of losing her twins what the lives of her children would have been like would it have been the same happier the characters were all interesting but the same due to the sadness sometimes i felt she ended a story abruptly and it felt unfinished don't want to add too much or give spoilers so i'll end it here","816":"i didn't mind the shifts from person to person it was a unique way to tell the story it gave more intimacy than an omniscient narrator could have many readers compared it to short stories i think a strong central narrative ran throughout making it more than a short story collection an enjoyable sobering read it inspires me to learn more about the migration of african americans the first and last chapters are wrenching both depict unwavering love for children in peril and the pain of not knowing the right way to help them as a newish mom those passages really struck a a chord most days i face the confusion of what the right choice is for my daughter u0026amp keep hoping that loving her the best way i know will be enough that seems to be hattie's way of coping too","817":"it's very i indepth in each character and even towards the end it leaves you in heavy thought but it is a page turner","818":"i didn't know until i got the book that it was on oprah's read list i came upon it after hearing the author interviewed on npr the book covers the life of hattie and her children through the use of short stories instead of a linear accounting of life from the time of the great migration to as i recall around 1970 i know one of the standards i have is whether i can put it down and i couldn't another is whether i wish there was more and i do mathis is a good writer lots of dialogue and all of it seemed authentic a good read","819":"while an interesting book and a beautifully tragic story the book itself just couldn't lock my attention the short stories worked but then failed without any additional tie in between chapters","820":" a new author to add to the favorites list ms mathis created a master with this one her writing style puts me in the mind of ms tayari jones in that she is skilled at detailed storytelling that is a bit frayed on the edges forces the reader to infer and predict what has and will happen i love being compelled to actively read especially when the need to do so is steeped in a story as sweepingly complex like this one the story is centered around hattie a member of a functionally dysfunctional family who doesn't have one but the lens of the story traces the experiences of her children with her as their mother this was a pleasure to read i finished it in 3 days when typically it would take me 3 weeks the only downside is the wait for ms mathis' next literary contribution","821":" this is a very difficult book to review for me on one hand i really liked it the writing is beautiful and very powerful many memorable passages from this book however on the other the way the book is constructed kind of bugs me a bit let me explain twelve tribes of hattie follows hattie shephard as her family leaves the south during the great migration it is written in chapters that follow one or two of her children what stinks is that after that child's chapter has ended that's pretty much all you hear of them it's somewhat difficult to find out how they ended up in life and it feels slightly incomplete to me i do understand why the author did this however there's a lot of interpretation that takes place here also this story is about hattie's life i think the biggest thing i take from this book is that removing yourself from a bad situation or an oppressed one doesn't necessarily mean that it lifts the feeling of it hattie has many challenges in life after her family fleed the jim crow laws of the south i do recommend reading this book some will think of it as a bunch of short stories but i felt it flowed well the years jump around and it's a bit tough to get your bearings straight because the story takes such sharp turns chapter after chapter however if you're not intrigued after reading the powerful first chapter the rest of the book won't matter to you","822":"i only rated this book as 3 stars because it felt unfinished i wanted to know what happened to the characters u0026amp i felt like i was left hanging great book u0026amp written wonderfully","823":"12 differently stories about a woman's hattie's children all similar to each other conflict wise became predictable towards the end","824":"this was oprah's book club selection therefore it came with a lot of hype for a first time writer ayan's book was prolific and well researched from the great migration from the south to the east socio economic issues the political environment the different settings provide an accurate historical canvas to every story the book is dark though very dark from floyd's story till sala's it seems like hattie's children never had a chance of making it alive sane or whole in this life how can a mother fail to create a launch pad for her kids sala the granddaughter looks like she'll break the cycle of hopelessness colourlessness and dread i don't want to spoil it for my fellow wormers we're discussing it on 17 nov","825":"had this been told in the same sort of narrative as the help it would have been a good read as it was it jumped all over the place with no real connection while it is a story about hattie and eleven of her children and one grandchild it was just very disconnected i made myself read it since i had paid full price but a really good book i will get through in a few days this one took me weeks","826":"couldn't put it down a little depressing but very interesting read","827":"this book was hard for me to get into because it is so sad and hopeless i did finish it but it is without much happiness and is rife with defeated characters and lives i would not recommend it and while i often save books that i read so that i can reread them this will not be one of those","828":"finally finished this book it took me a while but i think i liked it at least it gave me some things to think about and for me this is what a good book does it's always interesting for me to read novels about families and particularly how relationships with parents have lingering effects on lives","829":"this was a crazy book and not what i thought it would be this is the story of how cyclical people's lives can be one hardship after another and each generation doesn't fare any better than the first sad but a book i just kept reading the writing was good although i had trouble keeping the characters straight in my mind","830":"found myself skipping over some parts whereas others were very well written","831":"a good companion to the warmth of other suns the epic story of america's great migration by isabel wilkerson as a teenager hattie and her mother leave georgia and the jim crow laws of the south for a better life in philadelphia motherhood and tragedy strike hattie too soon after her arrival this account of hattie her unreliable husband and their children hattie's twelve tribes is both heartbreaking and inspiring as hattie shows resilience in the face of many trials","832":"i'm suprised that i liked this book written in an unusual way each chapter about one of hattie's children but so well done that i felt it ultimately did tell the story of hattie","833":"excellent writing i'm not too thrilled with the ending only because i need to know what happens to everyone i need a sequel please i think each of hattie's children warrants their own novel","834":"the emporer's new clothes we never get to know hattie who is she how does she feel what is her inner voice saying this is not a novel it is a collection of mediocre short stories they're disconnected tales of her kin that describe lots of people doing things but tell us very little about the characters add to that a multitude of implausible situations hattie's old beau brings his new young girlfriend to meet her really and you have a mish mash of well turned phrases that amount to not much at all beyond disappointing sorry oprah you missed the mark yet again","835":"i suspect a fairly true representation of life during the last 100 yrs in a poorer nieghbourhood ayana has a good ear for the different voices in each generation she ably captures the depth of each individual expressing their most honest thoughts without judgment although a sad novel it was very interesting and i look forward to reading more from this talented new author","836":"i began loving it then the next few chapters just felt detached near the end it gained speed for me and i got a little more invested overall just fair nothing that i'll remember in a few months","837":"rounded up from 3 5 stars i enjoyed the stringing together of the vignettes that tell the story of hattie's children by far not an uplifting book but the prose and observations of the characters was elegant in its honesty the vignettes individually stand better than as a group as a group they are a little on the long repetitive side looking forward to more work by this author","838":"yuck no more oprah books","839":"the story centers on hattie the matriarch of a family of twelve children her difficulties in her own life then that of her children each chapter represents an honest look at how life's tragedies encompass generations there is no happy ending but if you're looking for a book that speaks of heroics having many children and ensuring they're clothed and fed but are missing tenderness and physical affection then it's a good read","840":"its hard to rate this book it was well written and i loved each character as they came into the story but because i was meeting new characters each chapter it was difficult to invest my emotions","841":" i have to say that i didn't completely know what to think of this book i thought it was beautifully written loved the beginning and the end there were definitely some parts that i highlighted for future reference however i have to say that there was some vulgar language and some sexual content that i did not think was necessary i am normally fine with this sort of thing if i feel it serves a purpose but with this read often i felt that it didn't there was also a long span where i did not completely understand the point of this book but after finishing it i think it makes sense to me it will be good to discuss with my book club gals","842":"i did not particularly care for this writers style of writing it made it difficult for me to follow the storyline and keep up with the characters the other thing i noticed which seemed odd for a storyline with so many siblings they did not seem interact with each other except for alice u0026amp billups just wasn't my preferred reading","843":"felt this book was very disjointed and ended quite abruptly not one my favorites","844":"excellent book","845":"more a novel of short stories about each of hattie's children i felt like i wanted to know more about her life and not each of her children's lives","846":"beautifully written what a talent","847":"great read but made me feel sad for hattie she was deeply misunderstood an sad and as a new mother it made me think about how i want to be as a mother through my baby's point of view","848":"a bit depressing and hard to get through the beginning once i was about halfway through i was more interested","849":" after skimming some of the reviews of this book i have to begin with this statement don't expect a typical narrative structure from this novel although the chapters are laid out chronologically this novel is more akin to a tale cycle without repeated points of view than a typical beginning middle end narrative each chapter is from a different point of view there are a couple from hattie's point of view but the story it that of hattie's family each child is damaged in his or her own way and the family is only partially functional the looming background of the family's establishment the great depression is never directly acknowledged but its effects are everywhere i enjoyed the book but my father came from a large southern family 13 children that was growing during the depression so i had a personal connection with the work i would recommend this book for anyone who feels the pangs of families who are struggling to find their form","850":"meh i finished this a long time ago now but i remember that the chapter by chapter of the children of hattie felt contrived and interfered with my ability to get to know any one character","851":"the character's are rich and you really become involved in their lives great read","852":"i liked this book very much at times it could be very depressing but ultimately the story ended with a glimmer of hope for hattie and a new beginning for her even at her advanced age an extremely thought provoking novel i listened to the audiobook and the readers were excellent to me the readers on audiobooks can make or break a story in this case the primary reader brought the characters to life vividly","853":"this was well written but depressing and i really have no idea what the author's message was","854":" i read this for our book club and kept waiting for some shred of hopefulness i guess hattie's anger eventually plays out but in the last chapter she has yet another child to rear badly sala a granddaughter the twelve tribes are for her children who each find ways to redefine misery alcoholism mental illness burns more mental illness the time frame is from 1925 and hattie her mother and two sisters are part of the great migration north from the south by seventeen she's had twins who die from pneumonia her husband august goes out at night and twice blows through money hattie has saved for a down payment on a house she almost leaves him but realizes she is leaving a carouser for a gambler another bad decision i just got tired of all the misery at least in the warmth of other suns nonfiction by isabel wilkerson the second generation begins to move into the middle class but not so much in this fictional family drear ruthie had said once that bell and hattie were just alike it wasn't true hattie was stronger than bell could ever be she didn't know how to tend to her children's souls but she fought to keep them alive and to keep herself alive p 217","855":"this is a sad and painful tale of a family with southern roots living in the north unfortunately we only visit with most of the characters except hattie for one chapter leaving us bereft over and over again","856":"good read considering the plot features more than a little family dysfunction of three generations of hattie's family","857":"sweeping and lovely this left me wanting more","858":"this book rocked me from time to time i had to put it down for a bit so that i could absorb it and take a break from its power the story begins with two children dying in the arms of their mother hattie hattie is the backbone of her family and these vignettes each chapter story documents a time in the lives of her offspring i wish i could write a better review for this book because it deserves one but it has left me at a loss of words read it","859":" i wanted to really love this book it is an interesting book with interesting characters but i didn't love it maybe it was the format of the novel that i didn't like each chapter was from the point of view of a different child normally this works but in this case once we read about one of the kids we didn't hear much about them again i was hoping that some of them would overlap more at times or at least come together at the end rather than being a novel this was almost a book of short stories about the same family told from different viewpoints i might recommend this book to some but not everyone","860":" i had a really hard time with this book it isn't really a novel and the story just didn't flow for me each chapter was about one of her children but none of the chapters actually did a very good job of character development what happened to the son who is was a gay musician what happened to the son who was a preacher with the power to heal the story about her mentally ill daughter was disturbing i guess my overall emotion after reading this book was frustration none of the stories had endings and even though i tried i could not really relate to or even like any of the characters","861":"this book teeters between 3 5 and 4 for me i enjoyed it but it's nothing to write home about i do however recommend it to anyone who enjoys an honest portrayal of an american family throughout the 20th century very very honest one can easily categorize this story as the african american experience but i won't pigeon hole the story into one unit it's truly prose that transcends the color lines check it out","862":"this story is about a woman named hattie and the trials of her and her children s lives","863":"the story never engaged me there was no growth of the family to speak of no real lesson learned in all one of the most depressing books i have read in a long time the author has a great deal of writing talent her ability to paint a picture and describe a scene was brilliant and that alone kept me reading mesmerized even though the short story format of the book style didn't really allow for building a relationship with these characters in the end i was just left disappointed that it was over and that nothing great had happened","864":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here well written but it was painful to watch this family fall apart and become so very distant","865":" this was an overwhelming book there were times i almost gave up and did not even like it but i am so glad i read it hattie is a fictional reminder that mothers are human not endless wells of love and support their abilities and resources are tested and they cannot be everything to everyone in addition as children we are not always the answer to their prayers but we can judge them so harshly the members of the tribe hattie's children are also fascinating characters on their own this book requires an emotional response it was amazing","866":"the short stories structure is perfect for all avid yet easily bored readers like me mathis has an elegant smooth literary style that made each word come alive her description of hattie's pain in the first chapter is stunning i don't know though why she infused hattie with such a repulsive coldness quite irritating","867":"i was surprised to find this novel so dark very little is redemptive for these characters not family love society nor religion it's a sobering read rather than the type of light in the darkness literary fiction i prefer but it is well written","868":"it took me several chapters to understand the connections among the characters in this book it seems more like a collection of short stories with thin threads joining them to each other in the end it is a reflection of the hardships endured by hattie and her family her sacrifices willing and unwilling and her undying hope for a better life","869":"wow that was intense i almost cried by page 13 what a debut novel i honestly didnt really enjoy the book as much as i thought i would based on the hype there is no doubt that it's gripping gritty and dark all qualities i love in books but it just didnt stick with me as much as it should have for some reason i cant quite put my finger on it yet but when i can i'll edit this and tell you what it was once i pin it down","870":"a beautiful collection of stories portraying the far reaches of poverty and race in a family over three generations such sadness unbelievable ability to survive i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it","871":" i liked this book just fine it didn't blow me away but there were certainly moments where i felt considerably moved the novel is built in the fashionable linked short stories that are so popular in modern fiction these days each chapter devoted to one sometimes two of the children of hattie shepherd an african american woman who produces a bevy of children over the course of three decades these stories were most compelling early on especially the opening chapter detailing the loss of hattie's two infant twins whom she names philadelphia and jubilee because \"hattie wanted to give her babies names that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in georgia... giving them names of promise and of hope reaching forward names not looking back ones\" 3 prose like this so eloquently describes some significant components of the black experience in mid twentieth century america the constant shifting between time place and character perspective left me feeling a bit lost at times yet the overall experience was enjoyable i read the \"oprah's book club 2 0 digital edition\" though which includes oprah's comments throughout as hyperlinked footnotes i clicked on the first few to see what she had to say but the experience reminded me why i always skipped watching her book club episodes on television her intentions are so good and it's so important that she has people reading en masse but her comments are empty platitudes that reveal her narcissism more than providing meaningful analysis","872":"disappointing well written but more a collection of short stories easy lunchtime reading read a chapter nothing compelling to want find out what happens next next chapter a whole new story","873":"i enjoyed this beautifully written book although it's more of a rich character study with hattie as its common thread than traditional novel while the story is ultimately about hattie her struggle her pain her determination i found myself wanting more resolution from the children's stories","874":"sad but well written","875":" although this was part of oprah's book club and the reviews were excellent i was bored by this book each chapter told the story of each of hattie's children for the most part but you only learned about a chapter of their lives and when the chapter was done you never heard anything more about that person for that reason i did not like the book i like characters that are woven throughout the book and ones in which you can gain insight to how the choices they make shape their lives a disappointment of a book","876":"sooo depressing every single character was deeply damaged in some way the writing was lovely and the characters intriguing but the structure of the book keeps the reader at arms length it is written more like glimpses into each character's life than a coherent novel","877":" hmm yeah not sure what to say about this book the writing was decent it was a collection of stories of each of hattie's children in a snapshot during their lives but only one or two of them had any semblance of closure which is very frustrating for me as a reader maybe i just did not get her literary style or goal of the book but there was no message from the book and no morals in the stories it was depressing as well and i kept waiting for the happy story closure something to tie the stories together and it never came so only 2 stars and there are many other books out there that are more worth your time","878":"i enjoyed it but it was a different format for me i would just get to know a character and then it was on to a new chapter with a new character and the others were never heard from again hattie is the only constant in the book","879":"well written but very sad the mother hattie has so much pain and disappointment in her married life that she does not have the energy to be loving and nurturing to her children although she dedicates herself to helping raise them and providing food and shelter as we meet individual children once they are grown none is happy or fulfilled","880":"really good read really enjoyed this book the book spans the civil rights era from 1920s any the jim crow laws through to 1980 the book is about a mother and the children she raises throughout this time frame very well written and well thought out though i want to find out what happened to some of the characters i guess that's for our imagination","881":"an eye opener to the struggles african americans had in the early part of the 20th century a good look at how early motherhood being poor personal losses and struggles can impact one's life and those around her beautifully written","882":"i'm not really sure how to describe this book each chapter is dedicated to one of hattie's children as a result it seemed like the story didn't flow well that's not to say the book wasn't very well written it is obvious ms mathis is a very talented writer it just wasn't my cup of tea i almost feel like this could have been a book of short stories rather than a novel","883":"this book is amazing if you love character depth and development i found that when i read each segment from each child i was transported into an unknown part of hattie herself the book ties everything together perfectly in the end as i've been thinking about it weeks after finishing it's a heartbreaking heartwarming intriguing look at human capacity i rarely enjoy books that are from multiple points of view but this one was amazing and i want to read it again and again","884":"this debut from ayana mathis read more like a series of short stories than a novel beautiful and painful the story of one family's great migration from georgia all hinges on hattie who manages to mother her nine children with the bare essentials but never with a tender word","885":"this is not a happy book but this is a powerful gritty look at an african american family's life over several generations i found it led me to face aspects of myself and my society in ways i couldn't dodge","886":" the writing is the only thing that saved this book i would be curious to know what the author would put out in the future you could tell this was a debut novel every chapter was about one of hattie's children and i expected all of them to somehow weave together nicely that didn't happen one family member was touched on and then never mentioned again there was no real plot here plus i disliked many of the characters you don't necessarily want to agree with every single character in every single book but it would have been nice to identify with at least one","887":" wow i zipped through this fascinating novel it read like a dozen short stories but interwoven so as to advance a plot and a chronology as the title implies each chapter is devoted to a different one of hattie's children the chronology of the novel spans most of the 20th century and therefore reflects the changing of times in the acknowledgements author ayana mathis credits the writer of the nonfiction work the warmth of other sun for writing an important and essential book mathis's novel creates and develops characters that illuminate the history documented in that book the story of the descendants of southern slaves moving north to cities such as philadelphia to escape the south the crisis that prompts hattie's move to the north is the murder of her father by white men who are jealous of his business success and who take over his blacksmith shop before his family even leaves town there are plenty of heartaches in the north too but hattie never regrets her decision to leave at the conclusion of the novel i wished for more what happened to ruthie and to the child her sister pearl raised i wanted to know more about floyd had his life as a gay man changed at all by the 1980s when the book ends furthermore the concluding story left me unsatisfied it attempts a sense of closure by implying that hattie is doing something different with her grandchild something to protect her in a way she did not protect her other children but i was not convinced so yes she didn't want her grandchild to become a religious fraud just for the sake of providing her with a supportive and loving community but the author provides no alternative vision of what hattie might do to redeem herself and her sense of failure as a parent other than jerking that child back from walking the sawdust trail it just wasn't enough nevertheless i loved the book my disappointment only reflects the high hopes i had for it","888":"great characters and story i enjoyed this book","889":" i read this book dispite it being on the oprah list i will agree with other reviews that the individual stories of each child are a bit shallow but the one thing that connects them all is hattie this is the story of a woman that did the best she could with the situation she found herself in and tried to give her children what she thought they would need to survive in the same life she thought they would find themselves some of her children didn't survive mentally some of her children didn't survive spiritually and some of her children didn't survive at all this was not an easy story to read and some may not be able to grasp it but for those who do","890":"caveat i listened to this as a book on tape and i have a feeling it might have been just 4 stars without the auditory interpretation either way this is a gripping portrait of many of the ways it must have been still is to be black in america the opening narrative of sick babies is heart wrenching and i was worried it would be too much for me but it calmed down a bit and i loved seeing hattie through each of her children's eyes glad o read it and will recommend","891":"i loved the way it described all the lives of the children it was a very original novel that compelled me to read","892":"essentially a series of short stories with the only connection being the parents of children i have not really connected with any of oprah's choices and this is no different happy that o bought from the sale table for $5 would have been really disappointed to spend $25","893":" i share the frustration of several other reviewers on this site each chapter introduces and explores a moment in the lives of one of hattie's children but the character is never revisited i felt that this was a collection of dangling conversations the reader becomes emotionally involved with these people due to the excellence of the author's writing but we are left without conclusion the only conclusion offered in the last chapter was just sad i do look forward to the next book by this author though","894":"i listened to the audiobook and i was pretty much confused the entire time the characters just blended together which is a downside of listening versus reading the book i will eventually re read the book and hopefully will be able to change my rating","895":"this was the 2nd book in the oprah 2 0 book club and not necessary something i would've chose to read it was just one long chapters of stories of some of the many children of hattie the mother and although i enjoyed the stories about the kids i prefer books that have the characters throughout the book once the chapter was done none of them really showed up again i felt for a lot of what hattie and her children had to go through and the strength of them all","896":"brilliant it's a whole fictional life and an american history lesson told through chapters that each read like a short story","897":"loved it as a collection of short stories disconnected from each other in the same way as the family they describe","898":"i liked the way this book was written it's the story of hattie and young girl who migrates from georgia to philadelphia in the 20's the chapters are all told through the lives of her various 11 children and go choronologically through 1980 each chapter is like a short story but they are all intertwined","899":"it was a bit disjointed it didn't grab me like some books do but overall a good read","900":" i really wanted to like this book i thought i'd find something of my family as the book opens in 1925 which is close to the year my grandparents were born the book tells the story of the children of hattie and august shepherd who move north from the hard racism of georgia the chapters roughly tell the story of the eleven children hattie birthed i kept waiting for the book to tie together to explain more about how hattie came to be and the effect this had on the children most of whom had very disturbing lives disappointing finish","901":"a few challenging chapters in the middle but other than that a true to joy to read","902":"this is a startling portrait of one family who heads north for a better life fleeing the discrimination of the south the story of a young mother who refuses to show and feel love for her tribe of children she keeps herself locked away to keep from feeling the horrific pain should she loose them of this mothers' continual grief and bitter disappointment in her broods inability to create a better life for themselves brutal enduring un satisfying lives unfulfilled lives a good but sad read","903":"really well written and engrossing but just too dang depressing to rate higher not a book you walk away from feeling better about life","904":"some common elements are active in the saga of hattie shepherd an african american who leaves georgia in 1925 in pursuit of the american dream in philadelphia but the talent of her creator first-time novelist ayana mathis is uncommon as the opening pages of the twelve tribes of hattie cogently make clear \"hattie wanted to give her babies names that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in georgia so she gave them names of promise and of hope reaching forward names not looking back ones \"ther preacher in georgia declared the north to be \"a new jerusalem \" but hattie's long road of trouble and travail over six decades begins very soon after she arrives in philadelphia she rocked her sick babies \"she pressed her cheeks to the tops of their head oh their velvet skin she felt their deaths like a ripping in her body hattie's children died in the order in which they were born first philadelphia then jubilee \" out of fear that her nine later children and her grandchildren will fail to survive in a world of hatred and poverty hattie becomes a hard demanding woman as mathis dramatically shows through the perspectives of twelve characters her electric style is both tough and compassionate creating almost unbearably poignant moments mathis moves the reader from hattie's perspective into the story of her grown son floyd a horn player twenty three years later then the focus shifts to six a preacher then to the child ruthie then to eight other characters but hattie is a vibrant participant in the drama of each separate narrative mathis allows only franklin a soldier in vietnam and cassie bedeviled by banshee voices to tell their stories in the first person powerful voices among the voiceless but the dialogue throughout is so achingly real that one may remember this as a novel of distinctive and haunting voices that yearn toward love and forgetfulness hattie's tribes are survivors of the great migration out of the egypt of the american south into a promised land in the north that fails them what succeeds is the culture of a people of a family that has struggled to endure","905":"enjoyable book tracing hattie's family from the deep south to philadelphia and the joys and sorrow of her children form 1920's to 1980's this book is more like several short stories put together rather one continuous story but well worth reading though","906":"powerful writing the book really feels like a collection of short stories rather a family epic but maybe that is the point","907":"really interesting stories and characters but they were all over too soon and put together oddly i would have loved to see these people with a chance to breathe","908":"a lovely first novel by a promising writer i liked her structure very much bouncing back and forth discovering her children in reference to other children very interesting i admired the author's courage to not sentimentalize her heroine and yet i admired hattie even when she wasn't very lovable the ending is also very strong and full of hope oprah's notes can be annoying but i found some of them here quite helpful this time again i wish that goodreads allowed for 1 2 stars because while i couldn't quite give this novel four stars i would definitely add a half to my current rating of three nice job","909":"i liked some of this book but there was a lot of rubbish as well went on far too long and it was depressing nothing happy happened","910":"i was very excited to read this new author's work especially as it related to the great migration the book while very well written was extremely dour for over 200 pages the ending offered a hint of redemption but i wasn't sure that it was enough to satisfy the pain and suffering that preceded it i would read another book by this author but i would only recommend this book to others selectively","911":"much better than i expected shades of the color purple but better would have liked more resolution at the end","912":"could not get though this book i thought it was about hattie and her struggles i quit after reading some of her son's struggles with homosexuality this is obviously part of hattie's story but the story just lost too much of the history i was interested in","913":"pretty good i liked getting to know hattie through her tribes sort of a cliffhanger at the end though maybe there'll be a sequel","914":"told from 12 pov's~ very thought provoking","915":"i stayed up all night to finish this book it made me cry think and remember how good fiction is written absolutely amazing","916":"a must read","917":"i don't always like the oprah book selections but i do read most of them this book was an emotional read and one that i am still thinking about long after i finished it","918":"the author is very talented in her prose however the subject matter i found unpleasant","919":" really enjoyed this book the author is a vivid writer and does a wonderful job transporting readers to philadelphia georgia baltimore and virgina across multiple decades in the twelve tribes of hattie as an only child i enjoyed reading about all of the shepherd children and their lives several life lessons can be learned from reading about hattie and her clan the journey of life was not a crystal staircase for this family but everyone tried to make the best of their lot which is all anyone of us can do","920":"i enjoyed the first part of the book but it somehow became a little disjointed toward the end","921":"i was a good story based around the great migration but it was hard to follow at times each chapter is dedicated to one of hattie's children or tribes and you need to keep track of the dates at the beginning of each chapter to make sense of the timeline i highly recommending watching the author's interview with oprah on youtube https youtu be nhz1clajgwc it really helps to explain the book","922":"nice book of vignettes born of hattie hattie is a hard woman whose children never felt her love the author manipulates the reader into sympathy for hattie with the first chapter from there it's hard to know who to feel sorry for hattie or her children or grandchildren the stories cover several decades reflecting the turmoil for negros in america with the adult child's relationship with hattie at its core","923":"very good book well written would highly recommend","924":"i didn't want this to end i wanted to keep reading about sala hattie and cassie the book gives the reader a glimpse into how it felt to be oppressed depressed and hopeless in the black community many years ago very eye opening and interesting the only negative was that it took me a few pages in to each chapter to feel like i knew and understood the character if that makes sense","925":"so frustrated at the hours i invested in this book trying to follow each new story at each new chapter just to have them all end up going nowhere","926":"i expeceted more from the characters and overall story especially after the interview on super soul sunday which i enjoyed with ayana describing the process of writing this book","927":"i heard a lot of good reviews of this book and of course it has the oprah stamp of approval but in the end i was a bit disappointed the novel is structured more like individual vignettes about each of hattie's 11 children for me there wasn't a strong enough common thread holding this novel together as i read on i kept hoping the author would develop the relationships among the children and provide more connections between their stories but that hope never came to fruition","928":"interesting that the reviews are so love hate i loved some of the characters in this book and felt frustrated by the format which only allows the reader a glance into a character's life before moving on to the next one as short stories some of these chapters are marvelous at franklin i became impatient with the structure but my enjoyment returned with sala's chapter so much story for 250 pages a moving novel","929":"i loved this book it took me a while to get into it but there is something about it that just makes you keep reading great characters with such depth loved loved loved this book","930":" i can't say that i didn't like this book and it's characters but i also can't say i enjoyed the read the twelve tribes refer to the children 11 plus 1 grandchild of the main character hattie shepherd she left georgia with her mother and sister during the great migration of african americans from the rural south to the cities of the north married at age 16 gave birth to her first children at age 17 buried them within the year and continued to raise children under the most brutal and discouraging circumstances hattie and her children suffer trials and tribulations molestation conflicts of sexual identity mental illness philandering father husband and hattie's own affair while hattie herself is powerless to support financially and emotionally encourage and ground her children each story they range over a period of nearly 60 years is unrelentingly desperate and sorrowful hattie herself is a bitter heart hardened woman as a story of the great migration the author makes some critical points although the wages of the factories of the north are much higher than poverty of the south many african americans who moved north weren't able to make a better life for themselves and their families they still faced poverty discrimination and the difficulties of life in a cold climate","931":"this was just an ok book i kept waiting for it to go somewhere i was disappointed in the ending","932":"i would have preferred if this was called the ten tribes of hattie definitely could have done without six and franklin's chapters but overall enjoyable","933":"great book loved the history and the contrasts between south and north the characters were a little hard to love but she still made you very interested to keep reading","934":"this book was beautifully written although it very much felt like a collection of short stories rather than a novel the book chronicles the lives of hattie's children with each chapter introducing a new child i appreciated each chapter but i wish somehow the chapters could feel a bit more interconnected you meet each child of hattie's and just as the story pulled you in it was on to the next child as a reader i wanted to know about the interaction between each child and ultimately i wanted to know more about hattie i still think this was a good book and i would recommend it i just had higher expectations for this book and i came to appreciate the book as a beautifully written collection of short stories rather than a novel","935":"a fairly simple book to enjoy","936":" i loved the writing in this book it was flavorful and imaginative and brought me right to each scenario the problem with it lies in its disjointed nature each chapter is based on a single part of each of hattie's children which made following who was who and what was happening when difficult we never got to see full character development and really feel for the full plight of each one's lives the ending tried to bring some sense of finality stitching together a couple of pieces of hattie's relationships with her children and her wisom in old age but it felt like too little too late i'm glad i read this book and glad i finished it and especially glad i borrowed it from the library and didn't pay money for it","937":"i was hesitant to give a new author a one star review but i had to do that this book was marketed so very far from what it says that i can only think that i read a different book than the synopsis is actually talking about i am going to take this point by point writing style it was written well enough for the various voices that come through but that's the only good praise i can give it there are few if any lines in mathis' writing that simply stop me in my tracks for their succinct and beautiful prosaic view of life or for their lyrical beauty it's sound writing but it's nothing that isn't already out there plot theme motif ostensibly a story of the great migration of southern blacks to the northern us states this book actually contained very little of that discussion and how it affected the children mathis instead chooses to focus on how a young mother hattie shepherd ruins the lives of her 9 surviving children through emotional neglect what is more shocking is that there are only 2 redeemable male characters in this novel the remainder are philanderers gamblers drunks and downright scamps one of hattie's sons franklin who goes to the vietnam war even goes so far as to say he has no idea why he can't just do right don't worry franklin you're in good company and there is no rhyme or reason behind any of your male siblings' maladies or trauma i am particularly frustrated with this because the book's synopsis says captured here in twelve luminous narrative threads their lives tell the story of a mother's monumental courage and the journey of a nation there is no story of hattie's courage from her children's mouths there's only page after page of the mother and father neglecting them so that when the narrative opens up from each character's view point you have a snapshot of a horrible life and are led to believe that it's because their parents didn't provide emotional love and support further there is no hattie's courage displayed at all in the way that the children discuss their mother if anything it's only contempt and a half baked love filled with ire over lost childhoods in which most of the adult children's narratives are written what was her courage to find the first boy her parent's disapproved of call him a field hand and then proceed to have 9 more children i can't even begin to say how little this book showed the journey of a nation so suffice it to say that if there were any characters that could have showed this to redeem the novel they were quickly vilified and written out of the storyline aunt pearl and her husband for example billups and his getting a hospital clerk job for example instead of discussing the juxtaposition of the life hattie previously had as a young teen in georgia the novel is a vehicle for her children to sing their depressing pains for many many pages it goes from one depraved tale to the next with little reprieve in the overall gist the icing on the cake was when hattie is with her granddaughter at the very end of the book i just about had my eyes roll out of my head this is not a tale of the great migration so much as it is the tale of a dysfunctional family's most downtrodden members i am not one who needs a happy predictable ending for every single person in a book that is meant to be historical fiction but i am deeply upset that the author seems to think that being deep and thought provoking means showing us the saddest tale with no light in anyone's tunnel and that her publisher thought it best to pass this book off as a story of a mother's courage during the great migration in mathis' book where there may have been a light or some silver lining she quickly snuffed it out with another character's soliloquy of pain for no purpose other than to fuel a novel of despair there are plenty of writers who write about difficult and harrowing historical situations that show us both the dysfunction and the beauty of humanity this book doesn't","938":"the characters were very interesting but i was left with wanting to know more about each and every one poor hattie what a sad life for her and her children","939":" this book left me with very mixed feelings with the dominant one being feeling cheated each chapter captures a moment in time for each of hattie's children and i was left feeling like i wanted to know more why or how did they each end up in that particular circumstance the assumption would be because of hattie' s parenting style i suppose but i still wanted more detail i loved the way we learned about hattie through the eyes of each of her children but again i think the story of her life in georgia would have made a fascinating story as well i gave this book 3 stars as i did enjoy it it just left me with more questions than answers","940":" this book is odd it describes the life of hattie through the stories of her children each chapter is a different child and you get the picture of her life through their individual stories the individual stories are very well written and the imagery is vivid the book wraps up beautifully and honestly as a almost 30 year old women this book makes me reflect on my own mother and how difficult it must have been on her overall a great book it challenges your view of the world as most books oprah chooses do and is very well written","941":"the further i read in this book the better i liked it for me it was the cumulative power of hattie's influence on her children that made we want to read on to the end it occurred to me after reading the entire book that i had an aunt who resembled hattie in some ways she and her husband came north from kentucky in the 1930's and her home became a way station for many members of her family over the years in addition to her own children","942":"each tribe was more miserable than the one before","943":"good character development but not much history on the great migration which is what i was after the warmth of other suns was a better witness to the migration","944":"a wrenching painfully realistic look at how traumas losses and relationship hurts can send families reeling through the years uff da one chapter per member is an interesting way to write it but nothing else about the writing dazzled me","945":"this bookwas too depressing to be enjoyable but the writing was fantastic and kept your interest i wish she had concentrated more on a few characters instead of short stories on all of the characters","946":"audiobook #2 of 2015","947":"very good read it ended too soon i could have read and read about hattie's family 4 stars","948":" functional families are all alike dysfunctional families are so in their own way the shepherds are about as dysfunctional as it gets a reflection of the immense social economic and cultural dysfunction of their time and environment this book is a microcosm of the era they lived it an amazing personal look at how one family survived barely hopefully the next generation of hattie is fairing better","949":"if you can stand the despair of the characters' lives it is a good read","950":"very good book however i think the stroy was based on her mother good book","951":"disjointed couldn't find any redeeming value in the characters and there is very little development surrounding hattie it was difficult to fill in the blanks regarding the dysfunction of her children","952":"reminiscient of james baldwin's go tell it on the mountain the book integrates the stories of several family members to create an engaging and compelling story of one's familys joys and mostly sorrows and triumphs some sections lag more than others but taken together create a great read","953":"hattie birthed 11 children and each chapter focuces on one child and also gives us information about hattie's life in the process i enjoyed the author's writing and the chapters about bell with tb and the son in vietnam were especially well written and poignant","954":"enjoyed this book it was a bookclub selection i liked the narrative from the perspective of hattie's various children the book description talk about the great migration to the north but i do not feel that is the major theme of the book but it is a good read","955":"the writing is good i can't deny that but really how this ended up an oprah book club selection i'll never understand it's not a book you read and are disappointed to see end it's not even remarkably special in any way thank god it was short read","956":" i've recently developed an interest in the great migration the movement of african americans from the south to the industrial north between 1915 and 1930 i've been reading isabel wilkerson's the warmth of other suns the epic story of america's great migration on and off for the past few months and found the twelve tribes of hattie a great fictional take on american history ayana mathis mentions warmth and its impact in interviews the twelve tribes of hattie documents the lives of 11 of hattie shephard's children one of her grandchildren and in a way hattie herself hattie moves to philadelphia from georgia as a teenager and swears to never go back through the stories of her children the reader sees a teenaged hattie grow into a mother and grandmother as i've mentioned before i'm a fan of short stories and this book felt like a collection of related short stories each chapter was dedicated to one at times two of hattie's children i loved that each of the chapters had a different feel and flow that complimented the personality of the child it focused on in the middle of the book i realized i kept trying to figure out the order of birth and how each child's story chapter fit chronologically with the other eleven even that confusion was appropriate and telling of the organized chaos of the household the point of the book wasn't to give a timeline of each child but to pinpoint a part in their lives that not only defined them but also their relationship with hattie","957":"very good but somewhat depressing","958":"agree with other reviews well written but seemed disjointed like 12 separate stories of desperation hattie had twelve children and none of them led successful happy lives didn't really like the characters hattie just kept having babies with little to no means to support them financially or emotionally each seemed to believe they lacked the power to change their circumstances despite this i think mathis is a talented writer","959":"really excellent story well written interesting and memorable","960":"i love the characters and circumstances though a craved more plot it read like short stories","961":"sorry i just didn't get what the hype was about this","962":"i read this as an e book and it seems that at some point in each chapter i kept wanting to go back to the beginning of each chapter to see what year was being represented maybe it was just my subconscious because i didn't know how to easily do that on the ipad it wasn't a big deal but every time i did it i vowed to pay more attention i enjoyed this book enough but i found it all a little too spectacular in that every individual in hattie's family had such stories to tell","963":"we learn about hattie through the lives of her children part of the black immigration from the deep south to northern states 17 year old hattie his twins as we meet her children we learn about their poverty the uselessness of her husband august and the challenges they all face interesting and well written","964":"this is beautifully written in that the words provoke imagery so vivid that you are unable to tell what's real and what is not","965":"more of a shorty story collection than a novel but well crafted each story chapter character stands on its own as well as relating nicely to the others","966":"well written and the tale of such sorrow and hardship you would think out of 11 children there would be some happiness and hope for the future","967":"thought since it was an ophrah book club book it would be good but don't bother","968":"i kept reading this because it was so well written but that's a bit like watching a train wreck because the explosion is pretty there is so much suffering in this book that it's hard to enjoy it's just where i am as a reader right now i want escape not misery glad i read it but also glad it's over","969":" you a cold woman hattie her husband august says to her there are many many types of people that i don't understand this book introduces me to several of them i don't understand hysterical women i don't understand promiscuous evangelical preachers i don't understand drunkards who ruin their families and abandon them i don't understand how anyone can be cold to their children i don't understand people who are entirely governed by their visceral impulses and completely ignore common sense as most of these characters do this beautifully written book is a collection of twelve vignettes in the lives of hattie's eleven children and one of her granddaughters each chapter follows one of the children for a short time hattie was born in the early 1900s and fled the south with her family to philadelphia in a tiny house she raises her eleven children with little help from her no account husband although most of these stories are painful they are not hopeless it was fascinating and eye opening to walk in each person's shoes for a little while","970":" this is the best book i ever didn't like i have sworn that i will never read another oprah pick her rec's are always so deep dark and depressing but i thought i'd give it one more shot as this book looked very interesting but no the novel was absolutely no exception twelve begins with a tramatic event and goes downhill from there in all hattie's children was there not one that escaped unscathed what a beautifully written terribly depressing book i kept hoping with every chapter that one of these kids ended up having a happy life not seriously goes to show how a parent can totally screw up their kids lives if you like tragic i would highly recommend","971":"the twelve tribes of hattie dedicates a chapter to each of hattie's many children and one grandchild the reader learns more and more about hattie through the lives of these people at various stages of their lives the stories are often heavy and sad not sure i would necessarily recommend it","972":"i found this to be an interesting well written book each chapter deals with the children and in the last chapter grandchild of hatti and august shepherd all the children are encountered at different ages and each has a unique voice and story to tell most of the stories touched me in some way some were difficult to read and all were sad in their own way i found the opening chapter as well as the one on ella and bell to be especially touching i would definitely read another book by ayana mathis","973":"i didn't realize how much i liked this book until it was over and i was so sad to put it down very beautiful moments characters with a lot of depth and a powerfully subtle ending","974":"a very dysfunctional 'tribe' but i really liked the writing and the structure of the book each person in the family had his or her own chapter and each chapter also covered a span of years from the 1920's to 1980","975":"very powerful words not a good structure","976":"beautiful writing each chapter and the character discussed were interesting and made me want to know more about them sadly this is not the way this book is written and i forced myself try to finish the book i felt a great lack of closure and the book was on the depressing side","977":"i loved the book it kept me interested all the way through would definetely recommend it","978":"i loved the storytelling in this book the language was so such and vivid i was sad for the characters","979":" now i waited for santa clause to deliver this book to me i was not disappointed with it it started off in the early 1920 with a young girl moving to philadelphia with her mother and two sisters from georgia she finds a husband and that is when it hits the fan she loses her twins babies at the beginning of the book too sad i cried with her after that each chapter highlights her other eleven children and one grandchild that she helps to raise she hattie has many problems and is not the kind of mother who looks out for her children this is the latest book in oprah's new book club 2 0 the second book and the second book that i would recommend to everyone so far she has done it again with her book club making new authors stars keep up the good work oprah","980":"although i enjoyed the writing this book felt more like a bunch of short stories than a novel besides having hattie as their mother there was really no plot or connection between the characters that were the focus of each chapter","981":"this was a really great read because the story was told through so many different voices perspectives","982":"loved this book the writing was beautiful without being overwrought the characters were very real each chapter covered a different child of hattie and as you met each child and heard their thoughts about their home life you gained a deeper understanding of hattie and her husband for me i felt like i really knew hattie after the last two chapters not going to spoil it for you and tell you whether i liked her or not you need to figure that out for yourself","983":" almost like a collection of short stories compelling and wonderful to read probably a bit too over the top at the end but who am i to judge i will be interested to read future novels from this author in georgia the preacher had called the north a new jerusalem all of those souls escaped from the south were at this very moment glowing with promise in the wretched winters of the cities of the north hattie knew her babies would survive though they were small and struggling philadelphia and jubilee were already among those luminous souls already the beginning of a new nation hattie was stronger than bell could ever be she didn't know how to tend to her children's souls but she fought to keep them alive and to keep herself alive they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind she felt as overwhelmed and unprepared as she had when she was a young mother at seventeen here we are sixty years out of georgia she thought a new generation has been born and there's still the same wounding and the same pain i can't allow it","984":"i had a hard time getting started just me but i hated when it ended i wanted to know more about the characters and how they were doing amazing for a first novel","985":"pretty good but not sure that it lives up to the hype each chapter is basically a short story about each of hattie's children my favorite by far was floyd","986":" the twelve tribes of hattie is a book composed of chapters that are about each of hattie's children and their experiences throughout the years specifically the majority of the book takes place during the great migration i don't want to give any spoilers away but i will say that this book will take you on an emotional roller coaster and leave you wanting to reach out to each and every character i felt compelled to give everyone a hug it would have been 5 stars if it weren't for one confusing part in the book i may need to re read the book to catch the significance of it if you want a quick read that sucks you in you may want to check this book out i checked it out as an ebook from my local library and i can't wait to get the physical copy to add to my library i will definitely will be revisiting this book again","987":"a heart wrenching story of a young woman who battled her life and the story of the affect on her children not an uplifting tale but a god read","988":"a book of depressing vignettes though the last page offers hope i kept reading waiting for things to turn around maybe read the last page first so you know the hours spent reading the book are good for something","989":"this is a good book even though it didn't really resonate with me part of the problem is virtually every single character is unlikeable the theme of the book the legacy of rage and poverty on families is told in a truthful and believable way","990":" you know what you're getting when you pick up an oprah book family dysfunction probably poverty some redemption so there is really no excuse when you're faced by these things and you find yourself somewhat disappointed mathis does a masterful job creating hattie's character surely she's offered up as our modern version of job this week we watched an nbc special on intercity poverty and violence in camden nj steve's hometown see http inplainsight nbcnews com _news this is the legacy for families like hattie's mathis offers very little hope and redemption in her novel real life backs her up","991":"a debut novel traversing the life of fifteen year old hattie shepard and the lives of her children told over the course of 57 years each offspring having their own unique relationship with a seemingly cold and loveless mother told in narratives the story reveals a precipice waiting each character and those who come into their lives","992":" the twelve tribes of hattiei read this engaging book in two sittings unusual for me i recommend it highly for those who enjoy books driven by the characters as each new character is revealed more is learned about hattie the title twelve tribes refers to hattie's eleven children and her granddaughter each chapter is devoted to the story of one of the tribes in the context of the whole family and advances the plot chronologically hattie comes north to philadelphia dreaming of a better future than the old south promised for blacks and black women but in choosing august an unambitious man and poor provider for his family as well as being a chronic womanizer hattie remains burdened by the responsibilities of caring for her children and can't gather the wherewithal to extricate them from a life of poverty and daily struggle her one chance to vault them to a better life is aborted when her lover disappoints what affected me most is hattie's lack of demonstrable warmth and love for her children without exception her offspring describe her as angry and cold but in defense hattie says her love was expressed in all she did for them on a daily basis she had insufficient time and energy for hugging and kissing","993":"geeeeeez this novel is like lemony snicket takes on the great migration i can't remember the last book i read with this little light in it","994":"mathis's relentless drive to fictionalize history can sometimes feel like shoving a square peg into a round hole but she gets points for often pretty prose","995":"i liked this book but i didn't love it the book itself revolves around hattie an african american woman married to a scoundrel husband each chapter focuses on the lives of each of hattie's children unlike olive kitteredge a book whose similar technique of loosely connecting stories around a common character was brilliantly done this one just didn't capture my interest","996":"i really enjoyed reading this book i loved getting to know hattie and to understand the depth of a mothers love and sacrifice for each of her children i loved how in the very end hattie learned to let go of the past in order to give herself and those she loved a better future","997":"this book reminds me of a series of short stories hattie is 17 when she marries a she is from a cultured family while a is not at 17 hattie has twins that get pneumonia and die she has other children but is emotionally distance to her children which twists their life's each chapter is about her child as adults many have very twisted life's because of their mother","998":"couldn't finish it nothing compelling","999":"incredible story and very sad at the beginning it was hard to follow each chapter being about a different person but i got used to it i liked it but would like amore cohesive story it seems disjointed to me","1000":"i looked forward to reading this book for a while and believe that accounts for my great disappointment upon finishing it hattie shepherd escapes rural ga with her mother and siblings only to tie her life to a man that her mother aptly predicts will be her ruin the titular tribes or at least 11 of them are hattie's children who in turn tell their story for me this structure was decidedly awkward as the narrative never gives you a chance to warm up to the characters by the novel's end i didn't care any more about them than when i started each chapter belongs to a different child and takes place in a different decade resulting in a marked lack of continuity while some of the writing is powerful the format doesn't lend itself to telling a well told story i found the twelve tribes of hattie singularly unfulfilling","1001":"thank god it ended on a positive note is all i can say","1002":"i enjoyed the writing and the characters are very vivid and three dimensional however i felt like the book was very bleak i was disappointed that there were no examples of good black men in the novel over all i think it is a worthwhile read the end was suprising heartbreaking and thought provoking","1003":"this was an amazing book that i devoured it's about a wife and mother named hattie and her children","1004":"i heard about it on npr but i didn't love this book","1005":"wow that was powerful and different a way of storytelling that feels new to me i liked the vignettes i like books with a grand scale of time that show how one lifetime can comprise so many crises and heartbreaks but life goes on and people survive and have stories to tell that said it seems incredible that one family could have as much drama as many tragedies and miseries as this one i don't know enough about the countries and eras and communities represented to say how plausible it is and i'm not sure what to make of hattie she's still mysterious aloof i want to like her respect her be impressed by her but i don't know if i could be so open if i encountered this character in real life but i appreciate that no one in this book is wholly good or bad no one is that simple or likable or hateful i'm all for recognizing the good and the humanity in people it's a good skill to practice","1006":"beautifully written and thought provoking but not a page turner that hooks the reader each chapter is a short story told through the perspective of each child of hattie i felt as if each story left me with more questions than answers which i loved but understand many readers would not i loved learning about the great migration a period in history i had not explored presented with poetic truth in this novel","1007":"my favorite new classic beautifully written a page turner each chapter draws you in in a sad way mathis ensures you will feel from the opening chapter to the very last chapter she never has to write again but i am so hoping she does","1008":"nice writing with some chapters very well done structure was a bit disjointed more like collection of character driven short stories","1009":"too disjointed for me i never felt like i was getting anywhere with this book maybe that was the point","1010":" i read this novel because it had gotten terrific reviews i knew it was one of oprah's picks and that it had been on the best seller's list the book just didn't flow the way a best seller should it was broken up into 12 chapters and each of them focused on one of hattie's children after the first chapter hattie the protagonist would be mentioned once in a while just enough to keep her in the story however she did get a lot of time in one of the latter chapters sometimes i had to backtrack never a good thing for me to check if the child had even been mentioned before confusing there was so much sadness in the book it eventually just wore me down hattie her family and her children endured so many hardships and suffered many ways i was glad to get to the end","1011":"kept thinking of the marvelous nonfiction book the warmth of other suns which followed the same time period and some of the same choices well written fiction about hattie and her children over the mid twentieth century and their struggles sacrifices and relationships lots on motherhood and scenes from long marriages","1012":" i'm giving this book 5 stars because it's beautifully heart wrenchingly written and is definitely worthy of every star this is a character driven book so don't expect a continuous plot every one of those characters are so accurately rendered that i can't help thinking that ayana mathis is a very worthy successor to toni morrison or alice walker mathis has a way of writing that is also extremely accessible unlike some of morrison's writings don't get this book expecting a uplifting read it's gritty and depressing however if you are someone who enjoys fine writing and reads contemporary literature in order to be enlightened and enriched please run out and get this book","1013":" i thought it was a good book i liked that each chapter was about one or two of her children but i would have liked to have seen more interaction between the siblings coming from a family of 10 children i could relate to the story my mother lost one child at 9 months and i would never want to feel that kind of pain i really thought for a first book from this author she did a great job you could really feel the fustration that hattie must have felt in trying to take care of that many children basically on her own as her husband was no help i could understand her resentment and her feeling of loneliness even though she was rarely alone","1014":"i truly enjoyed this it has moved me to be more sympathetic to my mother and grandmother i think we live in a time where we romanticize things too much i grew up with two hatties they weren't and still aren't affectionate but they love hard they're the only ones that love me this way so i'm grateful this book was a reminder","1015":"i greatly enjoyed this book however i felt there should have been a chapter for each of hattie's children and they should have connected to one another at the end there were so many questions left unanswered","1016":"excellent writing excellent storytelling each chapter is a short story about one character in unto itself but the stories... so utterly sad","1017":"its about how the other reviewers describe it it was definitely some powerful writing but the structure of the book made it hard to want to keep reading i'd say get it from the library before adding to ur collection","1018":" i blew through this in a 12 hour period thanks dca bos den it reminded me a bit of olive kitteridge in its structure but with writing i enjoyed better and character snapshots i could emotionally grasp in a stronger way for whatever reason the lessons being told and taught here were made more obvious but insodoing were also more thought provoking i wish there was a better tie between each of the characters rather than a more or less standalone story per child hattie but regardless enjoyed this book","1019":"i always try to figure out why the author gave a title to a book this one has to do with the children to which hattie gave birth plus one grandchild throughout her life from 15 years old until in her 60's we see how hattie takes care of her children we meet each of them in subsequent chapters each with their own story and each their own view of hattie hattie a beautiful young girl marries august who her family thinks is below her she gives birth to twins in a tiny house with a wood burning furnace her care and devotion to these babies is tender and furious and then we see how the care of each of the other children that she births plays out in a family this large one expects all kinds of drama and turmoil note the kennedy clan for example and mathis gives her fictional charges lots of drama and turmoil a first novel this is a well done and far reaching achievement in literature we will see more from ms mathis","1020":"the book was an okay read it when through 12 children of hattie and how she influenced their lives it would have been nice to see the lives of her children through hattie's eyes","1021":"this is the best book i've read in a long time the novel consists of related short stories all involving the children of hattie sheperd hattie has 9 surviving children and she is not a warm outwardly affectionate mother she does what she is supposed to do but by the end of the book i think she is just tired it is not the usual vision of black motherhood and because of this i found it very interesting and enjoyable read it","1022":"this book develops like a series of short stories that lightly tie to each other by random mentions of characters that you've previously read about i enjoy a deep dark story but man this book is just sad","1023":"need closure what happens is anyone happy in the end ugh","1024":"i am a bit disappointed i found this book difficult to read and follow while the premise of following the life of hattie and her children was a good one the story never unfolded for me the chapters were disjointed and the ending bore testimony to a hardened life i do think the author felt the story i just think it could have been constructed differently","1025":"i liked this book very much i didn't love it but ms mathis made me feel as if i knew or had met everyone in this family each chapter is about one of hattie's children but the stories take place at different time in their adult lives short stories all tied together through hattie yes they are black and i'm not and that colors no pun intended their lives but i was not aware of their skin color unless it was mentioned they are first and foremost a family with a mother who above all else strives to better their lives","1026":" this is a beautiful and heartbreaking book it is a novel but it is told as a collection of stories all taken from the complex broken and vivid lives of one woman and her family over 4 generations some have said it is a story of the great migration when southern blacks moved out of the south starting around 1915 and it is true that many of the hardships and struggles are representative of families migrating at that time but at its core this book is the story of one family and that family's unique struggles both internal and external the stories are told with a poetic voice and although the jumps through time and context are sometimes jarring the careful words and vivid imagery keep the narrative grounded the stories are replete with drama but they contain such truth that by the end of the book i was responding as if they were my family with all of the love anger and remorse that that implies to me that is the author's greatest accomplishment here that she made these stories so real and so vivid that they became my own it was a tough sell for me at first because this book exposes all the pains of the heart it is a sad book at times unbearably sad and if you are looking for vindication or tidy happy endings then it is best that you look elsewhere you won't find them here but sadness and hardship are great teachers and as kahlil gibran wrote the deeper that sorrow carves into your being the more joy you can contain that was true for me about this book and although the author does not show us many happy moments within these pages there is an understanding that we can only be this sad for people that we care about and for relationships that we cherish and because of the promise of joy maybe right around the corner or maybe here all along and we failed to notice it i could continue waxing poetic about this book but that would mean spoilers and rambling and it would keep you from going out and getting a copy and reading it immediately i will end with a thought from hattie who in the book shares her favorite bible quote from the book of job yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward when she is told that this is too depressing a thought she replies that it makes her feel like she is not alone and that too is the achievement of this book by recognizing our shared hardships the kindred sadness and grief in our lives we can also recognize the shared spark that keeps us going can see the possibility of continuing on in the face of impossible odds can see the beauty in just moving one foot in front of the other","1027":"i found it to be the most relentlessly depressing book i think i have ever read","1028":"i didn't really get this book as a bunch of short stories it was all right not very fleshed out but all put together it just didn't make sense","1029":"i was hoping for more development of each of the characters interesting technique of drawing hattie into each chapter but it lacked a conclusion","1030":"beautifully written book","1031":"i found the story sad and depressing and nothing of pleasure to take from it it passed through a large range of history and ages of the characters but nothing of relevance","1032":"i thought the book had no substance at all characters were not developed stories seemed to follow the same formula writing was mediocre and the ending was disappointing","1033":"not perfect but an excellent first novel by matthis the stories of the great migration never gets old to me and as long as the storyteller is honest with the setting and portrayals of the struggle i enjoy","1034":"well written i think the author used the technique of short stories within a novel well kinda reminded me of olive kitteridge but i yearned to know what happened with the different characters i also wished i could have read about interactions and relationships between them","1035":"a woman has 11 children and 1 grandchild they are all miserable the end","1036":"i chose to read this based on oprah's book club reputation for finding deeply thoughtful compelling books i was disappointed in the lackluster style of writing and the predictable directions of the plot there wasn't a character of true depth or complexity i gave up halfway through and regretted i wasted my reading time on this harsh","1037":"i just don't know what to say about this book honestly it had rave reviews in magazines but when i ended up reading it i just felt like there was no specific pattern for where the story was going and therefore felt like there was no resolution","1038":" the twelve tribes of hattie is a book of twelve narratives about hattie sheperd's 11 children and one grandchild the story starts with hattie in the 1920's married and orphaned at age 17 she is desperately trying to save her twins philadelphia and jubilee from pneumonia she failed due to a lack of hot water antibiotics and any knowledge of how to get help for them that loss was devastating and helped to shape her relationship with her subsequent 11 children from her early experience hattie became remote with her children and just concentrated on keeping them fed and clothed the shepard family lived with the legacy of slavery even though they had escaped to the north from jim crow their lives were no better because of discrimination poverty and poor educations it was an ambitious story for a first novel and at times got lost in the terrible lives of the children hattie was the foundation of the story and helped to anchor the narratives in the end of the book you finally see hattie attempting to soften her parenting skills with her grand daughter","1039":"favorite chapters philadelphia and jubilee floyd ella","1040":"2 28 2013 note to self remember to check that you're listening to the chunks of audio in the correct order before you begin the book i listened to the entire second half of this novel and started writing a review with only a few hesitations that something seemed odd about the book before i realized that i'd missed the first half altogether i was crabby at audible that there was no notification at the beginning of the second half that it was the second half but whatever i then listened to the first half...and found answers to my questions...and loved the book though really i would have preferred going from beginning to end mathis takes on a big job here chronicling the experiences of a large family the tribes in this case are hattie's children over almost 60 years of their lives with the backdrop of american history always behind them she does amazingly well given this challenge going from the young hattie arriving for the first time in philadelphia in the 1920s after leaving jim crow georgia amazed at the differences to hattie's son franklin's experience in the vietnam war to hattie's relationship with her granddaughter in the 1980s and everything in between each chapter is from a different person's point of view mostly her children's but also hattie's sometimes it feels a little like mathis wrote a big list of all the possible issues her characters might have to face and then checked them off as one or another of hattie's family members deals with an issue but more of the time she manages to create sympathetic flawed real characters who struggle in the world and often fail yet somehow they keep on as does hattie and do what they can to survive and keep some kind of connection with that harsh world alive sometimes mathis' writing is clunky or bland or trite and this is distracting but there are some lovely passages where she really gets it right especially when she's gotten in the groove with a particular character and his or her voice comes through clear and true i think mathis has great promise but needs a bit more confidence and experience","1041":"i liked the style in which the book was written hearing from each member of the family but not all wrapped up perfectly because when does that ever happen in real life i was saddened that simple medicine could have saved this family from a life time of sadness that poverty has lasting effects far beyond the obvious","1042":"truly enjoyed this book wanted more about each and every character i think each chapter could be is own book looking for more from ayana mathis","1043":" this is a book with a major case of the blues don't let that stop you from reading it as it's beautifully written it's the story of hattie and her children and grandchildren with each chapter focusing on a different year from 1925 to 1980 and a different character each chapter stands alone as a story and many of them are very haunting hattie the title character is flawed and hurting and all her children contain some jagged piece of that pain within them some of it comes from the racism in the society around them some of it from the dislocation of leaving the south and moving north and some of it is an echo of trauma that their elders experienced before they were born they all enact it in different ways and the author lets us into their deepest selves this is not a book that resolves anything or that offers a cheerful ending what we do experience is a deepening picture of hattie herself a woman who has held a lot of lives in her hands","1044":" set against the backdrop of the great migration the twelve tribes of hattie takes us on a journey with hattie shepherd across a span of five decades she struggles for the survival of her children the novel gives us glimpses into hattie's life through the stories of her eleven children and one grandchild hattie is a superbly well written character i have mixed feelings toward her on one hand her fight to keep her children alive and healthy in the face of poverty is commendable and on the other her dysfunctional relationship with her children may have been the cause of their troubles in adulthood in the beginning hattie is full of optimism and hope of a wonderful life with her new husband but then she loses her twins to pneumonia this tragedy is the catalyst that turns hattie into a hardened soul into someone who puts the survival of her children above everything else even above showing her love for them what i loved about this novel is that each chapter is so different yet having a common link hattie bit by bit you come to know more about hattie how her experiences have influenced her decisions and behaviour which in turn have shaped her children's lives each of the stories in this novel is told beautifully with wonderful and believable character development ayana mathis has a flair for description she describes a scene to such perfection that i can see what the characters see and smell what they do beautiful flowing words are an integral part of this novel 'the sun rose in an angry orange ball could be another earth another earth just like this one all up in flames ''she wore the same yellow dress he'd seen her in the previous evening - canary yellow bright and loud as cymbals crashing together 'another interesting ploy mathis uses is the disjointed timeline which is a bit disorienting at first but soon fades away into the poetic wisdom of her writing 'that's how the lord does us the plants are there in the field like we're here on this earth he reaches out his hand and makes them grow ''it seemed to him that every time he made one choice in his life he said no to another all of those things he could not do or be were huddled inside of him they might spring up at any moment and he would be hobbled with regret '' maybe we only have a finite amount of love to give we're born with our portion and if we love and are not loved enough in return it's depleted 'the only thing i did not like was that all the stories were so dark and depressing i wish mathis had not made her characters so helpless and incapable of turning things around having said that the ending was just perfect and heart warming especially the strength hattie exudes and how she finally understands just how much of an effect she had had on the lives of all her children 'she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind 'i would definitely recommend reading this wonderful book for lovers of historical fiction and those interested in a different view of the aftermath of the great migration recommended listening mad worldby gary jules wait it out by imogen heap detlef schrempf by band of horses","1045":" a novel that reads more like a book of short stories the twelve tribes of hattie chronicles the life of hattie from the time she moves as a 15 year old girl during the great migration of the 1920's from georgia to philadelphia told in chapters devoted almost entirely to the separate lives of each of her 12 children all quite disconnected from each other each story presents a rather tragic tale of a son or daughter tortured by their own demons and displacement all ultimately unable to flourish described as a story about the great migration i saw it more as a series of separate character portraits each vividly told in ways that made me just pause and marvel at the author's gift for language her eye for detail and her ability to immerse me the reader in the imagery of each story i reread much of the dialogue and passages for this reason and i loved the thought provoking ending despite the sadness if it all","1046":"a woman named hattie in early to mid 20th century philadelphia is unveiled to the reader warts and all through a series of short stories as told by her children and grandchildren nobody is happy everybody has their issue and hangups some all of which are blamed on hattie either outright or implied hattie is a complex character angry closed off sullen yet fiercely devoted to her children in her own flawed way i feel like i should give this book more stars because it was very well written and well structured but i just can't i found it a real slog to get through and i was relieved when i finally finished i had picked this book up awhile ago and read a bit of it decided it wasn't for me then it got picked for my book club so that's why i finished it looks like my initial impression was on target at least for me i can see why others might like or love this book but i just never got into hattie's head i get it really i do i get how i'm supposed to get to know hattie and her complex soul better and better and eventually come to understand her if not like her but it just never really happened that way i never got inside her head this is probably a great read for a lot of people but not me but i am looking forward to discussing it because i bet people's opinions will vary wildly","1047":"a well written engaging often heart breaking novel many moments of beauty but no toni morrison","1048":"a novel about a family told in individual stories about each of the members it contains love anger infidelity childbirth death drug addiction damnation and redemption a deep read","1049":"it was a novel that read almost like a selection of short stories with subtle and yet almost profound links connecting each member of the family to hattie's larger narrative this book impressed me","1050":" while reading mathis' work i came to the conclusion that it is less of a novel but more of a collection of sad depressing tales of a family's tragedies set in philadelphia a generation after the great migration hattie's life is torn at a young age by the deaths of her newborn twins not a spoiler it happens in the first chapter and you 'know' it after the first paragraph she has more children but that event colors the rest of her her husband and her children's lives each chapter focuses on a different son or daughter and how his or her life is just one dreary violent alcohol or drug filled lonely one there is one small hope but it's a long time coming taken as short stories it's just as i wrote above taken as a whole and after having read it several weeks ago i now have a different perspective the experiences of the families who moved north to escape jim crow and other atrocities in the south have rarely been written about so well instead of focusing on one person this novel examines each family member from his or her perspective sad yes tragic yes true also a definite yes however just as there was a small spark of hope in each and every family's souls who were searching for a new life a better life from the oppressive south there is also hope in this family albeit small and snuffed out over and over again in the end yes there are injuries heartbreak addiction aching loneliness a feeling of never belonging and even death but that same small spark continues to live into another generation and another and we are privy to this family's journey and as readers we too have hope for this family this tribe that it will not only survive but thrive","1051":"beautiful writing i didn't get as involved in the book as i thought i would its more like short stories","1052":"this was a fantastic book it is amazing how much you can learn about a mother from her children","1053":"this is such a book full of tragedies i found it to be interesting confusing sad and yet i am conflicted it is tough and not kind to african american lives oprah loved it me just okay i'm glad i read it though","1054":"i usually enjoy oprah's selections but this was such a downer why is every black man in this book portrayed as a gambler a drunk or a womanizer with their women forced by their circumstances to put up with them","1055":"some parts were really good other parts just left me confused and the ending leaves a lot to be desired","1056":"loosely connected stories of hattie's 12 children some stories more captivating than others but all fairly dysfunctional interesting historical background however","1057":"i mostly enjoyed this book it read more like a collection of short stories than an integrated story with each chapter dedicated to one or two of hattie's children i found myself not wanting to stop mid chapter which speaks to the author's ability to engage the reader in each character this is the first time that i've read an oprah recommend book i wonder if that designation set my expectations too high causing me to judge this book lower than i would have otherwise","1058":"good book for a new author i wanted to know more about the characters and how they interacted with each other not just hattie","1059":"this book was one of the most emotional books i have read in a long time i loved hattie i hated hattie but for anyone who is a mother we get why hattie is the way that she is we may not see ourselves behaving the same way but we get it","1060":"listened to this on audio and really enjoyed 2 of the chapters we're read by different people a little disconcerting to have 3 readers but effective","1061":"i didn't feel this book had any flow to it you never really feel like you know what happens to any of the characters appreciated the time frame it's set in but i've read other books with the same setting that kept me more intrigued overall didn't really find that it was that well written","1062":" this was a book chosen by a newly formed book group which i've joined i had never heard of it before as our first book it generated some good discussion however though it was enjoyable and interesting to read it had way too many undeveloped points and lacked focus the main character hattie had eleven children plus one grandchild she cared for the story takes place over a 55 year span with each chapter focusing on one of the children in most cases there are no backstories and no further development of what is raised the ending seems hurried and abrupt voicing sentiments on the part of hattie which have no real basis in the story the book group agreed that as a first novel it showed room for growth and potential on the part of the author finally i wonder about the title it suggests something biblical but doesn't follow through it also suggests generations but the view is on the individual and in all but one case there are no specific descendants mentioned why tribes","1063":"the twelve tribes of hattie as several reviewers before me have stated reads more like a collection of short stories or short vignettes about her children i had difficulty engaging with the story because the characters were not very well developed the prose was lovely but i wish there had been more substance to each character and even to hattie herself","1064":"interesting book wasn't sure i'd like it but i did it's basically a group of short stories all connected by one woman not a mindless read but a clever group if stories with a lesson","1065":"just wish she would have expanded the stories of each child","1066":"not exactly sure now to score this one i liked the book actually looked forward to reading it as it was not predictable at all kind of a sad book but still good","1067":" beautifully written but i was disappointed that the stories didn't come together in the end i was expecting a story about a family but this book is more of a collection of stories of individuals who happen to be related i was hoping they would all connect somehow in the end but perhaps that is the point hattie is the common thread in their lives but each of their lives is uniquely their own as a mother i can relate to hattie i cannot imagine being married to an irresponsible husband and trying to raise nine children hattie loves her family but is so preoccupied with keeping them fed and clothed she becomes unable to express her love heartbreaking i would have liked to have seen just one of hattie's children forgive her","1068":" what an incredible book not only was it well written but it dealt with some really heavy issues both in depth and very sensitively reading almost like a collection of short stories this novel gave insight not only into being black in america from the 1920s on but touched on other aspects of society and personality that people were going through at the time the intersection of issues and difficulties struck me as both hard and important to read mathis balanced out these areas with courageous people trying to find humor in difficult situations i would highly recommend the twelve tribes of hattie","1069":"i enjoyed reading this book because it brought some thing to light such as how couples stayed together when things were truly at its worst also how the kids viewed their parents in comparison to their life in adulthood this book discussed all the children and their perspective of what caused them to be the way they are but in actuality each person is responsible for their own destiny good book to read","1070":"good writing and story i wish there was a family tree in the book so i could refer back to as i read the stories to understand birth order very tragic and sad i wish there was more than a chapter on each child you would just start to get into each child's story then the chapter would be over and on to the next i would look forward to a novel by this author based on the story and character development","1071":"i suffered through this one there was no plot no characters to connect to or like way too many holes nothing that pulls this so called story together maybe the writer just needs to write short stories cuz that's what it basically felt like and i'm so not into short stories will not check out this author in the future oh and i was highly offended that hattie decided that people who had faith in god were basically dumb and naive i felt like that was some message from the writer and i was not drinkin' that kool aide give me a break you would think someone who suffered as much as her would find some humility and try god out but she stayed stubborn and miserable to the bitter end","1072":"overall a good read i liked ms mathis' style the stories of hattie's children were raw and at times difficult to read her kids were all broken in some way and this is supposed to relate directly their upbringing by a stern woman incapable of joy or affection the last chapter of the book was my favorite","1073":"the story was ok lots of sadness and depression i forced myself to finish it i was surprised oprea rated it so high","1074":"wonderfully written chapters about hattie's 12 tribes intriguing me as a reader so much that caused me to want more depth and connection between these tribes unfortunately once the author finished with one tribe his her story was never picked back up and that drove me crazy enough to withhold the 4th star from my rating","1075":"this novel is one of oprah's recommendations and it does not disappoint the central character is hattie as revealed in the title hattie is revealed to the reader primarily through her children and through the multiple narrative that spans about 60 years it is a story that is beautifully and expertly woven including profound emotion social and historical commentary religious and racial commentary as well the prose is lovely the variation in narrative style and character is sophisticated i thoroughly enjoyed this novel","1076":"can you tell the tale of a parent especially a mother by telling the tales of her 11 children and one of her grandchildren the twelve tribes of hattie does just that in a novel told in connected short stories at times it reminded me of olive kitteridge some of these stories are very powerful and all of them are well written the first story and the last three were the highlights for me","1077":"i wasn't very enthused to read this book for my book club mostly because i find oprah's book selections too depressing but i actually really enjoyed it i would recommend this woman's story to any mother or anyone with a mother","1078":"it's amazing how much you can learn from observing someone's children hattie was an amazingly strong woman that was a victim of her plight this period piece is so relative to the modern day struggle of some african american women minus about nine children","1079":"i really enjoyed this book it is broken up into separate chapters for each child and does seem like you are reading short stories but each child was so different and their stories were really interesting their mother hattie is the glue that connects them and she is has so many problems that i found it interesting how her life had such an impact on her children","1080":"not sure what to think of this one mom is overwhelmed and doesn't love her kids so they turn out to be losers hmmmmmm","1081":"i enjoyed this book it was realistic and i thought the author did a great job of convincingly telling hatties story through so many different voices i liked them all was frustrated by them felt sympathy for them angered on their behalf i can only barely imagine what it must be like to a member of a 'tribe' of 10 children with parents who are leading their own complicated lives as parts of their own tribes very well written and interesting","1082":"i liked the style of writing but it was good but i can't put my finger on it all i know is the last chapter finally tugged at me a bit don't let this stop you from reading it it might not have been my cup of tea it could be yours","1083":"a really beautifully woven novel in stories or segments reminded me why i love the form excellent read","1084":" i really enjoyed this book but had some trouble with how i should rate it i think this was an oprah book and that should surprise no one plenty of sadness and misery to go around i guess my biggest problem was that hattie had 11 children and 1 grandchild and every one of those children had a major situation with their lives coming from a large family it is my observation that yes there's all kind of history around and among us but this was just over the top i guess that's why i only rated this 3 stars although it was fascinating and well imagined it just never seemed realistic the individual stories were quite good but it stretches the imagination too far to try to accept that this is one family i think it would have been more effective as a collection of short stories anyway that's the major criticism i have which i have not been able to get past","1085":" i listened to this book it has a poetic voice rita dove quote at intro which was fresh i really like a lot of the characters but a few i'm like who are you and was lawrence or august belle's father and if the former then why august u0026amp hattie at the end of book and the ending what felt rushed more drama incest please and why two new readers after i'm on disk 7 8 yes he was great but why it broke the rhythm of the story for me u0026amp where i got lost seemed like short stories then thus the rating","1086":"to me this book shows what happens when children grow up in a home that doesn't show love very good book left me feeling sad for everyone however i did not like the ending","1087":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was everything i've come to expect from an oprah book it was heavy and mostly depressing sigh the best thing i can say about it was that it was written well i did not like how jumbled everything was we jumped back and forth between characters so i'm not sure exactly how hattie's family was laid out it would have been nice to kind of have one chapter that gave us better more complete family information and the ending was completely sad because the only way to have hope was to give up this was everything i've come to expect from an oprah book it was heavy and mostly depressing sigh the best thing i can say about it was that it was written well i did not like how jumbled everything was we jumped back and forth between characters so i'm not sure exactly how hattie's family was laid out it would have been nice to kind of have one chapter that gave us better more complete family information and the ending was completely sad because the only way to have hope was to give up on god really that was just sad but at least it was over so i didn't have to keep reading overall an ok read but not uplifting or hopeful on any level more","1088":"on the positive side i really liked the author's writing the characters were rich and well written but i kept expecting all of their separate stories to come together somehow and they never did it ended up feeling like more of a collection of short stories than a novel","1089":"one of the things i share with my mother in law other than loving her son and grandsons is a love of reading many times we have bonded over book titles so when i felt a book underneath the wrapping paper at christmas i was pretty confident she would choose a winner i was pleased to see a title the twelve tribes of hattie which i had not yet read once again my mother in law had produced a winner the book opens rather dramatically with 10 month old twins suffering with pneumonia in 1925 we are immediately thrust into hattie's world its joys and its tragic misfortunes thereafter each chapter is told from the perspective of one of hattie's children or in a couple powerful instances hattie's voice about one of her children or grandchildren in some ways these glimpses into each child's stories give this book the feel of excellent short stories but given hattie's reoccurring role in each narrative twelve tribes holds together as a full novel through these interconnected pieces we trace not just hattie's life but can look at african american history primarily urban in the 20th century \"his pain was his most precious and secret possession and six held on to it as fiercely as a jewel robbed from a corpse \"in a brave move ayana mathis doesn't provide any easy heroes in these pages hattie and her tribe s are all broken and damaged by life and the choices they make she is far from a perfect mother and her children don't rise from their lot miraculously i really appreciate that she doesn't make this story easy on us the reader \"the thing to do was to insult her or slap her or run her out into the night she'd left him with all their children she was holding another man's baby in her arms anyone would agree that he ought to do something terrible to her but she had been gone fifteen hours and in that fifteen hours his life had crumbled like a lump of dry earth \" even in the end with hattie's granddaughter mathis does not provide any resolutions to the stories we've read i found the book's ending perfectly in keeping with what had come before experiencing a sense of closure without really knowing an \"ending \"this novel put me very much in mind of elizabeth strout's olive kitteridge - interconnected stories one strong willed central woman around whom the novel branches out strong sense of place beautiful language highly recommend","1090":"this sad powerful novel tells the story of hattie shepherd who flees georgia in 1923 and moves north to philadelphia seeking a better life one of many southern blacks to do so during the great migration soon after her infant twins die of pneumonia and something in hattie breaks she and her absent husband augustus go on to have nine more children and each chapter of the book tells the story of one or two of the children the chapters span decades with large chunks of time in between and each of them is more a snapshot in time rather than a complete story life is hard for hattie and her children full of poverty and hopelessness this is not a happy book but each chapter is vividly told and beautifully written and there is something uplifting about it just the same it was a great book to listen to on cd","1091":"i liked this book a lot the writer uses a great deal of description and it mixed in some stories of the south recommend it","1092":"what an absolutely beautiful book","1093":"i really dislike oprah but must admit every book i've read from her book club lists are great books i enjoyed this book great writing sad story","1094":"this was called a novel but was more a series of individual stories about the children of hattie a black woman who moved north in the great migration the stories are of her children but there is not the weaving of these threads that would have made i think a better story throughout you get a sort of framework of the relationships within the family but it is missing a cohesiveness that i would have liked","1095":"this is an amazingly good book read it now","1096":"oprah's 2nd pick for her new book club couldn't put it down","1097":"i listened to this book i want sure i wanted to finish it but i hung in there with all the stories of the different family members some are happy some sad some puzzling i really feel there is a lot for me to learn about the lives of african americans throughout history and the twelve tribes of hattie is one that covers people in more modern times","1098":"i usually know that oprah's recommendations are tear jerkers and i have tried to avoid them because of that but this book sounded so good that i was excited about reading it unfortunately it let me down all the characters including hattie are self centered and not nice i was rooting for hattie but never got to know her well enough to really care it's definitely well written and has an interesting way of tying things together but it left me unfulfilled","1099":"this book was very choppy none of the characters were very developed and it left me always wanting to know more about them also it was very depressing so beware","1100":"i didn't care for this book it took me too long to figure out that the chapters were about hattie's kids i was hoping that there would have been more of a relationship between characters i don't know what the fuss was about","1101":"i can't believe i stuck with this one all of the way through what a waste of time","1102":"i'm not much on oprah books but this one was good","1103":"hated the ending other than that it was a great book","1104":"i loved everything about this book i read it this summer or listened to it rather as i was driving back from savannah georgia","1105":" i would have given this book 2 1 2 stars at fifteen hattie gets married leaves georgia for philadelphia gives birth to twins who die shortly after birth this starts the stories of hattie's subsequent children through the years hattie is a hard woman determined to give her children the strength and backbone to survive the hardships of life each child has his own set of struggles and obstacles the book tells the story of each child without really linking him her to the siblings the stories could have been read as stand alone short stories i would have preferred the stories to be more intermingled and to have told more history and background of the family the writing was strong but the story telling was weak","1106":" a good first effort for the writer i like the snippet way the stories were told in that format i as the reader had my own opportunity to flesh out the characters stories despite being able to do that i still felt that some of the characters were under developed i felt robbed with some stories they ended so quickly without much substance while others were packed to the gills from beginning to end in my own life experience i've met hattie and her tribe multiple times in some cases some members of the tribes were able to rise above their beginnings and create a more successful end i wish that had been the case for some of the members of hattie and her tribe even if just one of them even reading this fictional account there was the reminder that life is difficult scott peck life must be hard carrying around all that hurt anger and dysfunction but it doesn't have to be all difficult if we choose to acknowledge then make positive changes to the negative aspect s of our situations that we've contributed i'll definitely read this book again maybe not cover to cover in the order the book was published like i did this time i'll definitely recommend this read to others","1107":"really enjoyed the pace and writing in this novel...strong characters","1108":" i liked it but didn't love it which is usually how i feel about oprah's picks obviously hattie had 12 children i think it was only 11 plus a granddaughter and each chapter was about a different child and every chapter was heartbreaking in its own way i can't recommend it if one is looking for a fun lighthearted experience but if tragedy and drama are your thing then it's perfect the common element throughout the book is of course hattie and a picture of her is developed well as the reader follows her from chapter to chapter year to year","1109":" no this isn't a book i can say page turner read this one in one sitting best read a chapter per day that way you have time to digest and process story was too broken up leaves one with too many questions i hate books that don't give me a complete story hattie's life wasn't simple it was complicated things happened to make her angry she continued to function in her daily life in an angry state she passed on a legacy of frustration and anger ok i file this one under unsolved mystery","1110":"i loved how the book was written from all the povs of the children keeping track of the time periods was a little confusing since there were so many kids to remember there were a couple of povs that were not as interesting but most of them were really fun to read mathis does a great job of using many different voices each child felt different which was always important overall a great and interesting read","1111":"i couldn't get into a character driven novel listening to it while driving in the car i made it through half the discs and decided the 'story' was going nowhere and stopped heard great things maybe different with the actual book in my hands but listening to it couldn't capture my attention","1112":"i didn't care for it the ending was crap","1113":"wonderful so many lives vividly linked to the mother this book resonated on so many levels as a mother a daughter a sister i had so many moments of understanding because the writing is just definitive it transcends race and time wonderful setting everything jumps out at the reader in sharp edges every person wrenches at your heart even when you know they are so deeply flawed as to be unredeemable or are they loved it need to read it again more slowly since i just couldnt put it down over the last two days this is a book that needs savoring","1114":"this book is well written thoughtful and a book that will stick with me for a while it was heavy reading there was nothing light and simple about it and i'm glad i read it in winter while it was raining mathis did not shy away from tough topics such as death sexuality or illnesses what keeps this book from being overwhelmingly sad in my opinion is that it is written so many years after the period of time in the book i think the silver lining of the book is that the country has come farther education medication a stronger legal system and a different structure for parenting are all highlighted by their absenses in the book if you're uncomfortable about how hattie makes decisions or how her children and grandchildren live then it's because you know things can be different and that you've been raised with a different value system it also shows how making a series of decisions affects not only one person but many and can help readers realize the importance of their decisions it reads like a book of short stories especially because some of the characters' chapters are first person and some third person this is a book i'd recommend for someone looking for something with substance not something to be read on a beach or by the pool","1115":" as this is ayana mathis's first novel i eagerly anticipate more from her perhaps a reader could say there isn't enough detail the how and why of all the children and the sisters but what isn't put in depth doesn't matter what isn't written you can put together yourself and the narration will still be compelling here this book calls into the frailties of human nature relationships the desire for what is love and how it is measured and received in the animal world does the mother feed and care for her young because she has to to carry on her lineage or because she loves them a question that has plagued scientists for a long time most will say to keep her lineage going very cold and objective as for human mothers well it's just the laws of nature that say a woman no matter what her age or background loves her offspring if she doesn't then there is something seriously wrong with her putting food in the bellies clothes on their backs and a school to go to at day time and a roof and bed at night isn't enough the children want more society anticipates it she must hug them kiss them and tell them she loves them she must it is her inheritated duty no matter what she feels or thinks she sacrifices everything to them her life her dreams her fears her love her youth and she must do this willingly she surrenders herself as part of the mantra of motherhood hattie gave up all of herself to her children and her disappointments she became angry enraged hateful in demeanor even because life conspirored against her early the life she had with her mother and sisters was taken from her she aimed to start anew with a youth she could love that was shattered and broken completely from which she never really recovered when you feel joy and pleasure from the birth or a child or twins and the child dies before you there is no recovery a part of you dies with that child no amount of time brings it back or heals the wound somehow you do go on but nothing is ever right again you aren't the father husband isn't not the other children if there are any there is nothing in this world to help the mother be a mother not even books with authors trained in child behaviour pyschaircy can help a woman or a man be a parent it isn't possible but there is no method allowed for mistakes or tears from the mother if she is depressed by her child she needs a cure there are laws for the unborn baby against the mother but no laws for the mother against the baby because that is seen as unnatural what is a child demanding demanding to live and to have love when does the child see that the parent as another human being such as itself sometimes the child even in adulthood never sees it hattie was expected by her children to be all of a god on earth in the end there was a reckoning of a kind all in all a very fine book you leap in and don't want to leap out","1116":"lost interest in the last few chapters i would have preferred more about hattie","1117":"this story is told through the eyes of the children of hattie descriptive gritty interesting perceptive and informative i really liked this one","1118":"why can't i bring myself to love the oprah books it was alright","1119":"i really don't like this book it is so sad but yet i can't put it down like someone else said in their review it's more like a collection of short stories than a novel there is little connectivity between the story lines each character seems to have a sadder story then the last i guess you might say i was intrigued by the story but i did not like i would not recommend this book if you are looking for a happy read","1120":"really tough to get through this book didn't grab me not sure why","1121":" the twelve tribes of hattie is a beautifully written novel about hattie shepherd mother of 11 children hattie became a mother for the first time at the age of 17 and her last child was born in her 40s we view her transition from a young mother full of love and hope for her children to a distant figure who remains an enigma to her children the book reads more like a collection of short stories with each chapter focusing on one or more of hattie's children hattie is the common thread but remains as a background character in many of the chapters although i wanted to love this book short stories are not my favourite form of literature so the structure detracted from my enjoyment however this is a profound book with tales of tragedy and hardship there are many readers who will cherish it","1122":"i enjoyed the author's writing style but the story itself seemed disconnected characters you would like to see evolve only appeared in one chapter","1123":"had a lot of trouble getting into this book i appreciated the context felt the weight of all the history but the characters didn't sway me and i found it easy not to commit with the short story format i would generally not recommend this","1124":" is it enough for a mother to simply insure that her children survive are safe and fed and grow into adulthood or is there some unwritten rule that requires her to nurture and cuddle and fawn over her children with affection and love in order to fulfill her role as their mother early on young hattie loses two little babies despite giving them her love affection and devotion which in the end proves to be not enough to save their sick little souls for the remainder of her life hattie does what is necessary to keep her nine other children alive not by nurturing them or fawning over them physically but by struggling to provide them with food and shelter and trying to keep them out of harm's way \"she didn't know how to tend to her children's souls but she fought to keep them alive and to keep herself alive \"the twelve tribes of hattie is a story of a strong determined woman who faces tragedy misfortune disappointment and pain and who when given the opportunity to run away from all of her problems and finally find some happiness in her life realizes she cannot leave her children behind her sense of duty as a mother albeit a stern and harsh one trumps any personal sense of comfort or repose that running away could give her she was destined to live a life of sacrifice for her children each of her children doing whatever was necessary to make sure they survived","1125":"very boring not at all what i expected","1126":"brillant bursts of writing throughout this book that left me wanting to know read more about each of the characters and their experiences like others have mentioned wished for more connection between and among the stories of the different characters","1127":"each small story left me wanting more and my imagination is buzzing with all the ways the members of this family could connect and continue the tale i liked the way the author made the characters deep and understandable even when not likeable with relatively few words","1128":" the twelve tribes of hattie is a well written saga notable for its eccentric characters and unconventional presentation though the writing is rich there is a palpable hardness to it that flavors the narrative throughout the genesis of which is hattie's loss of her twin babies in the first chapter from there the story focuses on this family's struggles with poverty infidelity and disappointment ms mathis's characterizations are sensitive and believable her rendering of cassie's mental illness toward the end was especially brilliant and the author's subtle critique of religion and its effect on her characters' lives was courageous and accurate even though as many reviewers pointed out the chapters are almost self contained stories with little bearing to one another there was enough of a thread to keep it all connected and flowing that combined with the superb writing kept my attention until the end","1129":"this is a woman's book unlike the title character i am neither black nor from the south i did not live through the bleak everyday realities of many of these characters but i recognize them with the familiarity of family hattie is my mother and myself","1130":"this novel is really a series of vignettes about a family it is heartbreakingly sad but fascinating it is different type of novel it doesn't have a central plot it travels through snippets of hattie's children's lives","1131":"excellent excellent story great thinking and loved the history jaunt social class stigmatism throughout the years i really liked hattie and her strong character despite life's hardships and what she was dealt she dealt with strength at times yet not forgetting her hardship's and even portrayed melancholy emotions despite her strong character depiction she had a big heart","1132":"i liked it but i didn't love it it was okay for me each chapter is dedicated to one of hattie's children due to this i felt like i was reading small individual stories and not one main story that worked for me in elizabeth stout's olive kitteridge but it did not work for me with this book the writing is very good some of the stories powerful but in the end it just did not move me and i really didn't really care enough about any of the characters","1133":"a little hard to follow all the characters but an interesting story","1134":" when oprah declared that the twelve tribes of hattie was her selection for her book club i knew i had to read it i had just finished reading proof of heaven a book that she recommended when interviewing the author dr eben alexander it wasn't one of the best books i have ever read but it was interesting when i started reading this book i immediately loved the authors writing style i was captivated by hattie's story but i kept feeling more and more lost as each chapter continued i was very disappointed when i ended the book i felt like all the time that i had invested was lost needless to say i do not recommend this book each chapter takes place in a different time period told from the point of view of a new character each time it is very disjointed i like the concept of the book in theory but not in practice sorry i am going to have to give this book two stars","1135":" i read this because i joined oprah's book club and this is the first book they're reading i kept waiting to be inspired i never was from the way the book is written each chapter is focused on a different character usually many years after the chapter character before it to just how overall depressing this story is i just couldn't love it i wanted to but i couldn't i don't even understand the title i thought it would end up being about how many children she had but she only had 11 i just find it hard to understand or relate to someone who has that many children and can't ever find a moment to smile or laugh never finding a moment to be joyful then i thought maybe i would get more of an insight into the life that southern blacks lived in the 1920's not so much of that either a little but not enough is the book well written other than the format yes it's well written but that's really the only good i have to say about it would i read it again only if i decide that i need to be more depressed one day","1136":"this book was well written but pretty depressing hattie is angry and cold and her kids are unhappy the male characters cheat and drink too much and the females are damaged i can't think of any happy parts maybe that's the message","1137":"wow oh wow when i saw that oprah had started a book club on goodreads i was mentally jumping up and down in excitement after joining about a week ago i would go in to the group everyday to see if any discussion had started as i really wanted to read this book along with the group seeing as now that i am middle aged the ole memory just dunt cut it you know what i mean lucy finally yesterday i just could not wait any longer and ordered the ebook from amazon thinking that i would just read the first chapter while hoping that the book club would start the discussion soon but oh no the discussion still has not started and once i started the book i just couldn't put it down i see my mother and myself in hattie you know how you can see things in your mother as a child and tell yourself you will never be like that or do that and once you become a mother you find yourself saying and doing the same things she did of course i am at an age where i now realize some of those things are not so bad my mother and hattie are strong women nothing of which to be ashamed hattie was like a lake of smooth silvered ice under which nothing could be seen or known the characters in this book are just bouncing off the pages i can see this as a movie and possibly oprah playing the part of hattie but more importantly what i want is a sequel i need to know more about these people please ms mathis tell me more tell me more","1138":"i would have loved an actual story line and more character development i kept reading because i wanted to find out what the ending was going to be","1139":"a brilliant piece of work in the spirit of toni morrison an acknowledged influence on the author full of poetry and truth and while it may lend itself to a feminist or ethnocentric reading it is too good to be interpreted in such narrow ways it is really the story of how hard it is to know what is for the best but as long as we have the interests of others at heart we might not be far wrong and that love and self sacrifice might actually be the same thing","1140":"twelve chapters of dismal characters i know you're meant to feel for these people but i just felt morose and depressed not my cup of tea","1141":"i'm so glad i read this book despite so many less than glowing user reviews here oprah recommended books are usually pretty depressing and although life is not rosy for the characters i thoroughly enjoyed the story the characters are vivid and hattie is at the center of it all one of my favorites","1142":"my first reaction was hmmmmph not sure what to make of this book each chapter was a 'stand alone' some better than others all about hattie's eleven children and her their struggles ok with some great passages and chapters but overall not great","1143":"i truly tried to love this book while each chapter was well written i felt the book did not flow together until the last chapter by then i just felt sorry for each character not one child chose to better their lives they all knew they missed out from nurturing parents specifically their mother but no one chose a better life so sad","1144":"this book was very deep and emotional the stories of each of hattie's children as well as her own interwoven throughout was very unique and deep i liked it a lot i felt like finding out all the stories of my grandmother's kids and understanding our history deeper great read","1145":"would make an excellent book club choice the reader's guide asks provocative questions","1146":"dec 6 actually will read the electronic version on my ipod so while the hardcover has 256 pages my version has 1 125 pages hmmm march 5 having trouble getting through this book it is a collection of short stories and nothing propels me to the next story each chapter individually is well written and i enjoy them when i read them but i just keep putting it down feel bad giving up at this point only have 3 stories chapters left march 9 finished this book yesterday finally i enjoyed the writing but this book was basically just a collection of short stories about hattie's kids and i just really couldn't get interested in seeing how the stories progressed glad to be moving on","1147":"i loved this book ayana mathis is an amazing story teller i hope she writes her next novel quickly","1148":"this is a book that begins with promise and although you've read the info on the book jacket and know how the first part ends you are still hoping for a better outcome then the second part comes along and you wonder who is this fellow and where is hattie at the end i wondered what the author's purpose was what were we supposed to learn this was a jerky jumble of characters and events that left me in a dull apathetic haze","1149":" this was a weak two stars for me this is basically a novel in name only merely a handful of disjointed stories with multiple points of view about people connected by last name only yes there's some powerful writing but it's done without purpose and structure there's nothing more frustrating than reading a 300 page book that adds up to nothing the author introduces hattie and subsequent children but each character is discarded along the way in this novel that actually says very little about the great migration lugubrious reading indeed","1150":" 3 stars what i did not like another momma done her kids wrong again story and therefore they grow up to be dysfunctional adults unable to cope with society can't anyone write a book about a great wonderful giving thoughtful and loving mom or aren't there any in today's society also each chapter is almost like an individual short story - we meet a specific child usually of adult age in the chapter learn about him her and their emotional liabilities and then never encounter them again a family that didn't play pray together and definitely didn't stay together what i did like ms mathis can describe the most pitiful situation with the most beautiful prose i have read in a long time you feel the emptiness the children suffered ... you hear the congregation answer preacher six ... you smell the smoke and liquor at the gambling tables etc etc and through it all you live the very emotional life of hattie from the 1920's through the 1980's a wretched life but one that probably was somewhat lived by many","1151":"this was an okay story but not one of the best i've read i usually expect better with oprah's picks this book was more like a bunch of short stories telling about all of hattie's children but i didn't really get any closure from reading this book like i do with most really think this could have been made into a great book but seemed disjointed imho","1152":"you would think the odds would be in favor of a woman with 11 kids that at least one of them would have a good life apparently being an oprah's book club pick puts those odds in the dumps i think i wanted to like this book because it made me think of things in a way i never had before but after i finished i was kind of angry with it it is pretty rough reading for sensitive readers","1153":"not an uplifting story but a well written one found myself always waiting for some good to come","1154":"incredible","1155":"i was pleasantly surprised with this one liked it more than i thought i would downfalls 1 i did find some of it a bit disconnected 2 on my nook there were highlighted sections that were footnotes to oprah's commentary really never saw that before and hated it so distracting","1156":" an interesting account of a black woman who moved from georgia to the promise of philadelphia escaping racism and poverty unfortunately she brought poverty with her as her husband never had a regular job and she had 12 children her first children a set of twins died and this caused an emotional death inside of her which had ramifications in her treatment of her children the book is divided into chapters featuring one of her children which is a treatment i don't particulary like it makes it hard to see how the actions of one affected the others when only read from that person's point of view","1157":" there is a lot of good storytelling in this book about hattie and her children and grandchildren over the decades as standalone stories which each chapter is broken up in they are very well written the problem with the book is it doesn't pull the stories together too well which is what the book sets out to do due to the loose structure of the book you are never really able to get involved with one character too much even hattie who is obviously the books central character because of the inability to invest in the people in the book names timelines family threads are almost frustrating to try and put together the book tries very hard to be something and there is something there but it seems like it needed some tighter editing before being released","1158":"well written but depressing","1159":"a short book and a quick read but each chapter packs a punch the book travels from 1925 to 1980 and each chapter is the voice of one of hattie's children and eventually her grandchild i was mesmerized by each of the stories and how her family struggled in different ways with various problems including poverty religion mental and physical illness gambling and hunger among other things by the end you get a pretty clear overview of what it was and probably still is like to grow up poor and african american in the u s","1160":" at least i can say i finished an oprah book club read it's interesting and an easy read i usually like some historical fiction too but it's a 'debbie downer' kind of book that starts with her twin children dying lots of bad things happen in life but it seems the unattached nature of hattie to her future kids and the impact on them really hit home in the book while the final lines of the book appear to have hattie finally rubbing her grandchild's back and giving emotional comfort i'd rather read a more uplifting book with characters who are more resilient and who i would admire for getting over the bad things life can sometimes throw at you","1161":"this book was beautifully written","1162":"really enjoyed this book each chapter was like a new short story and the book was threaded together by one central character hattie mathis is a poetic writer i often reread her powerfully written sentences so that i could be sure that i was digesting them in a meaningful way i look forward to more books from mathis","1163":"i liked this book although i agree with many of the reviews that it was a struggle in some places i nearly gave up but glad i didn't some of the chapters are so well written and you really felt the struggle with some of the characters anyway i would urge people to carry on to get an insight how awful it must have been to live in fear during those times","1164":"a truly life changing book about the great migration","1165":" i feel like i should be giving this novel a higher score than 2 5 solely because it was extremely well written but i feel that would be disingenuous because i really didn't enjoy the content of the book oh hattie how could someone have some much misery befall them and their family i guess when you put any family's life under the microscope you'll be able to dig up their miserable dirt on the same scale but what i don't understand is why an author would want to make the central theme of their work inescapable unhappiness we never get to see those shining moments between hattie and lawrence that bell mentions or find out if pearl ever gets the family she longs for it is true that life is not happy that there are hardships around every corner but hope also exists and i wish we would have seen a bit more of it in these glimpses into the lives of these characters if you enjoy a fairly bleak read i'd recommend this to you though you may find yourself needlessly depressed by the time you finish the last page","1166":"i found this to be a quick enjoyable read that left me frustrated and wanting more at some points but satisfied over and a nice compliment to the warmth of other suns which i read last year and loved this is when i wish there were half stars i would have given it a 3 5 but rounded up","1167":"did this on audiobook because the readers were awesome this just wasn't that interesting to me none of the characters except hattie really stay with the story you are introduced to them find out their story then they go there is however some great writing hence the 3 stars","1168":"it was a very good story and it displays how the siblings were all so different and lead different lives even though they all came from the same parents and the same house each chapter is dedicated to a different sibling it would have been a better story if at the end they all came together but instead the story shows a tired african american mother trying to do her best","1169":"enough has been said about this book the prose are beautiful and the characters are stunning problem the ending i turned the page expecting more and ended up with acknowledgements it felt very unresolved that's one of the problems with literary fiction while hattie has some insight that hints at some internal resolution it is very understated otherwise it's a beautiful read","1170":"this was a great story of a big family through decades told from multiple perspectives parents children outsiders i loved how each chapter was different but they wove together i also really enjoyed the language of this book very descriptive beautiful use of metaphors but not overly verbose","1171":"the author can write but the material was unnecessarily dark not that these things don't happen but why fill the book with it i didn't want to finish it and ended up skimming by the last chapters","1172":"three stars for the fact that this might be the most depressing book i've ever read each chapter covers a different child that miserable hattie gave birth to and chronicles their miserable adult life that it is clear came from being raised by a miserable mother","1173":"this book was somewhat disappointing each of these stories was interesting on its own but the overall book lacked cohesiveness i feel like there were too many details left unsaid i've read books that tell a story through multiple characters before but when they work they also reference each other as the story goes this would have drawn it all together a few of the stories stood along as a great short story but i think it just fell flat","1174":"great pick oprah i was initially a little embarrassed to be toting around a book bearing the big oprah's book club logo but i soon got over it because the twelve tribes of hattie is just great the stories of each of hattie's twelve children are told over a period of about sixty years and the narrative thread linking each of these stories is hattie who does her best to raise her kids though at times she has very little love to give though she arguably makes more than a few mistakes as a mother due in large part to her pride but also to her poor taste in men hattie is one of the most admirable female characters i have encountered but the book is mostly about her twelve children who in various ways illuminate the different kinds of lives that became possible in a country that changed rapidly between the 1920s and 1980s for better or for worse they are very much their mother's children and they as well as hattie must deal with the consequences of that","1175":"this was good but depressing the writing was lovely and the style was creative the story is told through pieces of 12 people's lives but still forms a coherent and captivating story the only problem is most of the 12 people and hattie and her husband who aren't among the 12 are broken living what seem to be very unhappy and unfulfilled lives some seem to be moving toward happiness but no one in the book ever really gets it i get that it isn't supposed to be a happily ever after fairy tale but i refuse to believe all these kids are doomed to happiness because their mother was unhappy like i said depressing","1176":"i can't quite decide why i didn't like this one more her children seemed to have many issues i did like hattie but it is hard for me to relate to someone who doesn't show her love and affection to her children","1177":"this is a completely absorbing beautifully written work which put me in mind of both the novels of toni morrison and the plays of august wilson yet ayana mathis' voice is hers alone it is a lovely fictional complement to isabel wilkerson's masterful history of the great migration the warmth of other suns","1178":" it's taken me a few days to really think about what i wanted to say on this book i have to agree with a lot of the other people that have reviewed this yes ayana mathis is a good writer yes she writes some pretty powerful stuff here but did i like this book well no not really each chapter felt so incomplete and such a sliver of the story sometimes names pop up again and sometimes they don't it's like peeking into someone's house that you don't really know listening to a conversation and then closing the door again and going on about your life when starting each chapter i felt relatively confused on what was going on only knowing that the main character was a child of hattie or assuming for the most part until that was pinned down then you spend the rest of the chapter hoping that mathis at least ties things up for this character which ultimately doesn't happen i like the idea of what mathis was trying to do here but i think to give the reader some closure for each character besides hattie she would have had to write an entire book for each child one question i wondered was how did she have so many children with mental illnesses or other faults because really it seemed like many of her children were unsuccessful at life save for maybe floyd and billups maybe but again not enough detail is that biological or a result of their upbringing nature vs nurture in the end you do realize that hattie is a strong woman possibly even compassionate in her own way but strong enough to get through her troubles and the hurdles that life presents to her and you realize that she will continue on that way","1179":"this book is really great i didnt want it to end i would love to know what happens to the future generations of this family one thing that i did not care for were the notes from oprah i read this on kindle so all of the underlining and links were very distracting and didnt add anything to the experience","1180":"i think hattie should have stopped at 3 or 4 tribes","1181":"tragic but beautifully written novel with an intriguing set of characters","1182":"i enjoyed this read but only gave it 3 stars because i didn't like any of the characters hattie was a cold mother and not one of her children were either likeable nor believable i found it hard to accept that not one of her kids had a happy or even somewhat normal life very sad and depressing","1183":"this book was beautifully written and really made you think it was slow but it was powerful not my usual fare but i enjoyed it","1184":"wanted very much to love it but didn't even finish it","1185":"the story was too erratic for me i didn't feel like i knew hattie well enough i got snippets of her kids but not enough to really get to know any of them either i feel like we're supposed to get to know hattie through her kids but i didn't feel like hattie was a main character in any of her kids' accounts","1186":"a little disjointed felt like short stories with a common theme they all had a bad mother i was not a hattie fan difficult to feel sympathy for her she was a cold hard woman","1187":"excellent book of interweaving stories creating the big picture loved it i read it in almost one sitting","1188":"some lovely figures of speech and an interesting format clever and creative the characters are sterotyped and that was a disappointment not as exceptional as the reviews led me to believe a disappointment","1189":"painfully moving book it broke my heart 12 times","1190":"i had such high hopes for this book and my hopes were not disappointed until the final third of the text when everything just fell flat and fell apart the writing is excellent mathis has a great feel for dialogue however it seems like she ran out of ideas or just didn't know how to finish incredible concept talented writer i'll look for her sophomore effort","1191":"as a social worker towards nearing the end of the book i realized that this book speaks to the generational effects of trauma hattie's early decisions defined her life i enjoyed the read and being reminded of the massive impact that spur of the moment decisions can cause this book also does a good job at presenting one's strength in weakness","1192":" i seriously enjoyed this book first lest talk about the writing poetic lyrical exquisite all the characters are thoroughly realized and tremendously flawed especially hattie i neither loved hated her nor liked her but i was concerned about her she'd experienced many heartaches and disappointments the themes in the book were very poignant and thought provoking the jumping of perspective and time didn't bother me in the least i thought it was a particularly effective device to show the scope and effect of hattie's decisions as a person and a mother","1193":"i'm always amazed that author's can write so convincingly about eras from long ago and this book is a superb example of that","1194":"i really liked the writing and the story was compelling from beginning to end very insightful about the struggles many black families faced during the great migration even though this was a work of fiction it gave another perspective to that part of history","1195":"a good book an oprah book club choice but not nearly as deep or preachy as several of her others","1196":"i will give rating 2 8 of 5 stars it is really under my expectation a few chapter iam enjoys to read it but then the others getting boring i can't found any excitement when the story is end hmm","1197":"3 5 full of emotional moving and heartfelt stories however it lacked the continuity necessary for a cohesive novel hattie's character wasn't developed enough to tie all the stories together it may have worked better as a collection of short stories","1198":"this one is hard to rate it was very well written and compelling but horribly sad it is about an african american woman who moves north in 1925 to escape racism and has 12 children each chapter is from the perspective of a different child which i didn't think i'd like but i ended up enjoying unfortunately every single story was heartbreaking perhaps that is realistic but themes were anger disappointment and unmet expectations men were most often the cause for these themes at the end hattie does seem to let her anger go and find some peace but at great cost so very good book but don't plan on feeling uplifted there was likely little uplifting for these folks at this time","1199":"5th book of 2015","1200":"engaging although sometimes a bit long i enjoyed that each story served as a story on its own although i would've liked if the other stories were a bit more intertwined","1201":"the forest chapter started out interesting and them this book went quickly downhill from there so far i have been very disappointed in the oprah 2 0 boom club picks","1202":"very well done each chapter gives you a view of one of hattie and august's children hattie's fierce but unobvious love for each and her struggle to give them basic needs such as food and clothing","1203":"this book started off with promise the first chapter was engaging the second chapter went off on a tangent and by the third chapter i had lost interest characters are introduced and you continue reading with an expectation of them being incorporated soon but that doesn't happen until the end after i finished reading i closed the book looked at it and said huh this was the third and last book i've read from oprah's book list all of them had themes of sadness depression and abuse not appealing to me in the least","1204":"although i am giving up on this one without finishing it i feel like i can still give it a 2 star rating although well written it was dreary and i couldn't work up any concern for any of the characters","1205":" this book takes place over the course of a life of a black woman who grew up in the south but moved with her family as a teenager to the lesser oppression of the north each chapter is marked with a date and the name of the individual for which it is about the dates ranges from the 1920's to 1980 the first chapter is about hattie the rest are about her children i enjoyed looking into this culture both that of african americans and the culture of poverty and how it impacts the lives of this family and the choices they make though the content was interesting it was not always fascinating there were definitely times i lost interest in the book there were also moments when i had trouble putting it down in the end it was worth the read","1206":"loved this book wonderfully written with very insightful prose","1207":"anyone who knows me knows that i hate everything oprah as a 30 something female i know i'm not supposed to say that but ive never liked her and i especially dislike her book club selections that being said the category read one of oprah's book club books made me cringe when i saw that as a topic for my 2016 challenge i have found her books to be highly centered around sad abused women not my preferred character type so needless to say i was not looking forward to this category i found that i had listed the twelve tribes of hattie on my to read list and discovered it was one of oprah's book club recommendations as well so my choice was made and i'm so glad i read it centered about the life of a sad abused woman of course the twelve tribes of hattie is told from the perspective of hattie's 12 children each chapter tells a different child's story and reading the story was almost like putting a puzzle together the stories are sad funny inspiring and engaging i debated for a couple days about 4 vs 5 stars but i settled on 4 because i reserve 5s for my top 10 type books i think this would create some great book club discussions as well","1208":"liked the character but the story is a bit obvious","1209":" in this book we meet a family tied together by mother hattie who at fifteen years old left georgia to live with august and bear him a mottly bunch of children scarred by the deaths of her first babies young twins who die of pneumonia she finds it hard to show her children love and many of them struggle as they grow up the author is very talented and the stories themselves are vibrant and alive and sparkle with each character just for me i hate the short story concept and it felt strung together i would have preferred a more fluid novel and would have enjoyed the continuation of hatties story i so loved her story and it took me more time to figure out what was happening with the children and who was who","1210":"this book was all over the place it seemed like a bunch of short stories all piled into one with only 1 character showing up in all the stories but even then she didn't really play the same role all the time","1211":"not too fond of short stories that have no connection in the end its not literally a short story but like someone wrote in their reviews each chapter is devoted to one or two of hattie's children and after they get that one chapter they're mostly abandoned for the remainder of the novel the book is well written but i found it hard to like any of the characters and hence the 3 stars","1212":"i loved this book and felt an instant connection with almost every character as a white woman from the south i can tell you that several scenes in this book made my blood run cold it's hard for me to reconcile in my mind the way things used to be with the way i like to think they are today great read","1213":" gorgeous but wildly inconsistent it's a marvelous first novel in that it shows flashes of tremendous promise but displays some weaknesses as well part of my sense that it wasn't quite what it was blurbed to be may have stemmed from the blurbs itself which i do think oversell the novel it's very much a story of one familial dynasty more than a masterwork examining race in america and the stories that incorporate more conventional tropes franklin with the vietnam narrative alice and billups fell flat for me they seemed almost trite in their beats i also felt central questions about hattie remained unanswered this was perhaps intentional but i wanted to grasp her at the end to see her story in its full scope and i never did some of the other stories though wow wow floyd six bell these were masterful the ruthie story and its connection to bell broke my heart mathis is an incredible writer her prose is immaculate and i loved the individual sentences enough to pause over them can't wait to see what she writes next there are flashes of morrison here and perhaps the next book will equal the hype","1214":"what a disappointment makes me not want to read the next oprah 2 0 book le sigh","1215":" ugh started out interestingly hattie's story i loved the perspective of a black girl moving from the south to the north in the 1920's as she observed interactions on the sidewalk expecting the violence and anger she would have seen in the south and being surprised by the lack thereof in the north it started out so good i only read the next two chapters after that her first son is a traveling jaz player who obsesses about sex continually male female whatever his mind and body are controlled by sex little story with him and a lady and then him and a young man ugh done next chapter the son who is deformed due to injury starts on the road to being an evangelical in a tent revival circuit not sure that he actually believes anything just is good at preaching reminisces on his childhood causes a faith healing and of course has sex with the daughter of the woman he healed so done unfortunately i did not find any uplifting or redeeming qualities in the characters i am not interested in wading through the filth to get to the end and hope there is some sort of decent message it had such potential and then just went downhill","1216":" it took me awhile to finish reading this book mainly because there wasn't much thread woven throughout to keep me connected by the 4th chapter i realized each new chapter was a whole new story and had very little or nothing to do with the chapters previous obviously this was the structure ayana mathis wanted for her novel so i respected it what i will say is the main reason why i continued to pick the book up was the eloquent writing ayana mathis is a master of language she knows how to bend and break and put words together in a way that just moves you it didn't seem like a novel more like a collection of essays but i relished in the writing so that's why i gave it 3 stars","1217":"i was drawn in by the first chapter but disappointed by the rest i wanted more of hattie not her dysfunctional children","1218":"this book is divided into 12 chapters with each chapter being told by or about one of hattie's children the stories were well written and kept my attention but were only connected through hattie after the one chapter that character was not heard from again this left me wondering about how things turned out for each character but we never find out each story is depressing and tragic hattie has a lot to deal with poverty a womanizing husband and too many children to care for she loses the ability to be loving and tender her children suffer because of this hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind just too dysfunctional and depressing for more than two stars","1219":"i opted to read the book because of the ny times review not the oprah book club seal of approval and i am glad that i did mathis is an elegant intelligent and straight forward writer she chronicles the experience of one pretty impoverished black family over 55 years through the mid 20th century the novel is really a series of 12 interconnected stories outlining the lives and travails of the 11 children of hattie and august as they try to come to terms with life poverty and america mathis captures the brutal power of racism during the 20th century and its dehumanizing impact i was especially struck by a brief vignette where hattie's sister and husband had to ignore and accept a vicious round of race baiting by a trio of ignorant white men just to stay alive this scene is not central to the story but it is powerful and memorable and there are plenty of moments like it in this fine debut novel ideally oprah makes mathis a rich woman who can afford to write more great narratives in the future part toni morrison and part august wilson mathis is the real deal","1220":"a sweeping family epic of hattie and her large family of children and one grandchild each chapter documents one child's life and some are more compelling than others but the book is well written and hattie is especially sympathetically depicted","1221":"the 2nd book i've read from oprah's book club and just like the 1st i was not impressed it was a sad story but i kept waiting for it to gain momentum but was disappointed the character development was well written but once a character was introduced there was no further reference to them wouldn't recommend it","1222":"this was not really a story but every chapter was a short story and the chapters had really nothing to do with each other some of the stories were good but not a big fan of this type of writing","1223":"the first chapter set in 1925 was intriguing and emotional it gave the book potential the second chapter set in 1948 went into a topic i would rather not read about or even think about i only read to page 27 but that's enough for me i know there are other books i will enjoy much more","1224":"it took me way too long to finish this i'm usually a book in a weekend kind of person if it takes me weeks then it's you not me","1225":"amazing writing sad story that is the best summary i can give written almost as a series of short stories but all tied together by being about the same family","1226":"i gave up reading my kindle copy with oprah's notes kept getting stuck in her notes and then i couldn't find my way back i was struggling with the book anyway and i'm afraid this gave me an excuse to quit and i never quit a book","1227":"an extraordinarily moving first novel by ayana mathis ella franklin and hattie will remain in my spirit","1228":"an earnest attempt but falls short in the brevity of each chapter thus the shortcomings of character descriptions the ending again rang true to the author's gravitation toward incompleteness and brevity","1229":"disjointed came together at the end more of a collection of short stories than a novel actually this was a pretty depressing book for me so much unhappiness and regret","1230":" this book disappointed me although i have liked oprah's recommendations in the past this book was not a favorite it is the story of hattie shepard who came north to philadelphia from georgia in 1924 and her 11 children and one grandchild thus the twelve tribes hattie faces a lot of difficulties in her life including poverty and a husband with a wandering eye who is not a good provider the book is divided into 12 chapters each told by one of the children this makes it hard to follow since each narrator has a different point of view and information given by each child is incomplete the chapters appear in chronological order starting in 1925 and ending in 1980 hattie is in each chapter and her life story is told in pieces by each child i saw some similarities between this book and the color of water by james mcbride a memoir about his mother who raised 14 children in poverty in new york city the reader sees that hattie loves her children but they are not always convinced of her affection","1231":"honestly i was excited to read this book because it was on the top of the list of oprah's book club but it was just ok the story was about hattie's twelve children the different chapters talked about each of them individually and how their life turned out after being raise in such a large family with no money due to their parents being pretty dysfunctional their was very little love given by hattie to their kids i was hoping for a miracle at the end that they would go out in the world and do good things nodda the end was just the end of the book","1232":"i'm so torn with this review i really wanted to love this book i wanted to be moved beyond words i wanted to place it on my 5 star favorites shelf and my want to re read shelf i wanted to put my kindle down and think to myself that was as good as the help or water for elephants can't do it sorry it is not a bad book but for me lacked the depth it had so much potetial for each chapter equals one character giving them their day in the sun and then they are done for me this felt so dis jointed and fragmented i found myself half way through each loooooong chapter before i figured out who the character actually was and what their part amounted to sad to say the very last chapter the ending was the book's saving grace in my eyes it kind of sorta brought it all together","1233":"i ended up really loving this novel i did however have to get into the book a while before i began to truly enjoy it apparantly oprah was hooked at line 1 that didn't happen for me but once the story started rolling i really got into the characters and the ending was incredible give this book a chance if you don't love it immediately stick with it i also appreciated being introduced to a great new writer","1234":"where to start this was beautifully written but abrupt the characters were diverse and richly developed but their stories were loosely connected the story of hattie and her children is filled with sadness and grit i enjoyed this read but didn't love it i did not like that this was an oprah 2 0 selection nor the fact that ms winfrey had highlighted passages in my text i will avoid oprah 2 0 books in the future","1235":"this was a well written book but i'm not sure it deserves all the starred reviews publishers weekly kirkus booklist that said it was a strong description of the great migration where african americans left the hateful south for cold weather but better opportunities in the north it got me thinking about what blacks were running from and how different and difficult it would've been to settle in the north","1236":"hattie and her family have a lot to tell the settings and characters are very interesting if depressing the writing is sharp and stark the stories do not hang together as well as i'd hoped","1237":"i would not normally read anything recommended by oprah but this was this month's book for my book club the book is very well written however this is a great example of just because someone is a very good technical writer it doesn't mean they can tell a good story the story had the potential to be excellent instead it was a huge let down rather than a novel it reads like a collection of short stories about different members of a family no attempts were made to connect the characters to each other or to develop the characters beyond the very surface presentation i think the author failed to deliver the promised powerful story of courage etc i was also very annoyed that in the e version oprah's notes were included i really would prefer to not be forced to read oprah's thoughts as i am reading if i wanted her thoughts i would look for them to me this is just further evidence of her incredible narcissism to force me to buy a book with her annotations","1238":"the book was okay each chapter was a vignetter about one of the main character's kids part way through i just started wondering why i was bothering to read the book i like books with a plot with a destination to be reached the overarching story line was the 'life' of hattie to see what her life was like and the struggles she had raising her kids i just felt like the time i invested was not worth it","1239":"the strong points in this historic novel offered detailed characters along good descriptions of the scenery the down falls were the chapters that barely tied the novel together each chapter could have been a stand along short story i kept looking for a progression of each character in the next chapter only to find another introduction to a different character but the authors style makes it a gem to read as well as the history of the great migration from the south","1240":"well written i just felt myself not really caring for any of the characters at all not that i didn't have compassion for their situation but their reactions to those situations was what i didn't care for of all her children grandchildren extended family it seemed like not a one had found some peace or happiness","1241":" if you are feeling sad or have a tendency towards depression do not read this book you will end up feeling lousy i give it 2 stars and not one as i usually do with a book that i cannot make myself finish because the author can write and some of her phrasing is almost poetic this is a whole family of pathetic people who have bad things happen to them then continue to screw up their own lives i know enough of these type of people who make one bad self destructive decision after another to want to read about a fictional group of them i read just franklin's chapter and i'm done he is one a mission in vietnam guarding a beach drunk and stoned while his crew set land mines his chapter has him reminiscing about the good woman his one true love who gave him not one not two but three chances and yet despite his deep love for her he couldn't seem to stop drinking and gambling to keep her as he is about to deploy he learns that she is now living with a good man and tries to coax her back but she says no thats the story i want to follow instead we are stuck with franklin who ends his chapter by making yet another bad choice","1242":"i listened to this on audio and enjoyed the stories hattie marries at 17 and has twins this is the first chapter of the book about hattie she proceeds to have 9 more children and each chapter is devoted to another of the children although the story goes from character to character you get a feel for each one but it leaves you wondering what else happened to them it gives you just enough to keep you interested i liked it and will look for more by this author","1243":"what a really strong book with great character perspective","1244":" gorgeous and heartbreaking that sums up the experience this book was the twelve narratives grab you and you want to scream at hattie for what her actions do to her children and scream at the adults those children become for letting that affect them which is just something the book focuses on children pay the price always yet you understand them care about them want to hug every last one of them because you feel the pain there i loved that mathis didn't shy away from subjects like sexuality mental illness abuse suicide but she didn't beat you over the head with them in her narrative they were simply a part of life highly recommend this","1245":"really a 3 5 being from the south i witnessed some of the last of segregations travesties i think mathis did a great job of telling hattie's story creatively some reviewers commented that it seemed like a collection of short stories and they were waiting for them to be connected but they missed the overall point they were all connected through hattie mathis just used the children to tell hattie's story she did end several chapters abruptly leaving me hanging i think it's partly a story of the impact a mother has on her children's lives people make ridiculous selfish choices in this world and always say 'the children will be fine' no they won't not for a long time anyway they will carry their scars with them as compasses this is not an uplifting book though it was a fast read nothing too dark just not positive it is real it's harsh at times and sad quite often i'm glad it's finished and grateful for a bit of hope mathis threw in at the end the evolution of a soul doing the best she could and in her 70's hattie 'gets it' loved the dialect and look forward to more from mathis~","1246":"each chapter is written from the point of view of a different member of the family it was almost like each chapter was a short story that stood on its own it made for a somewhat disjointed story but overall i enjoyed it","1247":"ayana mathis writes a great story about a black women hattie and her pain while living in the south and battling the dysfunctions of trying to love and protect her family under harsh conditions it is creatively written and really pulls you in i intend to read it again in the near future","1248":"while i really liked the writing i found this book very disjointed it was more like reading short stories than a novel honestly i wouldn't recommend this book","1249":"some spoilers the structure of this book works well but it still was a little troublesome for me the book starts off with a compelling chapter 1925 hattie is tending to her sick infant twins but they have pneumonia and hattie has no access to penicillin the babies die by the end of the chapter i was hooked i wanted to read more of hattie's story but then the next chapter is set in 1948 in the point of view of floyd subsequently each chapter is about a different offspring of hattie's throughout the years the writing is great the chapters on these characters are very good but that's all we get on these characters one compelling chapter in the last chapter hattie returns however the story never does fully succeed in becoming a unified whole nevertheless this is a well written book i recommend it to anyone i'm also looking forward to ayana's next book","1250":"i loved the beginning of this book and liked the rest","1251":"when i read the first section i thought this book would be too hallmark for me but the characters and stories got more and more interesting and consistently surprised me bell's was the craziest but in a family with that many kids there's always at least one bell isn't there the format was also really really smart where hattie ends up at the end with august and with sala mathis absolutely won me over","1252":"i loved how the stories delved into different characters but i was left wanting to read more about some of them and not others i wished the story ended more tightly and you left with a complete understanding of hattie but sometimes that's not how it goes very well written","1253":"it started out very strong wonderful writing evocative prose each chapter is a short story good historical perspective of a movement that hasn't gotten much coverage each story seemed more futile and bleak than the last","1254":"the title led me to believe it may have roots in genealogy but no the book is poignant snippets of hattie and her children's lives the snippets are from different years 1925 to 1980 hattie was born and lived in georgia but when her father was killed maybe murdered in a race issue they moved to philadelphia each of the snippets is from a different character's point of view and though short there is a lot of depth in what is learned about each person their humanity and flaws and loves and frailties one of the ones that gripped my emotions in a raw way was the character franklin the story is thoughts that frank is having when he is in viet nam in 1969 frank is about twenty one and has messed up his marriage to the love of his live sissy by drinking and womanizing nobody ever thinks he's going to become one of those failed men those bums that normal people won't make eye contact with ashy old men with cirrhosis and matted hair and a room in a flophouse and nobody ever thinks i didn't before i got sissy's letter that those old men probably have wives and children who have had to forget them insightfully simple thoughts like the other characters' stories in this book a wonderful read but not joyful like life sometimes","1255":"beautiful writing some interesting and probably important insights lacking plot and momentum","1256":" i liked how this book was structured with each chapter representing a different person or tribe and a different time period occasionally it made the storyline difficult to follow but there was enough details and consistency that i didn't get confused the only downside to this structure is that i found myself getting into each character only to have his or her story end at the end of the chapter i wanted to know more about the children and how each coped and grew into adulthood i wanted more depth and details about their childhood and their relationships with each other because i felt like the chapters only grazed the surface perhaps the author could use those characters as spin off novels i also felt dissatisfied with the ending but maybe that was because i wanted to know so much more about the other characters and the family as a whole","1257":"i loved the writing in this book the characters were interesting and well developed though each story was sad most bordering on depressing my only regret is that there was not more of a formal tie in as a final chapter","1258":"while this was an incredibly well written book it became absolutely unbearable and increasingly burdensome to read i found neither one ray nor glimmer of hope and honest love","1259":" i finally finished reading this book i gave it three stars the writing itself is excellent the story well that is quite different the characters were uninteresting if not downright un compelling the stories could be single vignettes not tied to one another except that each character is from a generation of the matriarch hattie in the beginning i was excited about a family leaving the south and moving north in the face of jim crow the story did not develop into anything interesting after hattie's first babies twins died the book then seemed like random thoughts i gave the author credit for attempting to create 12 separate generations of hattie however the author did not really bring the characters together in a cohesive way i found myself waiting for the story to end rather than relishing in the characters' stories and experiences interestingly enough it seemed to be that the story was about freed slaves rather than upwardly mobile blacks migrating north looking for a better life but the characters seem to defeat themselves and fall into the oblivion at least from my perspective the book ended without fanfare passion and without reason except that it was time to stop writing hattie was a bitter and self defeating character and even in the end could not allow her grandchild a bit of happiness i was never quite sure where the book was going i wanted to relish in the characters' success in the face of racism and poverty this book just did not take me there","1260":"kudos to ms mathis on her first novel it's been a long time since i've read such a good piece of fiction her characters stepped from the pages","1261":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i would like to rate this 6 out of 12 tribes of hattie i did not love this book i liked parts of this book a lot some of the stories are really lovely and pretty powerful and sad but overall there is too much wrong with it for me to love it or even like it first the stories are barely connected considering that this is a book about 12 siblings i think it would have been more successful if it was about 12 strangers the lack of connection between the stories bothered me but maybe wo i would like to rate this 6 out of 12 tribes of hattie i did not love this book i liked parts of this book a lot some of the stories are really lovely and pretty powerful and sad but overall there is too much wrong with it for me to love it or even like it first the stories are barely connected considering that this is a book about 12 siblings i think it would have been more successful if it was about 12 strangers the lack of connection between the stories bothered me but maybe wouldn't have if it had just been 12 stories it really could have been plus hattie is just a terrible mother her children are terrible people the vignette style that mathis uses means we get such small glimpses that your opinion of the family never really evolves maybe a little at the very end and there's just no character growth over the loooooong setting of the book structurally the stories would have been more successful if they had either a taken place all at the same time the late 60s perhaps when hattie's children ranged in age from about 35 to toddler b been more connected or c not been about hattie's children but her descendants so that you could really see the evolution of the family as it is it was a better than ok collection of poorly linked stories that could have been really interesting with some significant structural changes or maybe oprah just set me up to fail who knows i usually don't love her books anyway more","1262":" i'm not usually a fan of oprah's book club but this one got so many good reviews i had to read it it's definitely worth a read but it will get frustrating especially if you start getting attached to a character most of the chapters are dedicated to 1 or 2 of hattie's kids once that chapter is finished they're never heard from again that was disappointing for me as some of the kids are really likable i found myself so involved with them and then it would end it reads like a bunch of short stories it was good though and at times you can't decide whether to hate hattie like her feel sorry for her or smack her read it friends","1263":" i wanted to love this book but it was so depressing and bleak the author ayana mathis is talented and she writes well the story line drew me in and kept me reading but i couldn't get beyond all the heartbreak and sadness of each of the characters lives couldn't one of the children have succeeded in life and found happiness i don't believe that reading something so filled with sadness can produce anything positive in the readers life focusing on all the negative in life just brings more negative into your life i'm surprised oprah chose this book i was so impressed with oprah's first book club pick by cheryl strayed wild from lost to found on the pacific crest trail that i thought this book too would be amazing so i it pre ordered it without looking at the reviews well that was a mistake that i won't make again i would not recommend this book to anyone","1264":" this was very well written and the characters were compelling that's the good part each section concentrated on one character and just when you felt you knew them and wanted to really delve into their lives that section was over i also felt like it was so sad not one of the characters were really happy surely with thirteen main characters the odds are in favor of at least one of them having a good and happy life it was a very fast read for me and i'm glad i read it but it did leave me frustrated at the end","1265":"one sad story after another nothing brings the book together in the end disappointing","1266":"o","1267":"when oprah puts her name on a book i tend to read it this is a sad story of a mother and her children each chapter is devoted to one of them and each chapter stands alone as a part of the story i wanted to stop many times thinking it would get better it just didn't work for me","1268":"i was prepared to really like this book but found it very disjointed i was only engaged with some of the characters and their stories for a chapter or two so many disparate voices so little cohesion like most oprah's book club selections this story was not remotely positive it was unrelentingly dismal perhaps it is a realistic view of the world through the eyes of those who live lives of quiet desperation","1269":"i really liked this book there was a tenderness and dignity in the writing a rawness in its empathy as the characters pushed through the grittiness of life the short story style for each character did mean it kept on losing momentum but it also gave a breadth of insight into each family member and consequently the family as a whole that the reader wouldn't have got from a single story would recommend","1270":"i really enjoyed the genre south vs north during the great migration i thought the characters were well developed even though the book is written in sort of small vignettes","1271":" i read this a year ago and i may be a bit foggy about it in 1923 fifteen year old hattie leaves georgia to head to the north she is sweet and sensitive and in love she is looking forward to a brighter future her first born twins meet a tragic end and hattie is changed she has fierce love but without any tenderness and she becomes repressed and angry if i remember correctly the chapters are told by various offspring part of her 12 tribes and their stories are of struggles bigotry oppression and also of love and mercy there was a great deal of symbolism and freedom metaphors but it wasn't over done and the writing was strong and powerful","1272":"excellent writing but not a huge fan of this style i was listening to it via audiobook and it couldn't keep my attention i kept finding myself drifting off and missing portions of the book some of the characters were very interesting and i found myself wishing she'd come back to them overall disappointing personally given the high praise i've seen","1273":"i neglected to review this immediately after i read it so my memories of it are vague the story at the beginning was especially emotional the structure was interesting having a chapter for each child more or less it also brought me to a neighborhood i've never explored","1274":"less of a novel more a collection of loosely connected short stories that can be summed up succinctly lady has a lot of kids she is haggard and kids have mommy issues too many characters to learn enough about any one of them so by the end the reader is confused and bored","1275":"good book actually short stories that are loosely tied to matriarch sad","1276":"i thought this was very well written very entertaining and also pretty sad a good read though","1277":"it was interesting but not particularly cohesive now i understand what the twelve tribes mean it is a part different part of america's culture a glimpse into another section of society it was alright something totally different my regular reading which is good for an initial novel it was fairly good ms mathis gets her point across","1278":"it was enjoyable in a way but also very disjointed i felt as if i were reading a grouping of short stories and not a novel the language was beautiful in places but the stories were sad and left you feeling a little hopeless even at the end it was just okay","1279":" okay i'm through with this book i was a little leery anyway because i haven like many of oprah's books i enjoyed the start of the book but as it moves from one character to another which i think are different children of hattie i couldn't connect it's more like a group of short stories i think there are better books that tell of the experiences of blacks as they moved to the north for better lives i recently read one the color of water it is a true story and you care about the people so on to something else","1280":"mathis's debut novel is the achingly sad saga of one black family making their way north and fighting to break free from poverty and prejudice in the early years of the 1920s hattie shepherd longs to escape from georgia where her father was lynched when she marries august they set off hopefully for pennsylvania only to watch their seven month old twins philadelphia and jubilee die of pneumonia despite hattie's desperate ministrations this loss will haunt hattie throughout the years to come even though she bears nine more children who together with the dead twins and a granddaughter form the twelve tribes of the title - an explicit echo of the dozen tribes of israel in the hebrew bible violence disappointment love affairs and discrimination from the 1920s through to the 1980s mathis traces an american family in crisis and suggests that cliched as it may sound love may have the power to heal what seem like fatal emotional wounds each chapter shifts to the perspective of another of hattie's offspring in either first or third person narration making for an impressive variety of voices and styles readers gain an intimate view of each of the children but also of hattie herself through the composite peripheral glances each chapter allows hattie is a troublesome yet compelling character as cold as she often seems to her children she feels things deeply one perceptive daughter realizes \"she'd never seen her mother laugh...she'd never seen any joy in her at all hattie had been stern and angry all of bell's life and it occurred to her that her mother must have been very unhappy most of the time \"mathis's novel is also strong at the level of language and allusion she subverts scriptural narratives even as she relies on them for structure the pattern of devoting one chapter to each family member reminded me of hanna pylvainen's excellent we sinners while the portentous biblical rhetoric applied to the reality of southern and or african american lives recalls not just morrison and walker but also william faulkner it's no surprise that oprah winfrey chose the twelve tribes of hattie for her book club relaunch with writing this confident and characters this convincing it will be a pleasure to await mathis's next work of fiction this review formed part of an article on my best fiction reads of 2013 for bookkaholic","1281":"maybe 2 5 stars i found my next donation to the library","1282":" i am somewhat surprised by the mediocre ratings of this book i don't consider myself a re reader but this book i see myself returning to because it is so rich and complex in a world where we rarely if ever hear about the stories of black women the story of hattie shepherd told in large part through the stories of her children is a treasure it is raw heartbreaking breathtaking and uncomfortably hopeful mathis depicts the intersections of racism classism and sexism beautifully and in a way that makes it impossible to ignore the parallels to the current state of the world this book was hard there were days when i said to myself damn i just can't do this book today but i loved it i think it should be taught in literature classes i'm already looking forward to reading it again","1283":"i enjoyed the book i would have liked to know what became of the characters but i suppose that would have drawn the book out","1284":"the way ms mathis tells the story through the lives of hattie's children intrigues the reader the realness of each characters issues evokes a plethora of emotions many people have had hard mothers to raise them and this book may give solace to that population this was truly a good read that should inspire parents to show affection to their children and understand how integral a loving fellowship plays on the outcomes of their adult lives","1285":" i really went up and down in this book i liked some parts of it and other parts i didn't like at all i have to let his one sit a while to decide if it is even a 3 star for me it's not i changed it to 2 before i finished writing this and that may be too high very depressing i think what i really don't like about it is that everyone blames the way they are on their circumstances since each child turns out differently it seems to me it must really be what they decided to do with their circumstances a very depressing book i don't think anyone turned out with a happy life although if there were any happy stories in there they certainly were drowned with all the depressing and sad life stores around them","1286":"this book has been on many of the best of 2013 lists i am not sure why it was ok but not a top pick in my opinion","1287":"well written book different than my usual books author has wonderful description of the characters' thought processes one whole family with different members featured in each chapter the other members interspersed there too thoughtful and satisfying read","1288":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i found the twelve tribes of hattie to be an interesting but depressing book in the book we see snippets of hattie over the years through the other characters we see a woman who never dealt with the trauma and depression resulting from the deaths of her twin infants and how this unresolved trauma impacted her family through the generations although the first chapter was gripping i found the story lost its steam by the end every one of hattie's children lead us on a different path of perso i found the twelve tribes of hattie to be an interesting but depressing book in the book we see snippets of hattie over the years through the other characters we see a woman who never dealt with the trauma and depression resulting from the deaths of her twin infants and how this unresolved trauma impacted her family through the generations although the first chapter was gripping i found the story lost its steam by the end every one of hattie's children lead us on a different path of personal failure yes we get the point the author is trying to make just because someone has escaped one form of injustice does not mean that there is an easy road ahead i just think maybe the author should have interspersed the failures with a few successes this depressing book was made more so by the fact that not a single one of hattie's children lived a decent life resiliency the ability to overcome adversity is an important trait to success hattie had spades of resiliency and stamina and yet her efforts led to massive disfunction in her children the fact that not a single one of her children became successful not a single one was able to triumph over their past and become a successful human being led to the depressive and disappointing undertone to this book i'm not sure i'd recommend it i rate it three stars more","1289":"favorite quote she had been with her share of schemers and men who were forever building castles in the sky all those dreams made out of clouds when it rained - and it always did - they were left with nothing but the soggy shirts on their backs 187","1290":"just finished the book a great read superb writing when i decided to read this book one of oprah's suggestion i secretly hoped it wouldn't be about a dysfunctional family it is oh the heartache the pain the poverty it has it all","1291":"powerful mathis weaves us through the lives of hattie's offspring and effectively pulls off various narrative voices it wasn't a light read and it wasn't particularly uplifting but it's modern writing at its best","1292":" i loved this book from the first page i was so interested in hattie's character and her life the story begins with hattie who moves from georgia to philadelphia in the 1920s and each chapter thereafter focuses on one of her eleven children it was fascinating to me to see how all of the children despite being raised by the same two parents were so incredibly different my one complaint about the book is that i was so engrossed in each character's story and i was sad to leave each one behind and move to the next chapter this was ultimately a fairly sad book hattie struggled for her entire life financially romantically and as a mother and this story paints a picture of a very real family and its many intricacies","1293":"one of many great migration stories this tells about 15 year old hattie's journey to philadelphia in 1923 it follows her life and that of her living chldren it was just all right and very depressing","1294":"loved the way this book was written hattie's life stories are told through her relationships with her children beautifully written but also a tragedy","1295":" this is probably more of a 3 5 and i've chosen to round up unlike other reviewers i had no problem with each chapter being about one or two of hattie's children i read a lot of short stories and i have read several collections of related short stories this book felt similar to those that may be why i wasn't put off by it being not entirely novel like it's a book and that's as specific as it has to get for me i thought the structure worked really well and i enjoyed covering decades without having to read a 600 page novel it was also interesting to see hattie through the eyes of her many children the first three chapters were excellent the quality became a bit uneven for me after that two of the chapters were told in the first person two different children i didn't understand why that shift occurred and i thought it failed the second time it was done really failed a narrator with a significant mental illness i wouldn't call the book psychologically astute but it was believable i can't comment on its accuracy as a migration story i just finished the warmth of other suns and i don't see any contradictions i'm glad i read warmth first because it gave me better insight into the times i think we need to be careful not to generalize migration stories so much that we lose our understanding that stories can be similar but none are identical","1296":"challenge category oprah book club","1297":"ok trying to figure out why i've gotten in a string of downer books lately this one was another one that was just sad all the characters hattie u0026amp her numerous children led pretty grim lives kept waiting for something uplifting to raise it all up but it never happened not sure why this got such rave reviews","1298":"loved the stories only way to improve would have been to focus on fewer characters and develop them more fully","1299":"reading this book was like looking at a family photograph with a stranger you tell the story of one individual at a time this book did the same by devoting a chapter to each family member you receive all of the information but none of it brings out a sense of family there is no interaction between hattie's children i found it to be a rather abrupt format and yet i became involved in each life story","1300":"i like hattie i'm not sure i'm supposed to but i think she did the best she could with what she had at the time there are many different ways to love people just because she wasn't cuddly and sweet with her kids doesn't mean they weren't loved obviously she made mistakes but who doesn't i'm not a fan of the way this book was structured i felt like it was more a collection of short stories than a novel i didn't feel a connection between any of the characters even though they're all from the same family and i can't really say that i got to know the characters either as their chapters were focused on one event or time in their lives without much background just an ok read for me","1301":"this book is very human i can't say i lived it but i cared about the characters i'd like to know more about them","1302":" i read about this book awhile in oprah's magazine and i finally had the opportunity to pick up a copy at the local library first of all it's an oprah book selection which means it will deal with heavy topics usually including sexual abuse i've noticed that many of oprah's book selections deal with this subject something that oprah herself has admitted to experiencing when she was young anyways book to the book i enjoyed the writing style but the novel seemed a bit disconnected to me because each chapter was told from the point of view of a different child of hattie's i wish the narrator would have been more consistent or the author would have chosen to focus on just a few of hattie's children i felt like just was i was getting to know a character they were gone with that said i loved the themes a young girl hattie migrates from georgia to philadelphia and raises 12 children over the course of several decades mathis questioned women's roles especially black women's roles in their homes and in society the novel explores mother daughter relationships and the church's role in the lives of many black americans because the novel spans from the 1920s to the 1980s readers also get to see the progress on african americans and to me the lack of progress made by black women one thing that stayed with me was hattie's inability to love and show affection for her children because her energy was spent keeping them alive love and affection seemed like a luxury for children who knew where their next meal was coming from i enjoyed the novel and appreciated a black novel that was not a slave narrative or a ghetto love story we need more novels that explore the richness of black culture without falling into stereotypes","1303":"i really loved this book from beginning to end every child had there own heartfelt story which every character story was strong on it own i wasn't sure if i would like the book but from the very beginning i was pulled in i enjoyed that every child was introduced like a short story i was so surprised how great this book was i really enjoyed it and really look forward to read another book by ayana mathis her writing was perfect with great story telling with this being her first novel i was really impressed","1304":"audiobook this book followed the lives of the main character and her relationships with other family members i honestly do not think i could have actually read this book and finished it somewhat glad i took the audio route it was an okay premise of the book but the execution of the story dragged on longer than i would have liked","1305":"the characters were so real that they were repelling this story is so real that it hurts to read it there is no closure there are no happy endings remarkable read","1306":"i hadn't heard good reviews on this book but thought maybe it would be different for me so i read it anyway i think if ayana would have woven the siblings together instead of each one of them having a separate story at such different times in their lives their might have been some connectedness between the characters this book could have been so much more","1307":"it was a well written book but not worth all of the hype","1308":"this is kind of a novel and kind of a collection of short stories each chapter follows one or two of hattie's children a key moment in their lives many chapters are just heartbreaking and the writing is beautiful but it is one of those books that takes an emotional toll i would have loved some more easter eggs in later chapters to hear how the stories resolved","1309":"though many people talk about how this book is disjointed and hard to follow i found it quite good i do agree with them but i started reading the chapters as separate short stories and i found i liked it more","1310":"what a life puts my trauma dramas in perspective and yet i guess i thought it was just ok","1311":"it seems to be a current writing trend to craft a book as a series of short stories loosely woven around a central character i e olive kitteridge here mathis writes twelve vignettes each featuring one of the children and one grandchild of the matriarch of the family hattie a strong woman who is fiercely protective of her family but doesn't have the time or personality to be a warm demonstrative mother all the stories are absorbing but the two written in first person are superior a great debut","1312":"this is really a collection of short stories as every chapter deals with one or two of the eponymous hattie's children and hattie is often the only link which makes all the different parts quite disconnected and thus not really a novel in my opinion and as with most short story collections there were some good stories and some not so good ones especially the last 4 or so weren't much to my liking i also wish at least one of the children turned out alright instead they all lead miserable depressing lives too much of that can be a drag and in this case also a bit unrealistic","1313":"this fascinating story centers around the great migration the movement of african americans out of the rural southern united states to the northeast the midwest and the west this story follows one particular character hattie shepherd and the struggles she endures when hattie was 15 years old in 1923 she migrated north to philadelphia from her home in georgia hattie's hopes and dreams for a wonderful and bright future full of opportunities were quickly squashed hattie became pregnant by a man august she had been seeing a short time she subsequently married him and gave birth to twins she named jubilee and philadelphia quickly learning just how difficult life could be august did not possess the strongest work ethic and spent many evenings out of the home hattie was a young mother with two babies and left very much alone the twins became ill with pneumonia and despite hattie's best efforts both babies died with her babies' deaths hattie's innocence was truly lost and something inside hattie died too hattie's life was changed forever and she became full of bitterness anger and hopelessness this story is about hattie's struggles and ultimately is about what happens to her subsequent children her 'tribes' because of her hopelessness and anger the twelve tribes of hattie the first novel by author ayana mathis is beautifully written and each chapter is told in the voice of each of hattie's children the reader comes to know a little of each child and through their individual stories we come to know a little more of hattie also the only aspect of this book that was a bit disappointing was that the one single chapter did not allow the reader to develop a deep emotional connection with each character that being said this was a story i did not want to stop reading hattie was a complex character one i could not really bring myself to like but one which was immensely sympathetic and understandable and just very human i found myself hoping that that she could find a way to see past her huge disappointments and bitterness and somehow ket her anger go if not just for her own peace of mind but for her children each of her 'tribes' were craving desperately and crying out to her for some attention affection and acceptance it was apparent that hattie felt that the best way and perhaps the most loving way in her view to prepare her children for the difficulties and disappointments in life was to not offer them tenderness the thing they needed most as a mother myself and having a very different belief system about motherhood than hattie possessed i found this book very difficult to read at times and yet i still found it riveting hattie is a flawed character and although i did not always agree with the decisions she made i continued to the end to wish for her to find some way for her to heal her 'brokenness' and in doing so she would be able to help her children with their own 'brokenness' although hattie's story was a harsh one filled with tragedy and bitter disappointments the book did end with a glimmer of hope for her and her family i would give this book 4 5 stars if i could and i look forward to reading more of ms mathis' work in the future","1314":"i think i enjoyed this book more as a collection of short stories rather than a novel the structure is more like jennifer egan's visit from the goon squad except not as daring i was hoping for more historical context but i'm just nerdy that way i am glad i read it but i don't want to read it again","1315":"found it a little depressing and sad life was such struggle","1316":"very sad i felt so sorry for tgese people great read though","1317":"very depressing disjointed and strangely fascinating i was disappointed when i turned a page only to find the acknowledgements i would of gave it 3 1 2 stars if possible","1318":"typical oprah book depressing book about poor people","1319":"great story loved the different narrative voices","1320":"ayana tells an engaging story of hattie's children and hattie the language setting and hattie's antics as a woman and mother kept me reading however ayana didn't delve into all the lives of hattie's children which i wondered why and if that meant we can expect a sequel the book also reminded me a lot of curtis black's perfect peace in other words the storyline and plot was familiar overall i look forward to more work from her","1321":"the book was a great read however it was like reading twelve short stories i wanted more interaction between the characters it was a sad book","1322":"i would rate it 3 5 if i could","1323":"this is a debut book written by a new author hattie the main character gives birth to 12 children the first chapter is tragic after contracting pneumonia and not receiving proper care her 8 month old twins die this tragic event shadows the rest of hattie's life an she goes on to have 9 more children each chapter is about one of the children and goes back and forth in terms of time it is a really good story a of a family struggling it's a great read and i would recommend it","1324":"interesting read because it is told through the 12 perspectives of her children i found that some parts dragged on as some of her children's perspectives were more interesting than others","1325":"the writing was quite powerful and compelling at times but i felt overall there were too many storyline setups and not enough payoff explanations","1326":"i had high hopes for this book it started out well very powerful character sketches but drifted and never came together for me","1327":" a beautifully written albeit dark book about the consequences of decisions and the challenges of being black in 1920's america when hattie finds herself pregnant at 15 she marries the father though she barely knows him they have twins who sadly die as babies at this point one would think hattie might leave her husband and try for a better life but she stays and goes on to have nine more babies and this book looks at how their lives are shaped within this family one criticism i had throughout the various narratives was how little the reader gets to know the other characters just as you're delving into their fascinating lives the author leaves them and their futures with more questions than answers still the saga as a whole is a brilliant achievement and the writing clean and vivid it was as though she'd been dropped into a life of squalor and indignities that should not have been hers hattie clambered from the train her skirt still hemmed with georgia mud the dream of philadelphia round as a marble in her mouth and the fear of it a needle in her chest","1328":"didn't love it didn't hate it i just kept hoping for more","1329":"i tried to like this book more but despite some good writing it was a disappointment too episodic too much just a parade of horribles without enough connection or context i'd begin getting involved with a character and wondering what would happen next and then poof next point of view next narrator i preferred the warmth of other suns as a nuanced study of the great migration of blacks from the south","1330":"i loved this book it really touched my heart how the author let us in to all the characters lives helped me to understand and in some cases related to each of them i would recommend reading this book","1331":"interesting read i liked how each chapter's story was based on a different characters life and interactions with the main character my only complaint is that it ended too soon","1332":"a very interesting read the twelve tribes were the children interesting how ms mathis wrote each chapter based on each child what's even more interesting was how each one of their lives turned out as a result of hattie's the main character love or rather lack of love what i didn't like was how the stories kept shifting in years one chapter i'm reading about the 50's then the next i'm in the 30's then another year etc etc overall i enjoyed the book and realized that any book on the oprah's book club review is going to be a very heavy read","1333":"this book is a collection of short stories you get a good sense of each character which was interesting i have mixed feelings about this book i felt the story line could have been developed more","1334":"saying that i really liked this book is kind of like saying i really liked schindler's list it is sad super sad gut wrenching this sucks why do i do this to myself sad i should have known when i saw that oprah sticker that lady loves sad books i am not one who usually enjoys short stories but the contents of the book short stories depicting each of hattie's twelve children and their family's strife were so beautifully written with a stark poetic style each story was riveting with their charging dramatic climax and often a tragic resolution this book is not one for the faint of heart but if you have enjoyed other oprah picks and the box of kleenexes that go with them you'll enjoy this one if you enjoy historical fiction centered on hard knock life characters and drama this one is for you too if mathis is the next toni morrison this is a great start","1335":"this is more a set of short stories than a novel i havent counted who all the 12 tribes are it was well written but very sad i wonder if it had been about an irish family or asian family if oprah would have embraced it","1336":"while the structure of the book felt lopsided at times and some characters were more memorable or engaging than others especially isolated as they were from one another i really enjoyed the personal stories of each child which often stood alone and how they reflected the complicated fierce hard loving woman that was their mother","1337":"it was alright interesting view point on one ladies life but book wasn't so great maybe it would be more appealing to someone that's gone through something similar","1338":"i admit i was a bit skeptical about this book having the oprah imprimatur and all the hype but i'm happy to say it more than lived up to all the praise what a beautiful book the hattie of the title is the matriarch of the family 9 kids we first meet her as a 17 year old new mother trying to save her twin babies from pneumonia she is part of the great migration north to philadelphia from georgia and we get brief hints of the kind of racial violence her family was escaping hattie is a very complex central character we see her desperation in the first chapter but the more we get to know her on into her old age the stronger she becomes and the harder she is on her children we see a house without a lot of love or tenderness expressed and most of the book tells the stories of her children and the long term effects of their strained relationships each chapter is told from another child's perspective coming back to hattie several times dealing with mental illness addiction sexual identity vietnam abuse the list goes on no one has it easy while this may sound like a downer of a book the writing and character development makes it worth reading through all their hardships and it does end on a hopeful note believe the hype","1339":"as always oprah manages to pick books that are just downers quite honestly i admit i prefer books that inspire that provide stories of determination and strength and hope and her picks often have little of those elements this latest is in the same vein not surprisingly the book is supposedly about one family's story of the children of the great migration and since i read what could arguably be called the definitive work on the migration isabel wilkerson's the warmth of other suns i was expecting something different from this book this is just the story of one woman who moved from the south to the north in the early 20th century and then a brief view of the lives of each of her 11 children and a grandchild all have serious issues and experience deep unhappiness there is a little ray of hope at the very end but the rest of the book just introduced me to a lot of very sad and messed up people who simply couldn't get past bad circumstances and or bad choices","1340":"disjointed i get what the author was trying to do but i don't think she did it each chapter is about another child of hattie but they don't develop through the book it's closer to a group of short stories than a novel","1341":"this is a different type of story i enjoyed this read thoroughly though at times i wished she spent more time on each child of hattie you just get a small clip of each life","1342":"it was ok each chapter discusses one of the eleven of hattie's children it shows how her children dealt with life and evolution into adulthood by how hattie's own demenor attitude love towards them her husband herself and her life situation turned out","1343":"beautifully written and wonderfully descriptive highlights the profound effects of a mother on her child's lives","1344":" hattie was part of the great migration and found herself in philadelphia at the age of 17 married and pregnant the pregnancies never ended she had few viable options to improve her life and her children's lives proved to be equally difficult women's maternal health options were just coming of age at the time and clearly had not reached hattie's echelon of society yet the upward mobility and social acceptance of the african american men portrayed were equally dismal the stories are heart wrenching tears sprung to my eyes again and again some of the stories are wild and extreme and others slightly magical but yet i couldn't help recalling real people and thinking these stories are lived american tales for many of our tribes of course oprah picked this book i really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down it was difficult for me to call it a novel until well into the second half because it is a book of short stories with each chapter a new story begins about one of the lives of hattie's 12 children her tribes the common thread is hattie portrayed in a discrete period time with each of her children over the course of her life by the end we have a full picture of hattie which ties the stories together well as a novel a truly american novel there was only one chapter that i really disliked about a son who fought in vietnam but that was probably because of the disturbing nature of the vietnam war itself on the whole i really liked the book i am looking forward to seeing what this writer does next","1345":" hattie leaves georgia and settles in philadelphia where she finds that colored people are not treated so badly at age 15 she is married to august and starts having children august shirks responsiblities and it is up to hattie to keep her 9 children clothed and fed with whatever little she has she loses two babies to pneumonia as she did not have the money she had to give away a child she seeks happiness with another man and thinks he will take care of her and her children and is disappointed so she is back home to august who lets her back in since he does not know how to organise his and his children life without her in these twelve stories the author has brought out brilliantly why hattie is the way she is she is very strict and distant with her children she wants to teach them toughness so that if the world treats them badly they do not fall apart but it has its own disadavantages each child has a problem and though connected to hattie in ways they cannot imagine they are confused whether she really loves them so they act out in different waysbut it is the mother's love that makes hattie the way she is and they realise that she will always be there for them inspite of their weaknesses and be there for their father too when he gets old and cannot take care of himself she is the woman of strength","1346":"this was a typical oprah book club pick it had all of the elements depressing poor african americans the south etc although the book had some very well written and gripping sections i found the book as a whole to be a little over the top","1347":"this book is about a black couple that left the south for a new life in philadelphia in the early 1950's unfortunate events lead to poverty disillusion and loss of the american dream or is it a loss hardship shapes character and hattie's character is developed through the eyes of her twelve children the family is survival mode and tough decisions are made the book tells the story using the point of view of hattie and from the point of view of the children applying this to our own lives what one person thinks is a sound decision may not have the intended effect i enjoyed the book","1348":"a young mother her loss her tribe a great read","1349":"i thought it was depressing","1350":"i totally disagree with the other reviews i found this to be profound moving and raw this gives voice to so many that never had one to people that were never noticed or appreciated for the hard lives they lived a small slice of each life in each chapter gives just enough to understand why they matter and why understanding how they lived is important to all of us everyone makes up a thread of our collective community and our collective history i loved this book","1351":"lovely first novel","1352":"i think oprah liked this book better than i did it was a bit disjointed more like a book of short stories but the end was worth reading toward","1353":"a difficult book to get through as a book on tape it's written more like several short stories linked together through hattie the main character i certainly enjoyed some of the stories more than others some wonderful writing but as a whole this was not a favorite","1354":"broken down to cut scenes of each of her children lives the book shows how each one of the developed from their and their mother choices i did really like it","1355":"well written and well read the voices of her children is a nice way to giveperspective to hattie","1356":"12 stories about hattie's children beginning with her first babies and ending with a grandchild hope and love and reality and disappointment","1357":"interesting story","1358":"loved this book please read my full review at my blog http suzysnerdyword wordpress com 2","1359":"i was toying with giving this book four stars it did get great reviews it was entertaining and a decent read it is basically about a black family living in philadelphia hattie is the mother of many children most of the chapters devote themselves to a particular child and all the different ways they each turned out i was disappointed in the ending","1360":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here actually loved the story telling by this new novelist oprah was right again in choosing this for her book club story of northern migration by 'haggidan' word learned from book and her 12 children her struggles loss love lack thereof great idea to tell story thru eyes of children they all had issues it appears like so many dysfunctional families both parents hattie arthur showed love in different manner hattie was more one to take care of needs shocking to read of loss of twins actually loved the story telling by this new novelist oprah was right again in

twins at beginning think i liked six young minister ruth ella and bell stories best alice was protector of billup what a name more","1361":"hattie came to philadelphia at 17 and is still there at 71 the book ends the twelve tribes refers to the 11 children born to her and one grandchild each chapter is vignette in the life of each of the children touching and moving and not always pretty it is a memorable picture of the life of those involved in the great migration of african americans from the south to the north over most of the twentieth century","1362":"pretty gritty read i liked her style of writing and the characters were deep and complex would recommend","1363":" it is difficult to like this book there is no happiness for any of the characters no joy each child of hattie's is left with a legacy of pain and disappointment a yearning for something better hattie herself is little more than a conduit for the basic needs in life she provides food shelter and clothing but neglects the basic needs of the soul there is no love or nurturing in this household however each child holds memories of an angry and vengeful mother perhaps it would have been different if her first babies the twins had survived the initial chapter of the book is the only section that gives us a loving and caring mother the portion of hattie that had existed prior to their deaths seems to have died with them in its place is a hard woman a woman who has given all she has left to her children a view of the world that is harsh and unforgiving now even with the heavy subject matter the author has a gift for words she builds each character with words that flow and interweave to create the stories of each child of hattie's we see hattie through the eyes of her children we feel their need their bitterness and for some their eventual forgiveness this is not a book that i loved but it is a book that i will think about for some time","1364":"loved this book am usually not a fan of short stories but this was so well done that it really turned into a memoir of hattie","1365":"raw unpleasantly real and sad but well written and powerful writing no real story just a lot of sadness","1366":"it was an interesting approach to tell this story through the eyes of hattie and each of her children i found the writing very accessible but somehow felt there as too much missing from the lives of these characters by relying on this writing device","1367":"wow the story was powerful the characters intriguing and the storytelling remarkable strangely personal to me at times felt like ayana mathis stole a page out of the story of many black families during the great migration this book was a great way to start off my literary journey this year","1368":"i had great hopes for this book but while it was well written i hoped for something good to happen to at least one of her children","1369":"i was expecting a more climactic ending good read poor ending","1370":"hattie and her children and everyone surrounding them these people are real real in their suffering and their strength you just have to read this one there's nothing more i can say","1371":"this was more of a 2 5 for me","1372":" bleak and unsentimental yet you can't put it down these interconnected stories are a novel in the same vein as olive kitteridge and let the great world spin like olive hattie is a prickly heroine worn down by her life's experiences and much of the book's success hinges on your concern for her the author's deft narrative and beautiful writing carry the reader through this unsparing portrait of one family's history from thegreat migration into the 1980s also what sealed the five star rating for me was the ending which is perhaps one of the most solid confident endings to a novel that i have ever read","1373":"dr taylor below asked me my reasoning for two stars so i shall try my best to state whyi guess i should be forthright i'm not someone who enjoys an anthology of short stories i have a hard enough time saying goodbye to my characters after having just finished a 400page book while i knew that this would be separate vignettes about each of hattie's children i thought it would be better connected the stories to me had little to do with one another and i have to say that i didn't see myself even liking many of these characters was it because she spent about forty pages on them perhaps not only did this book lack any kind of connection between characters it lacked understanding for me at least between relationships as time progressed you'll read a story about one of her sons set in the 30s where little to nothing is mentioned of their siblings the following chapter is set in the 40s and you're suddenly jolted into another sibling's life trying to think about how this new person relates to the person you just read about in the previous chapter and often there would be little connection i was disappointed by this book i had started reading the warmth of other sons which i really ought to revisit and thought this would be a nice shorter and fictionalized read especially given wilkerson's review of the twelve tribes of hattie in the nyt book review i just ended up disappointed wanting more","1374":"really good book interesting format","1375":"i have wanted to read this book for quite some time i finally got the chance to listen to the unabridged version of the book i found the story disjointed the main character hattie had a gang of kids she was a teenage mom when the story began in philadelphia in the 20's the book jumped all over the place where the children were concerned i couldn't keep track and i was confused as to how many children she actually had towards the end i figured out she had 11 children in all there were so many stories to keep track of and some were interesting and some were not i could have done without the whole story line about franklin there were a few relationships i would have liked the author to explore more of such as the one with ella after hattie gave her to her sister to raise then there were two of her sons' floyd and six very interesting stories but we didn't get it all and there were passing mentions in later chapters about the two of them alice and billups had a strange relationship too but i was left wanting on that story too overall it was a pretty good read but i think since there were so many characters it was hard to go as in depth as was needed i would read another book by this author","1376":"i want a sequel to the book or more details to each character","1377":"this is a lovely book about hatie and her children her tribe the book goes forward and backward in time providing the reader with different insights on hatie and her children's lives hatie is a strong woman who is part if the great migration from the jim crow south to the north she and her children have experienced so many of life's ups and downs you just want to reach into the book to give them all a hug","1378":"i liked this book the chapters had a short story quality about them which i liked but aside from hattie there wasn't really a unifying element that would make it a novel","1379":"becuase this was an oprah book i was thinking i'd like this book more than i actually did i've liked almost all her recommendations they always have lots of drama and this one did for sure i can say it kept me interested but i wasn't into the down part of most of the short stories as each chapter is a short story about a pivitol moment in each of her children's and hers lives","1380":"wow not a single happy moment in the whole book it must have been difficult to come up with twelve depressing situations for these kids to be in not a favorite","1381":"the title didn't make any sense hattie had 9 children not 12 strange book","1382":"although extremely well written and able to engage a reader i struggled like many did to connect all of the stories i appreciate hattie's hopeful claiming of her granddaughter at the end but it was difficult to read story after story of how poverty and institutional racism destroyed hattie's children","1383":"luminous prose compelling characters i loved the story of floyd and the other children that are hattie's tribe memorable images that make you realize how hard life was for those who took on the great migration","1384":"this book is haunting and i must say reminds me somewhat of toni morrison's style yet it was uniquely ayana's wonderful use of language and imagery that is hers alone the tragedy of hattie's life to me is allowing her ability to be warm and loving die with earlier losses and the price her offspring had to pay for this lifelong trauma stereotypes abound but we know that there is some truth that is part of these formulaic perspectives the problem that most people of color fall victim to is that it becomes a group temperament for outsiders and sadly for many within it this particular genus may have contributed significantly to the success of ms morrison ms mathis and others who have the gift of weaving these tragic and memorable tales","1385":"the great migration was such a critical period in american history so i was intrigued with this novel that uses that moment as a jumping off point in some ways it read more like a series of short stories about different members of one family others have mentioned how dark this book is i will certainly agree and wish there had been at least one hopeful tale it had a strong start but by the end i was ready to move on","1386":" ayana mathis has been receiving a great deal of attention for her debut novel most notably being chosen as an oprah's book club selection i was interested to see what all of the hype was about this is the tale of hattie shepherd told through the stories of her children in many ways this novel reads more as a collection of short stories with hattie as the common thread the first story introduces us to hattie an african american woman who moved with her husband from rural georgia to philadelphia in the early part of the 20th century the young hattie has twin babies who we quickly learn are ill with pneumonia poor as the shepherds are they are unable to afford the medicine required to save their babies and hattie loses her first two children this tragedy haunts hattie and her husband august throughout the rest of their lives as the first short story suggests this is not a light happy read this novel highlights the struggle and hardship of being human particularly for a poor minority throughout the 20th century one criticism i've read about this novel is that there is too much suffering that mathis tried to fit too much into one book while i can certainly see where people are coming from i didn't feel that any of it was unnecessary mathis is an exquisite writer who manages to write truthfully with hope even throughout the dark topics of this novel mathis's writing was very reminiscent of edwidge danticat's work an author who has been celebrated by oprah winfrey as well fans of danticat's work will certainly enjoy this novel","1387":"reads and is written well not sure what i expected but this approach was interesting telling a tale through future generations but everyone's story was so gut wrenching and emotionally trying the heartache and desperation was palpable through each page","1388":"i like to read different viewpoints in a story it adds perspective for me this book missed the mark though there was too much left unsaid and i did not like the ending at all","1389":"if you are looking for a light hearted uplifting book this is not the book for you however that doesn't mean that it isn't an excellent read it is just tough from start to finish sometimes a tough read is just what you need to put your life in perspective","1390":"excellent book but would have liked closure at end of book","1391":"it took awhile for this book to grab me but it really did by the end hattie is an amazing character loved the ending","1392":"i tried to like the book but had difficulty liking hattie and several of her children couldn't one of them have gone on to college had a happy marriage volunteered","1393":"after just simply reading it i gave it 4 stars after my book group discussion i changed my mind to the 5 stars out of respect for the writing not that i found the content any more enjoyable","1394":"i truly enjoyed this book it's been almost a week since i finished and i'm still thinking about hattie i appreciated how the author told each sibling's story in different time period it not only gave you a sense of hattie's growth as a woman wife and mother but also provided an opportunity albeit a very brief one to gain additional insight into siblings whose story had already or had yet to be told while the chronology was beneficial for knowing hattie it did leave me wanting i wanted to know more of each sibling's story unfortunately the structural treatment only allowed a snapshot of who the siblings were normally at a time of crisis or change i also loved the imagery the author literally painted with words i could see the scenes and the characters in my mind she also had a way of capturing a concept or emotion using a handful of impactful words beautiful writing my favorite chapters were philadelphia and jubilee broke my heart belle scan da lous and six actually six wasn't a favorite just memorable he was the sibling i found most disagreeable this was a beautiful painful triumphant story can't wait for her second novel","1395":"i do not always enjoy oprahs recommended reads but i must say i found this one compelling so much heart ache in this story but the people never give up i found it to be well written and left me feeling i knew the characters personally","1396":"this book was well written but being that each chapter is about a different child and sometimes it was told by hattie but mostly it was told from the child's pov it was a bit disjointed you did get a glimpse of hattie's life but so often you never heard about the child after its chapter was done i wanted to know so much more about some of the characters it felt a bit like reading a collection of short stories you get a taste of things but don't know the whole picture","1397":" this book really struck a chord with me this would be a good choice for a book club there is much fodder for discussion analyzing all the characters motives the roots of everyone's unhappiness the historical significance of the great migration etc i just wish it had been a continuous narrative instead of split into a series of vignettes told from different points of view although i thought this was very well written and it evoked strong emotions i didn't think the voices were distinct enough i look forward eagerly to the next offering from this author","1398":"by the end of the first chapter i was crying the plot or plots rather suck you in i enjoyed this book much better than we sinners another book about a big family with each chapter told by a different sibling this one felt much more real much more down to earth the writing was so much more accessible i look forward to reading more by ayana mathis","1399":"loved this it made me cry ok so no happy endings but real because of this characters really moving particularly hattie and august hattie on the face of it cold and lacking emotion but this is the only way she coped with all that life threw at her about life motherhood hardship relationships discrimination would really recommend","1400":"excellent writing powerful read although the structure of the book feels disjointed more like a collection of related short stories i was not really wowed by it but really enjoyed this book","1401":"interesting story","1402":"beautifully written stories about hattie and her children each chapter dedicated to each child however these children never come together nor are their stories continued once the chapter ends for me this was more of a collection of short stories then a book and left me yearning for the characters that i liked and skimmed through the less interesting ones","1403":"this book just tore at me i put it down a few chapters in and didn't pick up my kindle for a month i finally came back and finished it it's a good book but an emotional read","1404":"what a depressing story not only did it end depressing the story never gave any closer to hattie's children very disappointed","1405":"i wanted more the characters were in one chapter and then abandoned i found it frustrating","1406":"i didn't enjoy reading a book about people in total misery it was well written but utterly bleak and there was not a character about whom i cared","1407":"i didn't really care for the book i tried i read the first chapter and didn't pick it up again for a while i read the second chapter i didn't pick it up for a longer while it was a book club read so i felt compeled to read more i read the last chapter that was okay i don't think it was bad necessarily just not a book that held my interest for this subject matter i much prefer the approach in warmth of other suns","1408":"would like to know what hattie thought maybe a chapter from her point of view would have been nice to read very sad and depressing","1409":" the story unfolds through short stories about hattie's children the 12 tribes of the title all revolving around the axis of hattie who moved to philadelphia from the south in the 1920s through grief poverty and youth she is unable to be the mother that the children need her to be unfortunately i think that the way the story is structured keeps you distant from the characters as you never really get to know any one strongly although in many ways it is how you'd know a family that you were acquainted with and their story without directly being told to answer a dear friend the writing was pleasant but not brilliant i did enjoy the glimpses into the great migration history but it wasn't fleshed out well for me i suspect there were some references that i missed though a book club read i'll be interested in hearing what others thought","1410":"very well written and exhausting am i to believe that a black woman of that era had twelve children and not one of them had a successful life i suppose it's possible almost a pity that such strong writing is devoted to the telling of such a disfunctional story it will be interesting to see what the author does next","1411":"very real if troubling story of a black woman transplanted to the north in the first part of 1900's and stories of the lives of her offspring engrossing and moving","1412":"i really enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book it has a zora neal hurston feel kind of a folksy yarn the narrators were excellent just the type of soothing voices that can spin yarn of a story i couldn't however believe it when i came to the end i wanted it to go on and on and i wondered what happened to one or some of the characters maybe the author purposely left us wanting more so that she can make a sequel seems like there is more to the story","1413":"an interesting technique to telling a generational story","1414":"while the premise of this book is very engaging i agree with a friend about it reading more like a collection of short stories rather than a novel as i am not a fan of short stories this was not a favorite","1415":"hard time getting into it but ended up really enjoying the story i wanted to dislike hattie but in the end could not help but admire her","1416":"i was primed to love this book after hearing the charming ayana mathis speaking about it at the national book festival in washington last month not to mention the numerous audience members who declared it the best book they have ever read it was not the best book i have ever read though i doubt i could name that without some extensive musing but i did enjoy the twelve tribes of hattie as an insight into the lives of african american people impacted by the jim crow laws in the south of the united states the 'twelve tribes' in question are the twelve people who depend on hattie to raise them and care for them eleven children and a grandchild and after the first chapter the book is told through their various voices the first chapter addresses the pivotal point in hattie's life the death of her first children her beloved twins that event changes hattie from the bright optimistic young girl whose voice is so charming on the page to a rather lost disappointed cynical woman who can only express her love for her children by grimly focusing on keeping them alive the first chapter is a delight though it made me cry but i'm not sure what to make of the rest of the chapters each chapter is a snapshot into the life of one of hattie's children and these provide interesting and varied insights into some of the paths that an african american person who grew up in relative poverty of money and affection in the mid 20th century might take the paths taken range from a life of preaching and womanizing to a jazz musician discovering his homosexuality to a soldier in vietnam to various versions of unhappy marriages and alcoholism struggling to move up the social classes and sometimes falling even lower while we receive these snapshots we receive insight into different aspects of hattie and slowly as the book progresses the sympathy for her that we originally had and started to lose midbook comes creeping back near the end i thought the book was patchy - using so many different voices can be risky because they inevitably hit different levels of compelling... in fact i found myself flicking through parts of a couple of the chapters though many of them held me i really liked the technique of revealing hattie through her children but i found it frustrating that each chapter felt as though it stood alone - it would have been much more pleasing for links and parallels and characters to run through the different stories as might reasonably be expected from the varied stories of one family it might also have been a more enjoyable read if at least some of hattie's charges had ended up happy or contented or even not entirely miserable or if any of the men in the book had turned out to be anything other than pathetic losers the book itself has quite an upbeat tone... but the more i read about these children doing so badly the more i felt pessimistic about the world it's like an anti american dream somehow all that said i would with caveats recommend the book it's an interesting read and historically informative it paints an intriguing picture of living in a certain time and place and many of the characters come alive off the page the writing is lovely and the technique of revealing hattie through the third person voices of her adult children while not perfectly rendered is compelling i think that those who adore this book relate to it in ways that i didn't but i still thought it was quite good","1417":" i grabbed this one because of oprah i mean she typically has good taste in novels though i don't always love them like she does i didn't know much about this one going into it i have a bad habit of not reading a book's description i just dive in so i didn't have any kind of expectation other than oprah liked it i did expect it to have some kind of story and that it lacked it's more connected stories about hattie and her children than the typical family saga there's no action that drives the story forward you get glimpses into hattie's family over many decades and i enjoyed that aspect much more in the early chapters but wanted a bit more of a story later on by the later chapters everything just became more sad but it started pretty sad so i guess i shouldn't have expected any kind of glimpse of hope it was a good read well written but not oh my goodness brilliant","1418":"this was really well written i wish though that the stories would have converged better","1419":"i really liked it in the beginning it had all the ingredients of a good oprah read but then towards the middle it slowed down and i got bored with it so basically skimmed the rest of the book to finish it i wanted to see how life affected hattie in the end","1420":"i liked it but i like depressing stories about dysfunctional people","1421":"while this was beautifully written and paints a very telling picture of the black american experience particularly with regard to the great migration it left me unfulfilled i would have come in with different expectations if it had been more clearly marketed as a series of vignettes and maybe enjoyed it more as it stands there are some children i'd have really liked to read more about and others whose chapters felt like a waste","1422":"good read excellent first book look forward to reading another would have liked to read more about hattie herself though she was summed up well in the statement about she gave her life to keeping her children alive","1423":"although this book had a lot of flaws i was entertained from the first word until the last this is just the kind of book that tends to resonate with me family drama mental illness and dysfunction and this book is packed full with all of those things i really enjoyed how the story was told through chapters in the voice of the various characters i thought it gave the reader an interesting perspective on the various characters over time the only negative about that approach was that some of the characters were underdeveloped and i wish we'd had more time getting to know them and seeing where they land the themes of poverty oppression sexuality mental illness and abuse were handled well the stories in this novel are not happy ones it's sad and frustrating there is little hope in what ayana mathis shares with these stories the cyclical nature of poverty and abuse is not a new concept but i think this book does a good job exploring these in a myriad of ways i kept hearing about how this book explored the great migration but frankly i think that is very misleading the great migration is perhaps 1% of the total story it's primarily a psychological study of this particular family it's essentially series of short stories about the various people in this particular family they are connected yet disconnected at the same time or at least that is how it felt to me the first chapter resonated with me the most perhaps its because i am a mom of twins and can't begin to imagine how i'd react to what hattie has to face in that chapter ayana mathis was able to make the events of that chapter leap off the page for me making it feel as if i was there with her experiencing each and every emotion myself it truly made me feel which i think is the mark of a good story the primary flaw for me was that the novel definitely felt like it was written by a first time novelist it had that feeling that first books often have as if it was not quite what it could have been the book didn't quite come together as well as i think it could have there were structural issues with the novel that made it less successful overall and i have to admit that there were times when i did find some of the stories to be contrived and even far fetched yet i was engaged so i don't think it had a huge impact but it was a thought that came to mind as i was reading anyway i think this one is quite good but not great it really could have been great i think i suspect that we will be seeing great things from ayana mathis in the years to come she is obviously talented and i am interested to see what she brings to the table in future novels as she matures as a novelist i think she has potential to blow us away one day i liked that the book didn't end with everything tied up neatly with a bow i liked the ambiguity of what happens to these people i liked that the ending seemed to acknowledge that there was no magic bullet making everything ok there isn't necessarily redemption but let's face it happy endings aren't always realistic i thought the ending of this novel fit with the flow of the story and i felt satisfied with how it all ended i was pleasantly surprised at how much i liked this novel although i definitely think it's not for everyone i really did like this one i think it's got a lot of interesting things to talk about and explore but it's not light and airy it's dark and sad if you're comfortable with going to dark places this just might be the novel for you","1424":"this is a first novel and a pretty amazing first it's a bit choppy in parts but the skill of the author in having each chapter be the story of one of the twelve main characters yet manage to tie them together in an overall theme is impressive","1425":"beautifully written but thoroughly depressing","1426":"wow does this book polarise readers and reviewers missing from the picture to the left is the sticker on the copy i read 'i can't remember when i read anything that moved me quite this way besides toni morrison' oprah winfrey endorsement enough you may think after all oprah's book club list is notable for some great reading as well as some not so great and she has a massive following in the us so you kind of get the feeling that you should love this especially if you are of african american descent but it would appear not it is moving but not as moving as i would have thought it isn't so much the subject matter that seems to be the problem hattie shepherd is a young teenager when she moves with her mother and sister from the violence and segregation of jim crow georgia being white middle class female living in the racially harmonious paradise of new zealand i had to look this up to philadelphia in the 1920s as part of the great migration i had to look this up too naturally things do not go as planned for hattie and at 17 she finds herself married to august and the mother of twins things rapidly go downhill from thereon and 55 years later when the book ends hattie has had eleven children and one grandchild the twelve tribes of hattie the biblical references are everywhere in this novel as are the trials and tribulations that hattie's children are burdened with the problem with this book is in the way the story is told each chapter is set in a different year over the 55 year period and about a different child so there is a fair amount of jumping around some of the chapters have hattie the mother as a dominant character others barely mention her in others she is a strong presence but only in a background way equally so the father august who is continuously portrayed as as a useless lazy drunkard in fact none of the men including the sons seem to have a single redeeming feature the children all seem to be damaged in some way the 15 year old boy left with a life long scar after a childhood accident who discovers he is a gifted preacher the young man who goes to vietnam and realises he is a clone of his father the daughter who makes a respectable marriage to a doctor who continually feeds her sleeping pills the daughter who is schizophrenic and so it goes on it is bewildering to me that out of a family of 11 children nothing seems to go right for any of them two we don't really know about as they are babies one is adopted by hattie's sister the pain in this chapter is hattie's and the other is not august's child again the pain is hattie's each of the chapters reads more like a short story rather than a continuous thread and this for me is the problem there is no interconnection between the chapters not only in time from 1925 to 1948 to 1950 to 1954 to 1968 for example but also in subject matter what happens in one chapter has no relevance to the previous or the next chapters the last two chapters excepted throughout the book there is very little about the family as a whole about aspirations and dreams the parents may have for their children and very little if any background as to the circumstances that led each child to be in their current predicaments i wanted to know more and it simply wasn't there perhaps the most surprising omission was anything to do with the civil rights movement this lack of rights is what led to hattie being in philadelphia in the first place possibly the single most significant event in her life and yet not one single chapter child has anything to do with this crucial time in america's recent history despite all this the quality of the writing is stunning the author gets inside the heads of her characters so cleverly we feel sympathy frustration and annoyance that they are in their current predicaments how easily do we really control our own destinies or are we are a product of our upbringings poor hattie has a tough road as a mother of 11 and wife to the hopeless august who wouldn't have a tough road with all that going on perhaps it is hardly surprising the way things turn out for her 12 tribes and i am sure this novel reflects the lives of many many women and families around the world above all else this is really a story about motherhood and love you wonder as a mother if you have enough love to give all your children whether you have two or twelve it may be patchy at times hidden while dealing with all the other stuff either not expressed or expressed in strange ways but if this book is anything to go by it is definitely there","1427":"quick but compelling read more like short stories than a complete novel easily recognizable and relatable characters","1428":"i really wanted to like this more than i did since the storyline sounded interesting u0026amp it was a 1st novel however the character development was weak u0026amp it was hard to stay interested","1429":"this book is very difficult to rate it is written very well but is somewhat scattered and feels somewhat incomplete and each page brought me down but i was very engaged and the characters were very worth exploring","1430":"ayana mathis is a beautiful writer and that is what compelled me to keep reading i never got so drawn into the character's stories that i wanted to read more about them but her prose was so beautiful that it kept the pages turning","1431":"this book was captivating from the beginning through to the end i thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning about each and every one of the characters and their stories very touching and brutally honest","1432":"this book is difficult to review i think the author tried too much and failed you get a very small glimpse of each of hatties children and thats it no follow up or closure with any of them poorly written waste of time","1433":" this book is essentially twelve short stories that are connected by a common thread hattie as a young newlywed she lost her twin babies a boy named philadelphia and a girl named jubilee she never quite got over their deaths made all the more devastating with the realization that all it would have take to save their live was some medication which she could not afford over the years she and her husband august went on to have nine more children and each chapter of this book tells part of their story although each story is compelling in its own right i was most drawn to floyd's chapter floyd was a travelling womanizing musician who also happened to be on the down low he had and attraction to men after i finished reading his chapter i craved more i was left wondering if he ever learned to accept his homosexuality especially after his little episode with the guy in the woods truthfully floyd's story as all of the others could have been a book on its own as much as i enjoyed reading this book i also found it to be very frustrating as i said before each chapter was compelling and i wanted to know more about each person i almost felt cheated i was teased and drawn into each story and when they ended i was left needing more not fair at all to say that mathis is a truly gifted writer would be an understatement she is phenomenal and i look forward to reading what she has to offer in the years to come","1434":"read this just after henrietta lacks these two books compliment each other well two sides of a strikingly similar family story","1435":"a fascinating portrait of a woman mostly told through the eyes of her children i say portrait but its more like a bas relief carving of hattie a character more defined by the outlines surrounding her we only rarely hear from hattie directly her descendants do most of the talking but in the negative space left over you see a complex woman a highly skilled first novel i'm interested to see what the author does next","1436":"very well written introduced me to a family dynamic that brought home the fact that if momma ain't happy ain't nobody happy","1437":"didn't like it to many characters being depressed","1438":"america's ugly racial heritage is explored through the lives and loves of hattie opening with a heart wrenching loss of her twins it comprises decades of struggle triumph loss compromise and finally survival mathis has done a beautiful job of telling a sorrowful tale in the end hattie is a hero as she survives for the sake of her children it is a book that you will not want to read twice but you wont ever forget","1439":"in the line of olive kitteridge and interpretation of maladies however just doesn't quite reach the same heights 3","1440":"the story begins in 1923 hattie settles into what may be a better life in philadelphia than she would have had in georgia the story is so full of regret by every character the story is devastating and rarely uplifting the character depictions are excellent it was full of emotional strife there is tenderness and compassion i found it an emotional draining read it is an excellent first novel this is an a writer to watch","1441":"excellent read a chapter given to individual children of hattie a strong black woman who had to raise them with sheer determination and little else","1442":"i'm torn on this one parts of it were really good but you only get a tiny peek into each child's story i need more to go on to figure out hattie","1443":"i tried really tried to read this book a chapter a kid just killed me after the character never appeared again in the book just not my style","1444":"such a powerful read i found myself having to put it down and take really long breaks from it because of its realness the characters are super well developed and it's almost like a collection of intertwined short stories a great book but very raw and very sad highly reccomend","1445":"a truly remarkable book i love the way mathis reveals the life long evolution of the main character through the eyes of her children i like the movement through time and the shifts in perspective","1446":"i thought the writing was wonderful and the format of the book was clever ultimately i felt a deep sadness for hattie the only thing about the format is that after i was introduced to a character that was it we don't know what became of them overall i really enjoyed this book","1447":"seemed a little disjointed and did not connect at the end really left going huh","1448":"i think this book has a really interesting premise and the idea of dedicating a chapter to each sibling and spanning the 1920s 1980s is great but because there was little interaction between the siblings the book just didn't really hang together properly for me it almost felt more like a series of short stories than a complete novel it would have been sufficient just to have the characters reference each other a bit more so that we'd know how each sibling ended up but there was little even in that regard also it was just so bleak how many problems can one family have i found it a bit of a slog to get through","1449":"actually this is a 3 5 i wanted to like it enough for 4 stars but i just couldn't do it","1450":"hard to believe this is her first book a very interesting read creatively structured","1451":"some were really good and some were just dull so it all averaged out i guess","1452":"your life is a reaction to your childhood no one really comes out okay tenderness and love are as important for kids as food and shelter","1453":"not sure i liked the lack of connection as the book progressed chapters were very independent for the most part sad and a bit depressing reminded me of how lucky i was to be born in an era of birth control choices for women","1454":"great writing but with each chapter about a different character i didn't feel i got to know what made any of them tick","1455":"this wasn't a bad book it was interesting in parts it shows a glimpse of the lives of several children within the same family who grew up not truly understanding their mother's love for them unfortunately all if the stories were not interesting to me i'm glad i read it but also glad it's over","1456":"what a beautifully written book i just love it when somebody's first novel reads like they were born to write i was in a frame of mind to pay attention to the writing and i was awed by her use of language metaphor dialogue each chapter of this book could be a standalone short story each one is about a different character except that they all revolve around the central character of hattie what astounded me was mathis's ability to climb inside each of these characters to give each one a completely unique voice history personality each child has his own troubles his own challenges each one is a wonderful story on its own i love a collection of stories that are interconnected but this is even more than that it's actually a chronological telling of a single story but in a wide reaching way starting with hattie and moving through each of her many children one by one we meet each one at a single point in his life and through that we grow to know hattie's whole life story each child has a different relationship to his mother perceives her slightly differently from the way the others do so that by the end we have this nicely rounded picture of her too i really really enjoyed this book a great concept and a really good story","1457":" i wavered between 2 and 3 stars this book is beautifully written and compelling but i rated it only okay because i found it to be depressing and sad without the uplifting and powerful message that many books like this one have i had a lot of sympathy for hattie and i guess in the end the reader is left with a small sense of hope but it wasn't enough for me i felt sorry for all of the characters on one hand but on the other hand they all seem pathetic and incapable of taking care of themselves i guess i was overwhelmed by their failures and i will admit that i pass judgement on hattie i am probably being completely insensitive to the issues of poverty and race and gender that transcend all of the characters and their experiences but ultimately i'm left feeling discouraged and sad","1458":"warning very good but very sad","1459":"i liked the stories about hattie and her children it was sad how hard she had to work so hard to keep so many in food and clothing without hardly any help from her husband and how she never had anything for herself it was unfortunate that she had so many it was hard to hear how so many of them led such unfortunate lives after she tried so hard to prepare them for life on their own it shows that just keeping them alive and fed and dressed is not enough humans require touching and carressing and hugging not just when they are babies","1460":"although at times this book was relentlessly sad the thing that kept me reading was the resilience and in some cases the hope of hattie and her children despite all the odds","1461":"challenge a book with a number in the title","1462":"i liked the story a lot but not the structure every time a chapter ended i dreaded starting a new one hattie's character did evolve beautifully throughout the book though so at worked well 3 5 stars","1463":"heartbreaking in fact a bit too heartbreaking it is hard to believe that one unhappy life could have spawned so much unhappiness a little bit of balance is needed","1464":"this book was everything oprah said it would be i loved it i felt so sorry for hattie and i could understand why she did what she did sometimes it was a good read full of feelings and history","1465":"the writing is stunning and the stories of hattie and her children whisper uncomfortable truths about the legacies parents bequeath their children and the heartbreak children deliver their parents in return the dialogue is achingly authentic the voices strong i'm still processing the structure it's unconventional but i really enjoyed the book","1466":"i thought this was an interesting story i liked the approach the author took telling each child's story and not necessarily in birth order the characters will stay with me for a while","1467":"disappointed not what i was expecting","1468":"i didn't really enjoy reading the story because as one reviewer noted it was somewhat painful to read there was too much dysfunction for me however it was well written and interesting to read about each of the different characters featured in the chapters","1469":"really wanted more story about each of the characters but i guess each could be their own book some really intense writing very toni morrison actually i got tangled up with hattie's kids and the home story","1470":"2 5 the writing was very good but the story was not compelling not much of a plot to speak of and just as soon as i started getting into one character the chapter would end and we'd start all over","1471":" i'm surprised this book has been given some low ratings i really liked it this was a 'summer read' for me nothing too heavy u0026amp nothing chick lit it kept me interested u0026amp wondering about the characters i am very much a fan of books that follow different people piecing together the connections therefore you might get frustrated if you need a book that has a character s or storyline that gives you a beginning middle u0026amp end that doesn't leave you questioning u0026amp wondering 'whatever happened to","1472":"strong characters for all the dysfunction in their lives","1473":"the book started out strong and immediately pulled me in but reading it was getting a little tedious toward the end one reason it redeemed itself was the ending which i loved i did like the book but it was unsatisfying having the chapter end just as you wanted to know more about each character some of the characters are mentioned in the end and we see what happens but i wondered about the rest of them i sort of wanted to read about how they ended up as well that's really what stopped me from giving this book four stars but i still enjoyed it","1474":"this is not the color purple i couldn't get past the section with the extremely graphic homosexual encounter in the woods the characters were not ones i felt emotionally invested in and not ones i wanted to continue to read about did not like this book could not make myself finish it very happy it was a library book not since jane smiley's moo have i wanted to throw a book across the room","1475":"really enjoyed reading this book hated to leave the characters behind sort of felt unfinished but i guess we are supposed to imagine how their lives might have turned out connecting the children a bit more would have been easier to follow still very captivating and honest picture of how people struggle to cope and survive","1476":"i did not like this book not enough character development as it jumped around chapters about each of hattie's children i didn't like any of the characters and while i can appreciate the author clearly has an underlying talent i just didn't like the story she was telling overall","1477":"2 5 maybe this just wasn't my kind of book there was no cohesive plot the first story brought me to tears and then we went in a totally different seemingly random direction that i mostly skipped because it was too risque looking at reviews here i figured out what was happening with the story so that took that confusion away but nothing in the writing made me particularly care about any of the kids if the chapters had been in a different order it may have worked better for me that floyd one pretty much turned me off and the six one didn't really help even if it made things more understandable this may not have been ideally suited for an audiobook for some reason they randomly changed readers for some chapters but not all of them so i don't know what that was about","1478":" i want to say that i did not read this book because of oprah winfrey i got a new nook hd for christmas and found i could install the overdrive app on it i had a nook 1st edition but never put a library book on it because it was too confusing with the overdrive app i can download ebooks from my library directly to my nook that is wicked cool one of the first books that came up in browsing the library was the twelve tribes of hattie i had recently heard it discussed on the books on the nightstand podcast and read a terrific review in the new york times book review so i thought i'd give it a shot the twelve tribes of hattie isn't technically a novel it's more a collection of short stories about hattie shepherd's 11 children and 1 grandchild i found it to be very moving it's definitely worth reading","1479":"interesting writing styles and a compelling idea but none of the characters resonated with me i felt i was reading about strangers instead of friends and so much sadness","1480":"this book was good it tells many very sad but authentic stories of hattie and hattie's 11 children hattie is a product of the great migration moving to philadelphia from the south some of the poorer reviews here of this book are from people who don't like depressing but that doesn't matter to me if the stories are about what real lives can be like and i learn something from having read them","1481":"i had to stop at 1975 while the concept of different children telling their stories is interesting there was no coming together the more i read the more depressed and alienated i felt so many negative stereotypes just became tougher to digest i tried and wanted to love this but i just couldn't","1482":"i normally read books in hopes that i will be frustrated that they are over so soon which is exactly how i felt with this one i related to every character in some way and didn't at all mind the format since the book ended up reading like an interconnected collection of abstract short stories well worth the buy","1483":"amazing so emotionally charged and raw it's an extremely short book as well easy to get into and hard to put down","1484":"while hattie had a hard heart towards her nine children i had to admire her tenacity to live through hard times of a black southern woman who escapes to the north following her family growing and developing it was interesting seeing what impact her personality had on each of her children enjoyable read great for a bookclub","1485":"i found this incredibly powerful delicious writing one of my favorites in recent years","1486":" oprah and i just don't seem to be on the same wavelength when it comes to rating literature and the twelve tribes of hattie is a case in point first time novelist ayana mathis is a decent writer but the structure of her book is seriously lacking the phrase twelve tribes presumably refers to protagonist hattie shepherd's descendants i counted eleven children plus a grandchild it's not clear that these are properly characterized as tribes all the more so given that two of them die in infancy and even though they are for the most part at least siblings one would hardly know that from reading the individual chapters for the tribes are mostly presented in isolation from each other accordingly in what is essentially a book of unconnected short stories characters remain under developed and no real sense of the shepherd family ever emerges nor is there any closure to this novel overall the individual stories are fairly well done describing lives that are anything but upbeat they feature alcohol and drug abuse poverty gambling racism abandonment etc mathis' narrative voice is pretty solid but when she has her characters speak for themselves their self expression often takes on a level of sophistication that is much less suitable to them than to their author a graduate of the iowa writers' workshop not only did oprah select this book for her revived book club the formidable michiko kakutani described it in her new york times review as an astonishingly powerful novel and another nyt reviewer characterized it as deeply felt that's what the pros say as for the prose i calls it as i sees it","1487":"hattie a young black woman moves from georgia with her mother and sister for a better life in the north in the early 1920s she marries august who brings her disappointments she has nine more children this is an intergenerstional story that follows the lives includomg love as well as bitterness in the promise of a better life for hattie and her children","1488":"very difficult to review this it's very powerful writing with strong character development although the book focuses on hattie's children every story is continued insight into hattie herself that is why it feels a little disjointed you only hear a snippet of each child's life but their outcome is not important the relevance of their story is to develop hattie's overall i really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others i received my copy as part of a goodreads giveaway","1489":"the 12 tribes are all of hattie's children and each chapter describes an episode in the life of each of them this one is our may bookclub selection and i've got to say it was ok but didn't wow me leisa","1490":"wow this was a great book completely unexpected from a first time author","1491":"a bit depressing but probably a pretty realistic story for the children of hattie well written","1492":" i enjoyed reading this book and would actually like to give it 3 and a half stars the book begins with hattie pregnant at 16 and she marries august the father they move from georgia to philadelphia hoping for a better life this first pregnancy is twins that die soon of pneumonia and hattie is crushed their marriage deteriorates from that point on but they go on to have 9 more children the rest of the novel is about each of these 9 children there is a chapter devoted to each one of them the time span covered is 1925 to 1980 the book does an excellent job of demonstrating the difficulties and challenges that african american people faced during that time poverty discrimination and womanizing by august the husband however all of this still exists today especially among those less unfortunate people","1493":"outstanding debut novel very engaging story told through the lives of hattie shepard's children this is a story that will stick with me for some time","1494":"didn't love the short story feel of it there was so little connection between the siblings and their chapters couldn't help compare it to we sinners which felt more connected but other than that it was a thoughtful book that offered a lot of different kinds of unhappiness to think about","1495":"like most oprah picks this book was heartbreaking a good read but it left me sad","1496":"excellent writing found myself rereading sentences because they were constructed so beautifully","1497":" it is 1925 in philadelphia an inexperienced and terrified seventeen year old hattie shepherd desperately tries to keep her pneumatic twin babies alive the doctor's medicine is not working and neither are steam treatments or hot mustard poultices as she watches her tiny children die hattie's heart is irrevocably broken for her nine following children the aftermath of this tragedy is felt deeply as hattie directs all her love into keeping them alive this constant battle leaves no room for sentiment or affection which is the one thing they all crave through her children's eyes we see hattie's never ending hardships as she fights against extreme poverty hunger an adulterous husband homesickness and shame the twelve tribes of hattie is an incredible tale spanning six decades of american history every chapter is told from a different child's perspective and through them we experience the racism of the jim crow era the difficulties faced by homosexuals in the 40s the power of religion sexual abuse war and madness despite their flaws each protagonist is depicted with heartbreaking tenderness as their thoughts constantly refer back to their mother although these children cannot see it the reader will realise that every decision this strong woman makes is motivated by an almost overwhelming love for each of her babies and an utter devotion to keeping all of them alive a stunning beautiful story of love sorrow family and hope","1498":"notionally i liked the individual children per chapter but i thought at some point the book would intertwine the children's lives to get clear picture of the family dynamic not just different perspectives at different ages in the children's lives the book wound up leaving too much of a gap for me i would have stopped reading it at some point had i bored of it so that being said at least it was well written even if it left me curious about large lapses of time","1499":"very well done but kind of a downer","1500":"i loved each of hattie's children and the way her story is told through them i would have liked to know some of them better maybe a few of them will become novels themselves what a hard life hattie has but she pushes on and never gives up her dream of owning a house it seems like such a small thing but to know hattie's life and her disappointments is to understand how important dreams are","1501":"book was okay if i hadn't been listening to it i likely would not have read it just wasn't that interesting yes hattie lost her twin babies and yes she had more children whom she never loved but it just wasn't that great a book","1502":"absorbing but not necessarily uplifting i liked the unique structure of each chapter being about one or two of her children but it kept the story from gaining momentum worth reading","1503":"i read this book over and over again the characters were wonderful and the storytelling was unique i love this book","1504":"i can trully identify with hattie the main character of the book but the end leaves you with many questions","1505":" great historical fiction about an african american matriarch and her twelve children the characters are richly described especially how the mother relates uniquely to each of her children this provides a multifaceted view of hattie most interesting was the depth of hattie's heart for her children she lets go and holds on tenaciously even when other mother's would not have had the strength or courage to do so i highly recommend this book to anyone who loves the complexity of characters especially within the family and to anyone who enjoys historical fiction","1506":"this book made me so tired of children for this poor protagonist all of the children of this poor lady were hard and strained on her since they really never really let go and are still making more children you can see her growing tired of little mouths to feed and her unreliable husband if you want to feel really tired about life as a whole this is perfect honestly had to take a nap after to gather my optimism back","1507":"life is hard but couldn't some of these people have caught some kind of break","1508":"not a fan i need to learn my lesson when it comes to oprahs book choices","1509":"this book knocked me right out really good if you have something against oprah books of which this is one put it aside to enjoy this","1510":"so well written bravo to ayana mathis first book written","1511":"read up to page 160 and lost interest","1512":"eh ok story but i think oprah needs to expand her horizons a bit","1513":"i am going to qualify my review by saying that my wife loved this book and gave it five stars my impression of the book changed with time my initial beef with it was that hattie's family seemed to run the breadth of historical experience it reminded me of an old ridiculous tv movie the '60s 1999 wherein one brother's a marine in vietnam one brother's an sds style activist and the sister's a hippie history is more subtle than this having just marked another anniversary of 9 11 we know that you didn't have to be related to a victim of 9 11 to be affected by the fallout not everyone was on the lusitania i thought that the history was too explicit and dramatic in the twelve tribes of hattie and it seemed lesser than works like jonathan franzen's freedom or e l doctorow's ragtime wherein the characters are of their time but not necessarily interacting directly with events the book seemed too much like a soap opera as i was struggling to finish the book my beef changed it became my goodness these people are miserable it reminded me of there eyes were watching god but there are two key components that make hurston's a much better book 1 hurston's prose is brilliant and mathis is a pedestrian stylist 2 janie and teacake had some fun the bleakness of mathis' characters became overwhelming and unrealistic people struggle in life i don't doubt it but eventually they have some fun mathis' was like a dystopian nightmare world my inner voice says well maybe some people are living in a dystopian nightmare world maybe mathis is keeping it real and this is where i think the hurston comparison is apt janie struggled janie was dirt poor but her life was not made up exclusively of struggle life is not made up exclusively of struggle it reminds me of a line in vonnegut's breakfast of champions trout was petrified there on forty second street it had given him a life not worth living but i had also given him an iron will to live this was a common combination on the planet earth mathis' world was made up of these miserable fallen people that i did not enjoy spending time with their stories didn't resonate with me i thought the story sounded like the work of a precocious graduate student mathis' treatment was too thin she didn't produce a believable novel instead the twelve tribes of hattie is an unbelievable short story collection based on my wife's and i differences and it's 3 45 rating i suspect takes on this book vary widely it must not be for everybody p s i enjoyed the amazon review that cites mathis' misandry http www amazon com twelve tribes h the men in this book are either frauds criminals serial adulterers or gamblers and they're all underemployed or sporadically employed the characterizations remind me of birth of a nation wait there is one doctor in a terrible and loveless marriage","1514":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here chapters to this book are as follows 1925 philadelphia u0026amp jubilee 1948 floyd 1950

young age hattie has married her no good doer lazy philandering husband august who is mostly away from the household and usually comes home drunk and flat broke from a night out with his buddies in the beginning of her marriage hattie a baby herself and inexperienced tragically loses her twins to bad health but her and her husband get on with life the best way they know how they have more

writing style and structure of the author and also get a glimpse of the fates of these characters for yourself you must delve into the painfully dark world of hattie and find out more about her and her tribe overall a definite must read and happy to say you won't want to put this book down that is if you have the physical book version otherwise make sure your devices are on full battery happy reading more","1515":"this was not what you would call a uplifting book in that the children of ms hattie did not have an easy or fruitful lives it was interesting and pretty detailed on the life struggles each dealt with i am someone who likes happy endings or at worst resolution of an issue s i did not get that state of mind when i finished this book","1516":"the stories were individually all very well written but as a whole the book was disjointed and unsatisfying","1517":" the twelve interconnected stories of this book follow the lives of the children of hattie a young southern african american women who leaves the south in 1925 for the promise of a better life in philadelphia sometimes it felt like i was reading a book of stand alone short stories but ultimately all the stories did keep tying back into hattie and her life the book as a whole was wonderfully written but each story seemed to get more and more depressing still it was a great read especially for a debut novel i would definitely read her next work","1518":"i actually really enjoyed this book even though each chapter was about a different person they were still connected to hattie so it gave a good idea of hattie's life with her children and an appreciation of her deep commitment to her family","1519":"would give it 3 5 a bit disjointed and no continuity between the characters not a bad read and i would say worth a try","1520":"i felt kind of cheated it's written almost in short story style a couple of the characters i would have liked so much more there are too many unanswered questions in this book i was particularly disappointed with the ending i didn't hate the book but not loving it either having said that there is enough there for me to see the potential in this author's writing style i would probably give her books a second chance","1521":"3 5 starseach of the stories are wonderfully told but i would have liked to see a bit more cohesion between them","1522":"much like olive kitteridge this is the story of one woman told from several points of view franklin's story was my favorite but they were all wonderfully told characters were so well formed as to stay with me occupying a corner of my mind even now three days later","1523":"this was disappointing while mathis is certainly a good writer i was frustrated that i only got to learn a little bit about each character as each chapter in the book was about a different one of hattie's children also it seemed sad that most of them ended up in hopeless life situations does this really reflect children of the great migration","1524":"beautiful bare harsh sad this is a book that will evoke a range of emotions as you weave through time and the stories of hattie and her family nothing is ever as it seems and love duty and dignity come in all forms","1525":"good book i like way it is a separate story by each of her 12 children","1526":"interesting book well written overall a depressing tone though wouldn't read when i was sad","1527":"i tried but i couldn't read this bleak disjointed series of stories about dysfunctional people","1528":"really enjoy the writing style not an upbeat story but a great read especially for her first novel","1529":"i really wanted to like this book but everything in it was too negative","1530":"i've never read an oprah book club book but being a fan of historical fiction i jumped on it hattie was a mother of 9 children her life is written via the nine viewpoints of her children over the years yes it sounds like a chicklit book but unlike others it was quite thought provoking and i had a continual sense of darkness while reading it","1531":"beautifully written story about motherhood that speaks to the darker aspects not often shared i like that the story was woven together though the different stories of her children over time such heartbreak but understanding none the less of how they came to be","1532":" i wanted to like this book i heard the author on an npr podcast and she intrigued me especially with the samples she read on air i downloaded this from the library and enjoyed the first chapter but it deteriorated from there the language is beautiful which is what earned two stars the author brings you into the world of each of these people quite vividly but that only increases the dissatisfaction with the whole book each section is a brief peek into the life of one of hattie's children there is no context set no relationship to any of the other siblings for the most part you are just dropped down into a brief moment in their lives the only thread is hattie and she is little mentioned in most of the children's stories it is also a very depressing book almost every adult has ended up dysfunctional alcoholic mentally ill emotionally stunted it is a terrible commentary on the impact that the great migration had on some african american families a bleak portrait of the outcome i just learned that oprah selected this book and it is beyond me why maybe she wanted to promote the first book of this obviously talented writer but the book is nearly stillborn in its lack of plot or coherence i would not recommend this i kept reading it hopes it would come together in the end but alas it did not","1533":" i generally like short story collections and i generally like story collections that have a thread that makes them feel more like a novel like olive kitteridge but this novel fell into a different category a short story collection presented as a novel but one in which stories were only connected tangentially this is a long way of saying that while i was very taken with some chapters on their own i got frustrated that we never really heard from some characters again except for passing mentions also i never felt that connected to hattie as she came and went through stories and i only got to know her via other characters talking about her i feel like the connecting thread should have been stronger or not at all so i wouldn't feel so jarred in olive kitteridge which had its own problems i felt like the author kept the title character around just enough to feel like it hit just that right balance of short story collection and satisfying narrative thread also i think this book ran out of steam in the last 3 tribes 3 1 2 stars mainly for some very well written chapters","1534":" on the one hand i loved this book and these stories were amazing and on some nights i really couldn't put the book down on the other hand i kind of felt like the author could have revisited some of the characters and their drama i mean did i just read the beginning of several different stories without the satisfaction of an end to any of them i feel like i need to see a continuation of this very well written moving thought provoking and colorful drama or set of dramas hmm part 2 in the works i would definitely read it that's for sure","1535":"interesting","1536":"powerful writing not a single wasted syllable sad story of a woman's strength and fortitude throughout her life each chapter tells the story of one of her children coming from a large family i enjoyed the individual narratives it showcased each one of them as unique hattie never gave up","1537":"although billed as a novel it really isn't nor is it a short story collection either as the chapters are not truly self contained beyond being uncertain and uncommitted about its identity it is unrelentingly depressing a barrage of gambling drunkenness poverty madness but with no characters you can really invest in since they'll be largely absent come the next chapter i think the author probably has a great novel in her but this wasn't it","1538":"during trying economic times hattie loses her baby twins at age 17 and then goes on to raise 9 more children in the span of 50 years she also shares the inequalities of african americans and civil rights","1539":"another long story about poor people with characters i never really got into it moved forward chapter by chapter but often it took am a long time to figure out how everyone was related","1540":"a beautifully written and captivating book it reminded me of toni morrison u0026amp also that the iowa writer's workshop turns out some great authors","1541":"this is one of the best books i've ever read it's up there with the known world and song of solomon it was a major page turner but i would be remiss if i didn't add that in my opinion this is also a very depressing book that is one issue i have with books from this era by black authors my grandparents moved from the south the nyc during this time so these books help me understand their journey and while life ain't no crystal stair i'd like to believe their lives weren't bleak i'd still recommend this book to anyone who asks you learn a lot about people and how the smallest incident or the biggest can change your life","1542":"this story was haunting written as a series of vignettes each about one of the children of a poor african american woman mathis weaves a tale of poverty and disappointment sprinkled with hope","1543":"the author did a remarkable job telling the story of hattie shepherd's family with linked narratives about her 11 children and 1 grandchild over 55 years but when i finished the book i was left wanting more i wish she had added another chapter or two to give closure to what becomes of all of hattie's family members","1544":" this book is a series of short stories about the children of an african american woman named hattie who left 1920s georgia in search of a better life in the north at first i was drawn into the story but i grew disappointed with the manner in which the story was told each chapter focused on a different one of hattie's children in different time periods despite each of the chapters being about the same family the characters that weren't the focus of that chapter were rarely mentioned so i was left wanting more i wanted to know what happened to the characters over time and that wasn't there","1545":"well written many flawed characters in places very sad","1546":"i can't decide how i feel about this book for the first half of it i felt frustrated the book is essentially a collection of short stories each chapter about one of hattie's children the writing is quite powerful in that in each short chapter i felt like i wanted to know more about that character but then boom the chapter is over and the reader is on to another child it keeps the book from gaining real momentum by the end though the reader knows that one chapter doesn't connect to the next except for the peripheral character of hattie that is woven throughout all of the chapters and the life of hattie is told through her children albeit in a unflattering way that part is cool can't decide if i should give it a four just for uniqueness it reminds a bit of the style of the book olive kitteridge","1547":"not exactly a cheerful read but full of beautiful writing about an african american family so exactly a kind of book oprah would like","1548":"this wasn't what i expected the story left more questions than answers you wanted to know more about the each child it was interesting as it was from a african american american perspective and their view of each other and the world around them i wish there was more i felt like this was an outline not enough interaction between tribes","1549":"i want to know more about each and every character the author leaves you hungry for more great writing absorbing tales","1550":"this was a wonderfully told history of one women's difficult life and the lives of her children","1551":"amazing debut for a novelist i loved it from the very beginning her characterizations are so descriptive and full of life and seem to be such accurate portrayals i felt as if i were transported in time","1552":"good but bleak","1553":"i don't often give 5 stars such beautiful writing of heart wrenching stories i liked the idea of separate chapters for the characters","1554":"stopped reading 3 chapters in slow moving unlikable characters don't believe the oprah hype","1555":" the first time out for this young writer and she hit a home run each chapter a snapshot of a chapter in the life of some of hattie's children beginning in chapter one with the untimely and preventable death of her infant twins of pneumonia and following the lives of five of her other children from 1925 to the 1980's all were left scarred by how they were raised by a mother who'd tragically lost her first borns and who proceeded to raise her subsequent brood with care but seemingly without love all were scarred and none understood or forgave redemption does come in the end with hattie's granddaughter all the children were not described which somewhat disappoints a part ii would welcome excellent and thoughtful read","1556":"the consensus from our book club is that she was a good mother she clothed and fed her children however the endings to the story of each child may beg to differ on that assessment keeping hope alive for ella wondering what does it take to be a good mother and who judges you on that criteria your child or society","1557":"i really liked this book very interesting historically because you can see some of the battles migration and first post migration generation of african americans had to fight ending is good too","1558":" this book is a difficult one to assess on one hand the writing is powerful and the themes are important ones to discuss as americans on the other hand the book reads more like a collection of short stories rather than a novel each chapter is dedicated to one or two of hattie's children and told from their point of view after each character gets their debut we hear very little of them and their stories are left open ended and unresolved in addition to this mass collection of fragmented points of view hattie is the center of blame for her children's terrible ends all eleven of her children lead depressing lives full of heart ache resentment and illness and many of them describe hattie as uncaring and lacking compassion the main lesson ayana mathis portrays here is that being lifted out of jim crow and an oppressed atmosphere does not necessarily exempt this family from the oppression that poverty tends to impose in fact hattie is so concerned with clothing and feeding her brood that she often neglects showing them the love and compassion that they crave there is a certain sense of poverty of spirit that resides in her hopeless children near the end of the novel hattie is struck by this reoccurring theme here we are sixty years out of georgia a new generation has been born and there's still the same wounding and the same pain having said all that i did enjoy many of the narratives of hattie's children especially those that included hattie and her migration to philadelphia from georgia","1559":"it was just so so","1560":"a book starting in the 30's and going to the 90's about a black woman and her 12 children each chapter follows one of their lives interesting but i found the chapters were very hit or miss with me","1561":"the writing was great but the stories of hattie and her 'tribes' were so tragic they were hard to read at times","1562":"am i alone in being underwhelmed didn't care about anyone and found the structure to be anti climactic boo","1563":"very cultural setting each chapter tells a child's tale","1564":"i surprisingly and despite not so great reviews really liked this book even though it is written like a series of short stories i feel like it was totally connected by the main character ms hattie kudos to the author ms ayana mathis for being daring and writing something different check it out you might enjoy it","1565":"great first novel and wonderfully read in the audible version","1566":"ayana mathis can describe the bejesus out of hardships an excellent portrayal of various personalities that all arose out of a difficult childhood very interesting to see how all of hattie's children deal with the circumstances of their youth ive read criticisms that the book jumps around while each child's story could be a novel in itself the author describes them well enough that readers can get a perfect snapshot of their existence in summary the pros vivid descriptions the empathy she evokes for her characters or anger the colorful picture of being an african american in prejudiced times in 2 vastly different places the north in philadelphia and the south in georgia cons the dates at the beginning of the chapter were a bit confusing so i'd bookmark them to make sure i understood the time frame of events overall i liked my first bookclub book would rate it higher if i hadn't felt so bummed out after finishing","1567":"i really enjoyed this book it was beautifully written and the characters were well developed","1568":"reading stories of miss hattie shepherd through the experiences of her children is original and thoughtprovoking a new voice in literature delivers a great read","1569":"loved this book thought really hard about giving 5 stars","1570":"i absolutely loved this book","1571":"i liked the 12 different stories that overlapped and the writing style was really good i did wish at times there were some of the outcomes were more positive but that would have changed up the whole book","1572":"enjoyed this one it was a bit slow in some parts and lacked a real plot it read more like short stories about all her children and their relationship with her tells the story of a very hard and unhappy life of a woman who escapes the south during segregation and how her hard and unhappy life affects all her children's lives","1573":"i recognize that ayana mathis is a talented writer however i didn't find this book to be a page turner there were simply too many characters that were never tied to each other strongly enough to make an impact","1574":"ugh a well written book about a horrible life for a woman and her kids","1575":"2 5 stars i wanted to love this book i wanted to love even like a character but i didn't the problem with this book is that each chapter is so disconnected from the one before it the characters don't even show signs of connection outside of their mother it just felt really disjointed i couldn't get into it","1576":" pregnant with twins 15 year old hattie drives up to philadelphia with her husband august in the cold northern winter she loses her twins to pneumonia however hattie goes on to have nine more children this book tells the stories of hattie's children as well as hattie herself we learn about floyd playing his horn at gigs and facing his own inner demons six becomes a preacher in the south when he has to leave philly after beating up a boy then there's bell who's facing impending death until she gets an unlikely rescue ruthie aka margaret almost grows up in baltimore while ella hattie's youngest is adopted by hattie's sister who is unable to have children of her own franklin sees the horrors of vietnam while alice and billups are tied by a horror they experienced closer to home cassie is sent away due to her own inner demons throughout these stories we get a sense of hattie's determination loyalty to family and steeliness to do what she can to keep her family alive and we get a sense of each of her children's own struggles none of them has it easy each in a different way i enjoyed this book and felt like i got to know each character and a totally different way of life it was interesting to see hattie through so many different viewpoints although disappointing and depressing that none of her children at least that we know of seemed to have a happy life in adulthood from gambling to womanizing to drinking to mental illness each of hattie's children seemed to have it rough even alice with her fancy house and help and doctor husband was terribly unhappy is this realistic and can i still enjoy a book if it paints such a bleak and unhappy view of life the major issue i had with this book was it was tough to relate and to be there with the characters since their lives were so dissimilar to the life i know and how i grew up also it was tough to like any of the characters given that none of them seemed to be generous or kind or friendly or any of the other positive qualities we see in people i respected hsttie for raising so many children with so little but i didn't have to like her the other issue was that each chapter was more of a short story than a novel with a plot each chapter could have been read on its own and apart from the interconnecting thread of hattie the chapters didn't have much else in common","1577":" the twelve tribes of hattie is less a novel that a series of stories about a black woman hattie who leaves the south for philadelphia in the 1940s and her children as such it succeeds beautifully as a shifting kaleidoscope that depicts the variations in the experience of the great migration there is some really really beautiful writing in the book i found myself wondering in what order the author wrote the stories and was hattie's opening first that opening was my favorite but there were other standouts and the lovely writing coupled with the characters bringing to life some of the history of this past century made for really gratifying reading","1578":" i wanted to like this so much more than i did it started out well and the cover promised me something beautiful and devastating i read beautiful and devastating books all the time so i thought this would be one i would love about a quarter of the way in it started to not feel as good as the beginning by halfway i was mostly bored it's not terrible writing so i kept going but i never regained interest none of the characters are likable for more than a few paragraphs there are a few thought provoking sentences but mostly it was a depressing story with no redemption for anyone i might actually give it 2 75 stars","1579":"what a tribe indeed these generational sagas are wonderful reads but they are hard to keep up so many people so many storied it makes for history","1580":" i only ordered this book because of seeing an interview with the author ayana morris and oprah i felt she was fascinating oprah praised her highly i should have known better and thought i would learn something as promised about the southern migration to the north none of that happened and the book as just as depressing as all the rest of oprah's reads i bought the kindle edition that had the oprah comments highly disappointed i am not sure why i expect so much from oprah but her comments were sadly lacking and somewhat shallow in my very humble opinion","1581":"i read this all sunday afternoon once i started i didn't want to put it down if you like exceptional writing and can accept hard truths this is the book for you the writing puts me in mind of marilynne robinson the intensity and use of language she plays words like the finest instrument i'll add this book to a shelf of books with strong women characters","1582":" this book is amazing amazing a great summer read or better yet a quick weekend read the book chronicles the life of hattie an emmigrant from gerogia during the great northern migration wiki it and her life with her husband and children it is interesting that first chapter of the book has a dramatic twist on the on latter saga stop reading now as everything else is spoilers hattie is a young mother in philly and struggling to keep her firstborn children alive she is suffering along with ther children as they have croup whooping cough needless to say that the episode is heartbreaking and does not end well for anyone in the family next we begin to jump back and forth in narrative between hattie and her subsequent children from muscial philanders to religous philanders to drug addicts to prostitutes gambling all in the family we see these aha moments of clarity as the children grow hating hattie and then realizing the chip on their shoulders has been made heavy by their own perception of reality it is also interesting to see how the kids repeat the same mistakes and sins of their parents i loved how the dialouge about god and faith progresses between hattie and some of her kids from the son who has a gift only to squander it to the child with mental illness who squanders her life away hattie's dialouge about god and his lack of intervention has created havoc in her family the final scene in the church and the parallels to job is amazing and how this modern telling of job ends is also shocking i hope you enjoy it","1583":"another one of oprah's picks the subject never changes in the books she chooses a downtrodden black woman from the south and the mistakes she has made in her life a bit disjointed as you never know who each chapter is about until you get through part of it sibling or child a sad tale with no hope","1584":"interesting book i kept having to go back and figure out who was who each chapter was about or from a different child's perspective which made things confusing at times not one of my better reads but continued because it's for my book club wouldn't recommend it to anyone if they asked about it","1585":"this was the first book book i read for our book club i read reviews before reading which was a huge mistake it isn't genre i would typically read but i did find the book interesting it felt more like a book of short stories about each of hattie's children grandchildren instead of a fluent book flowing from one page to the next telling a complete story about hattie i had a hard time relating to some of the things that happened and it was hard to believe that so many of the characters were unfaithful to their spouses not sure if this was typical for the time period i am interested to hear about the other book club members have to say about the book as a whole","1586":"interesting booki liked this book i didn't love it this book was my book club's selection for march 2014 it was quite interesting how it flowed from one child to the next you get to see life through the eyes of all of hattie's children and one of her grandchildren hattie reminded me of my grandmother raising so many kids back in the day it made me think about life with a newfound perspective i do recommend heck so does oprah lol","1587":"i loathe books that jump around this one did it a lot a couple of the sections were gripping but most were a bore i struggled to keep reading at times anything but a page turner some characters just weren't relatable they didn't seem real and their choices were strange to say the least far too much talk of god it's one thing to use religion as a plot device or for character development it's entirely different to preach to your readers quoting multitudes of bible verses two stars because a couple of the sections were quite interesting and moving it would have been nice if the characters' voices were distinguished by their accents as winton did in the riders","1588":"i didn't love this book but i liked it i liked the way each chapter was a different tribe and it was easy to read most definitely a book for discussion","1589":"pain and loss are plentiful in this novel that follows hattie's family from her teen years as she leaves the south to her granddaughter's pain and need for a mother's love in many ways this book just made me want to curl up into a corner and weep i liked it though it had truth and a kind of beauty","1590":"reading twelve tribes of hattie was akin to sitting on the floor next to a grandmother on a ocld night with logs burning in the fireplace and listening to her tell a story about her daughter and each of her daughter's childrens lives there's sorrow for sure and secrets when i read the last page i walked away wondering how each life would turn out the twelve tribes of hattie is indeed a good read","1591":" the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis was a great read the writing style ayana mathis used was new to me and i loved the fact she was able to write mini stories on all of hattie's children and one grandchild it was confusing in the beginning at first when it seems to jump from one character to the next but in the end you see how all the children were connected it would have been better if the book was longer and add more details in each chapter and go deeper into each character's lives i really liked 2 chapters in the book and was unhappy because of the way the relationships ended anyway the book was amazing considering it was on the rough times for african americans it shines light on our strength i would love for ayana mathis to write more books like this something different for me to read each time","1592":"choppy depressing lack of character and story development","1593":"frankly i was left hanging i didn't feel like the story was over we got a glimpse of several characters i was left wanting more","1594":"this is a hard one to rate recommended by a friend it's not a book i would have picked up on my own i'm didn't love it in the midst of reading it but the writing is beautiful the story an important one and one that sticks with you after you finish i was wishing for more character closure because just as you got into each character's story you were moved on to another left to wonder what became of this or that all the while trying to understand hattie","1595":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here books that are filled with struggles sadness oppression and all that aren't easy to love but they aren't easy to forget either mathis spends each chapter in the book telling about one or more of hattie's children from the first twins she loses to pneumonia as a young mother of seventeen to the granddaughter she inherits as an old woman of seventy one each child's story like a glimpse through a dusty window into a moment of their lives be they infants or teenagers or adults we get jus books that are filled with struggles sadness oppression and all that aren't easy to love but they aren't easy to forget either mathis spends each chapter in the book telling about one or more of hattie's children from the first twins she loses to pneumonia as a young mother of seventeen to the granddaughter she inherits as an old woman of seventy one each child's story like a glimpse through a dusty window into a moment of their lives be they infants or teenagers or adults we get just enough of a view to have an impression but we can't really know the whole story hattie's children love and hate her just as she loves and hates her circumstances nothing is easy for any of them and love is expressed in a multitude of ways with varying degrees of success the storytelling is like looking through a book of photographs here's a little bit here there's something in the background there that colors the next photo a few pages later by the end we don't really know hattie or her children but we get a sense of who they are and can imagine their legacies there is a feeling at the end of the book of hopefulness and the possibility of new beginnings which helps smooth over some of the rough parts more","1596":"great book about hattie and her children a black woman who moved to philadelphia in the 1920s","1597":"beautiful writing it's not for everybody but i loved this book looking forward to reading more from this author","1598":"enjoyed the book it was as if each character was based on someone i know it would have been nice if the last chapter had the family gather for a family reunion","1599":"story of a mother her husband her lover and a lot of kids ach child gets their own chapter kind of like reading short stories with a common thread","1600":" the official summary of this book strikes me as downright disingenuous the novel is anything but luminous and uplifting twelve tribes is a frustrating novel about persons with no hope and seemingly no inclination toward self analyzation and self determination i don't find hattie admirable or courageous at all in fact she's the opposite after suffering through heartbreak with her first babies she selfishly takes the easy way out emotionally distancing herself from the remaining children born to her this was in no way a conscious decision for the benefit of her children meant to prepare them for the hard world ahead no she simply checks out her children follow in her footsteps muddling through life no enlightenment at all the only characters i felt any empathy toward were peripheral the husband and the view spoiler lover hide spoiler the writing style itself is fine the content was a waste of time","1601":" this is a beautifully written story of hattie shepherd a black woman who flees georgia for philadelphia in the early 1920s in the hopes of a better life as only a teenager herself she was forced to become an adult and a mother and her life would no longer be her own hattie lost her first two babies to pneumonia and their deaths left a gaping hole in her existence not a day went by that hattie did not feel their absence in the world the empty space where her children's lives should have been hattie struggled and sacrificed to raise 9 more children as well as a grandchild and with so many mouths to feed her life never became what she had hoped this book is written like a series of short stories from 1925 to 1980 about hattie's children each of whom have their own struggles and demons hattie's children face battles with their religion their sexuality finding their places in the world dealing with sickness and disease and living in a society still polluted with racism each child must also make peace with their upbringing with a mostly absent father and a mother too overworked and unhappy to show love or tenderness hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing the and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind each must discover their own definition of love and how to find it maybe we only have a finite amount of love to give we're born with our portion and if we love and are not loved enough in return it's depleted i would have like to see more connectivity between the characters and also more insight into hattie's own upbringing and life events that shaped her into the woman she became overall though i thought this was a beautiful story and i was captivated by each character's story","1602":"i can't really say that i loved this book however i did get caught up in the story of hattie's children who all suffered from her lack of warmth and emotional support it was a good character study and i wanted to read on to see how her withholding affected all of her kids but i wouldn't necessarily recommend it","1603":"each chapter is about one of hattie's children it felt like a collection of short stories which i'm not generally into any individual chapter was interesting and well written but as a whole it felt somewhat over the top as each of hattie's children had some unique affliction by the later chapters i was rolling my eyes","1604":"took me a long time to finally finish this book not really worth the effort expected more","1605":"this was a typical oprah book meaning it was about a family that had issues bigger then them the book was interesting in the it talked about each of hattie's children in each section not sure how they tied together since it was only about each one and not about each one with each other more weaving of characters would have made this book an ever better read than it was if you like oprah books then read this one you will like it too","1606":"this is the kind of book that stays with you and grows on you i liked it the more i thought about it but reading it at times was painful it's hard to truly embrace a book that has so few likeable characters it's the story of hattie and her mostly absent useless husband august and their 11 children and 1 grandchild each is given a chapter i would have liked to see the brothers and sisters stories more intertwined and woven together i can only imagine that with all those kids living in a small house in philadelphia there lives must have been messy but the bulk of the stories occur after the children have grown up enough to leave home","1607":" oprah told me to read this actually oprah told me a while ago but this first novel by ayana mathis hadn't been released here so i waited and i waited and then i waited a little more until the happy moment i spotted it in waterstones last saturday alas the wait still was not over as i hadn't finished crime and punishment but eventually i did i hurtled through this book i couldn't read it quick enough i'd come in from work throw my stuff down feed the guinea pig thelma and then sit enraptured on my sofa with this for hours so was the wait worth it absolutely this book is about hattie a woman originally from georgia who moves to north philadelphia as a teenager it is her story told via the lives of her children all eleven of them each chapter deals with one or in some cases two of them and from the adults they become and the references about their mother we learn all about hattie it doesn't sound that exciting and i suppose it isn't exciting but it's something better than that if a book could ever break your heart there's chapters in this that completely do a lot of it is terribly sad but kind of hopefully at the same time it's by no means a long book but the amount of subjects it deals with is quite incredible there's death madness homosexuality suicide alcoholism racism poverty adultery and even though mathis might only write about them through her characters for a couple of pages it never feels like she's skimping or throwing them in for the sake of it she writes so clearly you understand everything about these topics grasp on the characters its really pretty powerful stuff this book kind of gets right to the core of you it did me anyway and you don't come across writing this good often i hope i come across another book as good as this one but it'll take some doing people always say in reviews 'if you read one book this year make it this one' but i genuinely mean it this is a top read if you know me i'll lend it to you but you have to return it it's my new favourite","1608":" i've been so anxious to read this because i heard so much talk about it it follows hattie a 17 yr old black woman through 55 years of her life after moving to philadelphia from georgie during the jim crow rules era hattie has been kicked hard by life and is determined to raise her children to have independence and backbone but maybe sometimes too much as i read i thoroughly enjoyed each chapter and the writing that pulled me into the action and bonded me to the characters as a whole though the chapters didn't exactly flow from one to another the only binding characters throughout were hattie and august the 12 tribes refer to hattie's 11 children and the grandchild she cares for each child is a distinct individual representing a different tribe as it were a homosexual repressing his desires a deeply psychologically disturbed boy turned religious zealot a girl with serious mental health depression issues etc i never felt like there was a summing up of the whole like the entire group never came back together to resolve anything but as someone else said sometimes such is life it just goes on from day to day without any specific re joining of the family all in all i enjoyed the book and have ruminated for a few days after reading it before reviewing it i would absolutely recommend it","1609":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was an easy read and i wish i knew what happened to the daughter she gave away i wonder if she would have loved or hated her if she had seen what became of her other kids","1610":"i bought this after i heard an interview with the author and oprah on npr i read it in one sitting which indicates that it captured my attention however i wanted to know what happened to hattie's older children in later chapters i will suggest this one to my book club","1611":"i would have loved this book if i had read it in print form but the audio book version i'm listening to a lot of audio books on my commute includes the voice acting of bahni turpin adenrele ojo and adam lazarre white all of whom are mind blowingly talented and they made me love it even more","1612":"loved this book","1613":"the vignettes were well written but to me the effect was too choppy for me to follow the ultimate meaning of the family history i felt as if i were left hanging and wanting much more","1614":"i gave up i did not find the writing compelling","1615":"i'm not normally a fan of the novel in stories format but these were closely linked so there was enough of a continuous narrative for me i've been reading a lot of darker literature lately and this one was no exception a lot of sad stories here but beautiful and poignant ones i think oprah got it right here definitely worth reading","1616":"riveting but not an easy set of stories to digest i looked forward to reading it everyday but it was unsettling","1617":"another well written multi generational family drama the story revolves around hattie who moves up north during the great migration and the plethora of children she births with her disappointment of a husband most of the novel is a downer but it doesn't take away from the fact that the story and the characters are captivating","1618":"this is a collection of short life stories each story follows a descendant of hattie 11 children and 1 grandchild and the stories cover about a 60 year period of time hattie is in each story but is usually a background character i enjoyed the stories but as it was a collection of individuals and not a continuation or building of an overall larger picture i had a hard time getting into it overall a decent book","1619":"i really enjoyed this book the different chapters revolved around the status of the main character's children they all had interesting events in their lives","1620":"this book is barely ok i don't know why oprah choose it maybe she's friends with the author there's nothing special about any of the characters and the story seems to fall apart a little more with each new chapter i give it a 4 on my 10 scale","1621":" an intriguing title the public library reading group selection for the month thus i read because i'd just finished reading the living is easy by dorothy west a member of the harlem renaissance writers i immediately saw connections between the two books both have strong courageous african american women who are the pivotal characters in each book i'm still pondering my reactions i nearly stopped reading twelve tribes in the midst of the first chapter however since oprah said she was completely captivated by it and chose it as the first of her second book club recommendations i decided to continue reading though hattie shepherd is the central character we learn about her through the eyes and voices of her children who as children were usually afraid of her anger and deeply affected by her emotional distance she simply could not show or speak about her emotions in relation to her children husband or other family and friends life is very sad for every member of the shepherd family i'll be very selective about my recommendation of this book to others","1622":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here with all of these books i'm rating at 4 stars i'm starting to wonder if i'm just not critical enough anyway this was another beautifully written novel about hattie and her 11 children philadelphia and jubilee floyd six ruthie ella alice billups franklin bell and cassie and her granddaughter sala each

try harder to show affection and love when raising sala the novel reads like a series of short stories with very little overlap between them hattie is mentioned in most of the stories but some of them could stand very much alone i was left feeling like i would have liked to read more about some of the characters what happens to floyd i'd have liked to have more details woven in to later chapters to keep us up to date on the earlier characters especially since the time period is so vast stretching from 1925 the twins 1948 floyd to 1980 even just a small mention in passing would have kept the later chapters feeling more closely connected to the first few i suppose six was briefly mentioned in one of the final chapters but with the rest we were really left hanging the writing was beautiful there was little hope throughout the novel though and it was frustrating that every member of this family could somehow manage to be so thoroughly messed up it felt hopeless of course i know that no family is perfect but this poor family seemed like it really couldn't catch a break a depressing story but i tend to like depressing stories and this one was no different more","1623":"couldn't put it down but still trying to figure out what happened in the end","1624":" this was a good book but frustrated me it is written from the perspective of hattie's many children and each chapter switches to a different point of view the stories were all engaging the frustration comes from the fact that they all end too soon i felt no sense of closure at the end of a narrative i just wanted to know when we'd return to the story and find out what happened next that never happened i finished the book with a vague sense of longing and wondering over the unknown fates of each character","1625":"she stole my idea of one chapter per sibling which is how i am going to write my memoir oh well nicely told misery","1626":"the twelve tribe of hattie was a good fast interesting read ayana mathis is a beautiful writer who uses words like a painter uses paint to create stunning images i would have liked to have more interaction or interconnection between the characters while each chapter was a beautiful story about an individual character i miss any feeling of familial connection","1627":"as other reviewers have pointed out the structure of this novel disrupts the narrative i have an image of hattie as a large dark house and 12 windows are briefly opened and then shut we get indirect and incomplete glimpses of hattie and her family i found of the chapters uneven and my 3 star reflects this my personal favorite was bell beautiful language and haunting imagery i detested the oprah i zition of the library ebook i read i want to form my own opinions","1628":"best book i have read in a while the kind you don't want to end","1629":"just too depressing to rate higher well written and good perspectives but a whole book on sad and tragedy was not uplifting","1630":"enjoyed it but did not live up to the hype for me","1631":"great story but the narrative structure prevented the deep connection to any of the characters that i like to develop left me wanting a lot more def worth reading","1632":" overall an interesting book well written the subject matter has historical interest but i think ultimately a let down the book is structured across 50 something years following one woman hattie as she moves from georgia up to philadelphia each chapter follows a different child of hers at a key point in their lives the opening stories are very strong but soon it seems to lose its way and turns into short stories as writing exercises rather than adding anything particular to the story of hattie near the end of the book several stories started to feel like padding i wasn't particularly moved or impressed with the ending which lacked punch and didn't really address the core character of hattie and her large and complex family nevertheless the writing is very good and it shows great promise for the author's future work","1633":"i really struggled reading this book i actually didn't finish it which i always try to finish a book but this one was sorry boring i always read oprah book selections and find some are great like edward sawtell but others are awful","1634":"so extreme real authentic alive with smells and emotions","1635":"should've been the twelve miserable lives of miserable hattie this was a pretty good book but it doesn't let up on these unfortunate lives hattie is a cold miserable woman there is no joy no hope no comic relief","1636":"strange book and annoying to have passages oprah thought important underlined i really thought it took away from the book","1637":"amazing first novel i look forward to future work from her interesting and emotional characters","1638":"a difficult read in many ways compelling and heart wrenching didn't find a connection to the characters until the last few chapters","1639":"a series of short stories about hattie and her children classic oprah sadness and depressing lives","1640":"interesting characters with surprising stories to tell i liked reading this book because i was surprised by each of the stories they brought our some surprising emotions you cheered for the underdog and celebrated with some of the conquests all in all i think this was a peak into some very interesting lives and the story of hattie who really surprised me too","1641":"an engrossing story of a family's struggles in the decades surrounding the civil rights movement every single story is a sad one but it is a provocative story of human behavior and how people cope with unmet needs","1642":"interesting insight into black lives but depressing","1643":"sucked me in quickly and the character based chapters made it a page turner for me however it may make it hard for some people if they feel like the book keeps starting over in a way","1644":" this book ripped my heart right out my chest and tore it to piecesi read some reviews where ppl stated they couldn't see how the stories connected or that it felt like it was all over the place and i can see that the story didn't have a consecutive time line and there are pieces missing that as a reader id want know but i think the point of the story ies were to see the afflictions of the characters to see how one affects the other in very specific ways and that is what stood out to me the suffering once it began with the death of the twins and spread through the family like a virus almost it was painful to read but i couldn't put it down","1645":"one of the most heart breaking books i have ever read but also one of those rare books that totally take you in and won't let you go until the final page upon which time you feel like you have been kicked out of the house","1646":"twelve children different stories all struggles","1647":"i usually don't like stories but this was an excellent read","1648":"i enjoyed each individual chapter about hattie and her family they each presented a short separate tableau of hattie or one of her children but after the chapter the character usually disappeared there was a continuous feeling of desolation throughout but not much connection among the characters it may be what the author intended but i was left waiting for more substance to the story","1649":" i enjoyed the book it was powerful and deep and sweet but i have a couple of criticisms i like bouncing from story to story from person to person but the time jump threw me sometimes we hung out with floyd for a while when he was away from home then we jump to another child and see that floyd is in the house we go with bell to the hospital and hear hattie offer bell a place in her home then we jump to cassie and sala who are living in hattie and august's home and where is bell also there were a lot of sexual relationships which made some of the stories feel a bit repetitive i kept looking for other kinds of relationships and didn't get them until the very very end with cassie and sala i do appreciate all that's left unsaid all of the blanks we have to fill in for ourselves except when they're contradictory who lived in the extra bedroom at hattie and august's bell or cassie and sala and the snapshots of a life","1650":"i listened to this on cd i liked it although i thought most sections depressing maybe realistic hard to understand why hattie was the kind of mother she was in spite of her early loss of twins","1651":"a moving look at the life of one woman through the lives of her children hattie's children both destroy her and complete her they keep her from living the life that she wants to live yet give her pretty much the only happiness she has in life the first chapter almost killed me i wanted to hold hattie in my arms and weep with her","1652":"the book was beautifully written but not one character was endearing there was no connection at all and no theme except maybe without a mother's affection people will be deviant the ending was atrocious i would like a real non post modern novel from this author as she truly has a gift tell a story","1653":"it's an opray book for sure not sure it could be much more depressing great writer though","1654":"the novel had potential but i was disappointed on 2 fronts the format only one chapter focussing on each of her children and so many unsavory characters","1655":"i thought this was such a good book i didn't really care for the ending it could definitely be a part 2","1656":" chapter 1 is heartbreaking and chapter 2 floyd is sexually explicit i skipped ch2 and read cautiously and so far i have been rewarded it appears that there will be a chapter per child and they aren't necessarily dependent on each other when i was almost through i started wondering why i was reading this book each of hattie's children is miserable in his or her own way this book is really sad i noticed that each chapter is written in a slightly different style and that impressed me the last few chapters connect back to hattie and the reader starts getting some insight into how she feels about her children and that redeemed this book for me i wonder if it's normal for such sadness and futility to run in families like this i hope not","1657":"book club selectioni enjoyed it a lot going on and some points hard to follow but for most part a great read","1658":"i usually turn away from any oprah book club picks but this was an exception this book left me reeling with its emotional and thought provoking story","1659":"basically a compilation of short stories that are depressing and incomplete glad its over","1660":"sad but poignant it evolves 1 character in each chapter i wish it would have had the chapter character name listed atopeach page as i kept having to reference back","1661":" although the writing was good i got frustrated with the set up of the book each part was about a different character and as soon as it got really interesting it was over and a new character came on board i didn't care about any of the characters i could say more but it would contain spoilers i only got half way through it couldn't stand what hattie was up to the word sordid kept coming to mind like a nasty soap opera i didn't know it was an oprah book if i had i wouldn't have even started it i like oprah but not her tastes in books","1662":"a series of tragic stories about a family living in philadelphia during the 1920s 1970s whose matriarch is a product of the great migration not an uplifting read but the stories seem like real human experiences the stories of jubilee philadelphia and alice broke my heart","1663":"at first i thought ayana mathis's book was a little discombobulated with too many disconnected narratives her style of writing is beautiful so i kept going in the end i did see that the common thread the children's mother had come full circle through her children's eyes amidst poverty and hardships it was very touching although i might've liked to see more of hattie in action instead of in thought","1664":"interesting book i thought it was a sad book","1665":"not one of my favorites and certainly not what i expected wish the book grabbed me like the first chapter did","1666":" not a novel or a collection of short stories but each chapter a glimpse into the life of one of hattie's children engrossing and a quick read that leaves me wondering what mathis might be capable of in the future however i felt that each chapter of her freshman effort illustrated some type of african american stereotype the musician the preacher the mistress the maladjusted socialite the child abuse victim the alcoholic etc and i feel there are few families with so many siblings who appear to have no bond with each other whatsoever especially in light of hattie's parenting style adversity usually ties sibs together these don't even seem to be from the same family finally does oprah ever pick a book that isn't overwhelmingly depressing couldn't at least one of hattie's children grown to be a successful adult","1667":"painful and well written","1668":"i found myself not seeking to like the characters but to rather appreciate them for their flaws for being human it was a lovely well written novel","1669":"i liked this book but i wish there was more background on the characters not all the children were discussed so the reader doesn't get to see the role of the in main players in the family completely overall i would recommend","1670":"i really liked this book except for the end i found it was slightly rushed maybe because i felt i wanted to know more about hattie's life i liked the structure of this book telling the story of the mother through her children so far the best book club book i have read so far this year","1671":"i love these kind of books it was about the migration of the black people from the south the hardships of a woman and how her children and grandchildren survived another book i read that was based on the migration was the warmth of other sons","1672":"it was ok i really don't know what else to say","1673":"i really liked this book it was very interesting however i wish the author would have delved deeper into the characters lives hopefully this book is a great setup for a sequel i do recommend this book to other readers","1674":"didn't really understand the point of the book not sure what else to say","1675":"pathology and suffering reach through multiple generations starting with hattie an african american woman who starts parenthood in her teens and suffers a terrible loss continues to have many children but never endures years of emotional stress each of her children experience some sort of serious challenge while not a happy story by any means mathis is able to convey deep characters who are quite authentic and interesting the writing style is flowing and engaging when i read a book like this though i often wonder why the author creates a story that is relentless depressing there is so much unhappiness in this book and it would feel more credible if at least sometimes the characters enjoyed their lives and relationships","1676":"meh typical depressing oprah's book club stuff okay writing though which is why i'll give it three stars","1677":" this was a very remarkable thought provoking book comprised of interlocking stories of members of one particular family from 1920 1980 at the centre is hattie the matriarch of the family who intially appears to be stern unloving and inflexible i quickly changed that opinion and realized that there are very different ways of showing affection and love each family member had a different story and different problems with failure the usual theme i felt the character development was this book's main strength each character different in some ways but sharing common family characteristics with hattie at the centre this book is not an easy read but is very interesting and provides insight into the period known as the great migration segregration and racial tensions i recommend it","1678":"very good book when's the movie coming out","1679":"beautifully written sad sad sad asks complicated questions about the great migration the south and the cost of progress","1680":"boy this is a hard book to rate i despised the gritty nature of the book the lack of morals the language especially the language the utter dysfunction of so many of the characters however some of the vignettes were quite poignant and well written sad what poverty and oppression do to people","1681":"this was an engrossing book i was left wanting to know more about each character though each child's story is told in one chapter and you never get to hear more about him or her after that","1682":" 3 5 rounded up great job for a debut writer i wonder if those who attended the iowa writers' workshop get all types of jokes after lena dunham covered it in her show girls i liked the approach of having different times and different points of view that focused on one person hattie i enjoyed olive kitteridge as well but she only had the one son not 11 kids was i the only one who kept count the extra is the voice of a granddaughter hattie had a hard life even when her children thought they had it bad they always had it better than hattie because she helped her children while no one helped her i don't know if tribes was the right word when the chapters of the children were told singularly","1683":" this was one of the strangest books i have ever read it was beyond depressing how one woman could mess up the lives of so many children is beyond comprehension we got part of everyone's story but not the whole story which was very frustrating hattie was a self centered cruel bitter woman who should never have had children the only child that might have turned out okay was ella since she gave her to her sister to raise but of course we don't know since we only have part of the story i keep seeing comments on the northern migration and how this book was about that but i saw nothing to support that yes they lived in the north that was it i read oprah's comments on this book and was appalled that an educated woman could like this book i think the author needs to find a new profession it was like reading someone's disjointed thoughts i will make sure i don't read any book that oprah recommends since she has really poor taste in books","1684":"i really enjoyed this book although it is quite a sad story stories the format was unusual as each tribe or offspring of hattie has his her own voice and story to tell while at the same time weaving hattie's struggled existence along the years having read patternmaster series by octavia butler plug plug not long ago i am still connected to the idea of the mastermind controlling its tentacles if you may in this case hattie the mother weaves each child's story and pain into her own and vice versa she knew everything about each of them she could feel their vibrating souls i used to think the pain was just fear but now i know it's a premonition you ain't strong like she is you got a soul that cain't be still your mama did too at one time but she wrestled it down yours look like it's running you","1685":"i enjoyed the short stories but wish the novel didn't skip years of her life it was hard to follow all of the children and what everyone was doing when you only read about them in one or two chapters good first novel overall","1686":"enjoyed the audio version of this book each chapter was a vignette of 1 of 12 children of hattie would have loved to hear more about almost every character","1687":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i was on vacation in florida looking for something to read when i found this gem on the bookshelf at the b and b the title was familiar to me but i knew nothing about it i opened it up and read the book in two days on the beach the book opens with the scene of a young hattie just seventeen years old exhausted and terrified as her baby twins succumb to illness each subsequent chapter provides us with a vignette from the life of each of her children ending with a scene with hattie and h i was on vacation in florida looking for something to read when i found this gem on the bookshelf at the b and b the title was familiar to me but i knew nothing about it i opened it up and read the book in two days on the beach the book opens with the scene of a young hattie just seventeen years old exhausted and terrified as her baby twins succumb to illness each subsequent chapter provides us with a vignette from the life of each of her children ending with a scene with hattie and her grandchild more","1688":"good writing i enjoyed reading about the members of hattie's tribe but the individual chapters needed more cohesion i expected a wrap up chapter that would pull together the lives we'd had small introductions to throughout the novel but there was no wrap up no glue the watered down ending is what stopped me from giving a more enthusiastic review of this book that kept me captivated until its end","1689":"i couldn't get past the first couple of chapters the death of the twins just too gruesome and depressing i can't sleep after this sort of thing worthy i'm sure but no enjoyment to be had","1690":"great character development like others i would have liked to see how they came together as a family more","1691":"could not put this book down it is not a happy book but so well written and engaging the first chapter is especially hard to read but important to why hattie is the way she is and how that affected her future children each chapter is about one of her 11 children plus the last chapter is about a grand child a family who has had it rough","1692":" this was a disjointed account of unmitigated misery i can see why it was an oprah pick it fits the genre well victimized long suffering women weak manipulative men traumatized children all in the context of racial oppression sexism and homophobia it is well written but it felt like well worn material there was nothing fresh no unique lens it was hard to care about the characters even when i began to the character more or less disappeared from the story i slogged through the whole thing only because i'm compulsive about finishing books i've started","1693":"i enjoyed some chapters more than others overall i just found it to be depressing i kept waiting for some kind of change to happen but each character just proved to be sadder than the one before","1694":"sad but strong i selected this book for my annual drive down to alabama to visit my relatives because the storyline fit the these in so many ways it didn't disappoint but it left me with a deep and profound sadness which i'm finding difficult to shake","1695":"very much liked these connected short stories i found them some of them heart rending and hard to read because the book was so well written","1696":"i only read half of the book because i found it depressing and hopeless for the characters i didn't like hattie's attitude and found her too prideful at times bitter and emotional abusive her children there are other ways to prepare your children for a cruel world than being cold to her kids i found there to be no plot and it read like several short stories","1697":"i have recommended this book to everyone who asks me what they should read next the combination of personal tragedy medical ethics and genetic science kept me riveted","1698":"i really enjoyed how she tells the story a very talented writer","1699":"it was good but i have rated it two stars because i didn't like how the author ended it","1700":"from the outset of the first chapter hattie is faced with tragedy and heartbreak and chapter after chapter it continues you wonder how much a person can bear and you begin to see and understand the strength of characteer and conviction that those of the great migration had to endure very thankful for all that i have today because of those who came before us","1701":"painfully and heartbreakingly beautiful","1702":"it took me a while to catch on to this book i e what or who the tribes were not enough wrapping up of stories for me it felt kind of like a short story collection at times","1703":"great read interesting characters history","1704":"just okay don't know why it is still on the nyt's list","1705":"all these very sad stories of hattie and her children exist as slightly more than vignettes although you get to see different facets of life among african americans in the lives of the children in the years between newly wed and grandmother hattie is the only fully developed character the lives of her surviving children are little more than vignettes well written but didn't live up to the hype","1706":"heartbreaking compromises painful choices made in an effort to survive then in an effort to love makes you think about the choices you've made in life and where they've led you life affecting and perspective changing","1707":"a disturbing book and not a happy one","1708":"beautiful writing but so sad","1709":"i found this book depressing maybe it's too close to real life","1710":"good characters would like to see them developed further it almost seemed like each chapter could be its own short story","1711":"i listened to this book on tape on a 19 drive from madison wi to wilmington nc it made an arduous trip bearable maybe even enjoyable","1712":"the book was well written but with a separate story for each child there is no cohesive storyline or plot line to follow none of the characters had any redeeming qualities and in general it was dark and depressing however we did have a good discussion in our book club as it brings out issues about race poverty and birth control in america i just did not personally enjoy it","1713":"compelling story of a mother who made mistakes and ultimately finds redemption well written fascinating realistic characters","1714":"the first incredible pages of this first novel tore at my heart and i knew right away that i would be reading something special like hattie's twins named for hope and promise the author shows great promise and i can't wait for her second book i loved the writing and the story and the characters especially flawed hattie heck i even liked august the author is so descriptive that i lived in hattie's world from start to finish and the ending was perfection this would make a great film you know that wonderful feeling you get when you've read a really good book i've got it","1715":"it was ok i could see what the author was trying to achieve with the narratives from the children's perspective whilst each story was interesting it felt that ayana mathis was trying to tackle several big issues without ever delving into any of them in a meaningful way it might have been better to follow one character and look at how race and family shaped that life","1716":"enjoyed it hattie tried hard to make decent lives for her kids and they could not see how much she loved them","1717":" lovely book about how lives interact how one persons sadness and inability to cope with the disapointment of her life influences the way her children deal with their own lives the book descibes the life of hattie shephard seen through the eyes of her children each child tells a part of its own story and by that the story of their mother because there are so many perspectives and so many short parts of different lives the book feels a bit fragmented there is not one story with an ending we don't know of any charachter in the book how his story ends the power of it that in real life we hardly ever know the complete story of the people around us in that way this novel is a story abou life in general raw sad sometimes loving here and there a little gem and without a proper ending","1718":" why are people so down on this book regarding the criticisms that hattie was a detestable character well come on folks she did endure myriad tribulations that many of us can't even imagine not the least of which includes the violent murder of her father her forced migration from the jim crow south and the untimely deaths of her beloved firstborn twin babies yes hattie is a stern matriarch to the point of being rather callous but she did single handedly sustain her family despite severe economic hardship and the frustrations brought on by the jovial but philandering unreliable and irresponsible husband august an admirable feature of mathis's writing is that she sketches characters like hattie august and each of their children who are at once loveable and horrible terribly destructive and utterly vulnerable there seems to be a fair amount of criticism about mathis's method of bouncing around between different characters and across a large expanse of place and time i actually found that the chronological leaps and the span across perspectives of multiple family members added a special dimension to the story true we don't get an exhaustive account of each character but the beauty is that getting a snapshot of each of hattie's children gives us a certain insight into hattie herself and if anything should belong to hattie herself it is this simple thing her own story","1719":" i wanted to like this one more but didn't this book really reads like a collection of short stories each chapter is a story of one of hattie's children and you never really hear from them again after the chapter is over i think i would've liked the book better if the chapters were interwoven or at least the characters crossed into other chapters but you almost got the idea that they were completely different stories characters who weren't related some stories are better than others but more than a month after i've read this book nothing has really stayed with me so i'm going to bring down the rating to 2 stars instead of 3","1720":"beautifully written but it is basically 10 stories of painful childhood all of which end abruptly","1721":"this is ayana mathis's first novel and it seems to be getting a lot of attention as well as making the ny times bestsellers i am also impressed its the sort of black american novels that i really enjoy hattie is the matriach of large family following her own family's sudden move from georgia to philadelphia in the early 1920's the twelve tribes relate to the stories of her children as well as hattie each one with their contribution covering a timeline and a chapter this technique really works with each chapter almost a short story but always linked to hattie and her erstwhile husband august the children are mostly down on their luck struggling to find their way in a tough world there are exceptions with the fragile alice marrying up to royce the doctor there's franklin in vietnam baby ella who is adopted by hattie's sister pearl the physically damaged six who combines a talent for preaching with his father's skills for womanising you get the picture the twelve tribes of hattie is a rich and sometimes challenging set of stories with the common thread over 50 something years of hattie and august","1722":" contains spoilers i absolutely love the way that this book was written structured the book kept me thinking from the beginning until the end trying to figure out would hattie ever change the whole book i wanted to see some sort of affection or some some sort of change in her children's experience of her and although i know in real life no one could ever get over the death of a child let alone twins i wanted her to show the same compassion for her other children that she had for the twins i didn't like that august was horrible the entire book i wanted him to step up and show the children the affection that hattie wasn't able to but he was in his own world and the kids were screwed from the beginning huge disappointment","1723":"great fast read sad story","1724":"author is an excellent story teller","1725":"oh oprah i don't know why i continue to read your book club picks there hasn't been a good book on her list since a million little pieces","1726":"listened to this book and the voices were different for each character brings you through time with an african american family's heartbreak through the decades sad but captivating","1727":"a complex and intricate piece of story telling that weaves backwards and forwards in time telling us about hattie and her life and the lives of her children fabulous","1728":"this attempt at the hard luck story of a couple that migrates from georgia to philadelphia in the 1920s and follows the stories of the lives of the dysfunctional children was overly dramatic","1729":"i gave up on this one 75% through some great stories but very odd layout didn't flow well at all","1730":"couldn't get through this dreary depressing novel started off strong but went downhill at about 35%","1731":"this is the first oprah book club book i have read i really enjoyed the different tales and narratives in the book all the while learning about hattie and the role she had in their lives","1732":"i don't reccommend it it's okay but seems to be everywhere with the characters with some character development","1733":"i loved the story telling aspects of this book but the colorful language and some of the content was too 'adult' and crude for my liking","1734":"loved the book but was disappointed in the ending wished it would have come together more","1735":"heartbreak after heartbreak but 'our' silver lining playbook","1736":"very much like olive kittridge i wish i had known going in that it wasn't a beginning to end story rather several related stories concerning the same characters it was good just not what i was expecting","1737":"very well written i didn't want to put it down however the ending is like falling off a cliff i am scratching my head and am thinking to myself is that it what just happened","1738":"story of hattie sheppard whose mother moved from georgia to pennsylvania to get away from the south due to the way the african american people were treated hattie married at 15 and had 11 childrn each chapter is titled after each child and tells about that person but rarely mentions them in other parts of the book","1739":"i don't understand what all this fuss is about i struggled to reach the last thirty pages and could not take it anymore though it has some interesting parts it's boring as hell","1740":"at some times tedious but very interesting to take a large family and write each chapter from a different member's pov i recommend","1741":"reads like a series of sad short stories through which the reader learns about hattie and her 11 children and her granddaughter beginning in 1925 and ending in 1980 i read truth in hattie's inability to express love and yearning for a better life","1742":"if you like toni morrison then this is very much in her style following the difficult life of hattie and her family this reads like a collection of short stories rather than a cohesive whole i kept wondering when we'd have everyone come together but like the family itself the only common thread is their disparate connections to hattie herself","1743":"it was ok not sure why oprah liked it so much each chapter is about a different person and was very disjointed","1744":"i gave this book 3 stars only because i'm still thinking about it even though i finished it two weeks ago i didn't love it but i am intrigued by hattie and why her tribes play out the way they do","1745":"i probably wouldn't have read this if i didn't pick it for my book club's february selection i didn't love it but thought it was really good technically which makes me think of both quality and appeal there are books you love you love the characters or the plot catches you off guard or the location is perfect and there are books that are technically good that are well written and show the craft of writing rarely does a book do both sadly this isn't a book that does both but it does do the craft of writing in spectacular form and that is enough and there is something to be said for that and means that i am a better for it after reading this story follows hattie and her many children as she moves from the south to philly during the great migration the stories are sad really really sad because each chapter is essentially a short story linked it was hard to get a grip on any of them for very long i would recommend this to a lot of literary fiction readers just have something light lined up afterwards","1746":" i found this novel very compelling depressing but compelling it's a set of related stories that starts with the tale of hattie shephard who in 1925 comes to philadelphia from georgia part of the great migration though hattie vows never to return south again life in the city proves difficult her new husband not what she had hoped and hattie is forced to watch her young twins die from a disease that could easily be cured with a trip to the hospital hattie goes on to have more children and the rest of the stories are theirs and through them you see hattie's strengths and weaknesses as a mother she has tried to prepare them for the toughness of the world but her lack of love sends each of them into the world with empty spaces that they try to fill","1747":"this book was not at all what i expected my 4 stars are quite generous because i could understand what the author was going for and why with that being said i have to admit it was not as enjoyable for me as i would have liked it to be because i did not like how it was done the story felt disjointed and fragmented the author however is a beautiful writer who has a way with words and feelings i can't fault her for that and she deserves the praise i was just not thrilled how it was executed but that's me and my own personal tastes the story starts out in the 1920's as hattie her mother and her sister move from georgia to philly hattie is 15 at the time of the move and by the time she is 17 she is married to august and has newborn twins the twins become sick with pneumonia and die after 10 days hattie goes on to have 9 more children the book tells a short story from each child's life this is the part that i really did not enjoy each child's story is told from a different part of their life so it felt like the book was fragmented and didn't flow together the one common theme among all the children is how their mother seemed to be a very angry person like i said before i understand completely what the author was going for but the style kinda bothered me","1748":"3 5 starsbeautifully written but unremittingly depressing","1749":"unfinished because of unsavory content and language i don't want pollyanna but neither will i use precious reading time to wallow in mud too bad too because i liked the writing style","1750":"glad it's over finished it because i started it didn't like any of the characters maybe i wasn't supposed to feel like i must have missed something even though i read all the pages the writing wasn't terrible just not very captivating","1751":"this was not an easy book to read because of the content each chapter is devoted to one or two of hattie's 11 children no one has an easy life for a variety of reasons i would have liked to see some connection between the characters to tie it all together that said i would give it a 3 5 if i could","1752":"a novel not really series of short vignettes about dysfunction skimmed the last several chapters just so i could say i finished it depressing","1753":"another disappointing oprah's book club pick for me i have read many of the oprah book club books since the 90s and i've been disappointed in many more than i have liked apparently ms winfrey and i do not share the same taste in books i thought the author did a great job with the characters in the book but overall the structure and themes left me wanting more and thinking that was it at the end","1754":"this was a very moving story with literary merit themes to give meaning and richness","1755":"historical novel sometimes hysterical with its bluntness sometimes very intense forcing breaks from reading worth the read","1756":" this book made me cry after the first chapter and i wasn't sure if i even wanted to read anymore but i did i decided that if i could get through that first chapter and this woman was still able to function in her life then i shouldn't give up and i was so glad that i did the main character in this book is a very strong willed spirt that had been through a lot in her life which is what this book is about the span of her lifetime and anything you could imagine a person going through she went through it and all along it made her an even stronger person now thats a story","1757":"well we all know what we get when we read a book that oprah chose a poor black family a ruined childhood a vacant and sad adulthood and problems all around depressing yes any real point no i heard an interview that oprah did with this author and she told her she was born to write well steinbeck was born to write in my opinion miss mathis was just lucky enough in life to have oprah like her book was that too harsh","1758":"i read this on the way to phoenix i never put it down and finished it when we got there each chapter is about a different person interesting read","1759":"it was too exhaustingly depressing to be good in a conventional sense but there was a power that insisted you finish","1760":"huh the way the book was organized didn't bother me at all rarely do we know everyone's full story so only getting a glimpse into the lives of each was not a problem for me did i want more yes could i imagine it on my own sure sometimes reading a book doesn't have to me resolution","1761":" i loved this book the twelve tribes of hattie is a wonderful read it tells the life of a black woman from 1923 as a 15 year old until 2080 when she describes her grandchild each chapter tells the story of her life and one of her children it explains about her parenting and how they turn out with everything from extreme goodness to the trials and tribulations of mental illness each child is distinct and sees their mother differently the characters are well drawn and you feel for each one the book is expressive and i would definitely recommend it","1762":"the manner in which this book is written makes it very difficult to follow each chapter is one of hattie's children and we only hear from most of them in their own chapter however it is a decent read with a very good ending the last sentence in the book ties it all together","1763":"this was definitely a difficult book to read it was an enjoyable read but a difficult read the family dynamics were anything but storybook perfect but everything like an authentic family with nuanced relationships i appreciated mathis telling this story and showing the complexity of motherhood","1764":"listened to the audio of this thought the voice of adenrele ojo was wonderful not a fan of audio though","1765":"read this for bookclub and loved it","1766":" ms mathis is a very skilled writer my rating is mainly due to my personal preference in a story line this book was too sad and deep for me there wasn't a single positive moment in the whole book it was chapter after chapter of misfortune and heartache i believe ms mathis is an excellent writer because i feel like i know hattie august and their children i can see their story in my head as if i was there but it made me very sad it was an interesting writing technique dedicating a chapter to one or two of hattie's children it was similar to reading a collection of short stories because the chapters were not connected the only constant character was hattie it left me wanting to know what happen to some of her children though i read this book because i wanted to try something different than all the romance novels i've read recently and i certainly got what i asked for ms mathis is probably the most talented writer i've read but i just did not want to stay up till 1 am to read this book because it was so sad i just prefer feel good books","1767":"interesting read enjoyed the way the story was presented","1768":" this amazing first effort by ayana mathis tells the story of hattie shepherd who flees georgia in 1923 for a better life in philadelphia after a teen age marriage she gives birth to eleven children--two of which die in infancy hattie loves her children but her bitter unhappy marriage prevents her from nurturing them and mathis tells the story of hattie's life through the various lives of her children their saga stretches all the way from the segregated jazz clubs of georgia and the revival tents of alabama to affluent philadelphia and battle zones of vietnam mathis' poetic and vivid descriptions of poverty hope belief resolve and sometimes harsh love are those of a much more experienced author each of hattie's tribes is given the same descriptive care and attention could mathis have shortened hattie's saga even mathis seems to wonder when early in the book she ponders if a mother can love only so many children","1769":" i liked this book and enjoyed each person's story i couldn't judge the characters because they was who they were i didn't have a favorite character but i didn't dislike them it had a terrible flow and it was too choppy there were so many unanswered questions it bothers me that i don't know what happened to the characters i guess each story was just mentioned to describe one particular point in each person's lives i am glad she told the granddaughter's point of view because the mom's cassie story was horrid and very confusing i caught on that she was mentally ill but what happened before she became ill what triggered if anything her illness the book started with the deaths of her 7 month old twins i had to recover from that before i could continue the main character hattie was a bitter old prune even when she was young and no one knew why she had a baby with another man while still married to her husband which was disturbing then she left the man and i guess he never seen his child again the child with two names she was called one name with her real family and the other name with her fake family i couldn't detect any sense of time except the years in which the chapters start i couldn't tell the ages of the children i felt like each character was a stranger to their siblings and their mother one of her daughters had an affair with her mother's baby daddy didn't she know that this was her sister's father what happened to billups was he raped by that man i really wish the stories would have connected at one point or another in the book each story was so different and nothing related i enjoyed the story for what it was worth but i was very confused throughout the book this is the reason for the 3 stars","1770":"very sad and oprah book clubesque but thought provoking all the same","1771":" is there a limit on the amount of love a parent can have for their child if you have more than one child is it possible to have loved your other children so much that you have nothing left for the others or is it just possible for life to beat you down so much so that you have nothing left to give your children except a place to stay food to eat and a determination to survive i can't find fault with hattie shepherd giving birth to your first children at the age of 19 in a new city can be overwhelming to find yourself giving birth years later at the age of 46 is surprising then to turn around at 74 and find yourself mothering your grandchildren is not an easy road but how do you explain that to your children who only see you as cold and uncaring somebody always wants something from me she said in a near whisper they're eating me alive as you read you'll be caught up in the lives of lloyd the musician six the wonder boy preacher the high strung and insecure alice who pretends her brother billups needs her when in reality she's the one that desperately needs him bell who seeks revenge against hattie when all she really wants is to know the secret joy her mother found once upon a time and countless others mathis dedicates chapters to the various offspring but their interactions as children aren't explored as much as they are as adults she wants you to see who they've become as a result of living in the house i love the set up of the book it feels like a compilation of short stories that are loosely tied together with the only common thread being that hattie and august have given birth to them with the exception of alice and billups we see very little interaction among the siblings once they leave home it's as if hattie's lack of love spread to them and there's nothing that bonds any of them together part of the great migration to the north i wonder how much of hattie's coldness is a reflection of her surroundings while her husband august longs for the georgia he remembers minus jim crow hattie refuses to even speak its name still you have to wonder if august lamenting over leaving the south is valid would hattie have been different would the children have had different lives had they been surrounded by paper shell pecans sweet gum trees gigantic peaches and neighbors whose names they could recite years later","1772":"this is an oprah book through and through but i really liked it life is such a journey and all we really see are only little snippets","1773":"hattie as part of the great migration moves to philadelphia with her husband where she raises 11 children each chapter focuses on one of these kids or grandchild with her role usually pushed to the periphery i like stories with multiple narrators but i felt like these didn't hold together very well nor help illuminate very much about hattie as a person","1774":"very good i listened to it on audio very interesting family story and characters","1775":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i didn't want this book to end but afterwards i was glad the pain and heartbreak was over as with many oprah books there were tough lessons contained within all real situations that happen in life and true historical landmarks contained within this novel not a warm fuzzy book nor a warm central character to the novel but hattie's intentions were ultimately good enjoyable writing style great voices of each character although more depth would have been great unique use of chapter to i didn't want this book to end but afterwards i was glad the pain and heartbreak was over as with many oprah books there were tough lessons contained within all real situations that happen in life and true historical landmarks contained within this novel not a warm fuzzy book nor a warm central character to the novel but hattie's intentions were ultimately good enjoyable writing style great voices of each character although more depth would have been great unique use of chapter to meet each tribe of hattie the matriarch easy to read i finished it in a few days on vacation congratulations to ayana mathis on her debut novel here's to many more more","1776":"it's never a good sign to be relieved when a book is over this story was so disjointed that i could never figure out who the characters were and why i was supposed to care until it was nearing the end of their chapters none of the characters were like able which made it even harder to read the stories jumped from person to person without any rhyme or reason the first chapter started off strong and sadly the book went downhill from there","1777":"well written interesting examination of a cross section of life over time","1778":"a collection of 12 or more depressing stories couldn't read past chapter 3","1779":"great read choked me up","1780":"if there were a 3 5 star option i probably would have gone with that but i decided on the upgrade because it is a first novel and first novelists get the benefit of the doubt in my personal rating system the book is a series of loosely interconnected stories about the children of the novel's namesake hattie shepherd the children each get a focused chapter and then are mostly not heard from or mentioned again this is a shame because several of the characters were sufficiently interesting that i wish we could have spent more time in their company even though their company was a depressing and often emotionally wrenching place in which to dwell in other words i wish there had been fewer tribes of hattie and more time and space dedicated to each tribe i do not think the scope of the novel would have suffered much and the depth of it would have been greater and more resonant that said the one character about whom we learn a fair bit hattie shepherd of the tribe was rendered with great compassion and poignance she is the character that most made the book a worthwhile reading experience for me and the small but profound bit of redemption at the very end felt like a reward well earned for her and for the reader","1781":"i didn't enjoy reading this book and i did lose interest in it whilst it included some good writing throughout it felt like just a collect of the individual stories which didn't come together to provide an overall plot","1782":"if you are one of those people who thinks oprah only picks depressing books you would be right with this one i'm not sure what all the fuss is about this book every awful thing that can happen to a family happens to this one each chapter more awful than the one before i thought there might be something positive eventually so i kept on reading i think if i were african american i would be especially offended as it perpetuates all the myths the culture is stereotyped with","1783":"an oprah choice good writing for first time author but subject matter is still about bumbling people 12 short stories","1784":"this book lacks use of literary devices it just comes across as a bland retelling of a family history it fails to draw me in and connect to the characters","1785":" the twelve tribes of hattie is a compelling story about a woman named hattie as well as a story about her tribe of eleven children hattie was just fifteen in 1924 when she her mother and a sister came to philadelphia from georgia as part of the great migration her father was murdered by two white men down south in philadelphia hattie meets august shepherd and by the time hattie is 17 she is the mother of twins even in philadelphia hattie can't seem to escape tragedy her twins become contract pneumonia and later die her husband offers no support or comfort yet as the years pass hattie gives birth to nine more children children that she seems incapable of expressing love or tenderness to in fact she in many ways seems like contributes to her dissatisfaction about how her life has turned out the story covers a period 55 years 1925 1980 and is told in chapters that focus on each of her children and later in 1980 on her 10 year old granddaughter each chapter has a year as well as the name of one or two of the children it is through her children and their issues that the reader gets to see the real hattie as her children are growing up and later on as adults we see how hattie's perpetual unhappiness and inability to nurture has affected her children the story is beautifully written and heart wrenching at times as well lovers of literary fiction will want to savior certain passages written almost like a series of interrelated short stories mostly bleak with certain characters dealing with real tough issues like abuse physical and mental illness alcoholism homosexuality etc however a reader who hangs in there will be treated to a few brief and happy moments as well as much as i liked the book it wasn't perfect i felt at times the flow felt somewhat disjointed and i also wanted to know more about some of the children the only character that i felt i got to know was hattie but perhaps that was the author's intent i think this book would make for a lively book club selection and i now understand why oprah has selected it have you read this one if so i would love to hear what your thoughts","1786":"a delightful story that evokes a sense of familiarity in it's telling the characters could ave been neighbors or relatives","1787":"nice writing yet i felt like i had heard it before in a couple of different books","1788":"good book not amazing but very good loved all the different voices different characters","1789":"great read some chapters more powerful than others","1790":"this is an excellent read i enjoyed the way the story was told and how each person contributed to the story of hattie through the years great writing and a promising author","1791":"i actually listened to this book and i felt like it was a fabulous selection for an audio book because of the number of characters narrating the story it was really interesting to get to know hattie and her life through the stories of her children i would not describe this as an uplifting story but i appreciated the realness of the characters","1792":"how do you prepare your children for a world you know is cruel fifteen years old with only the hope for a better life hattie shepherd leaves the american south for philadelphia sixteen and pregnant with twins hattie's american dream is shattered time and time again a cheating husband raising nine children in poverty discrimination and decimating heartbreak the narrative of hattie in this novel is chronological however each chapter is her children's stories their tenderness or steeliness to her tough exterior reflected in their own trials and tribulations whilst this provides fresh eyes and engaging yarns i feel this way of story telling has separated us from the character that matters most whose hardship is most painful in the first chapter something utterly devastating occurs if i had known hattie better as a reader i would have been in floods of tears this feeling followed me through the entire novel i was too removed from the emotions to feel anything more visceral than sympathy whilst this is a peculiar oprah book club selection no self help or eckhart tolle here this is a profoundly compassionate american debut and a tale that might bring you to your knees","1793":"the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis is a powerful story hattie came of age in a state and time when a white man could take anything he wanted from a black man including his life like many others she fled north with her mother and sister seeking safety and the chance for a better life hattie is just 15 when life teaches her these lessons 16 when her twin babies die in her arms she bears 9 more babies and fiercely teaches them the realities of life her story is told in alternating chapters through the children she raised the trials they gave her and the way she kept getting up and going on every time life knocked her down this is the story of a woman's strength and determination it is the story of children yearning for soft in a world full of hard angles and the story of a nation as it wrestled with the oppression of blacks and their striving to achieve equality in a world that judged by the color of skin also consider reading the non fiction warmth of other suns by isabel wilkerson the story of the black migration away from the south in search of better lives wilkerson was the first black woman in history to win the pulitzer prize for journalism","1794":" hattie has eleven children and this is their story scattered to the winds they travel the jazz circuit and the revival tents to upmarket homes and ghetto appartments to different countries and different cultures hattie's children witness illness infidelity and hunger some carry her resilience some her stubbornness some her adaptability this was a fantastic story of a time of great transition stretching from the apartheid nature of the southern states up into the 1980s hattie's story is one survival and the difficult choices that survival take","1795":"what an awesome book truly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it","1796":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here when i read fiction i like the main character to be someone worth cheering i liked hattie i hated hattie and only with a few pages left in this book did i start to smile for hattie once more it was this paragraph that made me see the true hattie hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if when i read fiction i like the main character to be someone worth cheering i liked hattie i hated hattie and only with a few pages left in this book did i start to smile for hattie once more it was this paragraph that made me see the true hattie hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind sure with that outlook hattie didn't need to continue having or trying to raise as many children as she did but she did no matter how hard it was no matter how angry it made her she did i wanted to love this book and hattie i hardly think this is the kind of book that is rave worthy still i liked the book i kind of like hattie more","1797":"i loved this book the book is about mental struggling and about the human mind each one of hattie's children her husband and herself has their own struggle and their own way of coping or not coping with life life choices poor or amazing are what makes us who we are and allow us to achieve things enjoy or suffer each one of them is different and it is quite interesting to see how they turned out very different mathis is a great writer and the audio book is narrated very well","1798":"reads like what should have been the first or second draft of a potentially powerful novel mathis is attempting a sort of african american epic a family saga with the matriarch hattie at the center stretching over three generations drawing heavily on classics of african american fiction there are many many echoes of morrison baldwin etc she centers each chapter on a different set of characters mostly hattie's children representing a different aspect of black experience mathis doesn't romanticize either the community or her characters hattie's closest literary relative is the hard side of pilate from song of solomon there are some powerful passages the final chapter is near the top in short a lot of pieces for a good book this isn't it for one thing it's probably impossible certainly impossible for a first novelist who's got some holes in her game to pack all of that into just over 200 pages mathis asks us to take far far too much on faith her characters are too clearly counters in the thematic game if hattie had been developed more fully that would have mattered less but she isn't her symbolic importance is clear but only rarely does she come alive on top of that there are way too many historical clunkers highway gutters crammed with trash well after that stopped being the norm kudzu appearing way out of its range at that point in time and vietnam chapter's just ridiculous which tipped the scales from a low three to two stars all of this could have been fixed with a good editorial eye and probably two or three more years writing mathis clearly has some talent but as of now she ain't got game","1799":" yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward i loved this book although i began with my own reservations this book told the story of hattie's children and of hattie dealing with it all i recognized so many emotions in this book that i did not expect these experiences involved alot of pain and people growing into themselves or despite themselves the style of the novel was short stories about each of her children but i think it worked well because we also got to learn things about hattie throughout each of the stories loving someone despite the ugliness and bad behavior that they have even sometime when it's yourself is an experience that we will all go through i don't want to ruin people's experiencing by explaining the plot but this is a story about the many different things that don't work out and how you have to keep going after it is definitely worth your time and energy","1800":"i liked the range of stories from the different family members and how they were spread out over time the overall tone was kind of sad though","1801":"although i enjoyed this it was not what i was hoping for at the time i just didn't connect to the characters and it was a bit of a downer i enjoyed the book but the characters and plot aren't sticking with me","1802":"great book club book i advise reading the great migration as a nonfiction companion","1803":"i did not want this book to end this book stirs up so many emotions it is raw and real what an excellent first novel","1804":" enjoyed parts of it some beautiful prose gave me a glimmer of what life was like for the emigres from the south to the north parts very depressing without any out in sight amazing group of what might be short stories but i didn't think were connected well enough one to the other would have like more development into the hattie character and what her emotions were we just saw that shesurvived and raised all these children one foot in front of the other and perhaps given the times and tribulaions she underwent that was the way it was she couldn't analyze just keet going and perhaps the deaths of her first responsibilities killed most of her emotions wished i had liked this highly acclaimed book better","1805":"i really wanted to love this novel because of the ethnicity of the characters but the novel was just ok for me","1806":"this book is very well written but it just didn't grab me","1807":"ugh i'm done with oprah this was a terrible book and life's too short to waste it on bad books","1808":"just like faulkner's as i lay dying it was beautifully written and really cracks open the complexity and loyalty of family and all of its dysfunctional members this writer is certainly gifted but just like faulkner's book it was bleak eerie and completely devoid of hope except for the last 3 pages i can't wait for the last 3 pages for hope","1809":" i'm so happy i ignored some of the reviews on here and decided to read this incredible novel how beautiful is the language hattie is the epitome of what an unlikely character is but you end up loving her anyway you love her because one moment defined everything in her life and she allowed it to you love her because she stopped fighting in the end you love her because she saved sala from another form of denial please read it we need to understand the past our history in order to understand the present truth after all is stranger than fiction","1810":"disappointed once i started reading u0026amp realized that this is more of a collection of related short stories than a novel probably wouldn't have finished if not for a good writing style u0026amp fewer than 250 pages sad complicated lives","1811":"i wasn't sure that this one would be for me but wanted to check it out i made it through floyd's story before giving it up i hated what hattie had to go through with the twins so sad i hated that floyd didn't feel like he could feel like he could want what he wanted or even talk to someone about it after these 2 depressing stories i couldn't bring myself to keep listening in the end this one just wasn't for me","1812":"wonderful and at times really powerful writing i kept waiting for a big connection between the family members and without it i felt a little unsatisfied","1813":"incredible writing from the first word all the way to the very last subtly powerful sentence","1814":" so despite this being a novel it is really just a collection of short stories each chapter is one of hattie's 11 kids and the last chapter is her granddaughter sala although with 11 kids clearly hattie has many more grandkids that could have been illuminated i liked the structure but the large skips in time and main character of the chapter it is all omniscient narrator so there is no perspective change makes it much more like a collection of stories than a novel i have been waiting for this book to become available as a kindle library loan so part of my rating may be disappointment but really there was nothing overly profound or interesting here i liked hattie's strong woman character it takes a steely woman to raise that many children especially with little to no help from her husband and i found it very believable that the kids thought she was cold we do get some insight with the first chapter and that her first two are the ones that died hattie understood them as extensions of herself and loved them because they were hers and because they were defenseless and because they needed her and later hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind i also liked the descriptive and non judgemental way that mathis dealt with addiction and gambling and women chasing most of the men her are stereotypical in that they all are sleazy and abandon their families to some extent i like her description of this cyclical relationship between poor choices and continued negative behaviors a night of excessive drinking or losing all his money at dice or any other debauchery he could not dwell on these breaches of his willpower lest he indulge them more often and i'll stay out of fights and the brig i think i can do that get myself together i've done it before though sometimes i think i am just a bleary drunk and the periods when i am clean and shaved and useful i am only hiding from myself i also liked that she was ambivalent about religion despite several very religious characters hattie remains agnostic and she prevents sala in the end from declaring herself a believer six's experiences are fraudulent but effective he can perform miracles it seems there is enough questioning here that i did not feel as if mathis was preaching at me in essence there wasn't anything purely good or holy maybe good was only accomplished indirectly and through unlikely channels overall it was entertaining and there are some interesting subtle and not so subtle comments about race and sexual orientation and male female relationships but ultimately it is just an oprah book ever since jonathan franzen threw a fit about having the o symbol on corrections i am skeptical of the quality of oprah's choices mathis tries hard to be pc and she does give us some minor insights but the book overall is nothing to be excited about","1815":"i liked it at first i was thrown off by it being different stories where i just wanted them all to be background and we could see them all together in the end but i thought she did a great job of sort of pulling certain scenes back into the story it was heartbreaking at most points and you really wanted everything to work out ok i would get more detailed but don't want to give it all away","1816":"sorry oprah this one was a miss another novel populated with people you feel sorry for but no one to root for realistic probably but not very compelling","1817":"very interesting read it went a little bit everywhere which i enjoyed but never really ended i enjoy a book with a good ending closure and this doesn't have it","1818":"i started this book u0026amp in characteristically i quit reading it early on i found it disjointed and hard to relate to","1819":"there's a lot of sadness frustration and darkness in this book which tells the stories of hattie and her 11 children born between 1925 and 1954 plus a granddaughter born in 1970 as they confront personal challenges related to prejudice physical and mental illness gambling infidelity sexual abuse and more while likely not an uplifting read this is a good window into a variety of societal issues and what it was like to face them as an african american in the us in the 50s 60s and 70s","1820":"i could not get into this book i tried and gave it my best shot but i just couldn't","1821":"this was a very well written book but it seemed to just end abruptly","1822":"good read and enjoyed reading about the variety that existed among a family if twelve and how the mothers attitude and demeanor meant so much in each of the children's development i was surprised by the ending because if how abrupt it was i had to re read the last several pages to better understand the ending","1823":"ms mathis is a beautiful poetic writer the characters are complicated and believable her writing makes the reader feel compassion for each of the characters there is no villain here just people who are trying to do the best with what they have unfortunately there are many victims whose lives were adversely affected by the life situation in which this family found themselves","1824":"i absolutely loved the structure of this book very unique way of telling a story","1825":"i enjoyed this book but because of the structure of it i wasn't compelled to read it in one sitting","1826":"mathis is a good writer and her prose was enjoyable to read that's what the 3 stars are for but the story itself was disappointing too disjointed to ever feel complete ideas were transmitted and as a bookclub reader i am so tired of moms who get the lion's share of responsibility for both their children's basic survival and their eventual adult personhood while the checked out dad seems to escape moral censure entirely","1827":"this novel traces the life of a young southern women through the lives of each of her eleven children as they become adults and make their own lives as they move farther away they remain connected to her and she to them in a strong bond and in the end redemption","1828":"ayana mathis crafted an intriguing read about an african american family spanning through decades of jim crow law in the south through the migration north to philadelphia and many of the historical developments that entails at the same time in the forefront is the at times heartbreaking yet somewhat heroic life of the complex protagonist hattie and her tribes offspring at the end i was vested and wanted to know more about these children mathis is a wonderful storyteller i missed her interview with oprah on tv although i'll try to locate it on the own website and am looking forward to a reading by mathis here at the university of iowa where she attended the iowa writers workshop later this month","1829":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it was like a roller coaster up and down wild and crazy didn't want to get off","1830":" this is an excellent book i loved it and loved hattie a character who on the surface seems hard to love she appears to be strict a little mean and far from tender with her children but inside she loves them dearly and does what she does in order to keep them alive and thriving she also is dealing with a difficult life of her own and growing to adulthood during the migration of african american families from the southern usa to the north each chapter is a different year and focuses on different characters the first chapter is hattie and her twins in the early 1920s then each chapter works through the years until the last chapter 1980 which focuses on hattie's granddaughter the stories characters and flow of the story will grab you you may even have trouble putting this one down i give it 4 5 stars","1831":"clearly oprah's book club is rigged as i have yet to read a book i like from her selections this book is really really bad there is no plot the writing is fragmented and meandering and worse yet the characterization is undeveloped there was nothing uplifting about this story","1832":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here well this book was sweeping and compelling in its focus and scope i really liked the way that each chapter focused on a different child of hattie which brought in different experiences views states and time periods however i found that many stories were left very much unresolved which was dissatisfying at times although often they appeared again later in their siblings stories clearly hattie brought her children up in tough circumstances and tough times which hardened her as a mother thi well this book was sweeping and compelling in its focus and scope i really liked the way that each chapter focused on a different child of hattie which brought in different experiences views states and time periods however i found that many stories were left very much unresolved which was dissatisfying at times although often they appeared again later in their siblings stories clearly hattie brought her children up in tough circumstances and tough times which hardened her as a mother this is no doubt a true fact and very realistic but each of the stories is so sad that it is truly hard to read about how much each child was so screwed up by their parents and their circumstances a glimmer of hope would have made all the difference i felt desperately sad at the end definitely worth a read for the realistic and affecting portrayal but don't expect an uplifting ending more","1833":" i would have enjoyed this novel more and given it another star if i hadn't accidentally purchased the oprah version what this means is that the text on your reading device will be littered with giant green o's which you can click on to read oprah's thoughts on certain sentences passages the experience is very similar to having someone reading over your shoulder and periodically clearing her throat in an attempt to get your attention i have nothing against oprah but what makes her think she has the right to come between the reader and the text or an author as a book lover she should know that the relationship between text and reader or author and reader is intimate and sacred it just ruin the whole experience for me","1834":"it was just a disjointed book and everyone is a screw up and self destructing so i had a hard time caring oprah likes books that are dark","1835":"there are few characters in this story whom i felt were likable there were so many ugly experiences although they could be true in life it was unpleasant and not a great read oprah's highlights were condescending and not that relevant i was disappointed in this book","1836":"powerful is how i would describe this novel you have to take what's given in this book and not wish otherwise i'm interested to know more about most of the characters but this is all i have for now mathis has given me a new perspective on several of my own family members and the saying i did the best i could as a parent that's all for now no spoilers here looking forward to discussions","1837":"i'd give this one a 3 5 star rating i enjoyed it but i felt there was something missing it reads almost like 12 individual short stories based around one character and the stories were too short to really get a sense of who the supporting characters really were i was hoping for a better connection","1838":"while the novel is less about the great migration than the complexities of life and survival of painful experiences i found it to be a compelling read i should also add that i love to feel my books literally and figuratively so i'm partial to the hardcover and deckle edge","1839":"it's hard to tell a story in so many perspectives and still be convincing but this novel pulls it off such an interesting story with a web of characters that leaves you haunted","1840":"i did not enjoy this book there are so many characters that i did not get to connect with any of them perhaps the point of the book is to understand the difficulties of the african american plight but there was nothing hopeful about the story 2 1 2 stars","1841":"loved this book about hattie a woman brought down by defeat struggle loss and disappointment like many of toni morrison's books it is cyclical in nature it starts off with hattie losing her baby twins a loss she never fully recovers from to a chance at redemption in the end with her granddaughter beautifully written there are so many dogears in my copy for metaphors imagery and just moments of awe i loved this book for its honest portrayal of life it is hard but in the end we all rise and meet the challenges as best we can pick up our feet and keep moving","1842":" like most people i was shocked by the shooting of unarmed teenager trayvon martin in florida this year you'll remember that his killer was a guy named george zimmerman who relied on the stand your ground laws as a defence - successfully it's a salutary reminder that the race based territory covered in ayana mathis' novel still has currency the novel starts in the 1920s in america a time when 6 million african americans escaped the segregation of the southern states by heading to the industrial north a huge migration of people perhaps the only equivalent in terms of size is the shift of chinese from rural china to the cities in the 20th century the book follows the stories of one girl hattie and her children as it plays out over the next thirty years each chapter focusses on one of the children of the family each story was engrossing and in each case i was left wanting more - this is perhaps a failing in terms of the format mathis was inspired by the notion of the twelve tribes of israel ''let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we should go up and the cities we will come to '' \"hattie's 12 tribes suggest the biblical figure of hagar the archetypal slave mother a popular subject in 19th and early 20th century american literature hagar provided a figure through whom writers such as harriet beecher stowe pauline hopkins and eden emma dorothy eliza nevitte southworth could allegorise the nation's debates over race and slavery and whom writers such as toni morrison would later in song of solomon invoke america's troubled racial heritage http www theguardian com books 2013","1843":"a debut of extraordinary distinction ayana mathis tells the story of the children of the great migration through the trials of one unforgettable family in 1923 fifteen year old hattie shepherd flees georgia and settles in philadelphia hoping for a chance at a better life instead she marries a man who will bring her nothing but disappointment and watches helplessly as her firstborn twins succumb to an illness a few pennies could have prevented hattie gives birth to nine more children whom she raises with grit and mettle and not an ounce of the tenderness they crave she vows to prepare them for the calamitous difficulty they are sure to face in their later lives to meet a world that will not love them a world that will not be kind captured here in twelve luminous narrative threads their lives tell the story of a mother's monumental courage and the journey of a nation beautiful and devastating ayana mathis's the twelve tribes of hattie is wondrous from first to last--glorious harrowing unexpectedly uplifting and blazing with life an emotionally transfixing page turner a searing portrait of striving in the face of insurmountable adversity an indelible encounter with the resilience of the human spirit and the driving force of the american dream mathis's first novel heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction goodreads descriptionthis is one of those books you read and then have to think about how you feel about it hence waiting a few days to put it on my list and rate it i liked the author's descriptive writing i could really envision the characters from their looks to their setting don't really like being left hanging with each character on the close of most chapters would have liked more writing on the relationships between the siblings with that many children this was a book club book looking forward to hearing other members feedback","1844":" haven't read a lot in past years certainly not in the years of all the frenzy of oprah book club so this may very be the first oprah book i've read saw it available as epub about 2 days after first saw it mentioned in a book site having just had reference to 12 tribes via a tall ship in savannah harbor owned operated by the 12 tribes that's another story and having had at least 2 aunt hatties and feeling on the cutting edge of the oprah world for once i snatched it to my ereader i read it i finished it it falls in the category of interesting it chronicles hattie and her life and children and is well portrayed as how individuals deal with a dreary and difficult life experience it was also a bit depressing but by the last lines as is often the case in reality there was hope for redemption and something that could be 'more' or be changed excellent book for a first time author no doubt it is well crafted and hats off to the author for any next venture decision to read depends on your interests reading motivations subject matters i'm neutral but don't think i'd make it high on my list to recommend to those in my circles","1845":"wow what a book this author ms mathis had me hooked in the very first chapter unbelieveable book of life hard life and challenges written in a way that grabbed me as i cared and loved each of her children and their individual personal tragedies and hattie herself stong as ever","1846":"a real downer well written but definitely a downer","1847":"interesting characters story lines and writing concept i found this book through oprah's 2013 bookclub my heart broke for hattie her children august and their future it's sad to think this could be a true story of those times in america's south","1848":"unlikeable characters and relentless whining","1849":"i don't think i really liked this book if it had been longer than its 240 pages i would have quit after chapter 3 or so this isn't so much about the twelve tribes of hattie as about one single episode in the lives of each of twelve children if you want to learn about the many ways that individuals and families can be dysfunctional and learn about a family that doesn't really have a single normal success story this is the book for you the problem is that you learn just a bit about each child at a single point in their lives and the ties between the siblings are very sparsely noted if you think of it as a series of twelve short stories perhaps you'll be more satisfied by this book i was lefting wanting to know more about the characters and their interactions as they grew up from childhood into adulthood the writing is fine and it's easy to read i finished it in three evenings reading much of it while my husband had the tv on in the background there's not a whole lot that requires intense concentration so it's a quick and easy read if you want to give it a try","1850":" as someone who loves studying our history and reading i was extremely excited to start reading this book ayana did not disappoint this was a book of amazing stories from one strong proud and even a little dysfunctional family but the dysfunction or familiarity similarity is what endeared me to the characters and their stories i don't want to include any spoilers so i will simply suggest this as a must read for anyone seeking a richer and more colorful glimpse into history not just african americans or better understanding of family dynamics and why we are the way we are i promise you will not be disappointed","1851":"i loved how we learned more about hattie through the eyes of her children than we did by reading her own words and thoughts honestly i wanted a little more yet i was still satisfied with the book hattie represents the angry black woman to me a woman who once had dreams but life happened","1852":"this book told the very sad tale of hattie who becomes pregnant at 15 by a one night stand they marry and then she experiences a terrible tragedy that affects the rest of her life she and her husband have 9 more children each chapter tells the story of one of those children in relation to the rest of the family i thought that each chapter could stand alone as a short story","1853":"i think i would have liked this book more if it was a single cohesive storyline but it was still a beautiful story nonetheless i came away truly admiring hattie in spite of all her faults and her coarseness because it's clear that she loves her family and is doing the best she knows how to do","1854":"i liked the format of this book and how each character's story could stand on its own yet still be a part of the overall of puzzle that was hattie's life i like the way mathis writes even though the book left a lot of unanswered questions i guess maybe that was the point","1855":"one of the worst books i've ever read not really about black migration to the north feels like a first novel which it is written in a writing class cannot figure why it's on the best seller list unless it's because of the sex my entire book club agreed","1856":" to me this novel's greatest strength is its narrative structure it's a brilliant concept to explore a central character through her children devoting chapters to all of them hattie is defined and restricted and shaped by her role as the family matriarch which is conveyed in part by the structure of the twelve tribes of hattie as a reader the interconnected stories get a bit repetitive depressing and claustrophobic i longed for hattie and her children to break out of a vicious cycle of disappointment resentment and foolish pride everyone blames someone else for their failings they are all self absorbed in their perpetual misery or momentary triumphs or long simmering anger it is understandable of course given their life experiences but it doesn't always make for an enjoyable read there is little uplift to relieve the unrelenting suffering and the language matches the narrative disclaimer i listened to the audio book so i am not sure if that changed my response to it","1857":"the twelves tribes of hattie by ayana mathis reviewed by george hemingway isomin 1925 at age 15 hattie and her mother leave georgia for philadelphia in search of opportunities impossible to achieve under jim crow hattie becomes pregnant and marries within two years after their arrival she has twins who die at home from lack of medicine and heat their death deeply traumatizes hattie and affects her attitude and behavior toward each of her subsequent children she has 9 more she is unable to show her love to them as they desire with hugs and kisses and tenderness instead she expresses her love by devotedly caring for their physical needs such as keeping a roof over their heads food in their stomachs clothes on their backs and watching over them to keep them safe and secure their father unlike hattie lavishes them with hugs and kisses as well as the women on whom he spends hattie's savings hattie's story is told over a period of 55 years during this time the life of each of her children unfolds in a highly realistic manner revealing its joyless and hopeless and cruel aspects the story of each member of this complex family is artfully crafted and brilliantly written mathis's poetic depictions are striking affecting the emotions and drawing the reader more into the story incidentally it was a nice touch mentioning jazz icons on page 16 coleman hawkins and lester young aka pres page 24 thelonius monk and duke ellington at minton's playhouse and page 32 \"round midnight\" it's to be expected that a novelist improves following his her first novel but in this case i don't see how ayana mathis can get any better the best is not yet to come it is here","1858":"i wasn't terribly enthusiastic in learning my bookclub's leaders had chosen this for november and my sense was right while the writing is well structured the story is lacking it's disjointed and without a sense of purpose or conclusion as others have said it's bleak if you're inclined to give it a miss do so this is the second oprah's bookclub 2 0 book i've read both due to my bookclub and neither have been worth it","1859":"some storylines were captivating while others fell flat","1860":"very fine novel about a family highly recommend","1861":"it was an ok book not really a fan of the story line","1862":" ayana mathis' debut novel the twelve tribes of hattie tells the story of an african american family from 1923 to 1980 in a series of short stories about each of hattie's children and in the process reveals the struggle of hattie to survive the hardships of raising a large family while not losing herself in the process it's a sad but beautiful story of a strong woman's survival in the mean streets of mid century philadelphia what i liked most about this novel was its structure what it leaves unsaid gives the reader opportunity for thought and conjecture i highly recommend it","1863":"learned a lot about the southern migration and each story is poignant and sometimes haunting but the stories needed some more connections to make a whole","1864":"meh would recommend a better editor for this book the writing was good but the story was so confusing","1865":"this was a good read but i can't say i liked it there was not one likeable character in the novel and the writer's technique of devoting one chapter per child did not allow the reader to form a bond with any of them raised in poverty makes you mean end of story","1866":"hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind the twelve tribes of hattie is a sometimes gut wrenching tale of how one woman's bad decisions reverberate for decades in many devastating ways this echoing misfortune persists not only throughout hattie's life but also deeply into the lives of her tribe of children and grandchildren everyone around hattie both directly and indirectly suffers from her seemingly endless bursts of seething rage as she is continually confronted with the outcomes of her initial hapless choices nubile young hattie gives her virginity to marries and immediately moves away with someone who will arguably prove to be the wrong man august will spend nearly all of his adult lifetime with hattie engaged in a pair of two relatively effortless activities first he'll give hattie child after child who she'll struggle with sparse income to raise after their father has stopped pursuing even menial jobs but not other women second he'll deny hattie the dreams she'd once had of a better existence up north freed from the indignities to be suffered by blacks in the jim crow south are the sins of the parents necessarily visited upon their innocent children in the twelve tribes of hattie ayana mathis examines this biblical notion as she paints a picture of one fictional black family's questionably successful participation in the great migration mathis' debut effort offers the reader a look at the possible results of an often destructive conflict of basic human ambition and self determination versus the pernicious power of institutional racism for the \"tribes\" of hattie this conflict is sadly compounded by the tragic and cascading effects of an apparent simple lack of either maternal love or a more than minimally responsible father however as her life's dusk approaches hattie seems to recognize her failures in the lives of her now grown children and the rapidly declining time she has left to make amends she summons her remaining strength and will and begins guiding the family's third generation toward a more hopeful prosperous and reality driven future","1867":"i really enjoyed this book depressing as all get out but you expect that from an oprah's book club book beautifully written with a cast of unforgettable characters","1868":" oh this is a heartbreakingly beautiful book and i might still decide to give it five stars but the ending just wasn't enough for me i noticed that some of the lower star reviews criticized the form in that each chapter is more like a short story about one or more of hattie's children but just as i loved the complexity of the search for olive kitteridge i loved what we learned from each of hattie's children and from hattie herself on behalf of one of her children this one gets my cried like a baby rating for the chapter about ella","1869":"this beautifully written sad hopeful novel deserves the attention it is getting i can't wait to read more from the gifted ayana mathis","1870":"i would rate this 3 1 2 stars the novel is about the children of hattie and august they move from georgia to philadelphia in the 20s when newly weds each chapter is about one of their kids told in their voice the kids' stories begin in the 1950s and continue to the present some of the kids are more interesting than others the novel is well written","1871":"well written especially for a first time novelist but hattie is so broken and so determined to make sure her children do not know happiness so their dreams don't get crushed that it is hard to like these people each chapter is dedicated to one child and then they are never heard from again it might be realistic but a little frustrating to the reader","1872":"given that this was an oprah book i was expecting a sappy tragic story not to be disappointed the story has it's tragic element there are dead infants within the first several pages of the book the writing however is excellent i liked the feature of each chapter dedicated to a different child i think written any other way it would have been a poor hattie story and would have been far less compelling by looking at each child you get a picture of the family was like the effect that poverty abuse mental illness had on the family i'm sure it would be a good study of nurture versus nature","1873":" took me a while to get to this one the latest in oprah's cherished book club i want to say first off i think this writer has a beautiful ability there's much to like here as far as her ability to capture scenes character but what she lacks here is a real narrative there's just no story here i looked around to find what i might have missed going on to other reviews and the like and i gathered that it is supposed to be about the effects of the great migration but this did not ring true for me had the author only gone deeper into hattie a very tough character to get to know or like to see her feelings on this it would have helped but this doesn't occur in fact i felt that i did not know any of the characters really for the good writing ability i give it 3 stars","1874":"what a wonderful book with such an eclectic cast of characters","1875":"pretty good book you grow to love and understand these characters and see how one big thing can change your life forever","1876":"loved how the author managed to write in different voices for each character and yet keep all of them believable","1877":"hattie did what needed to be done the theme that ran so deeply throughout this book i really enjoyed this book and the description did it no justice i felt every emotion along with every heartbreak a mother's love the way a mother shows her love and the perception of those around her truly powerful","1878":"a well written but depressing story i didn't particularly connect with any of the characters but kept reading hoping something would happen","1879":"i almost bought this book in the airport bookstore but made myself wait till i could get it from the library a really riveting read each chapter tells the story of one of the children of hattie an african american woman who migrated north to philadelphia from georgia in the 1920s with her family","1880":"very good i was struck by how seamless the transitions between the sections were despite that they each follow a different character at least notionally - in two of the sections the subjects are young babies which allows for more focus on hattie following all of hattie's children gives a depth and breadth that a novel in a different simpler format wouldn't have sharply written tender and unflinching","1881":"clearly the work of a writer with a long career ahead of her the first chapter is gripping and tense and sets the stage for the trials of this family to come not sure yet how i feel about the overall episodic structure and the momentum but the surety of voice here means i'll be looking forward to what comes next","1882":"i can't believe that i kept listening to this book this has a terrible read and would not recommend it to anyone it reminded my of a persons scattered thoughts nothing quite fit with me on this book not only that it had a large amount of f words and ended terribly","1883":"wish there was a bit more closure and character development but overall a good read","1884":"loved it wanted each story to continue","1885":"i made it through to the end but found nothing redeeming read this book if you want to be sad and depressed and that is it","1886":"definitely more of a 4 5 star review because this one was really really good an interesting narrative device for sure but it suffers from what almost all anthologies can suffer from the pieces can't help but be uneven it starts with gut wrenching tragedy then pirouettes through heartache pain hope terror and remorse but doesn't quite stick the landing the way i wanted it to make no mistake though this is a strong recommend","1887":"i wanted more","1888":"just started but not so sure that it's going to come together for me even if oprah recommended it","1889":"i liked the writing but i did not like the set up i was just getting interested in a character one of hattie's children and then you never hear about them again after their chapter is up what happened to them the book starts with hattie and ends with hattie but shouldn't have gotten us so invested in her children's adult lives if we never find out what happens to them","1890":" this was the second choice of the oprah 2 0 book club and also a first time author i had read quite a bit about her and the comparison to toni morrison and i have to tell you i loved this book being canadian the history of black people in america doesn't come up that often in canada but when there is a book like this that is during a time in history where the black culture was vastly moving along it was very interesting to hear the perspective of the 12 people in this book i really learned something and look forward to more books by this author","1891":"this book is very well written but i don't think it lives up to the hype it reads more like twelve short stories each centered around one of hattie's children grandchildren i think it would've been better had it stuck with hattie throughout the book as i found the changing narrative somewhat disjointed also the majority of the characters were unlikable which made this book feel longer than it was i don't consider likable characters a necessity for a good book but when you have thirteen plus it'd be nice if at least one of them was","1892":"a tragic story each story about almost every single one of hattie's children was just flat out sad and hopeless couldn't one of twelve kids have found a way to make a better happier life relentlessly tragic","1893":" a striking allegory for the consequences of the great migration of african americans to the north this is also a well wrought portrait of the titular character through the lives of her children and those around her this is the kind of novel i used to read all the time and that i seem to see less and less it is also the type of warts and all story that would get criticism for negative portrayals but it is well worth your time i put this on my list to read before oprah picked it i just feel the need to say that thank you","1894":"extremely well written vibrant description and incisive observations re human nature i just wish all the stories about the individual children came together as a whole more and i really wanted to know more about hattie","1895":"it appears the author sacrificed depth to minimize the length of this book i wish she had spent more time on the many characters rather than devoting a chapter on each and then moving onto the next one","1896":"tales through the decades through the eyes of members of hattie's tribe the great migration north church family spite devastation desperation parenting music a quick read with some writing that evoked the senses but not a stand out","1897":"i read almost all of oprah's book club books when she had her talk show it has been a while but i saw in entertainment weekly that she has a new book club 2 0 she recommended this book i really loved it it was like a collection of short stories but each is connected to hattie one of the things i liked about this choice is that many of oprah's novels when she had her old book club the protagonist was a woman who went through bad times but persevered there are a lot of characters in this selection and not all do well don't get me wrong there is hope at the end of the book but this was a darker selection than many of the other choices i have read when i finished i thought of people who i would recommend this pick to i'm glad i read it","1898":"the writing was vivid and pulled me in but the story was hideous after first couple of chapters it was choppy showing snippets of each child's life in each snippet there was no beginning or end just some random chapter of the life none were happy or even well adjusted all blamed their mother as the sole reason for their unhappiness why must all of oprah's book club recommendations be about unhappy depressed people oh well one more must read book checked ofg","1899":"i really enjoyed this book this book follows the life of hattie and her many children throughout their lives in philadelphia and various locations in the south from the 1920s 1980s even though the book contained many characters each was fully developed believable and interesting the characters in this book have many struggles including poverty sickness mental illness marital strife racial prejudice etc not an easy read due to the difficult topics covered but i highly recommend it","1900":"hattie's tribes are her children and each one faces a unique set of circumstances that touched my senses emotional and beautifully written i am so glad this is an oprah read so ayana mathis can get the publicity she deserves","1901":"all i can say is blech","1902":"overall this was a unique intriguing book that reminded me vaguely of toni morrison's writing style i do wish that the author focused on less children and instead worked in more of a connection with the vignettes and some deeper symbolism i would definitely recommend this book","1903":"i really enjoyed this book but it left me with wanting just a little more i have read oprah's books in the past and i know they tend to leave me sad this one is no different maybe i wanted a little more for hattie i would recommend it though","1904":" it is not easy being a mother it doesn't matter what year you were born your race your economic status and it doesn't matter how many children you have hattie knew her life wasn't going anywhere fast in georgia in 1923 so she quickly flees to philadelphia and marries only to have her life get more complicated instead of easier her first joy is the birth of twins and her first and possibly greatest tragedy happens at their death from pneumonia each chapter is narrated by one of hattie's nine surviving children through them we see a harsh side of her her disappointment in life that shows itself at every turn and the love of her children which she keeps to herself fans of the color purple and their eyes were watching god will find themselves falling for the twelve tribes of hattie each narrative will break your heart and bind you to this close but vulnerable family book clubs would be wise to choose this book as it offers a myriad of discussion topics i was lucky enough to receive an advance of this author's wonderful debut and it is scheduled to be published in january 2013","1905":"somewhat meh the book reads like a series of short stories that is loosely tied together by a narrative about a strong willed and distant mother i'm sure there are lots of similarities between the twelve children and the twelve apostles but since i'm not a church goer and certainly never set foot in a sunday school i don't have a clue as to what those similarities are","1906":"i really liked this book you get an excellent feel for hattie through the eyes of herself and her children","1907":"the story wasn't bad but none of the characters really grab you","1908":"i loved this book and then i got to the second half then i liked this book i thought the premise was wonderful mathis started out strong i felt i knew the characters and their supporting stories were compelling and easy to follow as time went on the vignettes became muddy the vietnam story was a hot mess no matter i read the book quickly and came back to it in short order because i wanted to know more hattie was a well drawn character real and vibrant i think i met her many times as a social worker she was smart tired cold and lonely emotional neglect is hard to describe but mathis excelled in this area read it it is worth your time","1909":"this was enjoyable but not great i like the characters and was impressed by this first time author overall good insight on motherhood family life but by the last chapter i was tired of how the book jumped around with minimal continuity","1910":"12 tribes has a novel format i enjoyed her style of writing lovely descriptions without the feeling of forced story construction","1911":"no holds barred real this book is about the choices we make in life and how they can affect the rest of your days it made me rethink the choices that i've made as a mother","1912":"i liked the book except it was so depressing that by the end i was just skimming to get to the end","1913":"a unique story told about the lives of hattie and her 12 children's lives","1914":" disappointed by this book it really did not live up to the hype although it was short it felt like a slog to get through another book of short stories masquerading as a novel the individual chapters didn't really hang together as each one was told from the perspective of a different one of hattie's numerous children family members jumping through time with characters generally barely ever being seen again after their original story it was reasonably well written and some parts were better than others but overall it was just unrelentingly depressing and not in a way that moved me or taught me anything i was actually kind of mad when i reached the end saying what was the point","1915":"could not read this book got about a quarter of the way through it then just couldnt read anymore","1916":"if you like short stories this is a good book i didnt like that it jumped all over the place the stories were not interesting either","1917":"this book runs the gambit emotionally very well written highly recommend","1918":"i just couldn't fully get into this book the writing was good but the story and back and forth between the characters was choppy","1919":" i enjoyed this book and liked the fact that each chapter was similar to a short story having said that i found the ending very disappointing to me it was as though the writer had reach the word limited and needed to wrap it up quickly i would of really liked another chapter that just summed up what happened to each child in their later stage in life prehaps the writer has left the door open for a second book but for me a finally chapter wrapping it all up would of been nice still worth reading though","1920":"very disjointed never got a feel for the family","1921":"hattie black a teenager pregnant the book starts out with hattie getting married and her first 2 children twins philadelphia u0026amp jubilee the following chapters shares a part of her next 9 children and 1 grandchild through their stories from 1925 to 1980 you get glimpses of hattie's life a great read","1922":" at first i was impressed with this story and i thought it was going to be about the great migration north while it began with reference to that migration it evolved into 12 short stories i found this book disappointing in that the stories were not well connected one comes away without seeing the point other than hattie was not the best mother and had a miserable marriage and her kids were all dysfunctional if you want a really good book about the great migration read wilkerson's the warmth of other suns it is nonfiction and vividly details the struggles of four families who made that migration this book is not worth the time","1923":"a quick read but the book left me wanting much more i felt there was the beginning of multiple great stories but none came to completion i was left dissatisfied and frankly in a horrible mood kind of like the last episode of the sopranos","1924":"powerful writing a search for a mother's love from a mother who did her best during difficult times","1925":"lovely writing not a happy story","1926":"beautifully written book the characters are so real and full of emotions i wish the book were longer and the characters were developed more than just one chapter each chapter ended abruptly leaving me wanting more at the end of the book there was no closure for me and i wanted more despite this i enjoyed the book and i'm glad i read it i look forward to reading more from this author","1927":" ayana has written a book that shows what some mothers face everyday a husband into himself and not giving his all the bring home money and she tells of her eleven kids and one granddaughter in relating the glimpses of each you find hattie in there giving of herself not always showing her love except by being there for her kids she losses her first two kids at age ten days old to pneumonia which she never gets over and never a day goes by when she doesn't think of her twins but it does harden hattie and yet she would give up her happiness for her children not an uplifting book but a book you can't put down i think some of ayana life does float into this book being she was a single mom and having a mom who was slightly mentally sick but would recommend this as a quick interesting book","1928":"i loved this book it moves very quickly but i really enjoyed it i do wish she had spent more time on each character though","1929":"this was another difficult book to rate i would prefer to give it a 3 5 it's very well written and an interesting story about the great migration of blacks from the south in the early 1900's unfortunately the main characters are all pretty miserable and hattie their mother is not a likable person at all my main complaint with this book is that the author introduced each of hattie's children in separate chapters but after the chapter is over they are never again mentioned","1930":"impressive first novel","1931":"though not a happy book it is an absolutely beautifully written book highly recommend","1932":" i really liked this book despite the fact that each chapter felt like a separate short story pieced together to tell hattie's story why four stars because i really wanted to know these characters i wanted to know what happened to each of them that brought them in brokenness to their point in the storyline i also wanted to hear more from hattie and august what i read was beautifully written there is so much potential and so many more stories to be told just with these characters where is floyd for over 10 years why did he not return for alice's wedding what are the pills she's taking and is cassie the only one who is mentally ill do ella and ruthie learn of their true parentage does franklin survive vietnam and have a relationship with lucille i would love to see how the kids interact with each other we are given only a glimpse of their relationship through the guilt felt by bell and cassie after six's accident and the responsibility felt by alice regarding billups situation i love that as they are older they see that hattie did not love with hugs and kisses but she loved the best way that she knew how did the absence of that affection destroy her children and make them all in some way defective my maternal great grandmother was a hattie but she was married to a wonderful man her hurt came with her to her marriage she did not give hugs or compliments that i recall but when the cabinets were bare she was there with food when you were sick she was there to nurse you to health even after her death she was there in my dreams the time line was not a problems because each chapter was disconnected from the previous chapter i look forward to watching ayana grow as a writer i hope that one of her future works will bring back the shepherd kids","1933":"this was a great companion to isabel wilkerson's 'warmth of other suns ' so i was pleased to read them in close proximity","1934":"think of this more as a collection of short stories about members of the same family rather than as a well developed novel each member of hattie's family is developed within its section but hardly if ever reappears in the book i longed for the stories to be pulled together and for this to be a more complete novel it lacked that","1935":" i'm going to repeat what a number of other reviews have mentioned already it's a book with great writing but the structure one chapter for each of hattie's children and one grandchild doesn't work for the whole book and i normally like the form it's probably because it's rather uneven subject wise for example what the chapter floyd says is all him his confused sexuality his cowardice but ella on the other hand has very little to do with ella herself but is more about hattie's sister coming to claim ella for her own and of hattie's reaction to her and ruthie is all hattie i'm not quite sure i like what the entirety says about hattie either not one of her children seem to have a good life not even a peaceful one other than maybe the children who're not really given anything to do ruthie ella billups but then since we have no clue about these kids who's to tell while i loved the short stories i think i would have preferred had they not been siblings had they not shared the same mother i don't get it why is not one person alright mathis seems to impress upon us that while hattie did not show their children love the children realize or know that she is trying to keep them alive to make sure they're fed but if that's so then why did they all have to have miserable lives it seems impossible that no one that we know of led a normal life and hattie i can't say i understood her why was she so angry she seems to be dissatisfied from the time she was a child so it can't be the hardships she faced later on it's hard to sympathize with a character like that especially when this character contributes to the mess of her children's lives it was a powerful set of stories the themes dealt with are varied and all equally powerful sexuality betrayal poverty racism below the mason dixon line adultery insanity abuse and are superbly written it's a great first novel but i just did not like the statement it made about hattie","1936":"the stories unfold with enough space to allow your imagination to knit them together beautiful writing sorrowful and powerful stories of a family shaped by the misfortunes if hattie you will understand how each person is tied to hattie and her upbringing decisions and the tragedy if her first two children excellent first novel","1937":"throughout the book i kept thinking to myself how it felt like mathis started 12 13 very well written developed books but didnt finish one of them while i got that hattie was the thread weaving together each narrative i kept waiting for something else i'm not sure what that something else was but i waited for it i'm anxious to see what else she does with her immense talent","1938":"she is a wonderful storyteller but i struggled with the way the stories of each character just dropped off that is just me though i like things wrapped up neatly in a nice bow but life is not that simple and mathis does a great job reminding me of that the book has a deep sorrow and labored suffering to the lives in it and along the way the family is reaching and longing for connection the end gives promise that maybe hattie will allow herself to be vulnerable enough to soften her parenting style for the grandchild as my mom said this book makes you think indeed it does i found my heart cheering for the characters and wishing them the best","1939":"evocative and so sad","1940":"wow i have done all or most of oprah's titles and this is so much more and different really enjoyed hope this first time author continues to write","1941":"at times throughout this i thought it was wonderful other times i just thought it was strange i can't decide whether i liked it or not each chapter focused on a different child children and one a grandchild each chapter was independent like the book was full of short stories yet they all tied together","1942":"an interesting look at the african american experience in philadelphia and beyond after the great migration from the south in the early 1900's as told through the eyes of hattie and or her 12 children chapters are split and focus on telling an individual child's story at a poignant moment in their life by doing this the author takes the reader through american history and the issues of race sex and economic class of almost every decade","1943":"liked this book less than i thought i would stringing together short stories made the book lose momentum too often had to switch to the audiobook in order to finish reading it most of the characters were well developed but i couldn't find a plot to save my life","1944":"i really liked the book it was a very truthful and sad story of a family who has many issues","1945":"i wanted to like this but just couldn't","1946":"lord but these were some unhappy people still the writing was powerful and the story compelling i won't be forgetting hattie or her tribes","1947":"i agree completely with jeanette's review below great writing but lacking just as i was introduced to each of hattie's child she moved on to the next one lot of man hating also in the book","1948":"i should've suspected this book would be depressing as oprah's book club selections have usually veered in that vein for my taste anyway in the past well i wanted to give it a shot and i did it is what it is","1949":"ayana mathis created strong characters without bringing closure to any of them they were not introduced leaving the reader to guess who where when and what it could have been an excellent book","1950":"a story that feels like it could be totally true as a biography of a family the children of hattie i listened to the audio book and really liked it","1951":"debut novel almost worth a 5 hattie leaves georgia with her mother and sisters to move north during what is known as the great migration we follow her life and all its problems through separate chapters about each of her children as we move from the 1920's through 80's","1952":"i liked the way the stories were told","1953":"the structure of this novel was off putting for me as i never felt a sense of continuity or cohesiveness between the characters felt sad and depressed after finishing it didn't feel that the long descriptive paragraphs helped to create a better understanding of the characters their relationship to their mother or to each other disappointing for me because i have always enjoyed oprah's picks in the past","1954":"i read this book for my book club i think the part of this book that i struggled with was the flow the book was more a compilation of short stories than a novel and each story is about a different member of hattie's family the stories take place in different years and settings so i found it hard to get a sense of continuity and conclusion with the different issues concerning hattie's family i am sure some people will like this book but i tend to love books with deeply developed characters and one chapter per character wasn't enough for me","1955":"more like a series of short stories although all held together by the fact that they're about the same family but how different each family member is especially in the suffering they undergo as a result of the family dynamics to begin with not a lot overtly about racism yet many great portraits of different experiences that african americans must have in our country powerfully and beautifully written","1956":"this started off as a 5 star read however it soon showed itself as a collection of chapter stories on each of hattie's 9 children rather than a flowing novel btw the chapters were all quite good but too short also although i have started to enjoy stories of hardship and endurance it seemed like hattie's struggle was for nought yes at the end it appears that there may be a shining light in her granddaughter but since the granddaughter is still quite young i'm gonna guess her life is highly likely to turn out like everyone else in her family so really this is a story about a dysfunctional family who end up leading dysfunctional lives there was no hero here","1957":" not too shabby for a first novel it's a portrait of a mother as the only commonality between her children she's the mortar between tiles of her own cracked and crumbling mosaic perhaps mathis demonstrates powerful and beautiful writing where the disjointed seeming structure actually binds the story rather tightly in a theme about disjointedness readers cling to hope throughout the mother's journey to understand her broken family and they reach the same cycle of realizations as her a broken family is still a family is still broken is still a family the novel has oprah's stamp of approval but stands very well on its own","1958":"i loved hattie even at her worst","1959":" i wanted to love it i really did unfortunately it just wasn't fantastic enough for me to love it i did like it enough to finish it and i loved listening to it as an audiobook because the narrator was wonderful the story just kind of fell flat for me about 7 8 of the way through and if never resumed the momentum i felt disappointed with the ending too because it seemed very anticlimactic and didn't answer any of the questions i had about the other children i think the biggest question i had is this why is it called the twelve tribes of hattie when according to the narrator hattie only birthed 11 children unless there's a misprint or the narrator misspoke i'm left confused","1960":"just finished and not yet prepared to offer a full fledged review i am willing to say however that this novel is heart wrenching and repeats the pattern of angst filled literature that oprah seems to love","1961":"the girl can write her first published book i was taken by the title however i had to skip chapter two tmi and vivid i closed the book in jan 2013 and didn't pick it up until may 2013 the migration from the south to the north for a better life and a better life didn't always happen hattie a typical wounded unloved woman couldn't verbalize her love but she surely showed her love by feeding housing clothing and caring for her children and grandchild that's how she said it i love you with her committed daily deeds it is so typical in our black culture so much hurt had been seen heard and felt until they lived in a trans and just got through life day by day how sad it seems to me a comparison to our military defenders of this country who have fought in wars and seen so much and come back home only to be in a trans a daze through daily life never really connecting to the heart and souls of others","1962":"i never put it down ellyn outreach servicesreserve a library copy","1963":"this story takes the life of a young african american woman who comes to philadelphia from the south during the great migration in the 1920s and follows her life through the threads of her 11 children the stories elapse over the years and give quite a picture of what life was like for african americans of that time a really interesting and emotional book i liked it a lot it's a great book of character studies","1964":"i was drawn into the book by the first chapter it tugged at my heart strings the following series of chapters was so filled with fornication and downtroddeness that i almost gave up on the book but i'm glad i hung in to finish it the last few chapters where we see the loving caring side of hattie were nice to read and provided the happy ending i was hopeful for","1965":"this book is about hattie by meeting each tribe we learn more about her i found each character fascinating and thought the idea that each child was raised by hattie but had a completely different path in life reflected real life family dynamics hattie is an archetype of that time and her experiences shaped how she raised her family","1966":"first book by this author on the best selling list already how does that happen oprah interesting read starts in 1925 with the birth of twins hattie has 8 more children and also raises a grandchild lots to think about black families children marriage nurture predisposition religion i wish she'd been able to tell us more about the individual members of the family she did just one or two per chapter","1967":"a good read but nothing spectacular","1968":"pretty heavy but very thought provoking and well written","1969":"quick read each of hattie's children have a chapter the problem is that the chapters have nothing connecting them to a previous chapter would not recommend this book","1970":"i didn't like the stories about the kids as much as i did the ones about hattie herself i also think that the book felt incomplete like half of a family epic still it's beautifully written and hattie is a character that's incredibly engaging so over all i enjoyed it","1971":"i didn't know that much about this novel before i picked it up in a waterstone's deal as it definitely ticked my 'generational historical epic' boxes the twelve tribes of hattie follows hattie and her nine children as they move through the events of the twentieth century mathis has a really compelling writing style and i whizzed through this book despite the subject matter not always being the easiest to swallow the sense of place throughout the novel is also really well suggested without there being long flowery passages of writing however my main problem with the book was that the perspective changed literally every chapter we never stayed in the same character's head this meant that i never really felt connected to any of hattie's children despite their stories coming from a place of drama the only character i really sympathised with was hattie herself although i do seem to be the minority on that the scene towards the end of the novel with her sister really tugged at my heartstrings i will also say that as a novel that is sold to be playing out against the backdrop of the changing american history this seems to have precious little impact on the characters in mathis's novel whilst this may well be the point the fact that there is almost no mention of the civil rights movement or any of the ensuing legislation was a little confusing like nine children and not one was involved in the movement overall for a quick read which has intelligent roots it does fine and i would still be interested in reading mathis's next works so long as it focuses on maybe just one or two characters","1972":"i have a love hate relationship with oprah's book club it has led me to some of the best books i have ever read one hundred years of solitude being one and has also had me chucking books across the room because they were so horrible i'm talking to you she's come undone so i approached this book with trepidation i still don't see what all the raving accolades are about but it was a solid book that kept me reading from beginning to end hattie shepherd moved from georgia to philadelphia in 1923 when she was 15 years old from the time she stepped off the train and saw whites and blacks living their lives without segregation she knew that this was the place for her but from the time her first children were born in 1925 her life takes a path that she never expected this book tells the story of hattie's life through the eyes of her children as they struggle as a poor black family and hattie makes sacrifices none of them will every know this is definitely not a light hearted read hattie is unhappy in life unhappy in her marriage and pulls her children through life based on sheer iron will as a collection of short vignettes we get a full picture of hattie's life and the trials of her children ultimately i really enjoyed this book and the ending was beautifully done and reveals the true nature of hattie which despite her children's believes is a love of her family however i think it is suffering from extremely high expectation syndrom which is preventing me from the 5th star i was expecting something earth shattering and it just wasn't there","1973":"even thou a oprah book to read i would not recommend talk about boring","1974":"i liked the narration the musical voices of the characters and the historical backdrop of the great migration of black america from the south to the industrial north they were looking for a better life a life of promise and they found ghettoes and poverty and struggles to fit into the white world they encountered a world as cold as it was demanding a place where the past was forgotten and the future was not as hopeful as they imagined when they moved to places like cleveland and chicago and in this case philadelphia the cold of the north is a fitting setting for the first scene of the book in which a 17 year old mother newly arrived from georgia sits on a tiled bathroom floor with a mist of steam creating moisture to clear her twin babies' pneumonia filed lungs it's an unforgiving place this philadelphia that takes her husband away from her for long hours and leaves her to use simple home remedies to take the sickness away from her children it's a tender time as she knows she's losing them and will never be the same again what a shame that she had to become hardened and worried and consumed with too many concerns as child after child was born when hattie was still mourning the first two it's not lost on us that there were twelve tribes of israel and hattie had eleven children plus a grandchild she raised the stories overlap and we see how her children see her mother and how she sees them an intimate portrait of a family as dysfunctional as any family that is too large and too strapped for money","1975":"i loved this book and couldn't put it down it was such a human story i think i heard it compared to the help this was nothing like that book this one stands alone the characters are the richest and most believable i have encountered the writing is beautiful and real only a writer with exceptional depth could come up with these characters and scenarios read this book","1976":"good book even though i had to skip around a bit to keep my interest at times","1977":"i liked this book but a little disappointed i like that each chapter is a story about each of hattie's children hattie a young mom who disconnected herself from her children after the death of her twins a sad story","1978":"liked but did not love this book did not see what all the hoopla was about for this book","1979":"this book sounded very intriguing when i read the summary and i finished the book but i just didn't like it i didn't like the fact that each chapter was devoted to one or two of her children and then no more the book read more like a short story and i'm not a fan of short stories also i thought it was a very depressing book sorry","1980":"had trouble getting into this because i couldn't identify too much with the characters","1981":"what really attracted me to this book how it jumped through periods of history i thought that the author kept me wanting to know more about each character which i thought was well done however it did leave me with a lot of questions that i wished had been answered i want want want to know what happened to all of the kids mathis did creatively just enough to provide snapshots of the all of hattie's children the reader is able to learn about hattie through the eyes of her children and their perceptions of their mother i did think that the novel was more of a collection of short stories than a novel but they were vaguely connected through the lives of family members honestly i was shocked when the book was over i thought it was interesting that oprah added her comments and connections that were linked to some of the passages","1982":"great writing i didn't mind the lack of a real storyline because i loved the character development in each chapter miss hattie sure did produce some messed up children","1983":"as many commenters have noted this book is difficult to critique i neither hated it nor loved it but i'm glad i read it the writing is quite good but i really do not care for novels where the author uses multiple characters to narrate the book partly to do with the fact that i have a terrible memory for names so i have to figure out who the character is each time the narrator changes","1984":"this book is really well written and i really liked the unique format of how each chapter advanced the story from a different person's point of view sometimes oprah's book club selections can be rather depressing and this book got that way sometimes but the terrific writing kept me interested i was afraid the ending was going to be really depressing but it wasn't thank goodness i was ready to rate it only 3 stars until i read the last 5 pages","1985":"beautifully written but painfully depressing","1986":"i thought it was well written scenes u0026amp characters but i did not like the format the format made the story hard to really grasp on the whole i think you would have understood the family dynamics better if it wasn't such a fragmented format i thought it ended a bit abruptly too i think i got the point of the book in relation to the main character hattie but i also still think the format ruined a good writer's story","1987":"i love this book love a book about the the great migration u0026amp complexities of the human condition mathis is compared to morrison but i find this debut novel to be much more accessible and even more engrossing still processing this treasure too many great quotes to write but here are two at random franklin you can't let somebody like me off so easy i don't know what's wrong with me it's not like i don't know i'm doing wrong or like i'm powerless to stop myself i just do what i'm going to do despite what it'll cost me after i'm truly sorry bell wasn't it funny that when she left her mother and the rigors of her house she had disintegrated bit by bit she had been free falling until she landed in this bed on dauphin street","1988":"well written but i would argue it didn't go anywhere just 12 different stories all sad of hattie's children i did enjoy it and i flew through it","1989":"masterfully written while this is definitely not a feel good book the writing style is flawless i felt all of the heartache pain and disappointments of the protagonist hattie good job ms mathis i look forward to reading more of your work","1990":"i had high hopes for this novel only to be disappointed it had a great beginning but then became a task for me to continue to read i plowed through it i give this a 2","1991":"really enjoyed this was written beautifully","1992":"the book's characters all have the ring of horrifying truth every one is terribly flawed and struggling for but gaining little control in their lives i read every page couldn't put it down but wish the characters and their stories were tied together better anyway a good first novel","1993":" there is much that could be written about this book and i'm sure there are some who will take the time to write a review that is more insightful than the one i am about to write my rating is rather low that is not because the writer does not write well she writes extremely well i enjoyed reading her words just not the story she had to tell i found the story too unstructured to be one that appealed to me as a reader having just finished reading olive kitteridge in the weeks before beginning mathis' book i could not help but compare the structure of the two books both books are a collection of short stories that together tell the story of the main character in this particular book the story of hattie is loosely told through short biographical character sketches of her children in is an interesting approach for an author to take it is an approach that i don't dislike i just didn't particular find this book as interesting as i thought it might be my main criticism is that the book is too loosely constructed i found some of the stories too far fetched and a bit contrived i'm not sure why oprah selected this book but i certainly have other books that she has selected for her book club that i enjoyed better i will be interested to see just what others have to say about this book as time goes by","1994":"the structure of this novel is dynamic i felt a strong connection to the characters and i became immersed in their stories","1995":"i was a bit concerned that all of the children had issues not that i wanted a happy ending but i just felt like the children were very detached i wish that the author had done more to develop each child's story through the eyes of the siblings it just felt like there needed to be more back story it just left me expecting more","1996":" i'd really rate this 3 1 2 stars it is wonderfully written each character is crafted in details that make me speechless it took me a while to follow the storyline and i was angry about it at first i wanted to go on more journeys with these people and i was only given a chapter to figure out who they were and why they ticked but sometimes life is like that the disappointment and that is what hattie is all about everyone is looking for something to fulfill them looking for something to make them feel complete hattie's experiences shape the others' life lessons","1997":"i liked the style of writing and learning about hattie through her children i don't like when religion is strong at the end when it wasn't prevalent in the book prior to the last 15 pages there could have been a dozen better ways to tie up the end not a bad read though","1998":" to quote another reviewer bleak but then oprah loves her some cheerless storytelling this doesn't mean i didn't like the book the author is a beautiful and insightful writer it's just that nothing and i mean nothing turned out well in the end there is no redemption for hattie's twelve tribes the book was actually a series of twelve short stories essays really telling the story of hattie's children when each child's chapter was over that was the last that was heard from them hattie was the thread that tied them all together and she was a tough nut to crack each child was miserable and dysfunctional in his her own way and most blamed their mother themes of religion class poverty and faithfulness were strong and well developed","1999":" normally i don't go for novels that are merely a set of connected short stories but this one was different each story was about a child from the same family that settled in philadelphia during the great migration of southern blacks in the first part of the 20th century each story was interesting some were mind blowing and intense some were just decent the setting of the chapters range through the 1920's to the 1980's the author does a great job with characterization and i felt like i knew each character as a well rounded individual even though some chapters were only about 10 pages long great writing i hope the author's next work is a novel that follows the same character for its duration","2000":"dnf i find this book difficult to read","2001":"i picked up this book feeling a little salty that people were calling ayana mathis the successor to toni morrison who i believe to be america's greatest living female writer i guess this isn't the first or last time i'll be totally wrong mathis earns that mantle with this somehow debut at times this book sort of seems all over the place -- it jumps forward in time with each chapter told from different perspectives of hattie's kids her husband and others who are simultaneously closer than anyone to hattie yet leagues removed from her this made it a little hard for me to get into the book i was all invested in floyd her son from one of the early chapters only to be thrust into another perspective the next with barely a backward glance or mention of him again in the rest of this slim but powerful book i know that sounds like a gripe but once the book is done it all makes sense we long for more of hattie just as every other character in the book yet the reader also winds up probably knowing and understanding her more than anyone possibly it's a terrific important book and i can't wait to see what else mathis comes up with","2002":"a number of unlikable characters in a totally dysfunctional family it was difficult to read but powerfully written i couldn't identify with deeply cynical plot","2003":"i have very mixed feelings about this book the first couple of pages already had me holding back tears some of characters had boring stories and some had interesting ones i really enjoyed the ending alot made me close the book and wonder about life in general the authors style of writing was brilliant i caught myself going back and reading paragraphs because the words would pop off the page","2004":"this was a powerful book each chapter was its own story but they tie together if one steps back this isn't the book for people who want every loose end tied up but real life is like that some chapters are magnificent and can totally stand on their own","2005":" none of the characters were appealing there was nothing but bleakness everywhere by all rights i should have hated this book but i really enjoyed it each chapter focused on one of hattie's children 11 children 1 grandchild during a specific year over a 55 year period as character studies they were excellent and you did get a good image of all of them but seriously alcohol gambling insanity abuse gay bashing religious hypocrisy racial hatred tb prostitution death destruction i'm hard pressed to find an upbeat section of this book the unifying element is hattie who was too stressed by poverty and all her children to do more than survive and i guess that's the take away survival through determination and the beauty of trying to do your best by your children even if it's not very good the religious theme deuteronomy 1 22 23 all of you came to me and said 'let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we should go up and the cities we will come to ' the plan seemed good to me and i selected twelve of you one from each tribe is one i'll think about during my next long car trip my lack of biblical knowledge is apparent but on first reading i have to say that none of the twelve would bring back a report regarding the route by which we should go but rather routes that should definitely not be taken","2006":"really i give 12 tribes a 2 5 it is more a compilation of short stories about hattie and her 12 children each chapter is devoted to one child and could possibly be read on its own hattie's life was filled with trials as were her children's the book is quite sad and trying","2007":"so well written absolutely loved how the author formatted her book each chapter telling the story through the voice of one of the protagonists 11 children spanning over six decades not my usual genre but loved the message that ultimately the most important thing a mother can give and show her children is love and tenderness very sad to read the story of each child and how the lack of love and tenderness in their upbringing lead to their failures as adults","2008":"it's an oprah book club pick so the nonstop melodrama was to be expected other than that the interweaving of the stories of the different children made for an interesting read just a little too tragic and over the top to be a great read","2009":"this book was sad and depressing","2010":"it's a difficult story to read because of the hard life this family lived it also reminds me that parents' influence is far reaching","2011":"everyone is broken every one this was 243 pages some of them containing a beautiful passage or two but the pain was simply unrelenting it was torture to stay with this book to the end as it must have been for hattie and everyone around her","2012":"this is a hard one for me to rate it is undeniably well written and tells a story that is all too sad and true but as a novel it fell short for me on several fronts for one the characters were almost universally unlikable and i was unable ultimately to connect with any of them the portrayal of men was particularly brutal surely there could have been a good one in the lot the book is a series of connected narratives and i liked some more than others of course","2013":"really amazing book each character profile was compelling in its own way rich in flaws and redeeming qualities i liked the historical significance to each chapter set in a different decade mathis employs a deft hand and elegance in her depiction of a strong complex female protagonist like hattie","2014":"great read by a fantastic storyteller","2015":"i thought i was going to love it i didn't i wanted more than a chapter for each child i needed follow up i needed something to tie it all together","2016":"awful each chapter is told by a different character all of which are one of hattie's children and you never go back to the same character twice every chapter was filled with new characters and just another depressing story that didn't go anywhere i couldn't find a plot that made the chapters connect into a novel it felt like a collection of short stories that sometimes tied in with a previous one i actually didn't even read the last chapter by the time i got there i didn't think it was worth wasting my time with yawning over every paragraph to finish a story that i had already made up my mind about i do not recommend it to anyone","2017":"i would have loved this book if i had read it in print form but the audio book version i'm listening to a lot of audio books on my commute includes the voice acting of bahni turpin adenrele ojo and adam lazarre white all of whom are mind blowingly talented and they made me love it even more","2018":" i enjoyed this book but at times it felt so disconnected and such a small glimpse of of the characters it almost felt incomplete hattie indeed connects them all but i was left feeling a bit miffed that each chapter felt like starting a new story that had no ending the writing was beautiful and ayana mathis has a way of gorgeously illustrating sights sounds and feelings i just wish there had been a bit more connection between the children and some glimpse as to how things turned out for each of them","2019":"not sure why oprah would pick this as one of her book club selections proverty oppression and dyfuntion and not so impressed the story just wasn't a good flowing tale for me just not for me","2020":"i don't know something about this book did not quite ring true for me i generally like short stories so much you must put in while leaving out all non essentials hattie was hard for me to understand and as all the characters build around hattie well i just did not feel as much for them as i have for others there are so many wonderful books out there i could have passed on this one","2021":"this is the story of the life of hattie shepherd a black woman who escapes the oppression of the deep south and moves to philadelphia it begins in 1925 and her life story and those of her children keep pace with the century it opens with the heartbreaking description of her going from joy to tragedy with the deaths of her first two children twins from bronchitis or croup the grief leaves her unable to unlock herself again it seems throughout that the lives of her next children although she loves them she is not affectionate to them her husband is constantly unfaithful but never split up even after hattie has the one affair that makes her happy the narrative concerning racial prejudice of the day is quite stomach churning i found each section deals with the fate of each of the children who mostly go out into the world and settle down elsewhere her daughter bella is the one that hurts her the most by having an affair with hattie's lover but she then rescues her from a suicide attempt they then live together in the small house that hattie finally manages to buy it is very readable and engaging narrative the racial prejudice is an important and shocking element of the story hattie's lack of affection and unbending strictness is sad but her determination and backbone is awesome","2022":"this is an excellent piece of writing for that i'd give it 5 stars it is highly sad and difficult and for that i bring the overall rating down if you want a powerful story about struggle and hardship borne by a strong woman this is your book","2023":" this was an oprah book club selection and a fine first novel i look forward to reading more from mathis we meet hattie as a 17 year old mother in 1925 times were tough for african americans then especially when she continued to have baby after baby and an irresponsible husband the book jumps around considerably chronicling many of her must be 12 children as they come of age and botch up their own lives ending in 1980 my major criticism of the book was that it read too much like a series of short stories we lost track of hattie for many years at a time as we were introduced to the new voices and their story lines i was glad to finally loop back to hattie who was the most compelling character","2024":"i loved how the story progressed and highlighted each child's life as an adult","2025":"this was my book club's selection for february and somehow i didn't finish it until mid may got it from the library paid a lot of fines etc the cover art is hideous so i'm glad not to have it in the house anymore the book itself was good enough with the author taking the right amount of liberties in the individual sagas of twelve ish siblings some are written about as newborns some as adults hattie the mother is presented always as stubborn and impenetrable which is fine although it takes a while to realize that she's not the point of the story or is she the amount of mental and emotional illness running through this family makes you wonder by the end","2026":"needed more chapters so good but wish there could have been more closure and a chapter for each of her children","2027":"i really enjoyed the book it just left me with so many unanswered questions i would really give it 3 5","2028":"this book reminded me of olive kitteridge in that it told a story through short stories revolving around one character hattie who was the more of all the characters in the chapters i thought it was well written and brought up many issues facing black people through the decades","2029":"amazing writing for a young new author each chapter can almost stand alone as a short story wish their had been a little more to tie it together each character's own story and own point of view is a chapter perhaps each one could have tied back more specifically to hattie toward the end the connections with hattie and her development as a character were nearly lost","2030":"hattie's eleven children's and one granddaughter's stories tell the history of the great migration from the south to the north in the 1960's and forward in our nation a great book filled with insight into the difficulties of life in the racially motivated stress of the late 20th century","2031":"i agree with the 'aw hell' reviewer it's a book i read it it was okay i was intrigued once or twice but overall not the kind of story i go for too much short story for me and as for the oprah comments seriously hot diggity damn ayana mathis is the bomb diggity wowwwww oprah's gotten too something for my taste yech","2032":"it was like twelve short stories the characters were fascinating with engaging storylines we have found this generations toni morrison looking forward to 2nd book","2033":"i loved the writing the characters the format and the subject matter i found myself getting confused at times about the ages of hattie's children because of the way the book jumps ahead to different years and different times in all of the children's lives i wish there were a lot more details about all the children and where they ended up but i guess it's a good sign that i wanted more as opposed to thinking there was already too much","2034":"this book was very intersting and by the end i was really getting it but it took too long for me to really connect as alomst each chapter has a different narractor character the main thread being hattie which is the main character you learn about through all of these stories it is her story that is being told","2035":"the book consists of what amounts to a series of short stories about hattie and her family you are left to weave this information into a history of the family where the sum is greater than the parts it was an interesting read","2036":" i haven't read olive kitteridge but this is what i imagine that book is like loosely connected stories all linked around hattie she plays a bigger role in some stories than in others but she is the character i was most interested in likewise some chapters are more interesting than others one of her sons six is a preacher who may or may not have the gift of healing one of her daughters cassie is mentally ill probably with schizophrenia and her youngest child is potentially going to be given up for adoption to hattie's sister who can't have children of her own those are the chapters that completely captivated me but even when the stories weren't as interesting to me the writing is gorgeous it's hard to believe that this is a first novel because it's written amazingly well yes this is definitely more character driven than plot driven but when you have characters like this that's completely fine by me","2037":" this book author had so much potential each chapter is more like a short story involving one of hattie's children and their interactions with her or how she shaped their lives the chapters are well written and almost poetic in their beauty however after that chapter has passed you barely get a mention of that child again and there is simply no ending to the book nothing ties all the stories together hattie simply seems to run out of children to write about and the book ends i was disappointed that what could have been so strong of a novel fell so short simply for the lack of an ending","2038":" the saying that applies here is it's not you it's me this book was picked for a book club read i just didn't 'get it' i didn't understand what i was suppose to get from this book it was a big ole' ball of depression from the first to the last i continue to read only because i paid for a hard copy of this and i thought at some point it would get better it never did at least not to me the chapters and the characters felt too disconnected there was no flow to it and i wonder if that was on purpose hattie was the main character and the subsequent chapters were about her children there was nothing to let you know that but after a while i figured it out read at your own risk","2039":"unfortunately did not live up to the hype potentially good story line but disjointed ending was extremely disappointing i ultimately a good first effort hope to see more from this author","2040":"filled with grief and sorrow","2041":" open ended yet the story seems complete the twelve tribes of hattie is a story of family promise and generational habits it begins during the great migration in 1923 when hattie flees georgia and settles in philadelphia the young fifteen year old marries august and begins a life she hopes to be better two years later they start a family with the firstborns being named philadelphia and jubilee names of promise and of hope reaching forward names not looking back ones unfortunately the first of many tragedies strike hattie watches helplessly as her seven month old twins died in the order they were born first philadelphia then jubilee hattie gives birth to nine more children and raises them with not an ounce of tenderness hattie's parenting style is to prepare her children for the harsh difficult world life is not kind so why should she be kind the next chapters focus on floyd six ruthie ella alice billups franklin bell and cassie the last tribe is sala hattie's granddaughter we can only hope that by now hattie gets it and will show tenderness full review on www literarymarie com","2042":" great characters wonderful writing it was just the structure of the book that bugged me and kept me from rating it higher it was more like 12 loosely related short stories with hattie appearing in all of them in some way but i got attached to each of her children and wanted to know more about what happened to them this potentially could have been a much longer richer family saga that took us more deeply into the lives of all the characters having said that i loved the writing and look forward to more books by the author","2043":"strong writing but the book went nowhere","2044":"all surface and not enough depth","2045":"interesting story but bleak not sure what the moral of the story is maybe just what life often holds","2046":"i was disappointed by this book the characters came across as a little stereotypical and one dimensional","2047":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here understanding the children of this complex woman hattie was not easy how much of the parent's influence was in their lives","2048":"i read this book based on my daughter's recommendation i really liked it although i wish some of the characters had been developed more it reminded me a bit of olive kitteridge in that each chapter could stand alone and was almost a short story in the case of this book each chapter was based on one of hattie's children or in the final chapter a grandchild i got to know hattie by hearing about her from her children's point of view","2049":"i enjoyed this for about the first half of the book then i couldn't keep the characters apart in my mind i thought this book would never end i got very sick of the disfunctionality of every single person i kept waiting for someone to be okay","2050":"this book is soooo messed up i would not recommend it it was so weird and strange i had to finish it just out of curiosity no good","2051":"loved how mathis wrote this book taking excerpts from hattie's life to share her many trials tribulations and sorrows as seen through her eyes and those of her children mathis is a great storyteller great first novel","2052":"to disjointed for me however i did finish it","2053":"i think i loved this book so much because i had the luxury of reading it while on vacation with very little disruptions the writing was wonderful and i feel like i was pulled in to the lives of the characters one thing is for certain i'm so glad i don't have 9 children i understand why hattie is the way she is who wouldn't be given the circumstances","2054":"as a mother i know all too well the highs and lows of motherhood and i thoroughly enjoyed peeking into this family dynamic it's quite evident that children from the same home and upbringing can be as different as night and day","2055":"i didn't find this cast of helpless characters entirely compelling","2056":"i enjoyed this but it didn't have a beginning to end plot structure which left me a bit wanting at the end of each chapter still a good read easy to get through and i'm looking forward to the discussion at book club post bookclub script i wasn't disappointed this book fuelled one of the best discussions of our 12 reads so far","2057":"i really wanted to see it come together in the end i wanted to know what happened to all of the children how it concluded in their lives i really enjoyed the book but it left me wanting more i'm hoping a sequel ties it all together and brings closure","2058":"interesting compelling and sad","2059":"i wish i could give half stars this book would be a 3 5 stars i enjoyed it it was interesting but also really depressing i was a bit frustrated in the end because it seems liek there is a deeper meaning to it i didn't quite get","2060":"beautifully written but horrifically heartbreaking i really enjoyed the structure of the book in that it is a series of short stories each focused on one of hattie's badly broken children they say a mother is only as happy as her saddest child it doesn't seem possible that hattie could have had a happy day since the deaths of her twins it is like reading angela's ashes makes you really grateful for what you are able to give your kids","2061":"hard to follow the lives of the hattie's children at times but over all interesting story of how children view and reflect on there upbringing","2062":"was not fond of this book love the genre and was really looking forward to reading this it started off good and went nowhere i was expecting a story about the interactions of all the family members it did not have any continuity finished it but it wasn't good","2063":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here beautifully written but so depressingly cyclic nobody gets better no lessons are learned no one escapes the oppression of life so many of these stories could have been fleshed out and we don't really learn anything of the title character by the end of 243 pages i have hopes for mathis' next novel her writing is so captivating in its language and fluidity that i am sure we can expect a better novel for her second","2064":"great book hard and emotional read i recommend it but not if you're looking for a feel good type of book","2065":" this is another book that i read through the first chapter and that's what hooked me but then when the second chapter started i didn't even understand where the author was picking up and i didn't understand anything else except that it was like 15 years later and the jubilee and philidelphia had both died it was sad and i wanted to know more about what happened after that but the humongous time gap was just something that i wasn't feeling maybe eventually i'll come back to this with a clearer head","2066":"i was a little hesitant at first because each chapter took up a new character but i ended up loving this book the thread is there and it's deeper than the story i thought this was brilliant","2067":" well the book lost me early on when i caught on to each chapter being about each child u0026amp how the dysfunction of their childhood ruined their lives i got excited and was looking forward to the ending but there was no ending the book was written well i totally understood the concept i felt the emotions but i hated the ending i assume sala will continue on a dysfunctional path u0026amp the dysfunction will continue until someone in the family decides to break the pattern i just wish i could've met that person in the story","2068":"the character development in this book was interesting as the perception of hattie was seen through a dozen lenses even in old age and after so much heartache she recognized her need to change to save her grand daughter","2069":"loved loved loved it yes the changing perspectives took a little getting used to at first but the story of hattie and her tribe of children is compelling enough to overcome any initial confusion i totally get what all the fuss was about when this book was first released","2070":"really enjoyed it it left me feeling a little unfinished like there was more to tell","2071":"one of the most depressing books i've ever read would not recommend it","2072":"i listened to this book but found the storyline about a young woman who has eleven children two of which die early deaths her inability to really show them love after the loss of her first two and their lives as they grew older","2073":" i really enjoyed reading this book with another person thanks diane d and i look forward to when she is finished too we follow along the heartbreaking life of hattie through the stories of her children very unique how each child as they become adults must deal with such terrible situations and how hattie was along for the duration it was hard for me to fathom hattie's emotional detachment and lack of any connection to her children we get to see little glimpses of how deep her love for her children really was despite what it seemed like i did not really understand how deeply hattie felt for her family as she did the only things she knew to keep them afloat while she barely was keeping herself together","2074":"an interview on npr lead me to read the book","2075":"i liked the book but did not love i couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars each chapter about a different child of hattie reads like a short story if you read this book for book club there would be a ton to discuss","2076":"3 5 starsthe author is a great writer and i went through the book quickly however the way it's set up with each of her children getting a chapter you barely get to know anything about them before its on to another child and i understand the time period and circumstances but it's hard to believe not one of her children had anywhere near a decent life the men were all worthless and lousy and the women were either unhappy or weak and needy","2077":"i really enjoyed this i was disappointed in the beginning but once i realized how each chapter worked i was totally engrossed","2078":"very gritty and emotional but i couldn't put it down","2079":"a proud woman and the challenges she faces in facing her family","2080":" i had high hopes for this book i was very excited to read a novel focused on race written by an african american woman because so many southern and or race centric novels are written by white women and men mathis is a great writer but i was left wanting more from each character chapter as a collection of short stories this works well however the format ruins any chance of this acting as a novel about the interconnectedness of family but maybe that was the point family is often fractured sections often echo toni morrison but mathis twists these in her own unique way this led to some hauntingly heartbreaking and beautiful passages","2081":"oh my this book was so soulful deep in the spirit and just all around amazing i loved all the viewpoints and the writing was clean crisp and poetic so glad oprah picked this book the literary world will never be the same after this novel","2082":"had a hard time getting into the book and really ended up disliking hattie perhaps if there was a more connected story i would have enjoyed it the characters were interesting just had no time to bond over them","2083":"need to talk about this book with someone mixed feelings","2084":" the twelve tribes of hattie is ayana mathis's first novel but you wouldn't know that from reading it she has the gift of holding the reader's attention rapt with masterful character development and expert turns of phrase she tells the story of hattie shepherd in an unconventional way through the filter of hattie's 11 children and her granddaughter sala it's almost like a collection of interlinked short stories rather than a novel but it does have consistent themes and interlocking story lines in many ways hattie and her children are representative of the african american experience in the 20th century she was born in georgia to a solidly middle class family at age 15 she had a casual fling with august a 17 year old she liked but considered too much of a country boy to be a serious relationship prospect she became pregnant though and the two of them married they moved to philadelphia to be near hattie's sister in that way they became part of the great migration of african american families from the south to the north the young mother gave birth to fraternal twins despite august's reservations she named the boy philadelphia and the girl jubilee sadly the twins would succumb to pneumonia before their first birthday hattie would never completely recover from the loss of her first and second born she would however go on to give birth to not in this order alice bell billups cassie ella floyd franklin ruthie also known as margaret and six we get little vignettes about each of them alice grows up to marry a doctor he wants children but she secretly takes birth control pills to delay that from happening although she lives in a mansion her life is empty bell works in a sleazy bar sidebar mathis describes its windows as opaque that phrase really stuck in my head and bothered me opaque windows would essentially be ceramic opaque means that light can't pass through it as we all learned in junior high science class the glass was probably tinted so that it was translucent without being transparent but i really don't think it was opaque it irks both the word nerd and the science nerd in me she takes up with a ne'er do well in his cockroach infested apartment in a neighborhood bell's siblings term the ghetto she intends to commit a kind of slow suicide by tuberculosis this is the 1970s mind you when tuberculosis was highly treatable before the hiv epidemic contributed to antibiotic resistant tb she is saved by a chance run in with willie a former neighbor who should by rights be the herbology professor at the u s equivalent of hogwarts she is also saved by discovering that hattie never stopped loving her as best hattie can billups is terribly abused by a tutor as a child cassie struggles with mental illness she's the mother of sala whose story makes up the last section of the book hattie's last act in the book is to deny a religious calling to the 12 year old since cassie's illness possibly schizophrenia takes the form of religious mania with delusions of persecution hattie and august must raise sala after cassie must finally be admitted to a mental health hospital ella is born when hattie is in her 40s because the family is struggling financially when the youngest comes along hattie makes the incredibly difficult decision to give ella to her childless and financially well off sister to raise in georgia floyd is musically talented as a traveling horn player he's developed a reputation as a ladies' man this reputation masks the fact that he's gay when he visits a southern town and takes part in a wild pagan like festival called the seven days he meets a young man named lafayette with whom he has a chance to find love floyd can't summon the strength to let love overcome his fear franklin serves in the navy during the vietnam war while he is overseas in charge of patrolling a bay through which weapons are smuggled he learns in a letter from his ex wife that they have a daughter franklin struggles with alcoholism and wonders if he'll ever have a relationship with his daughter we know very little about the kind of person ruthie turns out to be because we see her mostly as a baby she's the only one of hattie's children who has a father other than augustus six was burned in an accident when he was a child given a low chance of survival he defies the odds when another child teases him about hattie having a boyfriend six beats the boy savagely he's sent off down south with the preacher for a few weeks during which six discovers he has a talent for preaching from the pulpit if not an actual inclination to be good throughout the book hattie is often portrayed as being aloof cold distant and angry the revelations of her life story however make this attitude seem perfectly reasonable hattie has often been given the short end of the stick of life even when she tries to leave august who's a bit of a drunk and a womanizer for another man the other man lawrence turns out to be just as bad if not worse her running away from home episode told through ruthie's story lasts less than 24 hours august is a bad husband but he's a great father in the end as his health begins to fail he begins attending church regularly stops seeing other women and regularly tells hattie he loves her his story arc is more redemptive than hattie's perhaps because in many ways she's stuck as that teenage mother from the 1930s helpless to care for her own children no matter how much she loves them and wants the best for them life simply overwhelms hattie she never seems to achieve her own happiness rather the suggestion is that the cycle of familial misery will be broken in sala i bought this 8 disc audiobook at a library used media sale and was not obligated to review it in any way i chose it because irish granny had already read the paperback version and she recommended it","2085":"could not finish it didn't like any of the characters and found pace really slow","2086":"an utterly disappointing and somewhat infuriating book it is the first book by ayana mathis and has the weight of being anoprah pick now i know that oprah's books come with a certain level of melodrama but i read the first few pages and the description of this book and had higher hopes for this one the book is ostensibly the story of hattie a restless disappointed angry woman as told from the viewpoint of her nine living children hattie flees georgia as a girl with her mother and sister she quickly meets august a man without aspirations and gets pregnant followed by a hasty marriage the first chapter starts off well as hattie watches helplessly as her first born children infant twins quickly fall sicker and sicker with pneumonia before passing away this starts withthe next chapter which moves forward 23 years to pick up with her son floyd's story and this is where the book rapidly dives into melodrama because floyd is a musician travelling in the south now and clearly fighting against homosexual urges while this chapter was compelling in its own way and perhaps the only other good chapter in the book it tells us very little about hattie he book then runs rapidly through a dsm iv of mental illness and other afflictions we cover child abuse alcoholism tuberculosis scaldings schizophrenia infidelity and more each child seems to face some dire circumstance nine of hattie's children seem to have what one could call a conventional life filled with simply growing up getting a job marriage and children there is little to link these chapters together and rarely do we see the children themselves interact with each other we see hattie in snippets and see that yes she is an angry and disappointed woman and areto infer that the later happiness that the children experience is directly relates to the lack of hattie's tenderness towards her children which really is the most insulting part of ts book as i read it i windered reslly how different hattie was from many women of her age to insinuate that her children's later difficulties are tied to hattie's mothering and yet not august's fathering is irritating at best only in the final two or three chapters does mathis seem to remember that we need to see that while hattie was a harsh mother that she was too busy focusing on her children's survival she really did love them don't you know and mathis does this with an incredibly heavy hand there are suddenly many drawn out passages where hattie is pondering her love for her children and explaining to the reader just how hard it all was this book had the potential to be so much better dealing with african american migration north from the southern states and the promise that held and the inevitable disappointments that followed there is a chapter where harrie's sister from the south drives north with her husband that has moments that really work it draws together so much the relative success of some if the african americans that stayed in the south relative to the freedom if their northern counterparts but the cost that it often came with due to jim crow and how the success they had could be undermined in a moment at the whim of a drunken white man if mathis had stuck to moments like this the book could have been so much more successful in my opinion instead she is content to rely on needless melodrama and the worn out and cliched bad mother trope give it a pass","2087":"i typically don't like the concept of having a series of protagonists but it worked for this novel some chapters were better than others bell is my favorite franklin is my least favorite until the end i also didn't like cassie one of this book's themes is generational misery pain having access to the thoughts of people who hadn't made the connection between wanting to do better and actually doing better gave me the opportunity to expand my perspective on people i actually know it's not much of a story about the great migration thought it plays a role it's about the long term impact of your decisions and how human interaction affects us i think this would work well in the context of women's studies considering how readily available and effective birth control would have changed the narrative is worth a thought","2088":"this book really brought the reader through a journey of so many elements of black struggle self identity poverty sexuality racial discrimination and much more i believe that almost every character deserves his or her own book each chapter could have continued into a true and real story i hope the author is considering this and that she finds success telling the stories of a great people","2089":" this is the story of the black diaspora out of the south and into big northern cities as told by one family it's also a story about how much it sucked sucked sucked for women not to have the same rights as men or access to birth control and about how much it could suck to be black in the united states between the 1930s and about 1980 the story starts with a very young girl arriving in philadelphia from georgia and immediately noticing how much freer and less afraid black people are in the north each chapter is told by someone different in hattie's family over many years and each chapter could be a little short story but they also shed light on the stories that came before the characters are well developed and it's set in germantown my old neighborhood in philadelphia so i enjoyed all the references to streets i remember","2090":"well written but i'm not sure i enjoyed the story","2091":"i am not sure if i liked this book or not i loved getting to know all of her children but you never learn what happens to all of them its strangely written and not a book to read if you are needing somethng uplifting as they all have a hard life","2092":" a great book to read the style of writing is straightforward but tugs at all of your emotions the opening chapter is truly one of the best chapters i have read in recent years the author has a gift in which you are brought in to the story feeding off the characters emotion u0026amp draining you that chapter stayed with me for days however i only gave it 3 stars i couldn't rate it 3 5 because of the structure of the story when i read a book there has to be an inkling of closure for me i don't want to spend my time reading a book getting into it staying up till late at night reading only for it to suddenly end just like that i wish there was a list of hatties children an index perhaps just so i could keep up with who they are when they were born etc i found it a bit confusing i wanted more from the characters there was only a chapter on each child and then suddenly you move onto the next chapter u0026amp character and have to abandon what you just read u0026amp move on whether you like it or not hardly a mention of them again after that as for hattie and august they were characters you wanted to know more about was august really as bad as hattie made out i kind of felt sorry for him even though he was a fool they both had affairs made mistakes but the kids paid for their failures in their marriage it should have tied in at the end somehow how did their lives turn out as they grew older their relationship with their parents u0026amp siblings i know that's probably not the point but they were so interesting that a few more chapters wouldn't have gone amiss i would reccomendation this book it's well written and quite emotional and not that long either","2093":"i read the first chapter and loved it read the second and couldn't handle it any longer too bad she was a great writer","2094":"liked it didn't love it excellent writing interesting insight on each character but i would have liked to see how their lives intertwined overall it kept me captivated","2095":"powerful artistically composed in taking a glimpse at each of hattie's 9 children and one grandchild the author builds up to an unexpected catharsis where hattie applies her wisdom in a way that those who have not seen what she has seen cannot possibly understand or support i don't know that everyone will appreciate this book but those with mothers who are fierce unbending and constant in their sacrifice will know the value","2096":"typical oprah book club selection well written but nothing pleasant ever happens to any of the characters in real life even families living in generational poverty have some good days","2097":"phew what a story every chapter was fraught and sad but i still really loved reading this book","2098":"a remarkable portrait of a woman as reflected in the lives of her children strong characterization lovely language but lacking a cohesive sense of place of home","2099":"just finished this and loved it","2100":"i was put off by the structure of the story each chapter was about one of hattie's children but that was the only time you learned about them it did feel like a book of short stories","2101":"i enjoyed the book despite oprah's highlights yes the nook version had oprah's highlights and her comments what did i like about it i found hattie to be a woman who had more than her share of pain disappointment and loss her children were drawn as three dimensional people whose lives could best be described as difficult and full of drudge the sadness and loss hattie suffered was shared by her husband but the author made the way they dealth with their mutual losses radically different i came away feeling she has a very clear understanding of how men and women grieve differently hattie had a chance to run from her lot but went back i wonder what made her return guilt did she go back because of her children did she feel she didn't deserve happiness or did she know she couldn't be happy with ruthie's father what do you think","2102":"sad compelling and well written 12 separate stories about the same family through the 20th century","2103":"took longer than expected to finish it some good individual stories","2104":"i enjoyed this book but i certainly didn't love it the writing is beautiful i liked the format each chapter is devoted to hattie or one of her children it all revolves around hattie's lack of compassion and warmth my biggest problem with this book is that every single character hattie all her children and her grandchild are unhappy and miserable i didn't find all the misery to be particularly enlightening either","2105":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed the story my favorite and unfortunately most relatable character was probably six but i felt connected to bell and alice too i liked that the story continued throughout a number of decades and you could see how times changed for example when hattie had thoughts about penicillin in the last chapter regarding the events from the first i found myself wanting to know more about everyone's lives i think the author did a good job of giving you just enough to keep you wanting and i enjoyed the story my favorite and unfortunately most relatable character was probably six but i felt connected to bell and alice too i liked that the story continued throughout a number of decades and you could see how times changed for example when hattie had thoughts about penicillin in the last chapter regarding the events from the first i found myself wanting to know more about everyone's lives i think the author did a good job of giving you just enough to keep you wanting and then occasionally giving you glimpses in later chapters of the earlier characters i read this on ibooks and got the copy with oprah's highlights and comments which were completely unnecessary sorry oprah more","2106":"i found this book to be somewhat confusing with the bouncing all around in time i understand that the author did it to bring out the highlights of the children's lives as adults but it was confusing her style of writing seemed to change throughout the book as well i found it difficult to find sympathy with any of the characters if it hadn't been a book club read i might not have bothered to finish this one","2107":"i was not impressed with this book since the names of hattie's kids were not focused on in the beginning of the book it was hard to know who you were trying to focus on as the chapters went by there was no resolution either you read about the horrific outcomes of these children's lives due to a lack of nurturing and love but you do not get a sense of closer overall it is something to read if you have no other options left very disappointed","2108":"a painful and depressing read each chapter detailing the tortured life of another of hattie's children i couldn't wait to get to the end and put this book down","2109":"it was a good book not what i expected after seeing the oprah interview but it held my interest","2110":"a terrific read","2111":"i enjoyed this authors writing style as she shared the trials of hattie's twelve children a very sad book","2112":"this is almost like a book of short stories rather than a novel in the traditional sense with the mother hattie being the connecting thread throughout the author successfully developed each character within only a few pages while revealing more and more of hattie's personality at the same time i thought mathis ably depicted some of the dysfunctional behaviours that can be found in many families the book is not exactly depressing but it certainly isn't a happy story just like real life","2113":"this book was given to me as a gift initially i was not that interested in reading it and it sat on my couch for a while taunting me to pick it up when i finally did i was immediately drawn into the story of hattie and her children the author chooses to tell the story through the first person accounts of each of hattie's eleven yeah i said 11 children and her granddaughter sala well except for the twins that die in the first chapter and who are instrumental in forging hattie into the mother she becomes this book proves my theory that parents are the greatest influence on their children whether they are great parents or horrible ones it also shows the humanity of a woman who sacrifices her life her dreams and her happiness for her children even though the children themselves really don't recognize her actions as being that and isn't that the way most children view their parents anyway i would recommend this book to anyone who is a parent who has a parent or who is thinking about becoming a parent there are lessons to be learned by all people in any of those categories","2114":"riveting captivating poetic u0026amp inspiring i loved it","2115":"i'm always a bit wary of the hype around oprah books but this one was worth the hype for me troubling and hard to listen to at times the audiobook narrators were terrific but just a lovely book overall i noticed that other reviewers didn't like that the chapters about hattie's children weren't necessarily connected but i actually liked that about the book","2116":"totally enjoyed reading this book i also enjoyed oprah's comments kindle version this is a book for our book club and there is let's to discuss i love hattie's strength the way it read each chapter had closure much in the same way olive kittredge did the writing is beautiful and the time period tense","2117":"this was pretty good like previous reviewers stated reading it is like reading a collection of short stories as hattie's life and her children are all just an anthology of hattie's life i liked it though and it made for good airplane reading some of the stories are heartbreaking and others lifted you up but the stories are a triumph of the human condition","2118":"i'm a sucker for character driven stories and this one didn't fail the life story of hattie shepherd is told through 12 narratives that document over fifty years of struggle love hardship disappointment and history as hattie's family maneuvers through decades of racism turmoil and hope","2119":"an interesting telling of this family's story","2120":"the direct look at hattie was the only part i truly enjoyed the rest was hard to get through","2121":" the twelve tribes are hattie's children who she sends out into the world feeling unloved although she did in fact love them but was not demonstrative and was always angry at both life and at her husband all of the children seem broken in some way although some gain a little self knowledge as their experiences are described in this book the book is almost like a book of short stories one story for each of the children with hattie and her husband as recurring characters the book is well written some of mathis' language is quite evokative and she writes believably about facets of african american life in the twentieth century that she couldn't have experienced","2122":"i enjoyed the writing in this book so much that i wish it was broken into separate books each of the chapters is about one of hattie's children but one chapter is not enough mathis makes you fall in love with each character only to never write of them again except in passing i nice read all the same","2123":" to see the life in the eyes of your parents and your grandparents to understand moments that you once never understood to see your life in a way that you can lock eyes with the chaotic that and more is what makes up the twelve tribes of hattie this book was made up of twelve various stories all providing further insight on the main character the mother of the tribe hattie such a sad real and yet somewhat beautiful story of the circle of life and what becomes of us how we see things and how we avoid things the last few chapters were read through teared eyes because the energy of the writers words was palpable read within a day and now writing this immediately after with a chocked throat oh and i also now at 2am want to go call my dad and my siblings and tell them just how much i love them a brilliantly blunt read and i highly recommend","2124":"i suppose this left me sad and wanting it would be the least fulfilling book i have read in a while but the idea was noteworthy i really wanted to like this and it was certainly tolerable i almost did at times","2125":"an impressive first work the story of a mother told through vignettes about each of her children great read beautifully written loved it","2126":"a sad story beautifully written the promise of a better life so compelling to so many inspiring hattie to brief courage and adventure is all to soon beaten down by the reality of her experience i found it fascinating that though the story is told mostly through the experiences of her children it is hattie that we come to know best from all of their perspectives","2127":" i loved this book the writing is flawless the characters moved me and the story never sagged it's about a lot of things almost every possible hardship befalls these characters but for me mostly it was about motherhood this line among others broke my heart maybe mother didn't know she was supposed to love us the writing was as the cliche goes 'pitch perfect' an example floyd made the horn stutter than he played it smooth it keened and it wailed it asked the people what their troubles were and blew them back to them floyd got out of the way and let his horn carry him out to the edges of himself there wasn't anything that horn couldn't say i wanted to read it again as soon as i had finished it to see what i'd missed","2128":"if i could give half stars my true rating for this would be 3 5 i enjoyed this book it was well written and the characters were interesting however i found it a bit depressing i wish that each character's story could have ended on a slightly more positive note in order to give the feeling of hope","2129":"in the 1920's hattie leaves the south and settles in philadelphia there she marries a man who brings her nothing but disappointment the sadest chapter spoiler alert tells about when she gave her daughter to be adopted by her younger sister who married a funeral director and was wealthy so the baby would have a better life each chapter deals with another one of her children's lives","2130":"hard to get into but persevered and it was good","2131":"i felt that this is a well written look into the lives of some folks i would not otherwise get to know as well i was disappointed with the end and the flippant rejection of christianity as being the easy way out","2132":"i loved this book until the ending the compilation of stories was absorbing and so real as with the help i could almost hear the characters speaking however i was disappointed at the finale i felt unfulfilled as the story seemed to just stop i guess i wanted something to bring a climax rather than leaving the reader hanging from a cliff i would recommend this book though i do think it was an excellent novel with much to say it was like meeting people that you know for a short time and then they pass out of your life forever we'll never know what ultimately happens to these characters but it was really interesting to have them in our life","2133":" it was a struggle for hattie to put herself together after losing her twins losing her babies was a partial disintegration of herself she could not move beyond her grief even when she had more children i believe she loved the children born after the twins but chronic depression affected her in a way that was detrimental to their upbringing her husband august's instability added to her depression although august was unreliable as a husband and father he had no difficulty expressing a little tenderness to his children yet august was a soft man who lacked character he was too easy too carefree a spendthrift who enjoyed the bars women and good times in essence august was egocentric i loved hattie's character i saw her as a strong woman yet her grief kept her tethered to a man that caused a great deal of her emotional disability august she could not lift herself out of the mire she was in with him her brief affair with lawrence showed her lack of direction however lawrence made her feel good made her laugh and gave her hope but lawrence's compulsion would have spiraled out of control lawrence would have sent hattie into a tailspin of profound depression lawrence could not offer her permanence and stability the parents' dysfunction and instability affected the children as adults as adults they had their own destructive behaviors and demons to deal with i enjoyed the book because i could imagine hattie's sister pearl's desperateness for a child i could imagine hattie's loss and the effects of depression on her psyche the writing was poignant touched my heart and made my eyes moisten at times that in itself is a feat for a writer i would have liked the book to end with bell who i found destructive i will not say more than that the only error i found was lawrence's discussion of robert kennedy in bell's chapter 1975 robert kennedy died june 6 1968 errors happen in editing and in historical facts no one knows this more than i do i suggest you read the book it is a great read","2134":"i had high hopes that this book would be a fictional version of the warmth of other suns but it was not even close sad underdeveloped stereotypes for characters and poorly written to boot the book was a disappointment from start to finish","2135":"the stories of hattie and her children are heartbreaking i didn't find much joy or redemption in the book but the way ayana mathis wrote about lives of the characters made me remember and appreciate that suffering and sadness are indelible parts of life what i took away from this book is the absolute importance and necessity of demanding love for yourself and your family fighting everyday for happiness and building and nurturing faith in a higher power","2136":"this book did not have much happiness basically it is the story of a young negro woman who had a good for nothing husband and twelve children the book recounts some of the lives of these children as well as the lives of their mother and father as they aged the book deals with child deaths drugs disease mental illness addictions relationships regrets etc in the end though it is family over everything that prevails","2137":"really more of a 3 5 stars grim but fascinating","2138":" took a while to get immersed in this book because each chapter was like a short story on its own and you needed to take a break between each one because the story did not flow however it was well written and gave an insight into the lives of black americans from the 1940s to the 1970s kind of a black angela's ashes poor blacks and the choices they had did not seem dissimilar to choices faced by the poor irish i did despair a bit surely hattie's life would have been better if she had fewer children but she achieved some redemption in the end she certainly deserved to have that","2139":"read for the popsugar reading challenge a book with a number in the titleto me this is less a novel than a collection of short stories about the lives of hattie and her family a structure i like a lot and respond to well gorgeous writing throughout especially floyd's chapter which felt like a lost story by baldwin excellent audiobook performances as well 4 5 stars","2140":"i really wanted to like this book but i just couldn't it was fairly boring hard to get really into easy to walk away from i was expecting more of a twist or something","2141":"lost interested and stopped reading it wasn't bad writing but the story wasn't really going anywhere but sad ville","2142":"twelve tribes of hattie covers years of mental anguish and struggle and pain and faith and the way to make a family families that support each other take many different forms and at first glance the tribe of hattie seems to lack emotion and empathy and tenderness expressing tenderness is difficult for hattie a woman that spends her entire life stewing in the anger of her ruin the chapters are truly short stories and take some time to process each one i had to give this five stars because some of the chapters took my breath away making me choke with anger and forming knots of grief and guilt and sadness in my throat as i read each line the scenes are simply amazing making me take apart each part of my relationship with every person in my life and dissect them that is good fiction","2143":"re rating based on the other books i read in the same year 2 out of 5 stars the themes and the structure and the different point of views used to put the story together were notable for this novel characters were not well developed all the stories were used to paint the full picture mostly about the main character","2144":" this novel reads more like a book of connected short stories hattie comes to philadelphia from georgia as a teenager in the 1920s the tribes of hattie are her children and each chapter in the book tells of one or two of her children the chapters are essentially about a defining moment or time in each of the character's lives and take place from 1925 to 1980 of course they all have the family and especially hattie in common but as one of the daughters says though it was also true that when assembled the family put her in mind of a group of roaming solitary creatures rounded up and caged together like captured leopards the chapters of this novel also felt like solitary stories honestly i really liked this book but if you are looking for a compelling overarching storyline you might be disappointed","2145":"great character descriptions i definitely felt like i was right there in her book my only complaint is the ending i felt like it was abrupt u0026amp i wanted more but may be that's a good thing","2146":"i loved this book i discovered this book while reading an o magazine and gave it a shot the story line starts slow but once it picks up you can't put the book down","2147":"i'm conflicted over this book there was some beautiful descriptive language in it sections that i wanted to just reread over and over i kept looking for each chapter to build on some common theme but didn't get that perhaps other than the men are philanderers and deadbeats and women are justifiably angry theme once i stopped trying to connect the chapters and just sort've treated each as a short story i enjoyed the book much more there are some really beautiful passages that i wanted to read over and over the author has a wonderful ability to pull you into the minds of her characters and such diversity of characters i was very moved but in the end i'm not sure that i know any more about hattie or how she left her stamp on the world through her children the theme of hattie felt like more of a literary device to pull these stories together all in all though a nice quick read by an up and coming author","2148":"great oprah pick listened to on audio","2149":" august mirrors mary june 23 2014this review is from the twelve tribes of hattie kindle edition surely eyes cannot be the only windows to the soul when a book such as this one provides such an insightful view of a woman's heart each chapter from the first to the last incites feelings akin to holding one's breath only to loose it when the lungs threaten to explode against a heart weighted with empathy this is a woman's tale personified through the person of hattie shepherd it is a journey across half a century of love and loss during which we see that the things that do not break us may leave us crippled instead hattie's life and marriage to august brings to mind the parable of martha and mary when jesus stayed at their home mary august sat at the feet of jesus listening to him speak martha hattie on the other hand was distracted by all the preparation that had to be made and complained to jesus that mary august left her alone with all the work tell her to help me martha hattie said jesus answered you are worried and upset about many things but few things are needed and mary august has chosen what is better hattie resents her husband's easy going demeanor with nine children to feed and care for there is much to do in the way of chores while he spend time with the children she assumes the role she thinks he should portray she despises him for things she does not have yet she yearns for him physically after her children are grown they do not hold any precious memories of her their memories leave them all fragile as reeds for all the wonderful things that could have been but never was this story reminds me of leila meacham's roses hattie like mary tolivar roses did not choose better","2150":"loved the first chapter and then struggled through the rest","2151":"i'm glad that oprah made me aware of this book it is a series of sequential stories of hattie and all her many children through the years 1930s through 1980s in philadelphia after she had escaped georgia with her mom and sister it is told in many voices and in different styles it is a set of stories about women and the men around them even the stories about her sons are really stories about women and in particular hattie","2152":"i made myself finish this book it was ok but too disconnected the way it was written once i read the questions at the end i understood the story better but was a shame i couldn't figure out on my own the relationship of hattie's tribe","2153":"tough to keep track of everyone's story need to focus on hattie it is her story not particularly happy with the prose was expecting it to be richer based on the first chapter","2154":"loved this book the characters were so real i felt like every chapter could have been the beginning of it's own novel i didn't want it to end","2155":"the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis hattie shepherd moves with her family from georgia to philadelphia during the 1920's they immediately encounter a new world where they can hold their heads high and walk on the sidewalk past a white person without stepping into the street but life is not so easy for hattie although beautiful and smart hattie marries august who becomes the great love and the disappointment of her life she has many children struggles through their illnesses poverty and august's constant philandering yet her will to survive is as strong as her intense sadness this novel is almost like 12 short stories connected through hattie the characters are intense and the writing is extraordinary leaving the reader to imagine every detail the only downside is the inexplicable sadness of hattie that is so strong it has a life of its own the glimpse of mental illness is heartbreaking and appears hereditary throughout this powerful novel there is no doubt that the characters will linger in your heart and imagination long after the last page highly recommend this authors first novel","2156":"somehow i never felt like i got to know hattie very well a bit of her came through in the unhappy lives of her children but she seemed to have more depth than the author explored the way the author revealed the intimacy of the inner lives of her children was stunning but the overall effect of the book left me saddened","2157":"i loved the book at first then the main story line fizzled out a bit and i felt like the character i knew the most in the last half i spent the least amount of time with but overall good book","2158":"i was unimpressed but my expectations were pretty high","2159":"this is the story following a black woman in the 1920's through the 1980's her life is difficult and she does not provide her children with the support and love they need to grow up to be happy individuals many people enjoyed this book but i found myself wanting to know more about the children and what happened to them obviously i'm in the minority as many readers really enjoyed the book","2160":"good but i think i will need another read to fully comprehend all the nuances","2161":"good but hard to do say anything just sad","2162":" how was she supposed to bear a life like this she looked around the room as if she might find the answer in august's face or marion's or pearl's but her eyes settled on ella in that moment it was no consolation to think she was doing the right thing for her child best not to think at all best to move because if she didn't she would fall down and she wouldn't get up again 137 after a heartbreaking introduction the book pieces together the struggles and sacrifices of hattie as she raises her eleven children and adopted granddaughter and loves her husband august and her lover lawrence poignant and would be easy to excerpt","2163":" i really wanted to like this book because i'd heard so many good things about it but i don't think it really delivers i am pretty fed up with connected short stories and although this doesn't completely fall into that category its structure kept it from being satisfying i wish the author had combined all the stories of hattie's children and had them interacting with each other as they stumble through life otherwise why call them a tribe aside from the first chapter which was lovely and full of promise the rest of the book treats hattie's children in isolation i want to know the whole family's story","2164":"i did not like this book there was no story here just bits and pieces about hatties 12 children and at that short snippets that left you wondering what just happened","2165":"i liked this book but i thought it ended abruptly which is to say not well but it was an interesting story of hattie her life and her children","2166":"i appreciate mathis' quality of writing and the complexity of the characters but also really did not like the characters in this book they are unadmirable","2167":"honestly i'm not sure how i feel about this book took me on a journey through several children's lives into their adulthood it was hard to keep up and remember what happened to some of the them and what their story was the most constant thing was the personality of the mother hattie she was set on being distant unemotional and only a provider for her children i was hoping that by the end of it all there would be some awareness on how her choice of parenting and her husband's impacted her kids lives into their adulthood i was left wondering if hattie ever realized how responsible she was for how her children turned out there was not a lot of material on what era the family was in and how the economy and culture could have impacted them i knew they were poor and they didn't live around many white people the mention of penicillin for a few extra pennies that could have saved her twins was more condemning on hattie's behalf than the idea that due to the era and culture there may not have been much education or resources available to have known this information what happened to the idea that parents do the best with what they have i didn't understand why hattie was the way she was what really triggered her to be distant and unemotional towards her children","2168":"deep and compelling and heartbreaking i could go on i enjoyed the way the story was written in snapshots and how you don't have to have a perfect ending for the book to move you","2169":"i will update this review after my book club discussion but overall i really liked the book although i found the ending to be a bit surreal","2170":"it took awhile to get into this book as every chapter deals with a different child of hattie's' and in doing so tells hattie's' life story about half way through i really got into the book and enjoyed it","2171":"a sad novel about a family who experienced tough times poverty infidelity u0026amp lots of children to feed u0026amp cloth the children never felt the love u0026amp tenderness from their mother hattie resulting in them having emotional u0026amp mental issues in their adult life each chapter focuses on one of the kids but there's no flow from one chapter to the other it seems as if the children are now living separate lives","2172":"the book was some what depressing it didn't really end with a good vibe the lives of all the kids just seemed sad and depressed i was hoping for a silver lining towards the end but it just never came","2173":" this book was truly one of the best books i've read in a while the characters are so real i find myself thinking about them and what happened you only get such a small slice of each of hattie's children but you find out so much about their character motivations and life my favourite chapter was the one on bell so much of her voice and her thoughts were insightful i loved the passage two had wanted to marry her good decent men who had families now and lived in nice houses on tulpenhocken street bell had been disdainful of them she thought them small and ordinary she'd taken pleasure in saying no to their proposals and breaking their hearts women who married men like that did nothing but shop for groceries and nearly die of boredom but here i am dying anyway such a powerful message about perspective there are so many amazing quotes and insights from this book as well as beautiful and simple descriptive passages i loved it definitely recommend","2174":" i must agree with many of the reviewers of this book about it's structure because each chapter of the book is dedicated to one of hattie's children there is not much time to develop true characters or even get a sense of how they relate to one another one character barely mentions the other with the exception of hattie so the reader never gets the sense of where the book is going or how family dynamics played out this book is a good first effort from a fellow girls' high alum however i found myself struggling to relate to the characters the writing at times is profound but the book never truly reaches a crescendo that pulls it all together","2175":"a gloomy book but it would make a good book club discussion book","2176":"i listened to the audio version and was brought to tears more than once the stories of hattie and her children are poignant though i found myself wanting more interconnection and follow up with the characters two chapters switched voice which was disconcerting at first while listening","2177":"this was an excellent book the way it was written from different characters was a very interesting way of communicating a story i would definitely recommend it","2178":"good job oprah this book of linked stories was like a mix of olive kitteridge and edward jones' lost in the city","2179":"difficult to read sad and depressing but at the same time it was a book that needed to be written and i had to read it","2180":"i really enjoyed this book each chapter is written from the perspective of hattie's children and despite the fact that it only gives you a glimpse into what each child had become and how they got there you never feel open ended about them","2181":"thought this book had such interesting characters it's a sad book as hattie's children find their own and terribly sad paths great book very much an oprah book","2182":" i want to emphasize first how good a writer mathis is she's so good her fictional world so textured and immediate and thoroughly imagined that it's actually quite easy to overlook her immense skill she has put this quilt together very carefully piece by piece and the result is a whole so complete one barely sees the stitching that said i found the overall structure of this book to be quite similar to olive kitteridge but less effectively organized which was a disappointment both are really collections of linked stories and both begin with stories that set out to humanize the central figure a strong prickly woman with whom it may become difficult to sympathize later the difference is that though hattie's tragedy is much more profound we barely catch a glimpse of that young hattie again from there she seems so grimly weathered so thoroughly disappointed by life that it can be difficult to keep that early version of hattie in mind throughout the book i also think that mathis's strategy to cover a new child in each chapter rather than circling back leads to an absence of interconnectedness between the children hattie is there but i didn't feel that physical pull of one sibling to another that mathis seems to want to highlight the facts of their childhoods were consistent but organically i didn't recognize a shared experience as for the two central themes the great migration and the power of music these were deployed in something of a puzzling way as well the masterful first chapter does a beautiful job of describing how hattie felt about the north vs the south but after that the children seldom encounter the south i guess i was expecting the contrast to be a bigger part of the book probably unfairly instead it seems to want to address the limited horizon of civil rights offered by the supposedly beneficial move of african american families to northern cities it does this well but i wanted more music this is an interesting one as well some of the chapters are about the soul stir of music in a visceral way but in others it's mentioned casually sort of tossed in as though mathis were looking for a way to link the children when music is prominently featured it's beautifully described but i felt this theme could have been deepened this feels like a lot of criticism but the truth is that i wouldn't expect so much from a book that didn't offer such a huge amount to ponder and discuss consider me a fan of mathis's work i'll happily read her again","2183":"yup only read about 80 pages of this i'm not surprised that i didn't finish","2184":"very well written i had a little difficulty with the variety of stories but in the end it came together nicely really is a story about hattie even though most every chapter highlights a time in one of her children's lives i did have a hard time visualizing hattie described as very attractive yet very stern and angry i worked hard at picturing what she looked like enjoyed the end a great deal","2185":"lyrically written in terse poetic language but unrelentingly depressing not one of the twelve tribes met with any success perhaps realistic but oh so sad worth reading but don't pick a time when you're feeling down","2186":"i didn't like the jumpy feeling but some of the stories were interesting","2187":"i really wanted to like this book but it was just too disjointed in its story telling and structure i could never connect to any one of the characters because their stories weren't interwoven enough by the time i figured out who's story i was involved with their story line would end and i was thrust into a new characters life i just couldn't emotionally connect it was a bit all over the map in its themes too such a bummer","2188":"easy read and liked how mathis told the story of hattie through her chaotic family","2189":" i just finished twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis this is the story of a young african american woman who moves from a rural town georgia to philadelphia during the great migration hattie's first moments outside the train station in philadelphia \"hattie looked more closely at the crowd on the sidewalk the negroes did not step into the gutters to let the whites pass and they did not stare doggedly at their own feet four negro girls walked by teenagers like hattie chatting to one another just girls in conversation giggling and easy the way only white girls walked and talked in the city streets of georgia hattie leaned forward to watch their progress down the block at last her mother and sisters exited the station and came to stand next to her 'mama ' hattie said 'i'll never go back never '\"although hattie emigrates from one part of the united states to another in the early twentieth century the south and the north are so different in terms of culture and opportunities for african americans that they might as well be different countries hattie's story is an intensely personal portrait of a mother told through the stories of her children through their lives we also come to understand a little of the times they lived in","2190":"good read yet slow at times and it didn't seem complete at the end shows a broken parent despite her good intentions the children suffer the consequences it's hard to nuture out of brokenness","2191":"in order for me to really enjoy a book i somehow have to connect to the main characters and that just never happened","2192":"as beautifully written as the short stories in this book were i could not bring myself to like it it was heartwrenching and disturbing in a painfully realistic way i grew attached to the characters and i was frustrated when i couldn't see their growth beyond a chapter this writer has talent but her first novel was just too disjointed and sad for me to properly enjoy","2193":"reads more like a series of short stories the writing was good the difficulties the children went through growing up were sometimes hard to read","2194":"the twelve tribes of hattie was an increasingly depressing novel i was happy to finish and move on with my life the characters honestly were well developed and unique in every kind of way the reason i was so ready to finish the novel is because this novel brought something out of me that i had not realize was there a certain outlook on how life could have been for me and probably was for my mother and her siblings it saddened me greatly and made me have a fear of failure for my future kids something i never thinks about and allowed me to understand my mother and her mistakes when i first began the book it reminded me of my own crazy family my six aunts and uncles that are so close yet so far apart they all have so many similarities but are so different at the same time spoiler alert hattie's eleven kids and one granddaughter really showed the many different demons people deal with they all carried different characteristics of hattie and that low life loser august and some were just all around crazy and deranged some of the children in my opinion didn't have a clue how crazy and demented they were while many were fully aware the two characters i was the most saddened by were cassie and alice i feel as though the way each of their chapters ended was a clear indication that they will always be stuck in a world and have no control of them the character bell was really intriguing to me because she was so aware of herself her mind and her demons she never lied to herself and new where her hate for her mother sprouted i enjoy the peace that came at the end of her chapter even though hattie has no intention of fully forgiving her it also seemed that it brought hattie herself to realize she needed to let things go and not hate and be angry all the time it never brought her anything but misery and weariness tsix was honestly one of my favorite characters he was a boy who were thrown into situations and dealt with them as they came he was afraid most of the time but he still did not waver he may have doubted himself but i felt as though there was something he born with that always pushed through his insecurity and just allowed him to be himself i understood his character the most and it brought me happiness that he found a place in the world where he could be on top and have people look up to him in that time and era and his condition he would have never found a following and a wife so easily especially in philadelphia t\"she didn't know how to tend to her children's souls but she fought to keep them alive and herself alive\" pg217 this quote sums up hattie in my opinion she was not a developed character because the story of her life was underdeveloped she was never able to be complex and wild she always sacrificed her dreams hopes and desires to feed her children and keep them alive hattie was never able to enjoy the simpler things in life everything about her was routine and miniscule","2195":"petty good but i expected more","2196":"this was an amazingly emotionally written story well i don't really know if it can be fully considered a story each chapter was it's own story it was more like a novel of short stories that were connected with each other by relation every chapter pertains to one of hattie's children with the exception to the last one the last chapter is about hattie's granddaughter either way it's a sweet read and i'm glad i got to read it i fully recommend this book","2197":"i loved this book i seriously wanted it to keep going so i hope another book is made she weaves an interesting story","2198":"i did not love this book it had no happiness no joy nothing good it seemed a picture of desperate and sad people i was interested in the lives of hatties children wanted to see how they fared hopeful for something decent also a bleak picture of motherhood just dark in its own way i didn't dislike the book but i couldn't recommend it","2199":" this book kind of broke my heart hattie tries so hard to keep her kids physically alive that she doesn't do anything for them emotionally it's sad to think that the only one of her kids that seems alright is the one that was presumably molested the book was beautifully written the metaphors were complicated and involved the chapter on ella hurt me the most and had the most eloquent metaphor overall i really liked it but i wish we could see more of the characters lives but i guess speculating might also what is so compelling","2200":"i regret purchasing this book i simply could not finish because it did not hold my interest","2201":"this novel chronicles one african american family in the great migration as readers follow the tales of hattie her eleven children and one grandchild readers will undoubtedly connect more with some characters than others but the wide expanse of time and the breadth of personalities illumines the courage it takes sometimes just to survive","2202":"this book so amazing i read it in two days i'm not always a fan of oprah's book club books but this one is a definite must read","2203":"a little hard to get into but worth the read i liked it","2204":" a debut of extraordinary distinction reads the first line on the inside flap of the book jacket i think i'd agree it might be pushing it a little to call it extraordinary but i am damn sure it is well above average and i am damn sure ayana mathis has the makings to produce a future book i will not hesitate to call extraordinary the format of the book more like a series of connected short stories than a novel leaves me constantly reevaluating my impression of the book based on the last segment read and most of my impression for each segment hinges on how well that story ends there are only two segments that end in a way i find completely satisfying one is franklin's story in vietnam and the other is the story of alice and billups those two stories are just about perfect in my opinion incredibly powerful and so well executed from beginning to end others like the story of six cassie and bell although they are also well written and compelling and all those good things just end as if mathis reached a word count and stopped writing they seem to just trail off and because those characters are now gone and the next segment begins with another of the siblings i am left feeling a little cheated so while i am not a huge fan of the twelve tribes of hattie i am already a fan of ayana mathis and happily look forward to reading her again","2205":"a modern masterpiece is that exaggerated perhaps but i knew from page one i was in the hands of gifted writer i look forward to seeing how she develops thrilled the nyt compared her to morrison i see bits of ed jones as well","2206":" i'm not really sure how to rate this book on one hand it was an engaging story written through the eyes of ten different perspectives all children and one grandchild of the title character hattie her life was hard she was hard and this reflected in the lives of all her children their stories were varied and heartbreaking and complex on the other hand so much of their stories were left unresolved a character is mentioned once or twice then never brought back a main character falls in love and we never learn of his fate too often i furiously flipped back through the pages trying to find the end story of a character only to be disappointed a good read but not necessarily the book club book of the year i was expecting","2207":"there were a few parts that could have been written a bit better but overall i really enjoyed the stories","2208":"a well done novel one of the better ones i've read in awhile vivid language paints a picture of the struggles of one large family hattie the matriarch moves from the south to philadelphia as a teen marries at a young age and ekes out an existence for herself and her children the story covers the diverse paths her children take and her own quest to find her own happiness this is ayana mathis' first novel a good start","2209":" i like to keep up with the hot novels especially ones recommended by oprah's bookclub as they are usually well written with strong female characters the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis does not disappoint this novel introduces the reader to hattie's children and grandchildren one by one with each chapter focusing on their trials and life beginning in 1925 and ending in 1980 the author was inspired by the nonfiction warmth of other suns depicting the struggles faced by african americans migrating from the south to northern cities i loved that book and had hoped to love this one too unfortunately i found each character to be lost every single one was so unhappy hattie had a large family it was depressing to think that every single member of the family led unhappy lives i was glad to have read this book and would recommend it to others but i don't think i'll re read it any time soon","2210":"after having this book on my want to read list for a long time i was extremely disappointed by it i can't quite figure out how it got such great reviews by so many people yes it gives a picture of the problems of poverty lack of education and racial discrimination but i did not find anything in this book that was hopeful encouraging uplifting or even particularly educational this family had a hard life and for the most part they made it even harder by their poor choices there was not even much in the way of love or connection to keep them going the structure of the novel reflects this instead of a narrative about the family and how it grew and changed and how the various members lived together and why they became who they did we jump through time sometimes skipping several decades and have a single chapter about each person with almost no connection to any of the other chapters or other family members and no real picture of why or how they grew into the adult lives that are described one character even references going to college but there is no description of how she was able to do that and why her life continued down a sad and destructive path so in addition to a depressing story line i feel cheated out of any insight into any of the characters or their lives i don't think every book has to have a happy ending but when i am reading for entertainment i like to at least get some connection to or understanding of the characters or learn something new and this book gave me none of that","2211":"good book interesting stories about the children but not enough about hattie to really understand her well enough having taught about the great migration it was interesting too bad hattie's life did not turn out as well as other's lives seemed to during this time period","2212":"a lovely overview of one family told through the stories of each of the different members compelling and thought provoking","2213":"enjoyed the collection of short stories very much amazing how mathis used beautiful fiction to share the plight of post civil war black americans who left the south to get away from backwards white people","2214":"beautifully written not an upper","2215":"incredible book the fiction version of the warmth of other suns kudos to ayana mathis i became so absorbed that i literally inhaled the book i could not put it down until every word had been absorbed happily sated","2216":"beautifully written story of hattie and her eleven children plus one grandchild hence twelve tribes not a feel good book by any means but the author develops the characters so well its as if you are reading from a place within their hearts and minds","2217":"it was the best book oprah has chosen yet","2218":"this was not a comfortable book to read the outcome of hattie's hard unemotional relationships with her children and the impact of poverty and racism were disturbing","2219":"there is some really solid and moving writing here mathis knows how to describe a scene an emotion a mood and can effectively change a narrative voice several times over i just didn't quite believe it a lot of the characters including hattie just didn't seem fully thought out the premise is incredibly intriguing and has a great deal of potential nine different stories that go in chronological order with each giving a brief glimpse into the experience of one of hattie's children until each child is covered and one gradnchild but maybe the premise was a little too ambitious and there were just too many voices oh yeah and i am not too crazy about the ending either it felt like mathis just needed an ending so she rushed it however this is mathis' first novel so i look forward to seeing how she grows from here","2220":"painfully sad but rings with the truth compassionate story of hattie and her 11 children their stories are tragic and difficult to read because of the depth of sorrows they endure but there is hopefulness in hattie's life in the end thought provoking","2221":"whenever i see an oprah book club sticker on a book i will usually not even bother to pick it up but once in a great while i will think well maybe this one is actually good no it hardly ever is this book pretty much consists solely of depressing stories with no point about a woman and her many children i'm all for dark and sad books but they need to have a purpose other than just trying to be depressing","2222":" you will remember this novel if any of these characters are in your life or if you have never met people like this you will remember this novel the african american experience is central to the story but it also the universal story of a family ayana mathis uses several different devices to tell this story and she expects the reader to work to get on board i like the fact that that the characters are neither obvious nor overly ambiguous","2223":"the ending kind of fell off for me it didn't seem like an ending to the story but since each chapter left you hanging about how that child's adult's story ended i shouldn't be surprised the writing was good though","2224":"great vignette story telling that weaves together a larger story heartbreaking characters","2225":"apparently i like my protagonists flawed and perhaps even damaged explains my affinity for gillian flynn novels in this respect hattie does not disappoint never warm never cuddly rarely empathetic but nonetheless riveting a wonderfully written story","2226":"what is it about novels that are raved about and put on a pedestal that i cannot get into i just did not like the structure of this novel although there was some great writing every single chapter is about someone different so you can never to know each character except hattie overly well once each of hattie's children have had their chapter they are pretty much forgotten i think if the writing style was different the novel could have been better but then again other people probably loved it...","2227":"great book","2228":"this book reminds me of all of the books i had to read in my undergrad african american lit courses it's very well written it's sort of depressing at times but an interesting view into black life","2229":"stunning story telling technique to essentially capture the character of a mother through the story of her children it is all the more amazing in that many of the stories do not even include hattie who is the main character without necessarily being in the foreground but by the end of the twelfth story you now exactly who hattie is and what circumstances has made her into the woman wife and mother that is the matriarch of her tribe","2230":"a memorable story about a woman moving from georgia to philadelphia for a better life for herself and her children hattie shepherd is the woman though much of the book looks at her children and the lives they develop wonderfully written full of life though darkened by despair","2231":"it was a great read each chapter was about a different person very descriptive i think hattie did love her children but was disappointed by life and her circumstances she was so worried about feeding and taking care of her children that she couldn't show them the love that she had for them unfortunately they became messed up adults as a consequence","2232":"i gave up on hattie and her tribes i just didn't care enough about any of them to find out what happened to any one of them the writing itself was very well done but i need to be able to develop a relationship with the characters and this is at it's core a selection of short stories","2233":"an ok book i thought the characters were a bit stereotyped and i wish the siblings' stories were a bit better connected to each other","2234":"i have to say that i was pretty disappointed in oprah's pick on this one the theme is a hardened african american mother being tough on her children to prepare them for life's difficulties and each child has a chapter dedicated to their story and point of view i love the premise of each chapter being a different one of hattie's children's point of view but not one of these characters was likable and i found myself not really being drawn into what they had to say i did finish it out but i literally had to force myself to finish reading it it had such potential but just didn't deliver for me with the characters or plot i also never felt that hattie was ever really redeemable","2235":"almost a collection of stories as we see hattie's life through the lives of her children as they make their way into the world the children are fairly spread out in age so the circumstances are quite different but in all there is a sense of despair a disconnect with love perhaps that arises from their relationship with their mother an interesting though not uplifting read i wish there had been more of hattie's story told throughout","2236":"takes you in and never wavers a thoughtful novel about love lost gained and forgotten a great read","2237":"a next book that i wanted to love but just didn't twelve tribes follows the lineage of hattie with interweaving stories of her children hattie doesn't share an ounce of tenderness with her multitude of children even though they desperately yearn it the most complex character and interesting for me was floyd and with the ending of his chapter and years in the novel along went my interest","2238":"it is no immortal life of henrietta lacks nor the help but once you move past the fact that nothing good is ever going to happen to any of the characters sit back and pay attention to the rich writing style may help to read the last 4 pages earlier so you can drag yourself through the doldrums","2239":"reads like a collection of short stories loosely connected on the basis of the characters all being members of the same family some reviewers have complained that it seems disjointed because of that but it seems to me an accurate representation of the disparate separate and often isolated experiences of siblings in a large family no two of them will experience the family in quite the same way especially not the ones separated by a decade or more","2240":"thoughti would like it more than i did a bit choppy","2241":"not really what i was expecting so i was a bit disappointed","2242":" i enjoyed this book it was a page turner although i thought the ending was abrupt i wanted more but i suppose the ending was fitting since we went through the life of hattie and ended with her grand daughter i thought it was interesting how the book was laid out in chapters each focusing on different people but all tying together did anyone else notice how much sex was filled in this book lol is that what they did back then or maybe they do the same thing nowadays and my conservative self has not been aware lol just an observation","2243":"could not stop reading different raw pain the strength to continue living despite the odds hattie is not the stereotypical mother portrayed in a thousand books she is almost aware of what she is and what she wants","2244":"i think she will be an excellent writer i did not dislike this book but i can't say i really enjoyed it each chapter was a short story and kept jumping forward although you got a comment about where on of the children were at a particular year you never really new what happened to them possibly she will develop each character in a later book this one was jumbled","2245":"was an interesting read and can't wait to discuss with brunch u0026amp books","2246":"i have never been one for oprah's books usually a sticker saying she picked it makes me run the other way but this one sounded like one i'd really enjoy...however...i am not sure what to say about this book it is well written but the choppiness of all the stories made it a little hard to follow it seemed like just when you were starting to care about one of hattie's children the story would jump to another also hattie was not that likeable it doesn't seem like she was a good mother or that august was a good father or that they were good together it seemed like losing those first 2 babies turned hattie's heart to stone yet she went on to have more and more children and didn't seem to love any of them all that much also each of these children is extremely flawed and i think the author is saying it is the way they were raised but it seemed no one rose above no one did better it seemed that the poverty that gripped hattie gripped her children too and it set them down paths to unhappiness i'm sure this is a realistic depiction of some families and how circumstance will mark you forever but i think i would have liked this story much better if even one these children had been given a happy ending of some kind also the ending was so abrupt i thought i had missed downloading a part the audio production this book was narrated by adenrele ojo bahni turpin u0026amp adam lazarre white i have only listened to bahni before and i am a huge fan i was also very impressed with the other two narrators they both did a great job but adam lazarre white was hands down the new narrator find for me he is fabulous reminded me a lot of dion graham he has that silky low voice but adam's had a little more gravel to it which i really enjoyed i will be looking for more narrated by all these narrators i would read another book by this author because her writing was very good but this book was just kind of middle ground for me 3 stars5 star narration","2247":"ayana mathis writes like poetry so much detailed imagery reads like a toni morrison novel or a rebeka sloot's non fiction or isabel wilkerson's epic story this story of america's great migration told in raw and soul searing prose by ayana makes for a brilliant first novel poor hattie stoic till the end my hope is that we as a people learn to be kinder to ourselves learn from our mistakes and become intelligent enough to ask for help for we are all in this together","2248":"in 1923 hattie shepherd leaves georgia with her mother and sisters when she steps out of the train station in philadelphia she is astounded by the fact that whites and blacks co mingle on the street at 17 she makes the mistake of marrying a man who will bring her nothing but disappointment there is no money for a doctor or coal for the furnace to boil water she holds her firstborn twins as they loose the battle to pneumonia hattie has nine more children but she is never able to love again she tries to prepare them for the difficulties of life but there is a deep sadness in their stories a thread of depression and or mental instability seems to run though the family there are 11 children and the final tale is of her granddaughter that she vows to save this one she will do right","2249":"well written but no momentum characters are developed mostly in the space of one chapter each no thread between chapters","2250":" this was a book from oprah's 2013 book club the book follows the life of hattie who is just 15 years old in 1923 when she moves from georgia to philadelphia shortly after arriving in philadelphia she marries a man who is a big disappointment to her as he gambles what money he has away they have twins who die when they could have been saved probably just for pennies if they had the money she then has 9 more children each chapter is of another decade in life and follows hattie's life this wasn't a book that i wanted to keep reading in fact i often put it down and didn't pick it up again for 2 or 3 days the ending stops suddenly i wish the ending was different this is one book i wouldn't recommend to someone to read","2251":"in the 1920's hattie flees racist rural georgia with the hope of a better life in philadelphia her life of heartbreak hope tragedy resilience and determination is revealed through the stories of her many children each chapter is a vignette of one of the children so different and yet so tragically the same a very well written book","2252":"very interesting stories very well written heartbreaking","2253":"what a well written book love how you learn about the character hattie through the portraits of her children hattie's determination to feed clothe and shelter her children through all the trauma life throws at them is written with such strength","2254":" i did enjoy this book i read it as an audiobook and that may have been an advantage as i found the stories about the different children conveniently separated i agree with many of the review comments characters got dropped after their chapter it was more of a family saga than a history of african american migration to the north while their circumstances were depressing and scary at times i was so fearful of the outcome when pearl u0026amp ben stopped at that rest stop i did care about the characters i wanted to know more about them their humanity their flaws their indiscretions their suffering their pride their strengths their weaknesses their mellowing with age and time all was beautifully conveyed through the author's choice of words dialogue and imagery it is definitely one i will remember","2255":"great story that provides a backdrop of the great migration period however the ending was disappointing i feel the story was left somewhat open ended i do have to give kudos to ayana mathis she is a great writer","2256":"great book great writing and storytelling but the end was a bit anti climactic","2257":"the twelve tribes of hattie tells a family story beginning during the last years of the great migration and ending at the eve of the reagan era it's an unflinching slice of realism that nevertheless looks at its characters with a humanist forgiving heart above all it's a story of how one woman an escapee from the racist south but still a prisoner of her gender created twelve tribes with varying worldviews weaknesses and ways of being hattie and her people are presented in what amount to a series of stories that could stand alone but ultimately are strung together by a most clever structure some excellent writing to be sure is found in this remarkable novel the best book of the year so far for me","2258":"poverty this intense ingrained is hard for me to understand and really kind people seem so hard to find willie maybe the woman who acted as the midwife so much alcohol drugs gambling sex and loss is this still the life of those so entrenched in poverty in the end we do find kindness caring deep down it is there but you have to look for it","2259":"i was acquainted with this author from a friend i am so glad that she acquainted me with this author book i have since recommended it to others they too have been mesmerized they have also spoke highly of the author and are anxiously looking forward to ayanna's next work ayanna mathis takes you on a journey that will at times bore you at times unnerve you and at the same time capture your heart spirit and soul it is a read that will forever pierce your heart get ready to question the life that surrounds the characters and all that it has to offer the book takes into account historical accounts that have contributed to the way we view various things as well as the way the characters view things the author probes various concepts such as the great migration marriage the role of the church children trying to find their own voice desires of those who are barren and a host of other things without boring you prepare to be enlightened prepare to recommend to others","2260":"couldn't put this book down","2261":"yes i enjoyed the book but i just wish there was a chapter that tied the family together i couldn't become truly involved with any one character because as soon as i got to know each one it was the end of the chapter and he she was gone it was like starting a new novel each chapter but i loved what was available for each character","2262":"i liked this but it was nothing amazing the writing is strong but each chapter is disconnected from the others reading it with the mindset that it's 12 loosely connected short stories rather than a continuous novel makes it much better and lessens the disjointed feeling to it","2263":"great book each chapter can stand alone and each are from a prospective of one of hattie's twelve children i highly recommend this book","2264":"loved this book each chapter is about a different child of hattie's it takes a bit of time in the beginning of each chapter to develop the character but i got really interested in each of the chapters and couldn't put the book down until that chapter was finished","2265":"beautifully written the author has a strong sense of language and storyinteresting choice for novel structurevery sadalthough billed as a novel that is glorious harrowing unexpectedly uplifting and blazing with life i would caution that the unexpectedly uplifting portions are very few and far between there are experiences of deep sadness that because of the structure you never know a character had the opportunity to grow past or survive","2266":"i was expecting the book to be more about philly and the great migration a good read real and interesting characters","2267":"excellent book","2268":"heart breakingly perfect the ending was perfect","2269":" this book had parts that emotionally wrecked havoc on me being thrust into hattie's world was a rollercoaster ride my heart broke with her felt fleeting moments of happiness and that hattie's world didn't seem to ever find that happy ever after i think reading this after reading olive kitteridge helped me make it through the multiple characters that weren't completely developed you just got a little glimpse of them like individual stories that have some of the same characters in them looking at the book that way helped me like it more i did love how mathis seemed to address different areas with each of hattie's children","2270":"wow this book was amazing not at all what i expected which was a straightforward story of the great migration instead i was pulled into an amazing family history which spans both a life time and a fast changing america this is a book i want to buy and read over and over","2271":"being an oprah book i was surprised at how little impact it made on me i liked it but not like i've liked previous books in the oprah book club i had a hard time with it because the entire book was choppy and incomplete in my opinion i understand that it was the author's particular style that she touched on a different character's life for one chapter then moved onto another in doing it this way i think she did a good job but it's just not my style i don't like tiny bits and pieces i like a whole story there was one chapter in particular that was hard for me because there was a lot of swearing and another that was more graphic than i like i realize that it was the circumstances of the characters that indicated these particular words etc but i still didn't enjoy it","2272":"not my favorite great character development but found myself not caring very much","2273":"it took me awhile to get into this book the total shifts in character and time bothered me but after the first couple if shifts i was eager for a hattie update and realized i was learning about her through the behaviors of her children i finished the book wishing for on update on each child","2274":" i thoroughly enjoyed this novel in fact i read it in a day hattie is 16 when she marries 17 year old august the novel opens when hattie and august's first children twins philadelphia and jubilee are 6 months old both hattie and august have emigrated as part of the great migration to the north hattie comes from wealthier lighter skin blacks her father owned the only 'negro' business in town before he his death august is from share cropping stock and hattie at times reminds him of this the brutality and disappointment life serves over and over is explored in depth in this novel what is the nature of love is it separate from tenderness what does a lifetime of oppression do to the dreams of a mother what does it mean to raise children you can't truly protect from the horrors of the world why does motherhood consume women and fatherhood is more of a pass time for fathers the colorism in the novel was pervasive all of the men were seeking high yellow girls with small waists and big butts most of the women who were pov characters were described as light skin it made me uncomfortable i think colorism is important to explore and discuss i just would've liked to see a darker skin women as a major character or hell even described as desirable pain and dysfunction are passed down in families like a disease this accurately shows this process from the best of intentions come further dysfunctional patterns i liked the authors treatment of christianity and preachers in the novel christianity is so important in the black community and has been since slavery yet i agree with the author that it serves us not at all as a religion more as a place to rest your soul don't get caught up too deep though as it doesn't bring the peace and happiness it promises ever in the end hattie is a hard women to either know or love she is fierce strong and the iron rod of her family i see in hattie much i see in myself","2275":"could not get into it therefore didn't finish it","2276":"spectacular well written captivating haunting just plain mind blowing this book reminded me of why i love reading the feeling of starting a book a just not wanting to put it down mathis told a story through various characters and with each chapter its as if you were being told a different story loved every minute of it really an awesome book","2277":"depressing book it was hard to keep track of the children each had a chapter devoted to him her but i could not remember what had happened to the child in previous chapters the writing was fine but the book itself is a real downer","2278":"a good story line and i would've given it 3 5 stars if possible i am generally however not a huge fan of fractured character development i wanted to know at least a little more about what happened to some of the children","2279":"this book left me very unsatisfied i loved the writing style of the author but felt the reader was only given glimpses of the characters each child had an amazing story and yet i came away with a beginning and no ending hattie was an angry shell of a woman that did nothing but birth emotionally damaged humans i will give this author another chance i think she has a lovely writing style and the book was hard to put down","2280":"this was not a novel it was a bunch of short stories loosely related this poses as serious literature and it has oprah's golden stamp of approval but it's disjointed and boring as all get go in essence the short stories deal with a dysfunctional families with hattie as the matriarch none of the characters are fully fleshed out or feel relatable","2281":"this book is a collection of short stories but as you read each one you realize they have something in common all the stories are connected to hattie a woman who had 11 children not all the stories have happy endings not all the stories make the reader feel good but all of them give the reader something to think about i think the first story about hattie as a very young mother of twins was the best and certainly helped the reader understand some of the rest of the collection","2282":"no plot each chapter describes a family member","2283":"it was okay but i am not sure that i would have bothered finishing it if it wasn't our book club selection for this month hattie lived a difficult life there is no denying that although i occasionally felt pity for her i never found myself liking her or finding empathy or compassion for her she herself admits that she's a harsh difficult woman to love i didn't particularly like the way it was written either with each chapter representing another one of her 'tribes'","2284":"a wonderfully moving and sadly beautiful story a good read indeed","2285":" fast read i found it easy to empathize with the female characters and wanted to read more to see what was going to happen to them but be warned this is episodic almost seems to be 12 short interconnected stories yet sometimes life is the same way characters we care for come and go i find myself hoping for a sequel although i learned plenty about life in post great migration philadelphia i would have enjoyed more historical detail recommended especially for readers who like short stories","2286":"great historical piece the trials and tribulations of a young african american girl she is coming off age in the 30s having migrated from the south to philadelphia liked the social commentary but i really didn't like the characters actually i didn't know them because of the structure of this novel they were never fully developed the darkest child by delores phillips is so much better","2287":" i found this book to be almost depressing by telling the story from the different children's pov you were able to gain insight into the family but the story spanned 60 yrs and everyone seemed sad and unhappy throughout the whole story it seemed like every bad thing that could happen to this family did happen infant death cheating pedophilia womanizing alcoholism u0026amp drugs mental illness etc yet you never delved too deep into any one person or time in their life you got to read about 1 day in alice's life and then you didn't hear of her again too depressing of a book for me","2288":"i want more the stories are compelling and mesmerizing","2289":"loved the book but would have liked a little more closure on hattie's children","2290":"really enjoyed the characters really gave you a sense of time and place i listened to the audio version and really enjoyed the narrator did not love the end very flat","2291":"i liked this book but didn't love it it's hard to love a depressing book","2292":" i have a tendency to pick up books that have been talked about and find myself disappointed in the beginning i get disappointed to the point where i find it a chore to pick up and read it my better half always asks me why i continue to suffer through a book when i'm not enjoying it and this book is the exact reason why i was so drawn in with the first chapter and then so disturbed by the next two that i really thought about giving up the next few weren't very interesting to me but i continued on i am so glad that i did ms mathis is really an amazing writer she wrote about feelings and emotions that i couldn't believe someone was able to put to words dark thoughts feelings and assumptions that you wonder if anyone else has had she hits them dead on i haven't decided that the approach to shock you in the beginning to where you become numb was an act of shear brilliance or complete luck it's exactly what hattie went through and just really helped you to feel and understand what she may have gone through in the 53 years the book covers the stories unfold and you feel what this family has gone through hattie did the best she could with what she had at the time and sometimes that's all you can do and then hope for the best all of this being said i'm not sure if i would recommend this to everyone i am known to struggle through a book especially when i can see that someone is a gifted writer i don't know a whole lot of people who will stick with a book through the end when they're having a hard time with it and for as hard as i struggled i'm apprehensive to recommend it there are some situations in this book that i found uncomfortable and difficult which is another reason i might be hesitant but i will definitely read another book by this offer and i'm very much looking forward to any future work she has","2293":"very good first novel i love this story about a mother and his different children in differents periods of time","2294":"it's an oprah book that should say it all not one happy thought no one is saved hattie's twins die at a couple of weeks old and although she has many more children the only joy she finds in her life is in an affair she works herself to the bone trying to keep everyone alive fed and clothed but no one feels loved each chapter is about a different child and the only that ties the stories together is that they are her children","2295":" the writing here is indeed superb but the story is a bit disjointed and the treatment of black males in this novel is absolutely horrendous here is a quote from usa today with one or two exceptions the male characters in this book make alice walker's the color purple read like a celebration of the strong black man that comes from a woman and those exceptions she mentions are fleeting at best the book starts off with a painful experience but the writing and situation draws you in immediately from that opening chapter it seems like everything goes downhill hattie never seems to quite recover from this event her husband august is nowhere to be found during this calamity the subsequent chapters are told from the 12 different children's perspective with varying degrees of effectiveness some of the chapters feel unconnected to the book as a whole predicaments are mentioned and then never followed up on i know this book and author have already been anointed as the next big thing and based on her prose i do understand why i could only go 3 stars because the misandry was suffocating and i sincerely hope that doesn't account for all the attention this novel has garnered i would find that very disappointing","2296":"oprah picks scare me cold mountain anyone ugh but she got this one right each chapter is about one of hattie's children her tribes and what is happening in their lives during a certain era most importantly these stories tell how having hattie as a mother shaped their lives colorfully told and a very good read","2297":"not very cohesive also she only had 11 children so why is it called the twelve tribes meh","2298":"yes it took me awhile to get through yes i put it down for about a month but i was satisfied in the end and actually realized how meaningful it was to get to know hattie through her 12 children and made me think of how people would see my family through me","2299":"depressing continuity errors unlikeable characters not compelling if i could give this book half a star i would do not recomend","2300":"great story ies kept my interest well","2301":" i read this book because i saw it on oprah's magazine i had this nagging feeling that i wouldn't like it but decided to take a chance i read this over almost three months usually in bed because the writing made me sleepy i understand the premise of the book but each chapter was about each or several of hattie's children they all get their moment in the spotlight but you don't hear from them again in the next chapters i was hoping that there was something at the end to tie everyone's stories together but was disappointed maybe the author wrote it that way ie each child has their own perception of their mother but to me it was just all over the place","2302":"similar to other oprah book club books i have read this is depressing the writing was quite good and it did keep me reading but i didn't like that each chapter focused on a different child and then never connected any of them","2303":"wonderfully written prose but so very sad with only a few exceptions the stories of hattie's children do not overlap it's like they were never siblings maybe that's the point related but not family the men are mostly trifling and they seem to flaunt their flaws i would give this 4 stars for the writing but only 3 because the novel was so utterly heart wrenching","2304":"the best book i have read since ava's man i highly recommend this book especially to all of us mothers whom for whatever reason hold some of ourselves apart i won't do ayana mathis the injustice of comparing her writing to any other author i pray she will write many many more books thank you ayana you are truly gifted","2305":"this was an extremely difficult story which is exceptionally well told hard to put down","2306":"intriguing characters dark but very good","2307":"not bad but no flow to it","2308":"the book is a series of short stories rather than a comprehensive story i would have liked to hear more about each of hattie's children later in their lives after the snapshot portrayed in the chapter assigned to each individual one","2309":" this reminded me a lot of olive kitteridge in that the stories are about folks all tied back to hattie the book covers the lives in birth order of hattie's children each at a different stage of their lives each story is heartbreaking but none so much as hattie's whose first experience at motherhood sets the tone for entire life as a mother i debated giving it 3 or 4 stars i suppose as i reflect on the story i would rate it higher than merely a liked it it makes a good book club book and comes with book clud suggested discussions oprah's notes were marked in the version i had and i found that a bit annoying it didn't really lend much to the book","2310":"the first chapter seemed like a type of book i might enjoy with history and a young mother's struggles then i started chapter two about her brother and it was too graphic about his sex life for me so i've quit","2311":"i actually liked the structure of the book though i found each and every story incredibly unsettling i liked hattie despite all of her flaws but i struggled to know hattie at first it took me awhile to really begin to build who hattie was because most of what we learn about hattie comes from the resulting lives of her children interesting read very sad unsettling set of stories","2312":"this book was written in a unique voice the book begins with the main character hattie being 15 years old and the story ends with her being in her 70s the cool part about this book is that we grow up with the character through the eyes of her children i would recommend this book","2313":"i wanted to like this chronological sequence of profiles of eleven children and one grandchild of an unlikely matriarch hattie first appears as a 17 year old mother of twins she is trying save from consumption in the end her offspring covered the spectrum cliched african american stereotypes and hattie remained angrily opaque","2314":"this was not a happy book the twins were lucky that they died as infants because they would have just been two more dysfunctional tribes would not recommend that's all the words i'm going to spend on this evaluation","2315":"an honest insightful tale i enjoyed it although it was a little too woeful for my taste will be interesting to see what is next for this author well written","2316":"very interesting perspective on the life of a woman who was part of the great migration north of the mason dixon line as told primarily through the perspective of her many children how difficult life was and how much her children knew and didn't know about her experiences and their impact on how she raised them the wide variety of lives her many children lived the successes and failures the hardships and joys what an amazing first novel","2317":"i know i am a bit of a pollyanna but i found it difficult to read a book in which each situation and character was so utterly depressing all heaviness no redemption just not enjoyable for me","2318":"this wasn't really a novel but more of a collection of loosely connected short stories of 11 of hattie's children and 1 of her grandchildren that took place over 60ish years this would be a great book for discussion because although there's not much in terms of an overall plot each story is a wonderful character study in itself which was perfect for me for an audio book i probably would have skimmed much more quickly looking for if i had been reading instead of listening i usually avoid oprah's selections but am happy to have read this one","2319":"beautifully written ayana mathis writes in a style that is poetic and flowing her characters live and breathe and draw the reader deeply into their stories the character of hattie will stay with me for a long time this is a book i know i will read again","2320":"i want to say i really like the way this author writes and i would seek out other books by her i really hated the way the book was constructed though just when you got into the flow of a character the story chapter ended and you were off to a different character time period setting why not write a multi generational saga with maybe a bit less detail of each story i also felt like too many of the stories had similar themes crazy mentally disturbed characters who act out because hattie was cold i get it but each chapter all i could do was roll my eyes and think really another one all the girls kind of ran together for me in the end because they were all batsh t crazy ruthie is barely mentioned later in the book so she doesn't even count as a character i would have loved to see one of them visit ella later in the book to see what her life turned out to be too bad mathis' editors didn't steer her in a more conventional direction because this could have been a great story instead it left me hollow and depressed","2321":"a story told through time about a mother's sacrifice struggle and eventual peace not uplifting but a compelling narrative keep in mind that the novel is about one woman and her reflection through her children and choices made","2322":" as a daughter and granddaughter of people who participated in the great migration i was eager to read mathis' novel about the trials one family went through in their journey north the story is rather bleak but so was grapes of wrath but definitely worth the read the style of the book reminded me of michener's 'tales of the south pacific' in that each chapter could be read as its own short story yet they are all related i also thought it would be interesting to compare this book to emecheta's 'the joys of motherhood' which touches on very similar themes in a different cultural context","2323":" in the beginning of the story it captivated me with the rich characterization i felt very sympathetic to hattie that lost both of her children it really prompted me to care about what she was going through however her story quickly became lost in the pages thus me not really understanding what her purpose was the main problem i have with these type of books is that the content is promising but the execution is poor i found myself skimming more pages than i would like thus that contributed to the three stars on the other hand there were some characters that left an impact on me but not many despite my fickle feelings this was a decent book but i am apprehensive about reading more work from mathis i liked the language of this book not so much the other parts i feel that it would have been better if it would have explored more of hatti's story and not the unnecessary characters i also was not a fan of the writing style that really makes or breaks a book at least when it comes to four stars or higher overall it was decent but not anything to brag about","2324":"hattie is married young and moves from georgia to philly with her husband and twin babies in the 1920s the twins die of pneumonia and hattie goes on to have more children the story is told in chapters from the point of view of a child or two as the years pass hattie is cold but fiercely protective of her children all of whom seem pretty screwed up hattie is complicated and her children hard to like though wonderfully written i wanted happiness in someone's life in the story","2325":"hard book to rate or write a review for the book itself is about the children of hattie and their struggles as individuals and as a family some parts of the book were really good and other parts were just okay sometimes leading more to the strange side overall pretty decent first novel","2326":"wonderfully written story of an african american woman and her offspring each chapter features insights into the lives of one of her children and through the childrens' stories one begins to piece together the story of hattie herself definitely worth reading","2327":"4 1 2 stars hattie is young and pregnant and marries the father despite what her mother thinks of him the next 50 years bring tragedy and many children who do not always thrive due to what keeps her so sad","2328":"i put this in the decided not to read folder but actually i read more than half each chapter tells the story of one of hattie's 12 children u0026amp the different experiences of a negro as they were called at the time family that had moved from georgia u0026amp jim crow up north to philadelphia very well written but i got tired of the sameness of some of the stories","2329":" meh i liked the idea of every chapter being about a different child of hattie it was an interesting view in my opinion hattie was the most interesting character and i wish there had been more of her since she was the title character and all i had a problem with the fact that every child of hers had a horrible life every chapter was a new snippet of each child's life and always a negative portion i think that out of her 12 tribes at least one should have had a happy moment right overall i thought the book was just okay nothing i would strongly recommend to anyone and really it was a let down i was expecting more from oprah","2330":"just closed the book it still seems a cacophony of so many voices all witnessing so much pain and damage yet hinting at hope i'm still trying to integrate those varied voices into the context of hattie herself her own words her own pain damage and hope i might well reread this book and it makes me promise myself to pick up another one i've been meaning to get to the warmth of other suns which chronicles the migration north of african americans in the late nineteenth and early 20th centuries","2331":"what a breathtaking book reminds me of one of my favorite's which is the joy luck club loved this book","2332":"i can't quite figure out why this book has gotten such good reviews yes the prose is compelling but the structure drags it down each chapter forces the reader to go off in a new direction get to know one or more new characters and then start over again with the next installment because you know you won't know the ultimate fate of each character it hardly seems worth it to make an effort to be interested in any of them","2333":"i read this based on oprah's recommendation it was good but not as enthralling as i had expected","2334":"not an easy read certainly thought provoking as most of oprah's picks are regardless of whether or not i like them i would say its worth reading","2335":"very powerful portraits of agony and pain of members of one afro american family","2336":"very depressing no redeeming factor until the very last page","2337":"this read more like a collection of short stories although the mother was the uniting thread between the stories she was not really the focal character most of the time and the chapters did not seem to interact cohesively although i had a day in an airport to read this in one sitting it did not capture me in the way that other books sometimes do","2338":"i think i need to read this again a family tree diagram would have been very helpful there was so much going on so many characters i often found myself asking who was that again great stories in this book but i really would have liked to see more development of some of the characters some of the folks we learn about in the early part of the book don't make any appearance anywhere else why what happened to them","2339":"i can see how the author tried to focus on developing multi faceted and intricate characters however i think the book got bogged down by shock and awe tactics in trying to prove a point i think the book just ended up being about a one dimensional family that was screwed up beyond redemption i should know better than to pick up books on oprah's book club list rarely am i impressed by her choices","2340":"started out strong but dragged toward the end","2341":" can one family endure this much misery even if they have twelve children can one reader endure this much misery hattie has her first children at 17 and continues until she is the mother of 12 poor african american and forever disappointed hattie raises the children from the 1930's to the 1980's each chapter focuses on a different child and his her perspective of her his self and his her mother it's not much about history or anything else except how each feels about the mom and the implication is that mom's lack of tender love caused their troubles we also get insight from hattie herself as she struggles to withstand the demands of the children a philandering scoundrel of a loser husband and her own hubris it's possible to read the last chapter as somewhat hopeful but it's a long slog to get there","2342":"i listened to the audiobook and low and behold my fav narrator is on here along with two others who dutifully brought the characters to life bahni turpin the book follows so many people in a way that isn't seamless but that's good this fits the tone wonderfully as i grew to know the troubles of each character the story wraps up in understanding a bit more about hattie herself a strong woman who did the best with what she knew","2343":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here great book","2344":"i really enjoyed this book but i felt i only got glimpses into hattie's life and the lives of her children this book really does show how life experiences truly shape the person you become","2345":"so beautifully written but really depressing","2346":" book blog review http africanbookaddict com 2015 11 i bought this in 2014 i didn't even plan to read this during the summer but the book was smiling at me from my bookshelf so i started it from the first page to the last this has been a good page turner i honestly do not have any issues with this book it was an excellent read i read each chapter as a short story since each chapter focuses on one of hattie's 9 children intertwined with hattie and her husband august's history each chapter has its own twists and turns as readers get acquainted with hatties children and whatever issue they face in life i believe mathis concludes each chapter powerfully and with a hint of positivity its interesting how all of hattie's children have such diverse lives and they face real life joy and pain yes hattie was an unloveable stern sometimes cold woman but i understood and appreciated her nobody in this life is perfect and this book surely kept nailing that into my head i don't even think a review can do this book justice you have to read it for yourself to understand its a shame that this book doesn't have great ratings on goodreads i don't know what people expected when they chose to read it lol i'm glad oprah saw the greatness of this novel hence peoples' increased interest don't get me wrong the stories are laden with lots of different things homosexuality depression mental illness colorism the great migration from georgia to philly marriage racism sickness pain cowardice bravery christianity family the book takes readers through 4 generations from 1925 to 1980 so be prepared for a long powerful ride note this is an adult fiction book readers should be 18 years or older to indulge","2347":"didn't like it only finished it because i kept hoping it would all tie together easy author to read but don't get it was i supposed to like these characters","2348":" of course i had to read this book one of my best friends is hattie though the twelve tribes is quite a different story than her life ayana mathis is a philly bred author where the novel takes place it starts under a cloud of deep south repression in the early part of the 1900's when hattie her mother and sisters migrate north after her father's death her life story is a tough one and she develops a similarly tough skin i will reveal no more so as not to spoil this book as it is definitely a great first novel and well worthy of reading","2349":"i did like the book was light easy read won't go down as a top fave but certainly worth my time","2350":" the twelve tribes of hattie is really more a series of connected short stories than a novel i'm sure they stuck the 'a novel' on there for the simple fact that short stories don't sell but the book is better served by looking at it in that way almost all of the twelve narratives can stand completely on their own and perhaps not surprisingly the ones that can't are the weakest they are of varying qualities and the characters held various levels of interest for me especially as each successive one started to cycle through the same mistakes as earlier members of the family there is some beautiful writing but that isn't quite enough to elevate the 'novel' to the next level","2351":" wavering between three stars and four went with the extra star as i truly enjoyed the stories and even more important i think i closed the book with a better understanding of a culture the book is something of a collection of short stories with individual focus on hattie's children chapter by chapter hattie's own style of fierce love is revealed in each of her kid's stories the only real tie in to each short biography as a reader i was waiting to see more interactions between the many siblings more on their connections to each other i think that extra dimension would have made the characters more real i would have felt more empathy and yet i give this four stars a book i would recommend to others for the historical content behind the stories and to take a deeper look at how a mother's love can be misunderstood","2352":"one of oprah's picks she loves books that have sentences you have to read three times to understand her words not mine i don't have time to dissect a book like that and this was one of those books","2353":"while this book was in one way fabulous i do agree with others' perspective that mathis should have tied the individual characters together better i was also expecting a better ending this one left me hanging expecting more","2354":"it's a little confusing but a very very good read","2355":"i was a little disappointed that this was more like short stories than a novel it gave a unique perspective lots of them but some chapters were too long while others seemed too short i wish the characters came together more i would read another ayana mathis book in the future","2356":"great writing totally contrived story could she manage to fit in one more cliche of the black experience in the 20th century it was more like reading a sociology text book than a novel i didn't even bother to finish","2357":" because the ten chapters of this book each concerns one or two of hattie shepherd's eleven children and one of her grandchildren i made the mistake of taking a break half way through to read a few other books the fact that i stopped when i did was an indication that i wasn't finding the book to be all that interesting i did intend to come back to the book which i did but i wasn't compelled to keep reading as i have been with many of my recent books however when i tried to pick up this novel again i realized that the chapters were more interconnected than i had thought so that i had to skim back through the first half to remember who some of the characters were hattie had a difficult life with several tragic events occurring to her early in her life as a result of her difficulties and her large family she was reserved in expressing her love for her children she married at fifteen or sixteen to a man she knew was not the best for her only because she was pregnant she made do with what she could get living in poverty for most of her life her children admired her strength and some returned to her sometimes reluctantly when they were in trouble but they wanted proof of her love too most of her sons were very like their father but the daughters that we see as adults have not coped with adversity in the way that their mother did this is a sad book it may reflect the reality of the lives of african americans in the twentieth century but it was not an easy book to read","2358":"so very depressing there was not one character that i wanted to spend time with","2359":" tender grandmothera horrendous event leads teenage hattie and her mother and sisters to abandon their beloved georgia home and flee north to philadelphia there hattie grows up quickly getting married and having twins before she turns 16 she's shocked and devastated by how much she loves her children and by how much her husband august lets her down hattie is not a perfect mother in fact most of \"tribes\" is about her parental short comings but to be fair to her she gets little help from her husband and little from her community since her pride prevents that hattie is determined to survive and to feed her children their emotional needs seem to be beyond her caretaking the book alternates chapters of some of her children and the aftermath of how they weather their upbringing none seem to thrive some barely survive they're all compromised either emotionally or physically or both hattie is tough and still retains a capacity to dream which is probably the only thing that sustains her her children are less lucky i read this book with mixed feelings jumping from character to character with only hattie being a constant was disconcerting the almost unrelenting hardships were not enjoyable many of the characters were unlikeable the writing was good but it felt uninspired i have the sense that this was purposeful on mathis's part to help convey these hard lives death and disaster was always a step away one misstep would clench it thankfully hattie gets a chance to redeem herself through her relationship with one of her granddaughters outside mere endurance this is the only brightness in the book ayana mathis is definitely a writer to watch i left this book wondering if it had let me down or i had failed by not liking it more this review is based on an advanced reading copy received from the publisher","2360":"a bit all over the place felt unsatisfied in the end as it just didn't all come together for me was like 10 short stories","2361":" although the writing is good the storyline was extremely disjointed i like the idea of a separate chapter for each of hattie's the main character children but ultimately none of the chapters delved deep enough into the character so at the end of the day you're wondering what happened to all of these folks not that i was looking for or even like a neatly tied up ribbon ending but some sort of connection b w the children would have been nice when i reached the end i was definitely wanting for more and not in a good way","2362":"very descriptive would recommend and would be conversation inspiring read for book club","2363":"this book is beautifully written but every chapter is heart wrenching hattie endures some of life's worst obstacles and each of her children is a train wreck in a different way","2364":"i enjoyed reading hattie's story over the years and through the perspectives of her children not like any style i've read before","2365":" this novel i found technically proficient and extremely well written yet utterly unlikeable there is a lot that works here gorgeous prose a blunt style reminiscent of flannery o'conner psychologically complex and well developed characters well handled portrayal of religion unfortunately i thought the book failed to soar above the bleakness racism and poverty it wanted to portray thanks to an utter lack of redeeming characters unless you read hattie more sympathetically than i did its hopelessness towards life and especially its negative characterization of black men oh maybe 3 5 stars","2366":"good book great character development the character and story reflect the human struggle particularly as it relates to the great migration of african americans and what it meant to survive in an urban setting","2367":"i didn't finish the book what stuck in my mind was sex with all the women then a man too not my type of read i am sure there is more to this book but i couldn't get past this part","2368":"well written but for me disjointed i got a little lost in the shuffle of the chapters with well done character development a snapshot of that characters life then we never hear from that character again but i will say it is a book with characters i thought about later which means for me it was a compelling story","2369":"totally disappointing dysfunctional characters couldn't warm up to any character","2370":"great characterizations and stories of hattie's 11 children and one granddaughter","2371":"i listened to it on cd i liked that they had different narrators for each person again parts were hard to hear and it wasn't uplifting but was a good book","2372":"this book did not hold up as an oprah pick for me the characters were not developed and the story was not interesting i did finish it because i wanted to see what the rave was about this book just did not rate as a really good read for me","2373":"while i like the author's writing style and enjoyed the narrative being told from different people at different times the whole book was just plain painful and sad kept waiting for some hope and redemption to the characters' suffering and didn't get it until literally the last sentence of the book at least it was a quick read interested to hear how my book club weighs in","2374":"i feel bad giving this book two stars but remember two stars it was okay there were parts of this book that i liked but overall it was just okay","2375":"essentially this book is a collection of short stories with the unifying thread of their mother hattie it is a study of how one person's intense pain can play out in the lives around that person it was intriguing i was interested in all 12 stories it was however very sorrowful i look forward to a book club discussion with this book","2376":"i couldn't finish this book which very rarely ever happens it was depressing and i could not relate to anyone to keep me reading","2377":"good book enjoy reading it think all of us has a little bit of hattie in us like a lot of other reviewers would have liked more connection between characters i finished the book wondering happened to them all","2378":" i gave this book 4 stars because i really enjoyed mathis' writing and her story telling style however each chapter left me wanting for more more about the characters more about their lives more about how hattie interacted with each child for instance what happened to ruthie did she grow up knowing her dad did lawrence play any role in her life there was a strong feeling of disconnect throughout the story with underdeveloped characters mathis did try to bring the story together with tying hattie in at the end with the granddaughter though but it just didn't seem to be enough yet each chapter and what i knew of the characters i loved the resilience of the human spirit the need to feel loved and be significant is inherent in all of us and was brought across clearly","2379":" a gorgeous novel and a remarkable first novel at that just wow poignant heartfelt wise i loved hattie- who at 15 married august and moved from georgia to philadelphia in the 1920s it is a family history but particularly a black family history which of course adds another huge level of difficulties the twelve tribes are hattie's and august's children the reader gets to understand the complex hattie and the simpler august through the children it held me in its familial web from start to finish and i didn't want it finish the biblical religion aspect was interesting but for me secondary i feel sorry for the next book i read because it can't help but pale in comparison on the relationship of blacks and whites in georgia the author writes these people had probably known each other all their lives and still one had the power to demand that the other step into the gutter and that other was cowed enough to do it","2380":"3 5 stars rounded up to four a good but depressing book","2381":"excellent beautiful writing","2382":"i really wanted to give this book 3 1 2 stars ayana mathis'prose is so vivid and thought provoking that i found myself completely engaged in the story of each of hattie s children however the ending left me wondering what the point of the story was so i gave it 3 stars","2383":" i really enjoyed this book it's a bit of a hybrid between a novel and a collection of short stories and i think it could be read as either some chapters interested me more than others and at times i wished there was a greater connection between the different stories presented however i really liked the concept of this book and i overall really enjoyed it i found the writing especially good and i definitely look forward to reading everything ayana mathis publishes in the future this was her first novel","2384":"interesting structure but not satisfying after the first chapter i didn't even like hattie would give it 21 2 stars","2385":"beautifully written emotionally draining","2386":" i loved this book it was very well written w well defined characters and terrific imagery hattie the main character leaves the south the only place she's ever known as a young woman of 15 and goes w her mother and sisters to philadelphia land of endlessly cold winters and no jim crow laws everything is different hattie has twins shortly after her mother passes the names she gives the babies promise hope and good things to come in the future names her mother wouldn't approve of because they were showy when the babies die of pneumonia after hattie does everything she can to save them some part of her goes with them hattie has many more children and each chapter lets you learn about these children at different times in their lives and hattie's life also because there are quite a few more children you glimpse hattie as she ages and see her views on life change you feel as if hattie is a very strong proud woman who cares for her children ensuring they eat have manners and finish school but without connecting with them in a nurturing way when she makes her daughter give up singing at 12 tho the daughter is really quite good the child and her father both think it is just meaness or even jealousy when in her reality hattie is trying to prevent future heartache you learn that hattie did the best she could caring for all those babies keeping them fed clothed warm and safe she just didn't have much left for showing affection which lead to some of her kids thinking she is cold and unfeeling when really she like any other mother only wants them to be happy healthy productive members of society this is a great read that shows the human condition w all its guts and glory intact","2387":"one of the best books i've read in a long time a beautifully written and significant story about one family starting during the great migration north from the jim crow south and ending several decades later there was a lot of sadness and tragedy but the story was also about hope and love and loyality as hattie did the best she could for her family a must read","2388":"an amazing book with a chapter about all of hattie's children at various stages of their mostly sad lives spanning 1925 1980 hattie is woven into the stories as a cold mother deprived of her husband's love and living through poverty that held her back descriptive and well written","2389":"mathis is a wonderful writer but this novel struggles under its own weight there are few can't think of any actually stories of hope in this book each character is overburdened by his her life it was a bit of a slog to get all the way through it","2390":"mixed reaction to a collection of compelling life stories of the children of hattie she was a young girl when her mother took her and her sisters from georgia to philadelphia where she marvels at the freedoms of life in a state not under the reign of jim crow the story goes downhill from the beginning following the heartbreaking deaths of twin infants hattie bears 9 children with her philandering husband hardened by her loss of the twins hattie never recovers emotionally a fact evidenced in the stories of her basically dysfunctional family knowing the difficult home life that produced them it is clear that each child has been deeply affected unable to make healthy life choices each chapter deals with one or two of hattie's children resulting in a somewhat disjointed novel barely held together by family ties within each story the author shifts time periods frequently further contributing to a disunited whole despite these structural drawbacks the characters of this tragedy are clearly if somewhat coldly drawn resulting in a fully human story of life in the slow lane","2391":"twelve intertwined short stories about hattie's twelve children each story was rich with emotion and detail i felt that i got to know each of hattie's children well and that every story could have been its own novel","2392":" in 1923 hattie shepherd finds herself in philadelphia married to a disappointing man she gains none of the opportunities she hoped for when leaving georgia and instead watches as her firstborn twins pass away in her arms because she doesn't have the pennies to pay for medication hattie ultimately gives birth to 9 more children whom she vows to raise tough enough to face the challenges and unkindness of the world that awaits through twelve different stories readers come face to face with crippling adversity the faces of love and the resilience of the human spirit","2393":"hattie and august and their progeny did not much fascinate me the writing was good but the characters were overly flawed i liked the way the novel was constructed with each chapter portraying a character but at the same time sometimes that felt limiting leaving me wondering or wanting more about one or another of the mathis kids couldn't there have been some happier or wiser outcomes hattie was so full of resentment towards her husband so attatched to the loss of her first babies a set of twins that she really kind of lost her soul none of the subsequent kids saw much of her tenderness at the end of the novel when hattie is much older and one of her children bell has been near death with tb we do finally see hattie's motherly love and devotion expressed with some dutiful tenderness i was glad august found god in the end but i shut the book mad again at hattie when she drags her granddaughter away from being saved at church all these characters need saving in any or all forms i see why oprah was impressed with the book it has grit and color it has some good storytelling floyd the teenaged minister of sorts gifted at preaching yet so unsure of his own faith was a fascinating character i am glad i read this but found myself thinking of another african american author i enjoy more j california cooper glad to have read the twelve tribes but wish the tribes had mingled more and fought back against hard times","2394":"i was disappointed as another person stated not a single character to fall in love with you feel for hattie her struggles her children's struggles but there are to many loose ends","2395":"it has been often said that the way a child has been treated by their parent can effect and ultimately change the very essence of who they are capable of being beginnings regardless of environment will either make or break a child but how can anyone know which way they will go this story portrays a mothers struggle both mentally and emotionally when faced with financial hardship racial discrimination and how that can impact her own 11 children that saying from forest gump life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you may get rings true for all characters in this book but one things for certain life is hard i now sit in wonder had hattie stayed with her decision of changing her future was that her golden door of opportunity i understood hattie with her inability of showing love to her children she had nothing left and was trying to hang on with every strength of the little energy she had without comfort for the spirit what light will you ever see a great first book for oprah's book club 2 0 choice i loved it","2396":" beautifully written story about a large family through the decades as they experience life in philadelphia during the civil rights and earlier eras as well as their roots tied to the jim crow south it is told in short story style with each chapter narrated by a different child of hattie a tough cold woman as described by her sons and daughters they all have deep issues and their stories are usually told at a major turning point in their lives the chapters are interconnected a bit but each story left me wanting to know more about that child just when you turned to the next one while it dealt with tough topics it was still a page turner and left me with much to think about","2397":"i love a book that makes me cry painfully beautiful","2398":" oprah finally picked a good one its been awhile this book made me cry many times the author depicts a new way to expose us to the age old conflict and unrest within the family unit hattie and her tribe endure a hard and laborous life as they make many attempts to live the american dream their struggle is beautiful and heartbreaking and so very poetic their many tragedies love loss mental illness alcohol abuse infidelity homosexuality are exposed throughout the novel spoiler the ending really struck home for me hattie has completly lost her faith in her husband and in god she is sitting in a church pew open eyed and closed off meanwhile the rest of the congregation is in the spirit and praising god hattie just can't let go of her inner turmoil and let god in she cannot overcome her inner demons she doesn't feel the spirit like everyone else seems to be she refuses to pretend and be a hypocrite as she has witnessed many fake christians over her lifetime including her own son six a pastor she refuses to be a lukewarm christian and continues to silently sit while everyone around her is being blessed she sits still until she sees her grandaughter about to accept jesus and then she moves fast yanking her from the church she just couldn't bear the thought of her innocent grandaughter being exposed to religion and all the evils that come with it mainly hypocrisy i feel like that most days and cannot let go of the evils of the church i e the congregation to accept the blessings that may or may not await me i think it all boils down to bitterness hattie is so very bitter after living a hard life that she cannot see the full scope and realize her need to love and be loved she has always had trouble with tenderness","2399":"this book was a little disturbing at times and had so much sadness in it but i couldn't put it down","2400":"good potential but hampered by the fact that all the stories of hattie's children were essentially the same and the treatment and character development was too shallow","2401":"good writing at times but disconnected at others i wanted more of a flow story rather than character portraits which is what this felt like and ultimately i felt like there was little hope to be found in hattie's life or this book","2402":" this was this month's book club selection and i just couldn't get into this book i like a character one can root for or one that shows depth of character or character growth there was none of that in this book hattie is a mother who just takes care of the basics given she has had 11 children and thus shows no emotions or love towards any of them thus each chapter is about a different child of hers and a story about how when they are grown up what depressing miserable lives they lead if this book doesn't dissuade people from having a lot of children and i mean 6 i don't know what will it truly shows that one only has so much to spread around and when a mother is spread this thin she is left exhausted both physically and emotionally and has nothing left to give her relationship with her loser husband is just awful too who has that many children with a womanizing drunkard and then she meets another man but he turns out to be just as bad gambling drunk so she goes back to her loser husband because he is the father of her children talk about not empowering women in the slightest overall a depressing read from start to finish with no redeemable qualities this was my first time reading an oprah book club book and i must say it makes me leery to read more of them one of the worst books i have read in my book club so far","2403":"i don't know i admit i could not finish this book somehow i ended up with the oprah 2 0 digital edition and that's what ruined it for me apparently oprah pre highlighted passages and added notes like i care nothing against oprah i've read several of her book club books but damn i want to experience the story for myself not through her mind","2404":"this book reads as if one were standing in a cool smooth stream the prose slips through one's fingers like grains of sand a very pleasant surprise indeed loved it","2405":"as many reviewers have noted this book is not novel like the chapters are related in that each one is about hattie and or her child ren but they do not really tell a story of the family it is much more like related short stories and the characters and their relationships are never really developed","2406":" an variety of stories about the members of hattie shepard's troubled family each chapter is about an individual and a moment in their life illustrating their turmoil so much so that i felt each chapter started on the premise what's wrong with this person some of the stories were fantastic others droll but not one of them was terribly encouraging the things these people get themselves into there are even a few stories from a first person perspective for which the audio used other narrators and it worked brilliantly just to throw off the reader in all there were parts that were beautiful and moving and parts that were stale and needlessly rough i think everyone can find a story in here that they like but i don't think hardly anyone is going to like it all it fails as a novel because it lacks that beginning middle and end and i don't think it quite works as a collection of short stories because they are all so similar still there are some amazing moments just don't expect to smile a lot","2407":"i liked this book although at times it felt like a bunch of half written stories just as i'd be intrigued by a character their chapter was over i also wish that there had been more connections between the characters in the chapters but can also appreciate how hattie was the focus","2408":"reads like short stories great characterization","2409":"ayana mathis has managed to write a stirring debut novel about souls a deep raw openly honest look into the complexities of family life the book is written with tremendous depth requiring readers to grasp at their empathy for characters that are filled with frailties hattie is a woman who once had dreams who migrates north for a promise of freedom a woman who bears 11 children but isn't immediately known as a good mother hattie believes that love is in the raising her devotion evident in her ability to stay married to an imperfect man for decades while every once in a while glancing out an open window wondering about life and asking why her family struggles throughout the book with the definition of freedom in very human terms mathis writes about the effect of racism on this very american family and its efforts at survival it is a story filled with such humanity that race is never the main issue rather the very soul of her characters is the focal point there are reflections of hope the angst of despair and complications of faith but mostly it is about how a family functions while surrounded by an unfair world","2410":"this book was just okay can't say that i really enjoyed it","2411":" this book is entirely worth of all the good press it has been getting it is so interesting how hattie's charactered is rendered out through the varying perspectives of her offspring over different time periods of their family sometimes through the aching of present absence and other times through memories of time go by though the reader only spends a chapter centered on a character they are all fully drawn and it's neat to get hints of the outward way they're viewed by others compared to the inner way we learn they view themselves","2412":"just an ok book shades of the help and the warmth of other suns the book details a young hattie who will raise 9 children as she tries to make her way though a very difficult and white world the story is told through 12 different family threads some are better than others","2413":" it took me a while to get used to the structure of the book it begins in 1925 with the deaths of hattie's first two children twins philadelphia and jubilee in this chapter we also learn that teen aged hattie arrived in philadelphia from georgia with her mother and sisters just a few years before the births of these children the passage illustrating her first impression of philadelphia is powerful you can imagine the difference between philadelphia and georgia and it's easy to see why hattie says i'll never go back never but from 1925 the book skips ahead to 1948 and tells the story of one of hattie's sons floyd so there is nothing about the years immediately after the twins' deaths or about the other children's births or childhood from there we read stories of her other children most of them grown some are heartbreaking hattie appears in many of these stories she is the only constant in the book hattie may have escaped a poor life in georgia but her life in philadelphia is a struggle too","2414":"i was expecting this to be about the great migration but that event was quite secondary to the story which is all about hattie and her family","2415":" this was a tough book to rate i felt the writing was excellent the book flowed well but i also felt a something lacking in the character development each child has a chapter devoted to it but that's pretty much the only time you hear about the character they are pretty much abandoned after that there's a lack of how the characters interact throughout their lives why they developed into the person they are etc it's pretty clear that hattie's parenting style affected each of the children but there's no exploration of why each child coped with that differently it's not a pretty feel good book it's raw disturbing and definitely leaves you with a lot to think about which i'm sure was the author's intention","2416":"this book was an amazing chronicle of motherhood i started crying in the first chapter and the rest just grabbed my heart and didn't let go outstanding storytelling and heartbreaking writing definitely one i'd recommend","2417":"as individual stories each chapter of this book is well told the characters are well rounded and the plot lines for each of them is engaging that being said i didn't feel like this novel had much cohesiveness there really isn't an over arching storyline that pulls them all together yes they have hattie as a common factor but i didn't feel like it was enough to pull them all together perhaps that was the point maybe it's meant to emphasize the disjointed family life they all shared if that was the intent ayana mathis nailed it it didn't win me over though i think i would have enjoyed this more if it had been marketed as a short story collection i went into it expecting a novel but feel like it came up short in that regard","2418":" i love great writing and ayana mathis is good at it her descriptions make the reader feel the grunge of the places and most of the places are pretty grungy and the hopelessness of the characters that's a problem everything is hopeless nobody is happy in this novel even though the writing is beautiful the characters' lives and situations were so bleak i was getting depressed reading this i try to read a lot of literary fiction especially the award winners yet most literary novels seem so gloomy and hopeless can't something be an award winner and have a glimmer of hope in them","2419":"i listened to this an audio book and didn't love it i'm not even sure what the story was about totally obviously it was about hattie and her family but it jumped from family member to family member and didn't talk about every child only some of them","2420":"this was a confusing book each chapter is devoted to one of hattie's children and then we never hear about them again a bit frustrating","2421":"excellent storyteller amazing for a first book","2422":"i was disappointed by this book because you only get a small snippet of each character's life and then there is almost no mention of them again throughout the rest of the book hattie is the only constant and yes she was a brave woman dealing with poverty and a wandering husband but i would have loved to have even more insight in her life rather than through her children","2423":"loved interesting characters and wonderful writing style i have always wondered about moms with so many children this gives perspective on a not so happy mom and the legacy she gives her children","2424":"more a collection of interconnected short stories than a complete novel but still very entertaining an impressive variety of styles and voices each reflecting one or two of hattie's children and one grandchild few of the characters are very sympathetic but their stories are still compelling","2425":"each chapter child could have a book of their own","2426":"mathis paints vivid pictures but the separate stories are a little disjointed and it is sometimes hard to follow or remember who the characters are some very poignant moments scattered throughout the book make it definitely worth the read","2427":" mathis is a beautiful writer he descriptions are exceptional especially digging into the human brain and how people rationalize their own actions that said this book did nothing but make me sad each chapter was written about one or two of hattie's children and sometimes the author would switch from third person to first person which i am not a fan of it makes it hard for the story to develop a flow it really was more of a collection of short stories i found the characters to be unsympathetic and one dimensional i now need to go read something happy to wash the taste of this depressing book out of my mouth","2428":"a compelling and emotionally powerful story of a family and a woman told through the separate but linked stories of her children read my full review at http bookbybook blogspot com 2014 1","2429":" in 1923 hattie moves to philadelphia in hopes for a brighter future and falls in love with a man sure to suck all the energy from her her life break her heart and ruin what possibilities she had before her not the newest story in the book but that doesn't take away any of the heartbreaking stories involving hattie her children her grandchildren her husband is pretty much everything a husband shouldn't be he's a womanizer a drunk he spends money she needs to feed the children on booze or women or some other entertainment for himself her first two children twins don't make it because she doesn't know what's available or else she can't afford it because her husband used the money on something else the fact that her husband has ruined her life her children's lives seems to be the only storyline that carries over from chapter to chapter otherwise they are separate vignettes on the oprah book club 2 0 edition kindle did i mind that oprah highlighted certain sections not at all did i mind that oprah added her own comments about those sections not at all sometimes it added something did i mind that had i wanted to highlight those same sections for my own clippings that i apparently can't yes","2430":" the book opens with a heart rendering tragedy which quickly captures the reader's interest the great migration the early 1900's and a mother with her three daughters move to philadelphia to escape the jim crow south things do not work out as planned hattie has a hard life but does manage to keep nine children alive with very little help hattie is a formidable character she has a strength and resiliencythat keeps her going but this does not mean she does not carry hurts and scars the structure of this novel was a bit difficult for me to get used to at first it is divided and narrated in chapters by some of her children her husband and hattie herself the ones narrated by hattie were my favorite this novel follows hattie and her children for over a decade and by the end of the book i really felt for hattie and love the fact that even at the end of the book she never gives up hope a well written first novel told in very matter of fact prose in somewhat of a different narrative style well worth reading","2431":"first line \"philadelphia and jubilee \" august said when hattie told him what she wanted to name their twins \"you cain't give them babies no crazy names like that \"tth tells the story of hattie a young black woman who moves with her mother and sisters from georgia to philadelphia in the early 1920s part of the great migration trying to escape the flagrant racism of the south and find a better life in the \"new jerusalem\" of the north each chapter deals with a different child or children of hattie and their personal struggle to find their place in a world that doesn't care about them in the opening chapter hattie is a child bride trying to save her sick babies their deaths change hattie they harden her and their absence is felt in all of the other chapters the final chapter or 12th tribe is hattie's granddaughter that comes to live with her because her mother is mentally ill by this time hattie is an old woman but she hasn't softened and her children are still fighting against the force of her will i didn't love this book it was very bleak i don't know that anyone in the book was happy life was hard for the characters and they often make bad choices in a bad situation it's grim and gritty and real one daughter gives up on herself and life and basically allows herself to wallow in poverty and waste away from tuberculosis in an apartment that sounds only a little better than a flop house where the only piece of furniture is a bed the way the book is structured the reader sees just a slice of each child's life before switching to another one it makes it hard to engage with any one character hattie is a constant but she is a difficult presence but mathis's writing is strong and when i found my interest waning the writing was able to pull me back in it wasn't a matter of something happening there would be a turn of phrase or an image that popped for me and i was back one thing that surprised me is how little of an impact the civil rights movement makes on the novel it is almost a footnote some quotes \"there are a lot of bars more than i would have imagined open at eight o'clock in the morning i went to a few and felt like i was stepping into all of the sadness in the world \" \"there were so many other things that she wanted to say but she only had a chalkboard and she lacked courage \"","2432":"it was well written but i couldn't connect with it each chapter was designated to a new character and didn't continue thru the book","2433":"exciting new writer excellent book must get her to the center for fiction","2434":"excellent writing very interesting book each chapter is one of hattie's children so beautifully written i was taken away i hope this author writes a book about each child as i would love to get to know each one more deeply really good escape book don't have distractions while reading just let it work it's magic","2435":"well written but overall sad and depressing more like short stories since each chapter was about one of the children and there was not enough connections between them","2436":"started well but started to bore me about 75% through","2437":"it was not the best as i lost interest in it after awhile","2438":"the first chapter of this book really grabbed me and then it fizzled from there i did not enjoy the structure of the novel at all and found myself trying to sift through all the characters this could be in part to my brief reading sessions due to my kiddos but in the end i really just think this novel wasn't my thing","2439":"would have liked to see the characters come together more it is well told and well read on audible but it just never grabbed me into the story because of the introduction on new people each chapter","2440":"i wanted to but i just didn't like it i didn't like the format nor half the characters","2441":"this book was a definite page turner tragic and dramatic but i couldn't put it down hattie and august move to philadelphia to escape the inequalities of georgia in hopes of a better life many tragedies befall this family and hattie was only a child of 17 when she arrives in philadelphia and she was not equipped to be a nurturing mother and of course the hardships of life took their toll as all responsibilites fell on hattie with the hardships not allowing august to be a good support to hattie or the children the book outlines the lives of her 11 children with each chapter bearing the names of her children the author weaves the story beautifully and though hattie is not a gentle nurturer she raises her children in a way to prepare them for a world that has been difficult for her to weather with the tools she was provided with herself and the children become emotionally bruised and lacking we can hope that time softens hattie's resolve and allows her to forgive the turn of events in her life and allow her to learn to love fully with emotion and give hope to the future generations of this family it was a rough ride through these pages but i enjoyed the journey","2442":"more a series of short stories than a novel hattie is an entertaining diversion each of her children's stories sheds a little more light on hattie's complexity yet focuses more on the impact on the children overall a nicely written and interesting book that was a very quick read","2443":"just a total downer which is something coming from me with no real point i never felt compelled to care about hattie chronicle of miseries that i just couldn't connect with","2444":"i live the idea of the book but it was such a sad story how we can be so busy surviving we forget to live","2445":" i liked this book this book is a story of over coming it is about overcoming poverty jim crow substance abuse mental illness and organized religion true overcoming leads to a place where even very late in the game the pieces of the puzzle come together to allow a glimpse of a big picture the big picture is love and kindness is always the solution that big picture comes clear for hattie in her 70's in the last 2 pages of the book but it does come clear i would have like the author to show us more of the process in hattie's mind that that finally gets her to that resolution but the oblique and confusing trek is worth the hike","2446":" this was beautifully written but difficult to read because of its organization it tells the story of a poor black woman who gave birth to 11 children although she tells a little bit of her own story it is mostly told in a disjointed way by her very dysfunctional children so each child has his own chapter then seems to leave the story just as you are getting interested and start to care about that character they are gone and you've moved on to someone else i feel like almost every one of the chapters could be turned into a full length novel and that may be the plan i also did not find hattie as cold as the story seemed to say she was very warm and loving with her babies and very loyal and caring about her children's welfare love can be shown in many ways","2447":"this book kept me wanting to know these chracters and how they wound end up great read","2448":"i didn't expect to like this book but ended up enjoying it tremendously i mostly listened to the audio version and found the voice work excellent i liked the way mathis developed the characters and also allowed the reader to learn about hattie through her children's stories","2449":" enjoyed the book enough but it had no momentum since each chapter was devoted to only 1 2 characters i was left feeling as if i only had part of the story and wanted to learn more about each of hattie's children overall this is an exploration of the often tragic impacts of being raised without tenderness the children are emotionally abandoned by their overwhelmed and also damaged mother hattie who tends to their physical needs but is unable or unwilling to tend to their spirits few excerpts i liked it seemed to him that every time he made one choice in his life he said no to another what if hattie couldn't love any more children maybe we only have a finite amount of love to give we're born with our portion and if we love and are not loved enough in return it's depleted lawrence had not loved enough he had refused to use his allotment and now it was spilling over pressing at the borders of him from franklins chapter one of the two most affecting chapters of the book he is on a beach in vietnam and is dealing with the new knowledge that he has a baby girl back home he wants to be a better man but is afraid and ultimately determines his daughter is better off without him incredibly sad the things you try to hide come out when you least expect them to some women get in your soul i have looked at my father many times and wondered how he could stand knowing he was my mother's ruin in my hours on this beach i have been so close to death that i am almost my own ghost the most powerful and disturbing chapter is about belle belle is very scarred by her distant mother and the memory of her mother leaving her when she left the family briefly for another man she is almost literally starving for love being abandoned by her mother left a fatal wound on her soul belle lost the ability to love herself after an episode in which she seduced hattie's former lover belle is in a very dark place few excerpts from belle's chaptershe belle had never been afraid of anyone the way she was afraid of her mother she had never been so angry with anyone and never wanted anyone to lover her as much as she wanted hattie's love maybe mother didn't know she was supposed to love from hattie herself i never did know what to do about my children's spirits i didn't know how to help anyone in that way hattie of course i'm angry i probably always will be but i've been mad all my life and i finally figured out that i couldn't keep carrying that with me its too heavy and i'm too tired maybe it was her cowardice as much as her betrayal that hattie could not forgive cassies chapter from hattie thinking of her children they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the would not be kind","2450":"engaging on a deeply emotional level mathis takes us to places and people most of us never visit yet there is truth here one should examine among the tribes of humans certainly among hattie's tribes many of us have blemished stories with messy endings and uncertain merit it may be difficult to find beauty in a life of feeble attempts and failures but effort and intention are still worthy attributes mathis demonstrates we can have compassion for those who choose poorly and suffer almost needlessly circumstances and environment do matter could i have done better perhaps perhaps not","2451":"not my favorite book but the different character perspectives was interesting","2452":"telling everyone to read this book the chapter structure was atypical for sure but not off putting to me i'm a big believer that people are very much a product of their environment and that belief really resonated to me in this book people are who they are for a lot of reasons but a lot has to do with who their people are and how they were raised and you could see hattie in each chapter compelling stuff","2453":"hattie isn't a warm caring person she isn't necessarily kind to her children she isn't kind to her husband she is more focused on surviving than thriving and hopes she teaches her children how to survive in a very unfriendly world told in a series of stories that feature hattie's children and one grandchild the reader understands how hattie's aloofness affected her family and their futures beautifully written ayana mathis is a strong voice and i look forward to reading more of her work","2454":"very easy read it caught my attention in the first chapter there was only one chapter that i didn't like i'm not sure what it was about that chapter i'll try to read it again overall it was a great book","2455":"it was a bit depressing every single character had mental health issues still an interesting read but could've used a bit more positivity","2456":"a great work by another graduate of the iowa writer's workshop","2457":"i loved this book it took me a while to get into the flow of it and to figure out that each chapter was one of the children but i thoroughly enjoyed it beautifully written","2458":"this was a good book about hattie and her children i found the first part of the book more interesting than the last part hattie is a high yella black woman who gets married very young and lives a poverty stricken life her hopelessness over her condition effects the kind of mother that she becomes it was a little too depressing but very realistic","2459":" the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis is one of those novels that you have to read once you begin the story because it definitely hits on a reader's sense of what happens next in the lives of the characters ayana mathis is definitely a superb author and story teller even though hattie and her family rank very high on the dysfunctional scale as a unit and as individuals mathis weaves a reader in and out of different eras of the events and responses within the family that makes their abstract interactions and thinking understandable to the reader there is no happy ending to this story and that is not surprising nor does mathis ever lead anyone to believe that there would be i like that aspect of this novel because it is in line with how things flow in life it was definitely an intriguing read i am still digesting all that took place within hattie's family life and the life of her children if mathis was not such a superb storyteller this would be a novel that would not hold my attention as a reader due to the high levels of dysfunctional actions on the part of numerous characters she has created a believable sense of balance that makes even the most painful moments acceptable because there are responses that we as humans often use in our daily interactions","2460":"i did not enjoy this book at all it is well written but there was not one likable character in it the disjointed chapters did not help it made the connection between the characters very tenuous i know it's an oprah 2 0 book and getting a lot of attention but it sure didn't live up to the hype","2461":" beautiful prose striking characters emotionally resonant but don't expect a novel it's a collection of linked stories gorgeous stories but linked stories we see different eras and pov's from titular hattie in the 1920's a story that actually made me cry to her granddaughter sala decades later while each examines family all the while retaining distinct voices hattie is consistently a presence the seed from which the other stories grow but other characters enter and disappear forcing the reader to inagine their future s a compelling debut","2462":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was interesting to have each of her children revealed one chapter at a time hattie seemed so busy taking care of her home trying to keep her family together with little money and with little help from her husband that she was unable to show much love to her children perhaps the loss of her first two children as a seventeen year old first time mother caused her to distance herself from the others she was a strong woman who may have shown her love by always being there for them when they ne it was interesting to have each of her children revealed one chapter at a time hattie seemed so busy taking care of her home trying to keep her family together with little money and with little help from her husband that she was unable to show much love to her children perhaps the loss of her first two children as a seventeen year old first time mother caused her to distance herself from the others she was a strong woman who may have shown her love by always being there for them when they needed her upon finishing the book i had hopes for her her children and grandchild more","2463":"wow a very moving collection of peeks into the lives of the children of one strong georgian black woman the only complaint is that once you become emotionally invested in one character you have to move along to the next and you really do become invested i don't normally like anthology style writing but this one took me completely by suprise a warning to potential readers is that it covers some mature themes and at times it can be quite harrowing two particular chapters quite literally had me in tears but the emotional scope this author covers is quite stunning and this alone merits these 5 stars","2464":"when oprah says jump i ask how high but i just couldn't find the magic in this book","2465":"the way history should be taught people and their lives","2466":"a little slow at times but enjoyable","2467":"very good for a first published novelist reminded me of a more modern day roots","2468":" what happens to a 15 year old girl who runs away from georgia to philadelphia and gets married in the early 1920's we all know that she is probably doomed to a lifetime of childbearing and subservience especially if her choice of husbands wasn't good the twelve tribes tells the saga of one such girl and what happens to her family mainly because of her determination to give them a better life i can't believe this is a first novel as the author weaves a wonderful uplifting tale recommended reading","2469":"possibly the most emotion provoking novel i have ever read cried and gasped after every single chapter not for the saps beautiful stories of love and loss family and childhood past and present and one woman's journey to come to terms with love simply fantastic","2470":"not my favorite by a long shot this novel is a series of vignettes about hattie's twelve children so it reads more like an anthology of short stories than a novel the stories don't build upon each other to create any sort of unifying plot each story is terribly sad they were well written but i still wouldn't recommend this to a friend","2471":"perfect companion read to the warmth of other suns","2472":"i'm not really sure what to say about this book i enjoyed it and felt myself draw more and more to hattie with each passing chapter the pain hattie survived finally enabled her to see that love may be part of the answer to disrupting the cycle of her families dysfunctional lives","2473":"this book disappoints each chapter is a story of one of hattie shephards children hattie marries at 15 her husband august loves her and their many children however he is not the strong provider she wants him to be there is some really wonderful writing in this book poignant and unforgettable moments they seem to be strung together too loosely and the story fails to move hattie is harsh and cold not determined or strong love enters much too late","2474":"i did enjoy this book initially i was not sure as it took me awhile to get into it i put it down for a few days and started it again as i don't think i was in the right frame of mind to read it i am glad i did as i loved it it was emotional in places but a good book to read","2475":"what a great read this man's story is almost unbelievable how he survived being a slave after being born free is a miracle it is very sad that it took almost 12 years to find the right white man to trust with his secret","2476":"this was extremely well written but i found it to be disjointed i have a copy to loan out to anyone interested","2477":"for me this book didn't live up to the hype i was expecting a phenomenal toni morrison type book and the first two chapters were but then the book lost steam the character vignettes were disjointed and i never really experience the story of the family as a whole","2478":" oprah is back with the 2 0 version of her book club i read many selections from her 1 0 version and found so many of the books to be sorrowful tales of people mostly women in bad situations the twelve tribes of hattie is more of the same the writing is beautiful but the chapters each one the story of one of hattie's children read more like a series of short stories with the common thread of their mother hattie hattie grieved the loss of her first babies twins so much that she couldn't give her later children the love they needed such a sad life for them all","2479":" i picked up the kindle version of this book and was instantly taken in by the story of hattie and her babies however when the story changed to what seemed like short stories of the children's lives i wasn't so impressed maybe this is how the author planned the book each of the chapters is set many years from the previous so the novel as a whole spans hattie's lifetime from having her first born children through to her granddaughter at the end i persevered till the end and i did enjoy the chapters but i found the ending a little disappointing after wondering how it was going to finish when i read the final line and realised that it was over i was kind of like wow what was that all about really i'm not sure i'd recommend this novel unless you're looking for something to spend the time of day","2480":"oprah downer book never reached the potential it could have not my cup of tea but not unreadable","2481":"interesting stories but not very artistically written lots of cliches the stories reminded me of the warmth of other suns which was a non fiction and therefore more intriguing to me personally","2482":"this story resonates within the core of family values more so in ways of the thread of african american families who have been through struggle this book opened me to the core so much so that i was able to realize that the story of ones suffering goes through generations and if we aren't mindful they shall continue in abundance through different struggles","2483":"not sure what the hype is with this book horrible depressing characters that you cannot bond with not sure if this is so popular since it was an oprah selection but i remember giving up on those books since they all seemed like a lifetime network made for tv movie","2484":" i really enjoyed this book when i wasn't reading it i was thinking about it the sign of a great book to me the book is about hattie and her 11 kids and 1 granddaughter 12 we don't hear about all her kids just the damaged ones it seems each chapter was about one of her kids and sometimes the stories seemed separate from each other but i think the author was trusting the reader to fill in the blanks the only tie the chapters had was hattie their mother hattie was a strong efficient woman that was hurt badly early on by both august her husband and by the death of her twins she had trouble showing her feelings to her kids her love was shown by doing not touching this is the fault that is consistently expressed by her family i really felt for hattie she had a hard path but followed it to the best of her ability this book is a great book to discuss","2485":" i find myself feeling disdainful of books oprah has picked and that's not fair because when i read wild and edgar sawtelle before oprah picked them i really liked them i'm being hypocritical to snub a book because oprah picked it but i sometimes get this way because too many of her choices are depressing downtrodden stories this explains why it took me nearly 1 3 of the way into this book before i started to warm up to the story and then i found myself thinking wow this is an incredible character study of a dozen people thus the four star rating if i were still teaching creative writing i would use this book to teach characterization each chapter is a vignette short story of one of hattie's children they are spotlighted for one chapter and then most of them disappear never to be seen or heard from again unless in brief passing as a side note to a sibling's story these chapters represent what is best in character study and the author's prose is beautiful it's too easy to fault hattie for her children's lives most of them are crazy violent or sad messes and this is my one condemnation of the book the author falls into the trap of african americans are poor and can't have a decent life and don't know how to parent and the men are all cheating philanderers who gamble away the family's money etc i've read many stories with these themes and i guess i'm tired of reading it still yes the book is a period piece so these themes fit the time period 1920s 1980s i guess but this aspect of the book still irritated me however when i step back and get off my soapbox i appreciate what the author has done and the format she used to tell this story adds dimension to what is really a simple plot but a plot that we can continue to wrestle with daily are we the product of our upbringing and can we fault our parents for our failings faults or are we responsible for who we are and what we choose to do and do we ever recognize our parents as people other than merely caricatures of a mom and dad stereotype this is a great debut novel i look forward to seeing what the author offers for her sophomore follow up","2486":"so depressing and uplifting at the same time i'm not sure how she pulled that off loved it especially the way it was written almost a separate short story for each chapter i'll be thinking about these people for a while","2487":"i found this book somewhat boring and depressing the family is disfunctional and i found no redeeming value in any of the characters i am probably a lone sole in this review as this book was listed as a book club recommendation","2488":"excellent excellent excellent heartbreaking and stunning i closed the book and wanted to start all over again at the beginning with echoes of toni morrison and the poisonwood bible but so entirely unique can't bear to put this one on the donation pile highly recommended","2489":"this book was an easy read that i was able to finish in about two days mathis's writing style is fluid and it's easy to get caught up in the lives of the characters which i like i really began to visualize them and see how they moved through space makes me think this has potential to be a good film one of the things i didn't like much bout the book is that the characters didn't have consistent connections throughout this seems to be strategic particularly to simultaneously highlight each child's story while keeping hattie as the prevailing theme however doing so it's hard to remember that these chapters aren't simply about individuals who happen to face challenges they're about a family whose life outcomes were affected by decisions at every turn the way it's written you don't seem much of how the relationships develop among them so the chapters read like vignettes or short stories and i wasn't expecting that even with that criticism i still think it's worth the read","2490":"tough read at times due to the subject material but well written and compelling some stories more than others there seems to be a trend of books of short stories which are really all about one character this book plus this is how you lose her plus olive kitteridge or maybe it's just my particular taste in books","2491":"there is some good writing that i admired in this novel but i never could bring myself to care about the characters perhaps the structure of the novel skipping from time period to time period and leaving huge gaps in between worked against it in that respect","2492":"when hattie is 15 she travels with her mother and sister from georgia to philadelphia seeking a freedom impossible for blacks in the south her expectations are high it seems that anything is possible soon she marries and has twins whom she names philadelphia and jubilee names of promise and of hope reaching forward names but the twins become sick and die of pneumonia in infancy a trauma from which hattie and her husband august never recover they have nine more children but as parents they are wounded and so are their children this is the promising start of the novel the book then goes on to cover crucial events in the lives of each family member we see how they are all impacted by the past we watch as the children replay the failings of their parents chapters read like a collection of slightly connected short stories i would have enjoyed more linkage between the chapters as i read there were too many traumas too many sad lives too many shiftless men a few of the characters were interesting enough that i'd've enjoyed a novel entirely about them other characters were totally forgettable so i must conclude that the novel was unsatisfying a promising start interesting format but then disappointment and something must be said about the ending but what the ending was perhaps in line with hattie's character and life but it left me wistful couldn't there have been a glimmer of hope that things would get better i was close to giving this 4 stars as the book is certainly well written and engaging but no too dismal 3 1 2 maybe","2493":"it was an interesting read can't really recommend but can't say it was totally bad some powerful scenes but kind of strange too left with more questions than answers but maybe that's good our book club had wonderful discussions though about relationships parent child brother sister lovers so i guess i could recommend for book club reading","2494":" full disclosure i don't buy into the oprah book club phenomenon i don't think i'm jumping on the bandwagon with this one unfortunately each chapter was dedicated to one of hattie's children so we never had a sense of anything being finished sometimes you'd catch a glimpse of the other children in the background of other chapters but that was it we learn about hattie through her children so at least to me it's very much an unreliable narrator the writing was fantastic but i can't help but feel cheated out of a full novel instead of just a series of short stories 2 5 stars","2495":"i'll give it a 2 5 this book didn't really capture my attention each chapter is devoted to a snapshot in the life of one of hattie's children some stories are interesting but most aren't they are all sad and somewhat boring the author is a wonderful writer but this book just missed the mark for me","2496":"really good read","2497":"i should stop trusting oprah's recommendations i have yet to read one that i love this was an ok read not great at all","2498":"eh i wouldn't recommend it frankly it was basically 12 very sad short stories there wasn't a happy one in the bunch they were each hattie's children but it was a very disconnected family and a very disconnected narrative i just didn't care for it at all","2499":"i liked this ok although i don't know how the different stories of the children really tied together i didn't finish the last couple of chapters and wish that the story would've been a little more unified","2500":"loved the beginning the end was ok","2501":"it was very good would definitely recommend","2502":"did not intrigue nor inspire me was mediocre at best too much media hype","2503":"don't know how to rate this one i wish the characters were more developed and you knew more of what happened to them maybe 2 5 stars","2504":"twelve tribes of hattie is not a novel nor is it even a short story the book has no structure and no character development what is this writing a school exercise","2505":"i loved this book very unique way to tell the story of a woman through her children's experiences","2506":"the prose is evocative and there are moments of wonderful emotional insight but the stories felt predictable in their ostensibly surprising twists the book shines at the moments when it would seem to be the most mundane","2507":"fascinating brutal sad stories loved the writing and insight into each character but i wish that the characters were more intertwined and more connected sometimes one or two of the siblings would pop back into the story of another but it felt very unsatisfying maybe that's what hattie's family were like many but distant with each one having a separate and removed relationship with their mother who silently dominated them all but who in the end we don't know much about","2508":"i loved this book it's heartbreaking in places but the writing is so vivid","2509":"i loved this story it is brilliantly written","2510":" the latest oprah 2 0 book is a novel in stories about a woman who migrated to philadelphia from george in 1923 the first story tells of the death of hattie's twin infants from pneumonia that their deaths were essentially caused by poverty sets up hattie for a life of bitterness and anger about the failed promise of the north each subsequent story depicts one of hattie's other children and the different ways they cope with life's struggles and with their difficult parents the book was an uneven reading experience for me i do have trouble with this kind of structure since the lack of a linear narrative makes it hard for me to remember things a few of the stories were compelling but overall there was so much misery that it started to read like a parody of an oprah book","2511":"hard to follow and not interesting to me i didn't finish the whole book","2512":"this is very much a book of short stories linked by hattie whose character evolves during snapshots of each of her children over a span of many years it was very effective but i felt somewhat unsatisfied wanting to know more about the rest of the story for these children","2513":"very good book i recommend to all","2514":"enjoyed the different points of view quick entertaining read it makes you see the best and worst in people and maybe yourself","2515":"i liked this book typical oprah fashion honestly though i would have preferred more hattie and less of her kids i understand the point was to get to know hattie through her children and their lives and her interaction with them however i felt i would have enjoyed the book more if i had spent more time with hattie herself","2516":"though i agree with many others that the fast ride from one character to another and their subsequent disappearance from the narrative is a bit disjointing this story still remains anchored by one person hattie of course she is a formidable woman a strong character who keeps the novel grounded and reflects the movement of the plot in a way the tales of her children do not i found this book to be quite beautiful and tragic reminiscent of toni morrison my favorite author","2517":"i felt like i was supposed to love this book it being an oprah choice and a friend whose recommendations i normally trust having praised it highly what a downer hattie loses her first born twins to pneumonia and is in a disappointing marriage hardly the first or last person in the world to have those things happen but through the stories of her nine subsequent children and a grandchild we find she never really rises above those circumstances her children call her the general and try to keep out of her way daughters can't remember ever having been praised or feeling loved or even being smiled at no wonder all of them wind up dysfunctional to some degree or other including full blown suicidality and madness the only time hattie displays any joy for life is in the arms of another man but even turns her back on that all those children seem to just happen to her as if she wasn't in some way involved and then she resents having to care for them she is a thoroughly unsympathetic character things are tough all over i just got impatient with her","2518":"i really liked the first 3 4 of the book i didn't like the last few stories","2519":"so i liked this book it really is a collection of 12 short stories that are tied together by the fact that hattie is the mother of each protagonist i actually started to like it more as i wrote the review available 11 5 5pm http bookedupandbossy blogspot com","2520":"these characters are still with me months after having read this book a tour de force","2521":"i thought the writing was good and i enjoyed each story about the different children however it felt more like a bunch of short stories where the only connection was the relation to hattie who generally did not play a big role in many of the stories i felt myself wondering what happened to the main characters of the early stories especially six and floyd there are minor mentions of some of the characters in different chapters but not enough to really satisfy the desire to know more about them it didn't seem like there really was an ending the last chapter was just about the last child that hadn't had a chapter yet so in the end although i did like the stories i felt the book as a whole was dissatisfying","2522":"this book exhausted me","2523":"or why birth control is a good thing dark interesting stories with very strong voice overall depressing though","2524":" a powerful story that leaves us imagining the lives of hattie and their subsequent tribes i got a deeper sense of what my grandmother must have went through and thought about during the rearing of her own 14 tribes it still tells the story of you do the best you can with what you know how in a different light with the moving to the north hattie had wanted better for her children as her mother before her and so on it is excellently written and an easy read for those who wish to think as we'll as read","2525":"depressing and ultimately unsatisfying but very well written and interesting","2526":" this book could have been so much better her writing is poignant and beautiful but the structure of the book left the reading hanging in so many ways first i thought the twelve tribes were hattie's kids a chapter for each one not all twelve were included i don't think and the ones who had a chapter had such blurry development reading about them was like looking through very strong prescription glasses they never quite came into focus too many details were left unexplained the real story was about hattie and i would have liked this book better if the author had been true to that end the kids could have been included but not with a chapter for each","2527":"i really really enjoyed this book about a large african american family in philadelphia in the early part of the 20th century whose lives all intertwine but mostly circle around the strong mother figure hattie recommended","2528":"i really have to stop reading recommendations by oprah this book gets you interested in life of hattie and her children but leaves you wanting to know more about all of them would have been nice to have had more written about each of the characters","2529":"a beautiful and harrowing story the vivid lyrical prose and the intensely real characters made it an impressive novel and an interesting sketch of the great migration of the 20th century","2530":"there were parts of this book i really liked but overall was kind of disappointed how can every member of the family be so messed up i kept waiting for a happier chapter i also wanted the stories to tie together but they didn't really meh","2531":"i just could not get into this book since it was an oprah's book club choice i should have known better definitely was mumbling to myself after the first 50 pages so i ditched it","2532":"excellent read if you are part of a big family you will absolutely 'get' that your family can see you as one person yet you can be a complete other out 'in the world a few very well timed twists really give pause highly recommend","2533":"would have liked this better if there was more cohesion between the chapters and characters with that many people it could have been an epic saga type of book instead it leaves you wondering about how all their lives came to be the way they were portrayed in short chapters lovely writing many very heart wrenching scenarios just wanted there to be more","2534":"at first i was put off that the reader does not find out what comes of each of the children after their respective chapters after a while however i saw each as a vignette that illuminated hattie's life and the choices she made interesting read","2535":"i wanted to like this book more than i did the author has an enjoyable writing style but it took me almost a year to finish reading this book a testament to the fact that i just couldn't enjoy it","2536":"it kept my interest was an easy read gave a fascinating look at the jim crow south and north my only complaint is that you never find out what happens to the kids aside from the chapter about them and every one of them seems to end up with an unhappy life except for billups","2537":"not sure why this got the rave reviews that it did maybe i was missing the point i think i wanted more from each character then the author gave me","2538":"i really lovedeach chapter which was a chapter on each kid i was sooo into it but then it doesn't all tie up we don't really know what happens i really loved[?]each chapter which was a chapter on each kid i was sooo into it but then it doesn't all tie up we don't really know what happens more","2539":"powerful first novel i couldn't put down","2540":"i can't say anything that hasn't already been said about this one just read it","2541":"what a somber troubling book","2542":"this book starts out sad and that sets the tone for the rest of the novel just sad sad sad","2543":"this was just an unpleasant book from cover to cover it starts on a very sad note and then never comes back up again i keep hoping that something good would happen or that someone would rise above their circumstances there were definitely glimmers of humanity and kindness among the avalanche of life destroying activities but it wasn't enough if you like to read about people that feel terrible about themselves and then live down to it this is the book for you","2544":"this book broke my heart beautifully written but every chapter was a burden","2545":" i wanted to like this book so much more than i did i'm not sure if it was the short story ness of it not my preferred style of writing or the dysfunctional family drawing away from the themes i thought i was going to see the book is written in 12 short stories of hattie's children with the underlying themes of motherhood and family bringing it back to one overarching story some of the stories were great it started out as a maybe 5 star read for me i loved floyd ruthie and ella's stories but perhaps i loved these stories because they had the most parallels and relations to hattie's original life i kept wanting the characters to relate back to each other or for the ending to have some sort of well ending i was left unfinished and that frustrated me this was touted as oprah's book club 2 0 pick following themes of african american migration from leaving the south to find 'better' lives perhaps i'd find a study on family dynamics and survival throughout an era unfortunately i felt like it had 12 disjointed stories of suffering i understand that this entire era was generally depressing so it's already a topic that many people won't 'like' but i understand why the author portrayed this image and didn't stray away from it the writing itself was great i think it was also enhanced by a great audio although i don't know why there were 3 narrators on the audio her flow of consciousness and descriptions are fabulous and she does a great job setting and painting the scene ican definitely see why some people love this unfortunately all of this can't bring my star rating higher than a 3 there's too much going on not enough detail on each character and the unsettling finish of a book with no ending was just too much for me to handle","2546":"this debut work shows great promise the story was wrenching and often painful to read each chapter told the story of one of hattie's children i didn't mind that as a literary tool but it was a bit disjointed and hindered the character development","2547":"i loved this book when i first started reading it i thought i could not stand the sadness poverty and oppression that hattie lived with however this is a book about perseverance and although i would not say it was a joy to read it is worth reading however the book does end rather abruptly it is like the author got tired of writing and did not know how to wind down","2548":"loved how this book was written in each of the different children's perspective","2549":"the writing is good but i just didn't like reading a story about a woman and the failed lives of her children","2550":"i'll never forget hattie shepherd or her children when i started to come close to the end of this book i had to slow down i didn't want it to end how's that for a recommendation","2551":" many depressing moments many angry moments so much like real life and so it is not one of my favorite books not for lack of talent or great writing or story or depth or character development mathis is a great writer its just that for me it is not what i want for my relaxation time i guess i prefer fantasy and hope real life has already worn me out i want to escape from it when i read not get deeper into some of my own issues ugh but as a literary work this is awesome i think it would make a good movie and i must say that the end made me jump for joy","2552":"slow read by the time i got to the chapter about six the interest was gone finished the book because i thought it would get better never did","2553":"this book was a delight it is structured more like a collection of short stories that relate to hattie and her marriage to august or to one of her children the writing is wonderful and some of the stories really evoke very specific neighborhoods or a slice of afro american history given that this is a first novel i would expect the author will be able to soon produce a cohesive narrative with a traditional structure","2554":"i did enjoy this book however i felt as though there was so much development of the tribes and then the book just ended i felt there should have been more of an ending and was left wanting to read more","2555":"the twelve tribes of hattie is intense and riveting it invites you to sit down and rest awhile as author mathis weaves a story that captures the essence of one woman and family's migration that is all at once great celebratory and sad","2556":"i finished the twelve tribes of hattie and recommend it it is a beautifully written story of a young african american woman who is part of the great migration and moves to philadelphia from georgia the author did an excellent job creating a place and sense of despair that was unrelenting and felt authentic the characters were so well drawn i cared about each of them excellent read","2557":"i did enjoy the book but the way it switched to discuss the life of another child kind of threw me at first once i got that i was ok except i like conclusion maybe she can right a book about each character like what happened to floyd what became of rev six by the time it got to the story of the daughter and granddaughter i got disinterested for some reason but overall i really enjoyed i may go back a retread the last few chapters in case i missed something","2558":"does oprah ever pick a book that's not depressing or is it that my book club takes the depressing ones off her list i didn't hate this book but i confess that i didn't care about any of the characters i'm not sure why i would have it seemed like it was one series of bad life choices after another and not one of the children nor august nor even hattie deserved anything other than what they got i must have missed something","2559":"i applaud the efforts of the author it was a refreshing approach to storytelling some chapters were quite powerful and other chapters fell flat i wish she would have connected the characters more throughout or at the end of the book","2560":"excellent book the good thing about this book is that you do not have to reward the chapters in order i think everyone that reads this book can find a character that they can relate to","2561":"upon finishing this book i was so disappointed after reading the glowing reviews the book was beautifully written but the characters really were not fully developed some chapters were great and i wanted more this book was just so sad and desperate at the end i feel like i didn't know anything about hattie and i didn't care","2562":"i really enjoyed this book mathis does a great job of crafting a story that tells a great level of detail while still moving from person to person the only downside of this story is it is incomplete each character is interesting but a couple stuck with me in such a way i could have read an entire book about them floyd comes to mind","2563":"worth reading","2564":"wonderful story of the lives of a woman and her children it is the heartbreaking account of how their lives don't turn out the way they would have expected it reminds us that we all have struggles and that we can learn to accept them and move on or we can choose to die from them it made me want to hold on tightly to my children","2565":"very good book about a black family who each go different ways true to the times in the racism and thoughts of the characters","2566":"hattie shepherd a member of the great migration of southern blacks to northern locales has eleven children and each of their lives captured in their own chapter is sadder and more depressing than the previous one reminded me of olive kitteridge in that it is more a collection of short stories connected by the central character my next read will be the warmth of other suns which i hope will be more uplifting","2567":" i think this book was quite an accomplishment for a first novel the twelve tribes represent the eleven children and one grandchild of hattie each chapter is devoted to a child now adults with the exception of the first chapter or children in the case of the chapter \"alice and billups\" and spans the years 1925 to 1980 it's important to note the years in which each chapter takes place so you can be aware of the events of the time as well as the ages of the adult children hattie and her husband august some may argue that hattie did not love her children or was not demonstrative in showing love to her children i disagree think about a woman in this case hattie birthing 11 children from the time she was 17 until she was 46 keeping in mind the timeline of 1925 to 1954 nor was she a woman who was well provided for by her husband the family was poor - hattie's dream was to own a house yet her husband stole her meager savings so that he could 'hang' most every evening i could never have lived in hattie's shoes after finishing the book it's clear to me that hattie did love her children and particularly when they were grown she was there for them when they needed her the chapter that resonated the most for me was \"belle\" not only personally but this example of hattie being there for her children not to say that the children did not suffer or long for their mother's love - it's very hard to put into words how i can see both hattie's and the children's side of things i liked how the book ended in the year 1980 with sala hattie's grandchild it said two things to me one that hattie's calling in life was to care for children - even though she was so tired of doing so think about it - 11 children and two that finally with her grandchild sala hattie was learning to show the tenderness of caring for them as written in the final lines of the book maybe with sala's generation things would be different constructive criticism of the book's presentation i would have much preferred if the chapters were numbered in addition to being named i wanted an index at the beginning of the book and i wanted a header on the left side of each page to tell me which chapter i was on","2568":"i enjoyed this book although it is very disjointed i did not really like hattie but i did pity her situation i would like for some of the characters to be revisited in detail in their own books reverend six comes to mind","2569":"the concept and setting for this book had all the ingredients of a good book but i found it somewhat disappointing it felt like each of hattie's children was an excuse to explore various social issues on a very superficial level race homosexuality sexual abuse mental illness fundamentalist religion etc in the end it made for a bleak and not particularly insightful read i found myself rushing through some of the chapters and really looking forward to being done with it the irony is that hattie herself was a fairly interesting and complex character and chapters where she was featured more prominently were much more compelling","2570":"normally oprah's book selections are great but i found myself trying to find the purpose theme of the book i was trying to get the correlation of the twelve tribes of hattie to the biblical 12 tribes of israel maybe i'm missing something i think i am biased since i did not like the ending and expected a lot more with the hype the book gets","2571":"about halfway through this one kind of lost my interest it's almost more of a collection of short stories each chapter dedicated to one of hattie's children but it's only a glimpse of each child's life which made it hard to really connect with or even like any of the characters","2572":"really more of 3 5 stars was a very well written book and interesting story however i found it somewhat difficult to finish","2573":" again i am reading a book made up of inter locking or inter connected stories put together to create a novel this one follows a strikingly beautiful young woman who has fled from the jim crow rules of georgia to philadelphia in the early 1920s hattie marries handsome young august shepherd and starts a family when her first babies sicken and die hattie is propelled into a depression and sadness from which she will never be totally free we follow hattie through nine more children and her battles to raise them all and keep the family whole she scrapes and claws from their poverty all the best she can for their essentials but in the mean time hattie gives the children little of herself and no tenderness or loving touches which they crave august is a product of his time and while he loves hattie and adores all the children still he lives by a masculine code of male dominance working smoking drinking gambling and womanizing","2574":"each chapter of this novel is a snapshot into a moment in the life of one of hattie's children or grandchild their struggles hopes and memories tell a collective story of the great migration the grit and heart of this book will keep you wanting more","2575":"had it's moments but for the most part the characters didn't hold my attention nor the story line","2576":"story of one black woman how she was impacted by one single event that formed the way she related to people even her children thereafter","2577":"got bored and quit reading","2578":" loved this book ayana mathis is a beautiful writer who tells the story of hattie a young women who migrates from georgia to philadelphia in 1923 in hopes of a better life hattie ends up having nine children and we learn of her life through their eyes mathis devotes a chapter to each child and we learn of all the trials and tribulations that this family experiences it's a compelling story and mathis is new writer worth checking out i'm glad oprah chose this for her book club because this is a book deserving of attention","2579":" i think i would really rate this a 2 5 5 so i rounded up it's not that it wasn't a good book it was and the writing was particularly strong i've read some other reviews that comment how it feels like a collection of short stories and i agree you never get a good sense of how many kids hattie has what their ages are relative to each other or anything like that which makes it kind of confusing in parts when trying to figure out where other characters were at certain points in some characters' stories i also didn't expect it to be so well sad not many light moments in this one","2580":"this book has garnered a lot of media attention probably because it is oprah's second book pick for her oprah 2 0 book club so the question is does it live up to the hype yes ayana mathis is a wonderfully powerful writer she is creative in her timing of and the ways she reveals important details her descriptions are lyrical and original she makes you sympathize with people who are losing at the game of life the addicted the suicidal the hypocritical opportunist the mentally ill the coward the vengeful the sleazy the superficial the betrayer the unfaithful the snob the killer and the chronic failure mathis deserves the attention she's received and i can't wait to read her next book on a thematic note i wish i knew more jewish history is there a direct analogy here each child being a specific jewish tribe in history with its own characteristics trials strengths and weaknesses it certainly conveys the generational truth of repercussions pain lasting longer than anticipated suffering and weaknesses continuing on in future generations etc well done thought provoking and full of emotion however i take issue with the summary of the book provided by the publishers it is the worst summary i have ever read first it does not convey the feeling of the book and yet also reveals too much of the ending the summary itself almost turned me off it was soooo depressing yes the circumstances each child faces are difficult but there are elements of hope in every story as well and second the summary presents this as a novel and i don't think it should be it is much more a collection of short stories bound by a thread of commonality like olive kitteridge a pulitzer prize collection of short stories by elizabeth strout each chapter on one or two of hattie's children could stand alone with strout's book the connection was a small town with this one the thread is that they all have the same mother read this book enjoy it as i did but ignore the summary","2581":"it was ok but not worth the reviews and one of ten best books of the year maybe if my hopes weren't so high i would have liked it more or rated it higher","2582":"really a neat book the plot layout is wonderful i had a hard time keeping my nose in this book i felt like i never really got it would have been awesome as a true story or was it and i missed that part very creative though and every character stuck in my mind that's for sure","2583":"i enjoyed reading this book the characters were interesting i believe life was like that during those years and truly feel bad for the women who could not meet their children's basic needs pennsylvania is a cold state in winter you wonder how they survived with so little","2584":"after finishing this book i felt profoundly sad","2585":"i found this a good but disturbing book here we have a culture within a culture a notable group who can call themselves american but yet are separate from the white community hattie has twelve children they are transplants from georgia to philadelphia she is poverty stricken and goes through the trauma of trying to raise her children with a philandering husband who contributes little to provide for his family she herself it seems has several fathers for her own children her children all grow up differently she has to give away a child to a relative because she cannot provide a decent life for them all another becomes a prostitute and another again discovers he has power as a preacher but uses it to further himself rather than the religion he preaches one daughter who does well financially is so psychologically sick that she is incapable of helping anyone else especially a brother she wants to control rather than aid hattie herself is tempted to run away from it all but ends up with a man similar to her husband the last story is about one of her daughters who has been estranged and only discovers her mother's care as an adult dying from tuberculosis i found the book fascinating but difficult to read we have to bear the responsibility for the fact that many people in this culture are banished because they are born different and struggled to overcome the effects of slavery with little help from their white community","2586":"could be a #sundayquickreads","2587":"excellent read fast hard scrabble life and enduring strength of black woman and her progeny","2588":"this is a beautifully written book the authors is very talented in her ability to paint a picture with words however i was disappointed at the end i longed for a connection between the characters and less separation","2589":"first read in the new book club i likely wouldn't have read this book on my own because it's downright depressing yet the book was unique well written and illustrates what was likely the struggles of many","2590":" i was drawn into this book chapter after chapter i think hattie loved her twins so much that it put a shadow on her heart she knew penicillion could have saved them but august wouldn't spend the money for it august loved them also but it caused both of them dissappointment in each other i think they both guarded their hearts hattie raised the children thinking she was preparing each for the way they would be treated in the world each child grew up thinking she didn't love them the way a mother should each child ended up with their own problems blaming hattie would have loved the book to tie up the loose ends of each child maybe a sequel","2591":"the idea is sound the story of 20th century america through the voices of an african american woman and her many children but i found i didn't care much about the characters and was ultimately bored speed reading through the last couple of offspring stories that could be because each chapter focused on a different character that with the exception of hattie was not much mentioned again also one daughter makes an observation about her tennis bracelet the year was 1968 i think that was about 20 years before the term tennis bracelet was in use","2592":"well written but i want a big fan of how disjointed the stories of each child was the link back to hattie and august wasn't enough","2593":"if you're in to depressing books with no happy ending this is the book for you","2594":"yay hattie you strong intelligent survivor loved this book","2595":"the only thing holding me back from really liking this book was that it's really a series of short stories having to do with hattie and her family it kept you from really becoming attached to any particular character as soon as their chapter was over they were gone forever never to be mentioned again a few were more interesting than others and i would have liked to know what happened to them","2596":"why not just publish a book of short stories then the loose connection between stories wouldn't be an issue this book reminded me of having a set of videos of people's lives set in front of me almost like i was eavesdropping while there are sections of insights beautiful prose unusual character juxtapositions overall it was a disappointment and the black male characters all seem to be lacking in some way or another","2597":"i love novels like this each chapter a different perspective on a central character and also a portrait of a secondary character wonderful addition to the american story and to african american literature","2598":"there was a lot of potential in the setup of this book painting a picture of a woman through the stories of her children is a great beginning but despite the shifting perspective the children all describe hattie in the same way over and over by the end i was exhausted not engaged by the family's struggles there were just too many tragedies pointing in too many different directions without enough relationships holding them together","2599":"i liked this book more than i thought i would usually an 'oprah pick' is more of a deterrent to me than a 'must read' i liked the writing style and was curious that despite the length of the book that it was going to be about 12 of her children some of the review commented on how you read the chapter and then never hear about the character again except maybe in passing so in that way it's almost a collection of short stories it wasn't as depressing as i thought it was going to be also a common comment in the reviews i think it was an excellent effort for a first time novelist","2600":" i wanted to like this so much more than i did it was hard to get into really hard as in the only reason i stuck with it was because i was on a plane to california and had 6 hours to spare i'm glad i finished it though especially when i got to bell's chapter which broke my heart the style of the book was interesting with each chapter being a child of hattie and their thoughts lives and how they were shaped because of their upbringing oprah's comments via kindle were more distracting and puff than anything concrete so if you read via kindle just skip over them as they bring absolutely nothing to the table i wish half stars were possible because this was probably more of a 3 5 but definitely not at a 4 level worth a read if you can push through and give it a shot but definitely not a quick read","2601":"the first few chapters didn't really keep me interested it was difficult to love or even like most of the characters but it got better around the middle it shows you motherhood marriage friendship adulthood betrayal forgiveness from different angles i won't say i fell in love with any of the characters but by time i didn't want to put the book down it came to an end","2602":"it was a good read it was sad and poignant at times i hate that this bit of history ever happened","2603":"pretty good book more like reading short stories","2604":"well written but the structure of the story stopped it gaining momentum felt like something was missing a bleak story about slavery and race and poverty and all of life's trials in all its forms and love i should have known better than to pick up a book oprah said she loved","2605":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here after picking this book for book club i thought maybe i should see how this book is rated the reviews to me are pretty negative and i think the people on my club will feel that i only ever pick depressing books i halfway through and i am liking it i like that is written as a bunch of interconnected short stories i think if you expect the lack of plot this book would be much easier to like i of course want to know more about everyone second this book is literally a tragedy hattie and ev after picking this book for book club i thought maybe i should see how this book is rated the reviews to me are pretty negative and i think the people on my club will feel that i only ever pick depressing books i halfway through and i am liking it i like that is written as a bunch of interconnected short stories i think if you expect the lack of plot this book would be much easier to like i of course want to know more about everyone second this book is literally a tragedy hattie and even august have love and therefore hope and yet no good seems to materialize knowing it is a tragedy definitely would help all those who could not read it more","2606":"a beautifully written powerful saga of one family and its matriarch","2607":" this was an ok book which only faintly held my attention it is the story of hattie a woman who travels from the south to philadelphia when she arrives she has two twins who die from a disease due to lack of treatment hattie and her husband have 9 more children and the book details the lives of family members episodically the last is a woman who is treated for tb in a difference in the lack of care that the young girls received years earlier i found that the book had some interesting ideas but didn't grab me and keep me interested","2608":"this book was recommended by the mom at tennis who reads a book a week it was good but not compelling at times i had to talk myself into finishing it hattie's 'tribes' were her children and ultimately a granddaughter it was somewhat tragic but spanned about 60 years of events and change toward blacks in america","2609":"i initially loved this book but as it went on i started thinking didn't anyone turn out happy also since it was called the twelve tribes of hattie why weren't all their twelve children's stories told with ruthie and ella only the very beginning of their lives were told how did they turn out i was especially interested in ella's life being brought up in an different household and i think i missed a son somewhere and alice and billups just seemed to appear out of nowhere and were never mentioned in any of the other stories but all in all it was a good book","2610":"amazing new writer very toni morrison the book made me sad yet kept me reading because it is so well written","2611":"each chapter involves a different child of the main protagonist hattie explores how a mother gives her all though it still may seem like not enough to her children excellent","2612":" it really gets my back up when somebody is described as the next truman capote or whoever in this case the comparison is to toni morrison why well it's a black woman writing a sprawling family saga encompassing generations so eh it must be she's the next toni morrison well no i wouldn't say that because first of all most of the people held up for comparison are originals toni morrison and by that definition the next great person in that genre will also be original hence by definition nothing like the original person so even if ayana mathis was original she wouldn't be the next anybody second i didn't find the writing all that great not terrible by any means but not outstanding the structure of the book was episodic and that can work except that all the episodes had the same voice so this seemed more an affectation and one that made it much harder to get invested in any one character with all this i will definitely take a look at the author's next book because there's enough here to make me think she's only going to get better","2613":"the story is good however you get lost at the beginning of it in the middle it gets better and again you get confused between hattie's kids and all their story all in all i don't regret reading it","2614":" a novel about lives lived unfulfilled and heartbreaking but lived as well as possible with the circumstances presented i think about my parents my mother and father and how their lives have shaped them but also how the lives they lived before me shaped them and me hattie's children will always be the product of hattie's heartbreaks and pain but also of her joy joy that she kept to herself for years and years but joy that she still has and is finally willing to share to fix all those wrongs because most parents do the best they can at the time and it is never to late to right a wrong i enjoyed this book and found it to be a very touching tale of family and the different paths we all take in life","2615":" disappointed i couldn't figure out what the point of the book was it is composed of mostly unconnected stories about hattie and her children there is a resolution of sorts at the end but i didn't get why i needed to know all the sordid irrelevant details i felt like i was missing something maybe the point is that this is life that this was literature imitating life that not everything connects like in a novel or film etc or maybe it was about aspects of black history and culture that i was not prepared to appreciate call me old fashioned but i wanted more of a plot","2616":" forst read aug 2014 very moving surprisingly as it is about a family who struggle to understand let alone express their emotions the history and perspective is interesting a black family's view on the south and their preference for the north the inability of hattie to keep the children alive and show them love at the same time is desperately sad and it is tragic to see how many ways the children found to suffer and be unhappy she is a great story teller and character builder ayana mathis i look forward to reading more of her work re read for book group march 2016 found it a bit more depressing than moving this time but still admire the characterisation","2617":" wow it's difficult to believe mathis is a first time novelist her writing is incredible the subject matter and themes are tragic but so insightful and beautifully written and every now and then you see a glimmer of hope within the pages the last chapter is one of the most powerful chapters i've read in a while perhaps because it spoke to me on a personal level having dealt with a loved one with similar issues despite all the hardness mathis approaches her characters with a soft touch enabling us readers to see the soft bellies underneath their shells and the cause of their often tough exteriors i'll be on the lookout for mathis' next novel","2618":"thank god for birth control","2619":"did i miss something so many have reviewed this and praised it i didn't like it each chapter is a mini story that never tells you enough i was left wanting to know more and it wasn't going to happen","2620":"the first couple of chapts i thought i wasnt going to be able to finish but the story picked up for me and i enjoyed the book i recommend","2621":" i decided to join oprah's book club on goodreads and this was the book they are currently reading personally it was just ok i found it extremely disjointed and not enough closure information on each of the members of her tribe i found nothing uplifting about this book just sadness and a thought running through my mind about how can you have that many children and every single one of them be no account losers bad parenting any kind of parenting very disappointed in my first experience with oprah's choice of books","2622":"got about 100 pages in and couldn't read anymore it was a struggle to get invested in any of the characters","2623":"i waited to review this so i could come to terms with what i really thought about it it started off rough the very first section about hattie and her twins really sucked me in it was compelling heartbreaking and beautifully written then we got to floyd's section and i thought wtf as the novel progressed i started to understand some characters a bit more and in understanding her children i was able to understand hattie she grew on me and i felt something for her it was impossible to really grow close to any of the characters of the kids as we only got a very short snippet from each of their lives some of the sections were more compelling than others and offered a deeper glimpse into their lives i didn't like not being able to follow up with most of them many were just purely forgettable actually i started to forget which kids went with each story and each life it was very fragmented which was maybe the point the author was trying to make it seemed that each separate story marked the turning point in the life of the lead character most of them weren't very happy stories either this story was really about how the parental stylings of hattie affected her children in the long run she had allowed her grief from early heartache to soil her future as a mother and there's a very beautiful moment in the end where she has a dramatic epiphany though she's an old woman she has a new chance at atonement i feel it was this ending which i won't spoil for anyone who would like to read it that redeemed the book i still had enough issues with it that i don't feel it warranted a 5 star rating but there's a lot here that i really admire in a book","2624":"i read this book with captivation as if i witnessed it all hattie and all twelve of her tribes i see you i saw you i get it","2625":"i was not a huge fan it was a typical oprah book club book i couldn't attach to any characters","2626":"wow -- not perfect but a beautiful sad true feeling novel that takes some risks and goes beyond the ordinary","2627":"this author first novel very disjointed reading hard to figure out the person each chapter was speaking about hattie comes from the south to the north for a better life but never stands up for herself hattie lives her life as a door mat and should went back to the south her life would have been filled with friends to help as she lives out her life in poverty","2628":"this was a terribly depressing book one character after another each more dysfunctional than the last i had a hard time wanting to read it it was well written but it was not the page turned that it was said to be it read like a collection of short stories instead of a novel i would have liked more interaction between the characters","2629":"randomly picked this up at the library and ready enjoyed you start out thinking it is a bunch of short stories but then everything weaves together interesting format to tell a story of a mother's struggle","2630":"i loved this book very much","2631":"crazy book makes you feel crazy reading it","2632":"the book was really well written but i would have liked to explore some of the kids lives a little deeper and i would have liked to have gotten some more insight from hattie herself she seems to be a woman of few words but i would have liked to hear more of her thoughts and feelings","2633":"i cannot help but to believe that the author intends to expound on the lives of the characters in other books i loved this book excellent read","2634":"beautiful and tragic book i loved each story of the family and the language used to describe simple things it seemed to read more like a collection of short stories perhaps than a novel but still was worth the read","2635":" i really wanted to like this book ayana mathis writes beautifully and i felt the pain of her characters and smell the humid southern air as i read but at the end of the day this is not a novel it's a collection of short stories and despite the excellent writing the book felt choppy and i didn't get the follow up i was hoping for as i progressed through the book each chapter focusses on one of hattie's children and uses a moment in time to tell thier life story but once the chapter was over that was it no follow up to let us know what happened to the character maybe that was the point but it made me wanting more and disappointed overall","2636":"this book is fantastic and fascinating i real recommend people to read the book","2637":" i probably would have given up on this book if it wasn't for it being a book club pick which i did choose but i am glad i didn't it is probably more of a 3 5 than 4 stars but who cares i can be generous once in a while i just didn't really understand it at first every chapter changed narrative and it took a while before i understood anything of that person and when i finally did the chapter was over then it just got amazing and i felt so many things and i just couldn't get enough and then it got boring but the middle though the middle it was a goooood middle i appreciate the story and i am really glad i read it","2638":"i would want to talk to half the characters and find myself staring glaring at he rest loved it and wanted more hattie in church at the end god i finally related to someone","2639":"this book is told as a collection of hattie's children stories i found each persons story to takes you back to the matriarch of the family hattie i only rate this 3 stars because after all the hoopla about this book i was left expecting so much more","2640":"i rarely give books such a low rating but i was really expecting this book to be better while the stories of hattie and her children were certainly woven together it was in too loose a style for my personal taste the writing was good but the interspersing of the plots weren't enough to keep my attention honestly i struggled just to get through to the end of the book however if separate short stories with a minimal thread holding them together is your thing you'll love this book","2641":"i don't normally rate books that i don't complete but i was so bored by most of it that it feels justified the writing didn't really keep my attention and i thought the story had a lot of potential that was never met hard to legitimize finishing this one when i have so many other things i could be reading","2642":"3 5 starsliked it but was disappointed that the chapters didn't flow into each other better","2643":"loved the different stories although the first was my favorite each was very different from the others and all made me appreciate how far we've come and the distance yet to go took me awhile to figure out how they are all linked","2644":" 3 5 stars individual narratives of the lives of hattie shepherd's children that span the course of 55 years it had been a looooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggg time since i read something just because oprah told me too but that's exactly why i read this book suffice it to say that oprah's book club 2 0 is a second verse same as the first if you've read enough of oprah's selections you'll know she likes some misery in her book club luckily it was a quick read because i don't think i had enough wine in the house to drown my sorrows if this one would have taken more than a day if you want a book with a silver lining don't read this if you don't mind spending an hour or two going over the pros and cons of sticking your head in an oven due to the overwhelming despair that embody the lives of everyone in the shepherd family dive on in","2645":"written more like 12 short stories","2646":"this was a good story a beautiful way to explore one woman and her family","2647":"this was excellent the only reason i rated it 4 stars is because it jumped around a lot but i realized toward the end it was being told from 12 different perspectives so that's why i tend to like books that aren't written chronologically and this was no exception","2648":"i enjoyed it i think it was written beautifully and i'm still thinking about it but i had a hard time sympathizing with the main character of hattie","2649":"enjoyed this book though much lighter read than the previously completed warmth of other suns each chapter is a short take on one of hattie's children and a grandchild i found it interesting and they usually end abruptly that would make you think about what was or might have been","2650":"ah hattie you poor angry soul you ruined your babies good writing is always inspiring you don't have to imagine a scene or a character they're just there standing there with their dirty laundry asking you to take a sniff then you do and even if you don't like it at least you have a first hand impression i love that unlike others who craved a plot i preferred this disjointed tale from various viewpoints that give the sense of hattie's mothering children from one parent cannot have the same story a family's tale cannot be told from only one perspective it rolled around a great sticky beast gathering tales from 12 children and left me wanting more thank you ms mathis not many people can write like you do","2651":"perhaps i didn't give this enough time but at about 25% done i still couldn't get into the story it's actually many stories of hattie's children seemingly removed from each other some reviews comment on how sad this story is and maybe that's it too i'd rather for something else right now maybe another time i will make another attempt","2652":"not my favorite book by a long shot it did a good job of depicting a very large truly dysfunctional family full of sadness and despair i did feel some compassion towards hattie but couldn't feel much for any of her children although the chapters were short i think the author did a good job of character development and you got to see just a glimpse into each of their life stories all of them were pretty dismal maybe sala can start a new generation of happiness","2653":"i enjoyed the character study of each child but couldn't connect with hattie at all","2654":"too much black people sadness for no really good reason there were spots in this book cassie in particular where there's a glimpse of something interesting and painful and real but not enough to make one good book i will say that the ending made this book a three star instead of a two","2655":"i enjoyed the author's writing style but felt the sexuality was over the top","2656":"this book has an intriguing start which captured my attention however several chapters of this book is hard to read because of it content and it vexed my righteous soul not as enjoyable as i thought it would be","2657":"i abandoned this book about 85% through it wasn't bad it just wasn't good coincidentally i am also right now listing to small steps audio book with my 9 year old son we are about half way done i think small steps is a much more interesting richer story about the african american experience that has something new to say the twelve tribes of hattie is predictable with limited character development i can't will myself to finish it","2658":"yuck didn't finish","2659":"powerful poignant perfect","2660":"good writing but the structure worked against it hattie had too many kids for a cohesive story each child had an individual chapter often separated by many years from the others so i didn't feel like i got to know any of the kids really well or hattie for that matter given that we only got her perspective at the beginning of the book children rarely have that much great insight about their parents and the way this book was written it was definitely true here","2661":"in 1923 15 year old hattie shepherd leaves georgia and heads north she settles in philadelphia looking for a better life but marries august who brings her nothing but disappointment her firstborn twins die as infants and she gives birth to nine more children each chapter is a story of her eleven children and one grandchild the twelve tribes this book was a november book club read and it took me about seven weeks to finish perhaps due to the holiday season however i now realize my lack of interest was in how it was written as short stories i think i would have enjoyed it much more had it been written as one story i am glad i finished it but i'm not sure i would read another book by this author in the future","2662":"loved this book","2663":"i liked this book i only wish that i had more closure to the characters","2664":"this is a dark and challenging book that leaves the reader hoping for any break from social dysfunction poverty or adultery reading much like a collection of short stories it chronicles the lives of the central character hattie and her 12 children if you really need something to wallow in this might be a good pick","2665":"i bought this as a gift and had to give another gift so i could finish it each chapter is like a short story with a few threads and hattie connecting well written","2666":"loved this book there isn't anything extremely notable about it except that the characters are gripping i'd like to read another book about what else happens to hattie's children but at the same time i like the mystery and possibility that comes with not knowing also as much as i hate to admit it this books makes me want to read more oprah book club books","2667":" warning to dad this book is depressing while i admired and respected the structure of this book it's not the same as actually liking and enjoying it each chapter follows a child or two of hattie's well one follows a grandchild and then doesn't really revisit that child much there was a lot of flipping back and forth between chapters to try and put all the children in their context what worked about this was seeing how everyone's perspectives came together to give us a rather cohesive look at hattie i liked how the chapters were told chronologically but not necessarily in birth order cassie is one of the oldest children but we don't get her full story until almost the end for example as i revisit and skim to help myself come to some coherent understandings about this novel i keep thinking oh this child's story is the most tragic oh no no never mind it's this child who is the most broken what they all have in common is this well meaning but stretched thin mother toward the end as hattie is an old woman she comes to this realization hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies well there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies anyway so maybe she should have spent more time hugging and kissing them but i don't think that hattie's emotional unavailability is due to the amount of children she has or the financial difficulties she encounters to raise them all instead the book starts us off as she frantically tries to save her twin babies from pneumonia as she the 17 year old mother watches her babies die the nurturing loving part of her goes with them another connecting thread is the desperation to not make the same mistakes you made before or to not make the same mistakes your mother made with you we see bell try this by taking up with her mother's old boyfriend in a particularly creepy section alice as she secretly uses birth control and hattie herself as she refuses to let sala get swallowed up by the church mathis certainly does a good job creating ten very different kinds of screwed up kids i'm not counting philadelphia and jubilee they were too little to have their own personalities arguably though so are ruthie and ella i found myself wondering if all our stories told with mathis' spin and focus could sound this tragic","2668":"it took several months to read this book for lack of dedication to me time i finally finished today and must say i loved it from beginning to end","2669":"the lives of hattie's children is told through a series of short stories that did not connect as i had hoped they would it is only in the last chapter that we get any insight brief as it is into hattie's view and feelings for some of her children and the paths they took","2670":"hattie gives birth to eleven children her life is a struggle personal and practical this is a story of the lives if each of hattie and her children while the book was well written i cannot say that i enjoyed reading chapter after chapter of hardship","2671":"more of a bunch of intertwined short stories about members of a large family than a novel it was really hard to like any of them because they were in and out of the book so fast","2672":"i thought the book was well written and in part beautiful but it was hard to follow i didn't feel like there was a story line just chapters in a book about different characters the only connecting character was hattie the mother of nine children it was more like short stories rather than a novel interesting reading because of the writing but it could have been so much more","2673":"so where to begin i really would like to go 3 1 2 stars because the writing was good it was more like a collection of short stories as there was little overlap in the story of each of hattie's children even the decades of their lives were different i seem to be reading a lot of stories this summer about the oppression of african americans and it is very hurtful it is beyond my understanding how people can mistreat their fellow humans i would recommend this book to anybody who likes to read to those who only read an occasional book i would not","2674":"i took a little while to get that each chapter is written from the point of view of one of hattie's children and boy are they different each story is from a very very different point of view sometimes it is difficult to read between the lines to figure out what's happened or between the chapters that is i left wanting to know more about several of the characters","2675":"not nearly as depressing as most of oprahs selections","2676":"good writing miserable situations without any redeeming successes not sure what the point was","2677":"should have known it's an oprah pick hence depressing","2678":"the twelve tribes refer to hattie's 11 children and 1 grandchild that she raised hattie's children all grew up in the 50's and 60's and the story is told from each of their perspectives as adults the two youngest children die of pneumonia when they are just babies this destroys hattie for many years to come even after several more children are born life is very hard in hattie's household there is never enough food to eat or money to clothe the children and keep the house warm this is in large part due to hattie's husband august who is a gambler and a womanizer one of hattie's children floyd is gay during a time when being gay is most certainly not ok he struggles with his sexuality and stays on the road as a musician so he can meet men on one day and be gone the next to another town another child six becomes a preacher in his late teenage years but in secret is a womanizer just like his father and franklin tells his story as a military man in viet nam cassie sounds like she is a bi polar schizophrenic and as an adult child with a child of her own hattie and august institutionalize her her daughter sala is the granddaughter that hattie must raise all of these stories and more comprise this book which shows hattie for the most part as a strong woman bent on taking care of her children to the best of her abilities even if it may seem harsh at the time i liked this book because it showed that families aren't perfect and that everyone struggles with their own problems what i didn't like about the book is that each chapter of the children seemed a novella unto itself for the most part there wasn't one story line that was developed through the book instead there was a story line for each of hattie's children these stories were good but other than having the same people in each story there was really nothing that linked them together to make one cohesive book if you approach it like all of the chapters are short stories then it makes a little more sense more importantly all of the chapters were good and held your attention","2679":"lots of suffering but well written kept me reading through the sadness","2680":"wow this book was incredible i couldn't put it down the characters will stay with me for a very long time","2681":"the author's imagery is out if this world i enjoyed reading it but don't see any reason to read it again nor any reason to recommend it the author has a lot of potential","2682":"heartbreaking and gorgeous storytelling the book was riveting but often very painful to read it's not an uplifting read more a story of survival and tending to your family no matter what the odds are i wish ayana mathis had spent a little more time on each of her children rather than devote a chapter to each but in some ways it makes a lot of sense highly recommended but it's very difficult to handle sometimes","2683":"loved loved this book","2684":"i would give this another half star the writing is compelling but i didn't enjoy the structure of interconnected stories some characters grabbed me more than others but the writing never let go the author is a girls high girl","2685":"this book blew me away i still can't believe that it's a first novel beautifully beautifully written i am filled with admiration for ayana mathis my only suggestion would be to not get the kindle edition which horrifyingly came with oprah's annotations all of her little underlinings and comments all accompanied by a round o lest we forget who's making them and i couldn't get them to go away through the usual kindle settings","2686":"very painful to read because there are no happy endings with any of hattie's children i was hoping there would be at least one","2687":"fabulous each chapter is about one of hattie's children if i had to have one complaint it would be that i was left wondering the outcome of each child's story hattie's story on the other hand does have an ending as hattie put her arm around sala and pulled her close she patted her granddaughter's back roughly unaccustomed as she was to tenderness","2688":"wonderful storytelling and characterization hattie is a marvelous woman i will treasure and remember for years to come","2689":"so many characters and so little time spent on each as soon as i would get invested in one the story would move to another i found this a little frustrating the stories themselves were quite good and i would have liked for them to continue with all their problems and quirks this family redefines the word dysfunctional","2690":" this book was very interesting to read due to the fact that each chapter is told by a different character it drives home the point that every child in a family can have a very different experience growing up with the same mother and how different siblings really can be from each other i think it would be very challenging as an author to write one book with many different voices but ayana mathis has done this very well i enjoy reading books that take place in different time periods as this one does very happy that i stumbled upon this one at the library","2691":" over the years i've developed an affinity for the short story format that i once despised mathis uses the great migration of african americans from the south to the north to kick off this saga of a family's history told through linked short stories after moving from georgia to philadelphia 15 year old hattie and her husband august have settled in their new city and are celebrating the birth of their twins philadelphia and jubilee in the first story named for the twins hattie is nursing them through a bout of pneumonia two pages in i was hooked the writing was so vivid and beautiful that i felt that i was in the room with those sick babies and was moved to tears while reading on my commute to work i'm sure the other passengers thought i was going through some things each subsequent chapter focuses on the couple's 9 other children and takes us from 1925 to the 1980's giving us insight not only into the lives of each person but also the nature of the family dynamic and each person's role in it children from large families at times have very different relationships with their parents than their siblings and i love that each story reflected that while also checking in with hattie and august","2692":"i was so disappointed in this book i loved each of the stories but they each were so abruptly ended i was left wanting more for each one i guess that was the point just to get a quick glimpse into the lives of these children i need more i need a whole story","2693":" the twelve tribes of hattie was chosen as the july selection for the books and beer club the novel focuses on the experiences and character of hattie shepherd but the chapters are vignettes that describe her based on her interactions with her many children rather than addressing her directly through this structural device the reader gets little snippets of information about hattie's children and their lives but eventually a more complete portrait of hattie herself emerges life is far from easy for hattie's family we learn that along with her mother and sisters she has fled georgia for philadelphia at seventeen she becomes an ill equipped mother to twins philadelphia and jubilee as the result of tryst with a boy she barely knows her experience with her twins and her relationship with their father shape the way she will interact with her future children this is not a book i would have picked up on my own and i probably wouldn't have finished it if it hadn't been the july selection for book club once i began reading i had a little trouble staying absorbed in the novel because it was hard for me to connect with the characters whose lives and experiences were vastly different from my own while each of the family members was unique interesting and well developed all of them seemed pretty miserable regardless of their situations their sadness constantly reminded me of hattie's own situation view spoiler it seems that after the tragic deaths of the twins in the first vignette hattie becomes emotionally closed off to her children it's as if she loved the twins and was affectionate toward them but she was unable to save them so she walls off that part of herself and forces herself to focus strictly on the other children's survival as a result she comes across to them as distant and cold but her actions make it evident that she truly loves them hide spoiler ultimately i'm glad that i stuck with it and finished the book because i think the whole text is needed to fully appreciate the character of hattie","2694":"this is a wonderful book eloquent and heart breaking and good for oprah if she discovered it and is responsible for promoting it if only she didn't have to promote herself i hated the banal little comments occasioned by particular passages in the book a product of the same narcissism that has her on every cover of her magazine it's not relevant to my appreciation of the book that stedman tells me i'm beautiful without make up","2695":"well written heavy on family dysfunction but depressing","2696":"i wanted this to be about three times longer","2697":" hattie hattie hattie... you either loved her hated her or understood her i understood her the most powerful chapter was the first and every chapter after that concerning hattie i understood maybe i did not agree but i understood hattie loved all her children not in the same way you and i may love our children but she loved them none the less had she not been trough the tragedy that befell philadelphia and jubilee she would have been a more loving mother of that i feel certain i did not find fault with her way of thinking she had children she had to take care of them as best as she could by doing whatever she had to do meanwhile her own happiness was out of sight and out of mind until a gentleman by the name of lawrence comes along and then only then is there a little hope of happiness for hattie as for hattie's tribe finding their way will be not be easy their mother was hard on them and their father august just was not there they grew up with little to no guidance and their lives all took very different turns and i am not sure that anyone other than billups will ever be happy i am not sure if i liked the chapters dedicated to each person because i missed what happened to that person in the time before and after their chapter... so the jury is till out on that all i heard about this book before i read it was how depressing it was i did not find the book depressing it is a sad story guided by a tragedy in their lives but i found hints of hope promise awakening and love yes love hattie didn't know how to love in the traditional sense of what we think love to be but she loved in the only way she knew how to love this book did what it was supposed to do make you feel something you either loved her hated her or understood her i understood her","2698":"i thought this book was so well written the author definitely has a way with words","2699":"since each chapter focused on the story of a different child or a snippet of the mother's life it was difficult to latch on to any of the characters it seemed more like a collection of short stories with the common thread of having the same mother rather than a cohesive book by the end i did find myself admiring the mother but it was a last minute half assed feeling","2700":" the first chapter had me hooked the writing was lyrical and the characters were interesting then i got to chapter 2 the book isn't as much a novel as a string of short stories each narrated by one of hattie's children there is no overlap the stories take place years apart with the exception of the last two actually i would have enjoyed the book much more if the story began with the last two chapters which contained some of the best character development in the book just as things are getting interesting though the book ends i think ayana mathis has talent however i don't think this is going to be her best book","2701":" loss sets the tone for this novel of a mother's unending grief and the effect it has on her family this book is everywhere every time i pick up a magazine of visit a book site this book is there thanks in part to oprah making it her newest book club pick entertainment weekly summed this book up best when they said \"...this is a slim poetic novel one that focuses less on american progress than on the small but powerful moments that are strung together like beads on a necklace to make one long strand of a family's history \"this story is a web which is spread out over time and space ensnaring all of hattie's children the writing style in this book is such that even with just chapter long snippets of each child we get a sense of where this family has been what it has meant to each of them and what their observations of hattie were we get to know hattie through the stories of her children i have to wonder though if we really get to know her or just a semblance of her children's perception of her this book has to be taken for what it is a short story of a family surviving the best way they know how it's not kind and sweet it's not really inspirational to me it was more tragic circumstances both her own doing and those beyond hattie's control affects each of her children in different ways she allowed a cloud of hurt and wants to surround her family not in the physical sense of clothing and food she did everything she could to keep their needs met but in the emotional sense this book will definitely make you think about the effect your actions or inactions and your emotional health have on your own family it's very well written for a debut each chapter could have been a stand alone story but i didn't find any inspiration in the pages only heartfelt sadness for both hattie and her children","2702":"very well written i liked that it was told by the children in his her perspective not exactly an uplifting book but a good read","2703":"i was expecting a lot more from this book i'm sort of disappointed a few of the characters and stories in this book deserved further exploration and depth others felt more like fillers padding to make a whole book all that said the stories are beautifully written some very real and heartbreaking images that haunt and disturb for many days after","2704":"i liked this each chapter was an event in one of hattie's children's life and her influence in that life i cared for the characters","2705":"i loved the parts about hattie and would have liked the book more if it followed her all the way through there was a lot there to flesh out and it would have made a better book in my opinion","2706":"loved the story but i didn't like the way it ended it was very abrupt","2707":"this book started out great but it was just too depressing after a while it finished the chapter for each child and then just left them you never found out what happened to them after that in the context of the family or out of it i would not recommend this book","2708":"wanted to love this book didn't it might be because i had a hard time relating to the lives of the characters","2709":"good story but not a fan of the telling the story in a different voice for each chapter too broken up for me","2710":"this self assured novel has the nature of a group of short stories related because they are about the children and grandchild of hattie a strong woman who raises her children without much help from her husband august or anyone else each chapter focuses on one or more of the children who all struggle with various personal dragons really not much works out for them but they survive mostly as does hattie she even mellows a bit and achieves her dream of a home of her own at the end","2711":"just ok seemed like little short stories but they never tied together","2712":"i`ve finally gotten around to finishing this book after having it on my kindle for awhile this novel has gotten mixed reviews but for me it was an enjoyable read in this novel hattie along with her mother and sisters flee the bitter racism of the south for a supposedly prosperous life in the northern city of brotherly love philadelphia as one can imagine life proves to be anything but peachy for hattie and her numerous children the chapters bounce around from one child to the next and is written more like a collection of short stories than a cohesive novel yet i enjoyed most of the stories and felt that the book was an easy read i like ayana mathis` writing style and would definitely check out another book from her","2713":"the story of a woman named hattie and all of her children each chapter deals with one maybe two children so the reader is never granted the full story only glimpses feels somehow incomplete 3 5 stars","2714":"painfully beautiful amazing how you can see pieces of this mother go with each of her children","2715":"it's not that i didn't think this was a well written book but it was so deeply depressing from start to finish that i can't give it more than 3 stars this is the story of hattie who at age 17 had the first of 12 children twins actually she and her husband moved from ga to philadelphia looking for a better life hattie's life did not get better nor did the lives of her surviving children remembering the book right now sends me into a dark hole","2716":"each chapter felt like a separate story even though i still enjoyed it","2717":"i think this was an excellently written complex and descriptive first novel ms mathis' writing is beautiful i thoroughly enjoyed the book and felt it bore a realistic portrayal of a family not so unlike mine life is not a fairy tale for many and the honesty and dishonesty of the characters were indeed a human condition i admired hattie for raising her family with the knowledge she had as a young wife and mother at 17 and the twists and turns in her marriage were pivotal perseverance and working through trials and tribulations appear to be lost with the throw away generation if you live long enough there will be trials tribulations gladness and sadness and i applaud the author's decision to have august and hattie withstand their hardships in the end family is all you've got","2718":"i have to say i liked it it didn't wow me but it was a nice hattie is complex and maintains this air of mystery by never revealing all of her feelings the book does leave you with unanswered questions about nearly all of characters that were introduced this might be annoying in other circumstances but i feel it works in other novels the same conclusion might have driven me crazy this is a well done debut","2719":"i enjoyed the author sharing different perspectives from different characters although fragmented i got that just wished there was more of a conclusion","2720":"i enjoyed the book and found areas of good writing i marked several passages i felt it was somewhat one dimensional as we met the characters one by one without any interaction between them","2721":" ugh i started this book so excited for the journey six chapters in i was desperately trying to love it but it was losing me and losing me fast every main and most of the supporting characters in this book are wounded and broken nearly all the men in this book are horrible people liars cheats gamblers broken struggling and ignorant i soon began to ask what does this author have against men what man did her dirty i hope it felt good to crucify every 'male' in her life with the power of her pen i began to hate this book and then i began to hate the author for taking me on this bleak and pointless journey i finished the book which ended so abruptly and almost unresolved still hating it and hating the 2 days wasted that it took to read it this authors writing is wonderful descriptive and elegant but i hate that she penned these lives i've read plenty of books that left me feeling for the broken characters and routing for their redemption even if it didn't come these characters i ceased to care about and that's not good i wanted so much from this book and was so severely let down too bad wasted talent it gets 2 stars for wasted potential le sigh","2722":"i wanted to love this book i found myself reading faster and faster hoping to love it however when i got to the end i had to check to see if it was really over i felt like i had walked the whole way to the emerald city only to have someone slam the door in my face i want a do over","2723":"well written but very depressing book it's full of characters who seem to have wasted their lives one way or another can't even feel sad for any of them most are pathetic if the goal was to show how one should not spend a lifetime then this book nails it on so many fronts not uplifting in the least bit otherwise","2724":" when i picked picked this up to read i didn't realize it was short stories at first i thought i wouldn't like that but after i loved the first two stories i knew i was hooked hattie become a mother and wife as a teenager and wanted nothing more than to raise her kids up in more progressive way and give them everything they needed to do well each short story is about one of her children each one is tender and heartbreaking and could be a book in itself the author does an exceptional job telling each story without leaving you feeling like you needed more the collection is full of sorrow but there is a deep connection of family through them all i loved this book 4 5 stars for sure wish i had chosen this as a book club selection would make for excellent discussion","2725":"some people panned this oprah book club pick but i really liked it it is similar in style to elizabeth strout's book olive kittredge where each chapter has a separate storyline but the main character is threaded throughout some of the stories are heart wrenching others hopeful","2726":"an interesting story about an emotionally scarred black family who escapes to philadelphia in jim crow days","2727":"good read while on the plane","2728":"loved this story or should i say that i loved these stories my type of book","2729":"i enjoyed all the different perspectives","2730":"2 5 stars great writing and story telling but never really got to know the characters as much as i wanted to","2731":"interesting way the book was written each chapter about a different child this book was sad on so many levels the death of two children and the lack of love or affection from a mother and how the surviving children only long for it the sadness of a family that struggled every day","2732":" enthralling story of an african american family unfolding through the 1920's to 1980' as told via the lives of the 12 children of hattie the story begins during the great migration of the 20' and 30's when thousands of african americans left the jim crow south and headed north in hopes of greater freedom and opportunity many left rural southern towns leaving family friends and community to settle in industrial northern cities the twelve tribes of hattie begins with hattie's hopes and struggles and follows each child into adulthood mathis reminds me of john steinbeck in her ability to capture the trials of the ordinary filled with authentic characters and brilliantly written diaglogue a fine addition to american fiction and african american literature","2733":"i really enjoyed this story and each of the many children that were described while they didn't give as clear a picture of hattie as i was expecting i still appreciated and enjoyed their individual narratives and experiences","2734":"disappointing the structure of the book detracts from the character development too much","2735":" i loved it ambitious achingly honest empathetic first novel it was the perfect follow up to warmth of other suns since it relentlessly and from all angles combed over the lives of one black philadelphia family with roots in georgia the tangled lives of the kids were beautifully rendered with the minor exceptions of the alice billups story the sala story and the cassie story all of which i liked very much but felt tonally out of step for obvious reasons if you read the book the writing was like a plainer real world version of toni morrison and was especially beautiful in the bell chapter describing her tuberculosis she was very inventive with styles and structure but still managed to consistently build the characters and family unit across chapters and through time it's one of the most harrowing but tender descriptions of flawed motherhood i've ever read and i can't stop thinking about the characters hattie especially","2736":"i found this book riveting in some ways it reminded me of olive kitteredge an intersting was to talk about the experience of being black in the time of the 1900's","2737":"ok story it had too many characters the author should have put the focus on the main character","2738":"i was so excited to read this book but at the end i'm feeling a bit disappointed it wasn't a problem with the author's writing or language in fact i often lost myself in her descriptions instead the problem i had with the book was it's structure while i understand that each chapter was to be a separate piece of hattie's life puzzle i struggled especially in the early chapters to make the connections and pick out the pieces that developed hattie's character by the end i felt i had read 10 short stories in a themed collection instead of a complete novel about one family certainly i feel that there were just too many holes and unanswered questions at the end for me to feel any sense of completeness and satisfaction","2739":"i can relate to hattie and her children for different reasons and experiences mathis brought real life issues to this story issues most do not wish to acknowledge or are completely oblivious to their existence","2740":"i could not put this book down in the end i wanted more as the mother of 8 children who married young and has very recently experienced the loss of one of my dear children i was relating to and feeling this book in the depths of my soul i laughed i cried i really enjoyed reading it","2741":"loved this one concise beautifully crafted dialogue and very real characters a lot of narrative well done in about 270 pages i read this for our book club and highly recommend it","2742":"i enjoyed this book so much i couldn't put it down even though hattie was a rough tough mother she loved her children so much as any large family there were many different personalities and different issues what i enjoyed was the individuality of each character","2743":"i know this was an oprah pick but for me it was twelve tribes of misery hattie is poor leads a miserable life chooses a bad man and has too many children there's very little relief from the bleakness","2744":"this book disappointed kept waiting for all the strings to be weaved together and didn't feel that they really were some good writing though and loved the characters 3 stars","2745":"with the exception of a few boring chapters this is evocative beautiful writing","2746":"hattie marries at a very young age and loses her twin firstborn children tragically she has moved to the northern u s to escape poverty and racism only to find that her life is a struggle from morning to night she later gives birth to nine more children and longs for peace and a home for them to grow in told in a series of twelve vignettes this is a novel to ponder learn from and enjoy","2747":"awesome read","2748":"an interesting story of 20th century black americana the funnest part reading as an e book is that from time to time there is an underlined section with a big green o if you click on the o you get to read a few sentences of commentary by oprah winfrey it's like having her at your book club very fun","2749":"i was excited to dig into this critically acclaimed book from an iowa writer's workshop grad i actually met ayana mathis in front of a bar in iowa city and i found her delightful i'm sure she found me somewhat less so i really enjoyed the book although at times it was tough to endure the uglier sides of all of so many complicated damaged characters","2750":"so far riveting now that i have finished i would say well written but rather sad and hopeless left me with a real ache in my gut wrought with unresolved guilt and remorse from many of the characters in the book","2751":"hattie moves from poverty in georgia to philadelphia where she hopes for a better life the book tells of her life and her children's lives good writing but too many characters for such a short book","2752":"the opening chapter is very good a few chapters in later part of the book especially when hattie is to give her kid away also impressed me the book has a separate chapter on each kid and grand kid with hattie being the single binding thread throughout this makes the book kinda incoherent to me the 12 tribes of hattie is a metaphor to 12 tribes of israel http ancienthistory about com od ju a biblical reference","2753":"it's hard to put into words how i feel about this book you learn about hattie in an indirect manner through her children and her relationships with others and that is very much what makes thus book so engaging","2754":"this book was selected for the oprah's 2 0 book blub i thought the book was ok each chapter was devoted to another character in the book and i didn't think they were well intertwined with each other","2755":" this was a lovely book and you feel so strongly for some if not all of the characters hattie and her large family of children but the structure of the novel makes it hard to really fall into the narrative just when you are hooked and want to know how life goes for the character of the moment it's on to another character you're left wanting more left feeling hungry to know what happens after which is i suppose the mark of a good storyteller but ends up leaving the reader frustrated and not quite satisfied","2756":"a phenomenally astounding book all of my night and day time waking readable hours were spent practically glued to the pages of this book on the cover of the book is a little sticker that proclaims that this book has the honor of having been included in oprah's book club let me say right now i would gladly put my name on a petition to request her her production company and her director friends to make this book into a movie excluding tyler sorry this isn't that type of book this book is spellbinding not since the color purple or the women of brewster place has a saga so real raw and told with such depth involving the struggles of the black family in american been written there is a certain relative sorrow within every character that is just so hypnotic it would be a sin to look away from as if you could you can't there is this something in its essence so pure and so honest that regardless of who you claim to be for the world there is some element of yourself that you will recognize within the narrative of each of these delicate souls the entire book the author ms ayana mathis will skillfully crack on a nerve and if you don't agree sit and ponder a sentence for a moment or two you will surely feel the sting this book is based on the black a family's experience but make no mistake family is family experience is experience and if you are any component to the family collective mother father sister brother you will find elements that connect with your life the twelve tribes of hattie is about your grandmother or your mother or your aunt you know this woman she migrated in the 1920's from the south to escape poverty and the jim crow laws with hope and wishes for a better life in the north she marries young because this is what you did and reality comes crashing in like sand storms through the desert a little bit at a time and the realization that the dreams of utopia in the north were nothing more than pipe dreams the babies start coming there is never enough work so there is never enough money and what is there but bitterness a dab of faith and hard resolve to try to feed the family and keep all alive some are lost because there are only two human hands to clutch them all some float away in confusion and distortion some are taken away for the better some pretend through their sorrows some are as stubborn as hattie herself this is not a book of short stories but each chapter does bring the narrative of a different voice of one of hatties many children some chapters also include the voices of august and lawrence who are not her children but i won't spoil who they are and sometimes hattie herself talks each narrative is a window into a different life and how their connection to hattie has affected and with many formed their lives there are so many things that one can take from this book one resounding theme that i observed was that there are pivotal points within all lives at an early age that form for better or worse the individual that we tend to become whether it is something from our parents infused into our childhood or the lack thereof these experiences shape us foundations whatever they may be are all any of us learn to stand on but it's the choices once we are of choosing age that really make us who we are this is what we see in this book the choices hattie as the matriarch makes and how they effect the lives and choices of all who come in contact with her it's something that is not always considered or maybe there is no time to consider or maybe the emotions are too high to consider that the choices they make do always effect others i give this 5 stars i recommend it 100% i will read other books by this author she did a great job this book is easy to read and you will want to read it i will hopefully watch it as a movie in the future every bit of this book is memorable there are characters who's story's are so sorrowful they stick in my mind i'm sure i'll never forget there are stories that rubbed me so close to the skin not the situation but the sentiment i wanted to holler at the author to stop clawing at my bones so soul reaching they were i cried a few times some smiling some with one hand grasping the book splayed open across my lap the other hand covering my trembling lips this is one of those books that lives with you for the duration of your reading time and when you close its pages the characters will all still be sitting semi circle around you and you will wonder what was it is their future fate soon they will fade i wish them well and i thank them for opening themselves up for my viewing and sharing their stories the pages of their lives now help to shape me","2757":"i would've liked this book better if it had been sold as a book of short stories each chapter was interesting about one or two of hattie's children but i kept waiting for it to all come together and it never did","2758":"fantastic intense rich characters who stick and stay in your mind after you put the book down great read","2759":"there isn't enough background in each story it starts out very well and then skips around with little purpose","2760":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed this book the writing style was engaging and helped me to create a picture in my mind of each scene the she described i enjoyed learning a little more about each character in each chapter i thought the ending was very realistic though i was kind of thrown off by hattie's actions at the church i wish that the author developed hattie a little more so that we could learn more about her thoughts of her children's lives throughout the book and not just at the end i think that that i enjoyed this book the writing style was engaging and helped me to create a picture in my mind of each scene the she described i enjoyed learning a little more about each character in each chapter i thought the ending was very realistic though i was kind of thrown off by hattie's actions at the church i wish that the author developed hattie a little more so that we could learn more about her thoughts of her children's lives throughout the book and not just at the end i think that that would have helped me to understand her actions at the church a little better there are certain books that i keep around to read again later in life because i feel like they grow with you based on your life experiences this is one of those books i believe that if i read this book again i will discover new things about hattie and each character more","2761":"mathis uses a technique that faulkner debuted many years ago why the professional reviewers make such a fuss over this clever technique is beyond me the book was all right but nothing extraordinary good story telling but i would've like to have experienced more literary devices and intrigue will be curious to hear what my book club friends thought","2762":"this is a wonderful coming of age story in the 1920s of a black woman who struggles to make a proper home for her children and shiftless spouse hattie has migrated from rural georgia to urban philadelphia and reconciles herself to the dismal economic realities of romantic dreams now deferred and still she rises","2763":"listened to would have probably liked even more if i could have gone back and reread","2764":"this story uncovers a unique and living history which i thoroughly appreciated maddeningly sad unless you find the god element leavening which i don't","2765":"sweeping complicated sometimes difficult to follow the jumps in time and voices of characters this is a book that i enjoyed more after i finished it and reflected on it than when i was reading it","2766":"not exactly uplifting but good","2767":"wonderful book this is the story of an african american family that moved from the south to philadelphia in the early 20th century and the trials and challenges of the 12 children through the years each section of the story is told by telling the story of part of the life of one or more of the 12 siblings by the end of the book we've gotten a glimpse of how things have changed and not changed for african americans in this country over the course of almost a century excellent i listened to the audio version of this book which was also very well done and i highly recommend it","2768":"heartbreaking and so much powerlessness lack of self knowledge and far too many children the individual stories are well done and i have read 105 pages without stopping so it's pretty powerful however the individual chapters are disappointing in not having more obvious links between them it seems the children are doomed to move on after their parents made the decision to move from the south to better themselves maybe that's the point they do have a bit more freedom to choose what they will do with their lives this is the random house paperback do they not care that the physical book is so badly made the pages have to held open very tightly to be able to read the pages it is intensely uncomfortable and the print is in a small font and they had the cheek to charge $35 nz it's the sort of thing that forces you to buy an e book i ultimately found this book too depressing and could not work my way through all the descriptions of dysfunctional lives gave up about 3 4 way through","2769":"interesting look at african american culture probably a good book for discussion","2770":"while i did enjoy reading this book i found it a little annoying the way the story had no real flow each chapter was about one of hattie's children after their chapter that was it you didn't really hear about them again it was more of a collection of short stories rather than a novel 3 5 stars","2771":"i thought this was very well written it was a quick read and there were many powerful and emotional scenes i felt the characters were victims of circumstances and the time they lived combined with their own character flaws thought provoking i would recommend","2772":"i get why oprah who is a lover of beautiful word usage chose ayana mathis' debut novel this author can certainly whirl a pen and make pretty pictures with it however i didn't think the novel which is really a bunch of stories 12 to be exact loosely strung together and in no particular order merited the amount of fanfare it received the common denominator of the novel is of course the name on the cover hattie she is the mother and the 12 tribes are her kids the book spans her long unhappy life through the lives of her 12 children and a lackluster sometimes awful husband named august hattie's not a particularly likeable character she lacks tenderness she is harsh she makes bad choices she is stubborn but like most interesting characters hattie is deeply flawed what isn't great is that a true resolution for hattie or anyone in the book is never reached at least for me all the children's stories begged for more information more detail or at least a glimpse into what might have happened to this person the characters themselves grab hold of your interest but then when you want to follow them their chapter just stops the book ended and i was trying to pry apart pages because i was sure pages were stuck together there had to be more to the story than the weak fall off a low cliff end i might have given it less than three stars but like oprah i love beautiful writing i just wish it had been a more cohesive tale","2773":"while i liked the idea of this book i really did feel lost in the format the stories were great but there was never any resolutions everything was left open and unanswered ayana makes you feel for each one of these characters and then you're left feeling abandoned after each chapter not a great read for sentimental folks like myself","2774":"just ok wouldnt highly recommend it","2775":"touching story of hattie somewhat of a modern day job told through the stories of her twelve children and their trials and tribulations a harsh mother who was really just dealing with what life gave her and trying to prepare her children for what she thought life would inevitably deal them","2776":"just no if it wasn't for the ending i don't think i would have liked this book at all barely anything positive happens at all and the characters are not likeable or relatable at all the worst part about it is that the entire book managed to ring hollow and make me feel nothing despite unending seriously they never stopped coming tragedies","2777":"not sure how to rate how do you rate a sad book that's impossible to like but beautifully crafted","2778":"i found this book sobering there is an underlining current of doom in all the lives of hattie's brood love expressed through practicality because grief had sucked the joy and affection out of the young mother one tragic loss resonated across decades at least the book ended with a ray of hope that changes could be made read it when you feel chipper or you might not get through to the other side","2779":"i really liked this book and i liked it for a number of the reasons that i've seen other reviewers give for disliking it it doesn't follow the traditional structure of the novel it is true and the characters are often mostly lost after their cameo chapters and yes the time intervals are not evenly dispersed but sometimes in literature we recognize these kinds of authorial choices as innovations and creative moves other times we write them off as errors or bad choices because they are off the beaten path that we expect from a genre or an author i cannot help but think that sandra cisneros' house on mango street was likely greeted with the same sorts of concerns it isn't a real novel but in time the very things that made that piece slip outside the proper boundaries of the novel form are the same things that won it awards and a place in our english canon i believe that in time the same could be true for this book it is definitely worth a read","2780":"hard to rate loved the writing loved many of the chapters and characters individually could not put it down but taken as a whole it left me wanting so much more i need to see how each child fit into the family how was it really to grow up in that time and place we only see the aftermath and then only a small portion of it the separate story approach did not work at all for me","2781":"i wanted more time with each character it was either too rushed or too many characters","2782":" i think i'm going to give up on reading any book that oprah recommends i love oprah but i've come to realize that we definitely have very different tastes in literature i had stopped reading her recommendations previously because every book was just so depressing but this one had received such great reviews that i decided to give it a read bad idea i'm surprised i actually stuck with it as i was at times sad angry or just plain bored it wasn't a cohesive story each chapter gave us a short story about one of hattie's children at a certain age none of the chapters were linear jumping constantly back and forth in time i didn't really get to know any of them that well but really when it came down to it i didn't really care i found i wasn't really that interested in who they were or what their lives were about and hattie goodness what a terrible mother she was she never gave her children any affection and at times could be very abusive i remember one scene in particular hattie's daughter wanted to know where hattie was running off to as she was hungry and wanted dinner hattie smacked her in the face and yelled don't you ever ask me about my business hattie was running off to be with her lover yeah great mom not i don't recommend this book unless you want to waste your time reading something that will not enrich your life in any possible way","2783":" this book was okay but considering that it was one of oprah's book club books the first one that i've ever read i had higher expectations the story told of hattie and her children throughout their lives each chapter told the story of one of her children and where they were in that particular point in their life i found it strange because you weren't given an intro to the child you often started reading when they were already in their teens or beyond without any background information once their chapter ended you were then left with a lot of unknowns as the conclusion didn't address each child","2784":"i was engaged immediately and could not put down this book i loved the writing and the way the chapters described different children and different times in a historical fashion i wish the ending were somehow more powerful bringing hattie's children all back to her","2785":"i enjoyed this book although not thoroughly i wanted more character development for each child of hattie","2786":"a very melancholy book but very vivid stories of hattie's children my one wish though was that hattie could've had a least one child that was happy and at peace i'm literally exhausted from reading about hattie's children's struggles reading more than one child's story per day depressed me throughout the book i kept holding my breath wanting to read about one child being happy the ending worked although i would've liked to hear more about cassie before her mental disruptions i gave it four stars because it was a good read and the author is remarkable this is not a quick read book but one that you want to take your time with so you can soak up each character","2787":"this book is between 3 5 and 4 stars this is a book about hattie's eleven children told throughout a 50 year span each chapter is named after one or more of her children i love the way the book weaved hattie's life story throughout each chapter too the writing is breathtaking and the plot structure extremely creative the only downside is the extreme misfortune of the characters perhaps too much terrific writing though","2788":"a very depressing story","2789":"i heard the interview with the author on npr's morning edition and was definitely excited about the book i personally didn't love it i wish it was either a book of short stories or that the author made more of an effort to tie the characters together the writing is beautiful though","2790":"a tragic story this is what i would call this book a mother lives in terrible poverty and has twelve children her harsh parenting with child after child was so difficult for me to read about i was disappointed in the ending of the book that seemed to be like a one tone story","2791":"not a book to enjoy as it's so painful there is some beautiful writing and i do love hattie even as she struggled and suffers as others said greater connectivity between the stories would have made the book a bit easier but part of me enjoyed the separate sketches and the digging for connection amongst these family members","2792":"this was a book worth tracking down on cd at the library the 3 narrators brought the characters to life","2793":"i'd give this book a solid 2 5 it feels like it's all over the place and the story just is not coming together i love southern fiction and thought that i would love this too but it seems like a book of mini stories and not a novel c'mon oprah what were you thinking","2794":"great storytelling intriguing and honest portrayal nice choice oprah","2795":"three and a half stars","2796":"good story and easy read chapters are divided into telling the story of one character non linear timeline to the story at first i was worried i was not going to be able to keep the children straight but it ended up being a great way to tell the story","2797":"great first novel like a journal or memoir granted parts were difficult to read because of the subject matter the pain caused the shame invoked the sacrifices made like an appetizer plate i feel these stories are just scratching the surface of the true banquet which is their lives i was left wanting to know more about hattie and her children","2798":"this book was bleak the disconnect in the stories and the fact that once a chapter was over the character was gone made it hard to read none of the characters were particularly likable anyway","2799":" an interesting novel that tells the stories of hattie and august's children born and raised in the north by poor parents who grew up in the south under jim crow the kids have different stories but are any happy the stories were interesting though the book reads more as short stories than as a novel also i felt i would have understood a lot more about the kids if i had any idea about their birth order age at wwii etc instead i would get to a chapter and think wow this is the first i have heard of xxxx which made it a bit confusing i am also not quite sure every child had a chapter very readable but did any of these kids grow up happy and successful it is not quite clear what about pearl did living with parents with money make her any happier the kids seem to blame this on not having enough money food shoes and a somewhat absent father and domineering mother but what about pearl","2800":"good book to read","2801":"a lot of powerful moments in this book i really liked it","2802":"looking like a good read for the week end","2803":" i gave two stars for the writing and the summary sounded interesting the flow of the story wasn't so great and i found myself wondering who these people were realizing by the third chapter that it was about each of her children there were hardly any tie ins to each other except for a couple of stories here and there also all the characters were unlikable and obviously all mental and or depressed hattie herself i was annoyed with she obviously hated her life but kept having children and passing down her mental issues wtf sorry she did not come across as noble just a self absorbed and selfish person yeah the book sucked oprah","2804":"interesting but pretty depressing we come to understand more about hattie in each chapter even though each chapter focuses on one of her children","2805":"so tragically sad","2806":"appreciated the prose but not the storyline","2807":"very thought provoking this is definitely not a feel good book if oprah hadn't chosen it i probably wouldn't have read it i'm glad i did","2808":"i don't know why but this book just didn't grab me the writing was beautiful but the individual stories seemed disjointed somehow had there been longer chapters about each character i think i would have enjoyed it more but you didn't really get to know any of them so they fell a bit flat","2809":"life of a mother great history on northern migration and the trails of life from south to north","2810":"i really enjoyed this book as the writing was amazing but it took me a bit of time to get used to the structure","2811":"i loved the author's style of writing she was descriptive and compelling i didn't like how the book lacked a theme except that they were all children of the same mother it was kind of depressing hardship and sadness for each of the adult children with very little redemption or explanation i still enjoyed it and hope that ayana mathis will write more books of this type","2812":"the book told in a series of vignettes is too ambitious and the author doesn't pull it off because she doesn't pull it together i'm not sure how she manages to tell a dozen stories about 12 children from a single family and manages to keep them entirely separated from each other while each one begins to touch you as you start to get to know them the author runs off on to their brother or sister without ever returning it feels more like a series of unrelated short stories","2813":"this book was plumb awful i should have known not to read one of o's selections because they all seem to be extremely dark u0026amp depressing i was rooting for hattie to catch a break right up to the end i reckon you shouldn't read this one unless you've got the name and number of a good therapist to help you decompress afterwards","2814":"well written but the book didn't feel cohesive to me it felt more like interconnected stories but it didn't come together some of the characters are never mentioned after their chapter is over","2815":"disturbing story yet interesting nonetheless","2816":"okay it's oprah but it was good","2817":"i thought that this book had a great concept with each chapter focusing on each of hattie's twelve children and i thought the writing was very engaging which made it a quick read for me however the reason i only gave this book is three stars was that as others have pointed out the book seems disjointed it feels as though it could have been better connected to hattie who is the main character some chapters connected really well with hattie and others didn't feel like they belonged to her 'tribe ' overall i felt that this book could have been more cohesive","2818":"seemed like a series of short stories thought it was all kind of depressing i like books about dysfunctional families but this seemed to go on and on","2819":"i enjoyed this book and the stories of hattie's children although i found it to have a pretty abrupt ending for an oprah book selection though i was pleasantly surprised it would make a good selection for a book club discussion","2820":"this book started with a bang an amazing first few chapters that introduced the main character and her family the job like hattie however about half way through it seemed to run out of steam the children were only sketchily laid out we barely have a sense of their personalities to carry us through their individual tales of lives seemingly blighted by their mother's lack of demonstrative love while these subsequent chapters are interesting we want to know what's going on with hattie we revisit her in the last chapter or so but by that point she is an old woman the fires of rage that have sustained her are dying down i just didn't feel the book hung together successfully there are too many plot lines and characters over too many years it felt more like a collection of arbitrarily connected short stories the book is still well worth reading mathis is a beautiful lyrical writer and her insights into the african american experience in the 21st century are finely drawn and moving it was just a shame we lost touch with the fascinatingly beleaguered hattie","2821":"this is a story about an african american family in the early 1900's hattie and august are from 2 different classes in black america since august is out nearly every night having a good time hattie has all the responsibility of raising their 9 children and hattie is considered a cold mother by all of her children there is a chapter by each of the children telling his or her story from that point of view the ending is great and ties up the story nicely","2822":" most people i know had really strong reax to this book they either loved it or hated it i was ambivalent it was a fast entertaining read for me though a better great migration based novel was your blues ain't like mine bebe moore campbell i think what some people did not like about the book was the unanswered questions the secrets and unfilled spaces in the book but personally i like that you're left to put to the pieces together and understand each chapter through the child's experience maybe there are things that you the reader don't know because the character hasn't figured them out yet i'm fine with that jump starts the imagination","2823":"it is a good book i have to admit that at the beginning it was hard to get hooked on the book however as i kept on reading i wanted more i wanted to know more about each of the characters and i wanted to know more about each of their story","2824":" the twelve tribes of hattie is 10 short stories all dealing with hattie and her tribe of 12 kids the book is a lot like the olive kittredge book where she is mentioned or appears in every story in that book the same is here the first story stars hattie from then on she is shown to have a huge influence on all of her kids and her story is told through their stories an added positive to the book is that the stories are set in certain time periods in our history 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s that reflect the situation of the civil rights movement also the book shows the difference in being black and raised in alabama vs philadelphia very enlightening in that way i really enjoyed each of the stories there really wasn't one i didn't like one dealt with a musician another with a woman who has gone crazy and is trying to continue raising her child in her condition still another is a reverend who goes into spells all of them are complete short stories with beginning middle and ends and they are well constructed with fascinating complex characters beautiful description and eloquent dialogue i recommend the book for these reasons","2825":"fantastic narrators on the audio book version just a little depressing","2826":" each chapter dedicated to one of hattie's tribe interesting individual stories mainly filled with sadness damage and slight hope hattie herself a product of hard times and how she copes with each new challenge the writing is good easy to follow and our book club will discuss but not a book i highly recommend having said that it is difficult to even begin to imagine the everlasting repercussions of poverty racism an unexpectedly large family who you can not support and the discouragement that comes with bad choices and hopeless relationships","2827":"loved this book but if hattie had 11 children why did they call the book the 12 tribes of hattie i'm going to have to research that hmmm well after checking in with oprah the 12th tribe was her granddaughter this book was so interesting and each chapter was about one of hattie's tribe members it was also an interesting time in history the great migration i'd highly recommend this book it was hard to put down","2828":"while some of this story stays with me a lot of it doesn't there is this odd habit of remembering and comparing the stories of langston hughes with other authors who write of negro experiences no one compares well with him so far except perhaps the female author of their eyes were watching god zora this is the first of oprah's recommendations that has missed the mark for me still that is a good record just this one out of so many","2829":"this is a beautifully written 'first novel' although ms mathis has been tending to this craft for a long time hattie ' s tribe her children and grandchild are damaged but incredibly brought to life in a sensitive moving series of tales read this book","2830":"beautifully written and full of complex intricately designed characters i enjoyed the language and the humanity of the author but missed the presence of a real story to connect them all","2831":" i have had some difficulty choosing good books to read since i retired from teaching elementary school in 2009 i was accustomed to reading good children's literature which can be excellent reading i have since relied on book reviews oprah's book club which i don't always agree with and befriending folks browsing through books at costco the twelve tribes of hattie is a oprah's book club recommended read i was intrigued with the premise being about the great migration of people from the southern states to big u s cities this story takes place in philadelphia beginning in 1925 and concluding in 1980 it revolves around the matriarch hattie shepherd and her family of 9 children hattie a strong woman who lacks the tenderness all children crave has never recovered from the death of her twins born in the first year of her marriage her husband august is not a strong man but does try to show he cares about the babies that are born in rapid succession after the tragic death of the twins my impression of the account of the children's life and hattie's struggle is one of sadness and respect for hattie's and august'off spring i recommend ayana mathis's first novel because of the clear reality it portrays of the negative effect early neglect and absence of lovehas on the life of all humans i give it 4 out of 5 stars because the author was slow getting to the meat of the story","2832":"wonderful heartbreaking beautiful read it","2833":"such a good story and interesting structure to it as well good pace as well would like to see more from this author","2834":"this is a beautifully written book that documents the events that extinguished the hope and optimisim the young 15 year old hattie had at the outset of her marriage some have commented that this not a novel but a collection of short stories i beg to differ this is a novel and it is through lens of her children that we learn about who hattie is and the what she is made of the fact that these reflections offered by her children are not presented in chronological order is not offputting either we meet people at various stages in their lives what we know about them is in the present however if the relationship continues we find out more about them and past events in their lives our knowledge of these events are not necessarily presented in chronoligical order we learn them in bits and pieces and so we come to know hattie at the beginning we find out how hattie left georgia and moved with her mother and sisters to philadelphia the hopes and dreams she had for her life in the north were shattered after the needless death of twins she loves her children but does not demonstrate her love through affection the hugs and kisses that mothers normally bestow upon their children she wants them to be tough enough to be able to weather the storms of life that are surely to come their way her love is demonstrated by the way she has to struggle to put food on the table because her husband is self centered and more concerned with looking good and going out with his friends than he is about seeing to the needs of his family he seems oblivious to the hardships he has imposed upon his family hattie is a survivor although she didn't live the life she dreamed of she managed to carve out an existence and in the end she found peace some reviewers compared this book to isabel wilkerson's the warmth of other suns which was a disservice the only thing that they have in common is that they were written during the period known as the great migration ms wilkerson's book is not a work of fiction she spent twelve years researching the book and getting the know the four individuals who were the subjects of her book her's is more of a sociological study of the period as told by the four individuals whose lives she chronicled the twelve tribes of hattie a work of fiction and is a story that reflects the life of many who migrated from the south during this period instead of realizing their dream they lived a dream deferred","2835":"very sad stories but engaging you kept wanting someone to have made it","2836":"i really really liked this book as my 4 stars indicate story of hattie who leaves the south for the north and then tells the tales of her many children through the years captivating engrossing all that good stuff a book that you read like and then recommend to your friends","2837":"at first i was a little put off by this book but then i realized its a book of characters within a family each with their own chapter each family member really comes alive and jumps out at you and they are so different just like in real life the author has a gift for character development and authentic dialogue i look forward to reading something else by her in the future","2838":"i started out not liking this book but by the end i grew to appreciate the excellent writing and honest portrayal of individuals in real life situations that are not always happy it is not the style of book that i prefer but it was very well done","2839":"short stories about each child good history but every character was depressing","2840":"the overall framework of having different short stories or novellas or whatever from the different points of view didn't really help everything hold together as a cohesive story for me mathis is good at setting up a story with gaps to create a kind of suspense that allows her to go back and fill in the missing pieces however","2841":"good and thought provoking novel hard to separate feelings about the main character hattie she's a very complicated and complex character well written and good historical context","2842":"i want to love this book but it has left me with more questions than anything it had so many storyline and characters that each could have been a book on their own it felt disconnected and unfinished however i'm beginning to realize that it may be exactly how the author intended for it to feel like it is the story of a dysfunctional and disconnected who left many things unsaid and many things unfinished perhaps that is what the author wanted the reader to feel when they finished the book this feeling of knowing characters but not understanding them this feeling of wanting so badly to see reconciliation and redemption but seeing neither come to fruition perhaps just maybe this is what the author wanted you to feel","2843":"ayana mathis' debut novel is heartbreaking and tragic this is the story of hattie sheperd's migration from georgia to the north in search of a better life than that enjoyed by black americans in the south in the 1920's while her dreams are big marriage to an unreliable and lothario husband and the children she bears to him stifle her aspirations of a grand life each chapter is dedicated either to hattie or one of her children none of their lives are easy or seemingly fulfilling but there is determination and in some cases hope hattie is a determined women committed to raising her children as best she can in the face of disappointment and dire poverty these are the beautifully written stories of american lives","2844":"this was actually 12 stories one about each of hattie's kids linked together only by that fact and that they were each a mess","2845":"this was a good book a great introduction to all of hattie's children and her interactions with them i think that i would be great if the author could develop each of the characters into their own little short stories and have the children interacting more at these different points in their lives","2846":"typical oprah book well written and depressing","2847":"dark and twisty can't say i liked any of the characters consistent and intriguing themes throughout so ultimately a well written and excellent novel by this author ill be wary to read future books if they're just as depressing but hey if 'art mimics life' then this is a realistic portrayal although i'm no historian to this era and of the great migration","2848":"hmmm how to describe a definite oprah pick terrible circumstances and fascinating characters with a whole lot of oh wow i'm glad that's not my life thrown in hattie is an enigma so you learn about her from her children's perspectives and boy are they an interesting bunch","2849":"does oprah ever pick an uplifting book poignant and a page turner but not very happy","2850":"a very interesting way of writing about the life of a family mothers can definitely relate","2851":"meh it was just ok for me typical oprah bookclub read","2852":"couldn't finish this","2853":"fiction book discussion holt delhi library september 2015","2854":"this is one of those that i would happily give 3 5 stars to if allowed i enjoyed it but didn't love it i was happy each time i read it but it didn't draw me to picking it up during the day when i had extra time that each chapter worked as it's own independent story worked well in this book and each character was interesting and intriguing i'm not sure i will remember it too many months down the road however","2855":" this book is worth reading although it is unrelentingly sad if you are already disgusted by human nature and feeling downtrodden don't read it right now it might push you over the edge that said it was well written and interesting reminiscent of olive kitteredge by elizabeth strout the main character hattie speaks in her own voice but her character is also filtered through the eyes and experiences of her children the stories examine the way that people can be very close and yet remain a mystery to those around them","2856":"although this is ayana mathis's first book it is very well written and her writing is very intelligent and poetic without being too high brow the characters were realistic and well developed and reminded me of my own family members great job","2857":"hattie is the matriarch of a family of 11 children each of whom the reader meets in a separate chapter of this book but this story is more than a family recital but also a story of race and the black migration north after wwii and how that also affects this family in the first chapter we learn of hattie's miserable childhood and her escape from the south only to be devastated by poverty and abject conditions which kill heartbreakingly her first children infant twins that hardens hattie so totally that each of her future children are also tainted hattie august and the siblings' lives are seen through the individual children's stories but the family tribe as a whole can only be glimpsed through the moments of time from the 40's to the 80's of each child's life the stories of six and alice and ella are sad yet so moving but my favorite story was that of bell who tried so hard to separate herself from her mother only to find how strong the connection remained by then hattie recognizes how destructive her methods are for making her children strong because life is so hard each of these stories could be expanded into a book of their own and each leaves the reader to imagine what came before or after but it all started with the catastrophic event of the twins deaths not a day went by that hattie did not feel their absence in this world the empty space where her children's lives should have been the times and experiences of each child and ultimately a grandchild creates several unique tribes but each is still also bound by the heaviness of their mother's life","2858":" i had such a intense dislike for this book that i feel maybe i'm being unfair or just cranky as i get older this time period place and circumstance has been written about with such frequency maybe i've just reached my own saturation point i found the characters stereotypical even though well written if that makes sense and just the whole thing was one unending tale of woe and misery from start to finish i wish i had given up after the first chapter but since it garnered so much praise i felt compelled to finish it and honestly its like i've been betrayed or mislead given that this is the author's first novel i harbor a bit of guilt for for my harsh criticism but that's just how strongly i felt about it","2859":"i didn't particularly like this book but the writing was skillful so it doesn't deserve two stars i think i would have preferred it if there was more linking between characters so that it would feel like what i am reading is relevant too often i'd get through a chapter only to feel that i'd read it for nothing and that it didn't contribute to the plot at all","2860":"not really a novel per se more a series of loosely connected short stories very vivid character portraits and vignettes but not a lot of plot","2861":"thank you to oprah for choosing this book for her book club 2 0 every child of hattie and her and her husband and other characters she came across in her life were given just enough depth to create a continuously interesting read the organziation of the book kind of made the novel feel like series of short stories that were some how going to come together in a conclusion the writing of ayana mathis was just the right amount of flower and casual the book touched on series of topics including sexuality mental illness faith sickness love loss grief and internal conflict and self growth the ending can mean something different for somebody else but for me spoiler alert she kind of did find the lord she doesn't know it yet but now she's possibly beginning to show emotions and becoming vulnerable its a fresh new beginning at her ripe old age great read","2862":"this book was beautifully written however i gave this book a lower rating because i didn't like the writer's approach of devoting one chapter to each of hattie's children once we get to know a character a little we move on to the next i still don't feel as though i know the main character hattie although her children provide a mirror that helps us get glimpses of her i still don't know what really makes her tick i look forward to reading other works by this author","2863":"i would have liked to give it 3 5 stars i think i would have enjoyed this more if i hadn't read reviews previous to reading","2864":" a very good read mathis' voice and style gets stronger and more sophisticated as the pages turn she has toni morrison undertones as far as depth level of sensitivity to humanity and character development yet she still has her own distinct voice even her characters' voices resonated well but hers was not lost in the mix that made my intro to her writing much smoother i'm not crazy about the structure where each chapter chronicles one of hattie's bloodlines that part feels a bit too calculated otherwise mathis' debut novel could easily pass for her third or fourth","2865":"3 5 stars really","2866":"a tough read in some parts some powerful characters and some that are not quite as dynamic i felt a little ambivalent at the ending and could kind of tell i would feel that way 80 pages from the end while shifting perspectives works it can also negatively affect your relationship with the book","2867":"why did i resist reading this for so long so good","2868":"heartbreaking but beautifully written","2869":"this book felt like many interconnected short stories all of them were good but i felt a lack of follow through for me the book fell short leaving me feel like something were missing there was a lot of roaming around in a sense but nothing really happened i was disappointed","2870":"first chapter amazing really drew you in but the rest was so disappointing like a collection of short stories with barely tenuous links characters that were flat or i just didn't care for such a shame had great hopes","2871":"i really liked how this book was broken down into sections each told fro the perspective of one of hattie's children with other characters' povs thrown in as well it was really interesting to get to know hattie not from her own internal dialogue or a narrator but from the people in her life some of the chapters felt like short stories and sometimes felt rather disconnected but as a whole they were very effective","2872":" i really loved this book the twelve tribes of hattie are the stories of her 11 children and one of her grandchildren it takes place between 1925 and 1980 when she leaves the south and moves to philadelphia for a better life hattie is so overwhelmed by life's losses and disappointments that she is unable to enjoy life or to love her children i would have liked more connection between the chapters and to hear more about what happens to each child there are no strong male characters it did seem unfortunate that all the men were losers when i read other reviews i didn't like that several different people said this author is no toni morrison or this author is no alice walker no this author is ayana mathis what makes you think she's trying to be someone else i will definitely read more of her writing","2873":"this book seemed fine enough but for some reason i just couldn't get into it it took me a long time to finish i'm not exactly sure what i didn't like","2874":"i read this book in less than two days fantastic characters are beautifully drawn wish it had been longer","2875":"sad but then most of oprah's picks are i enjoyed the writing and would definitely reccommend it","2876":" this book caught my attention prior to it becoming a part of oprah's book club 2 0 the story was similar to my own grandmother mattie as she also migrated from the south for a better life up north i would give this story a 3 star but i'm forced to only give it 2 as the layout wasn't the best a chapter for each child at different moments and years doesn't give you any insight into how they were truly a family the author does get a huge kudos for the her detailed descriptions of settings she made me feel as if i was right there alongside the characters i appreciated this very much as i often think about whether or not i would have been able to survive in a time when blacks had real struggles against overt racism i look forward to reading more from ms mathis","2877":" this is an account of a young african american woman who moves from georgia to philadelphia with her husband and infant twins each chapter is about the lives of one or in the case of the twins two of her 11 children the final chapter is about her granddaughter although the book is well written i am not sure i liked it because of its generally negative theme hattie herself is incapable of expressing affection to her children her marriage is bad her children's lives are for the most part unhappy the book is certainly worthy of discussion about the relationship between mothers and children and about hattie's strengths and weaknesses i have one quibble with the book in the book the twins die in infancy no spoilers here it is on the book jacket for lack of medicine a few pennies would have cured fact check the babies died in 1925 penicillin wasn't discovered until 1928 the babies didn't die because they were poor or because their mother was young they died because pneumonia often killed people before there were antibiotics","2878":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i was torn about how to rate this book the writing is powerful and evocative but the structure is not effective it seems more a collection of short stories with one character in common than a novel unity is lacking each chapter is about one of hattie's children but the stories are not linked beyond that and once the child's tale is told we don't come back to it the weakest link in the book is hattie we never really learn who she is or what she did to mess up her children and mess the i was torn about how to rate this book the writing is powerful and evocative but the structure is not effective it seems more a collection of short stories with one character in common than a novel unity is lacking each chapter is about one of hattie's children but the stories are not linked beyond that and once the child's tale is told we don't come back to it the weakest link in the book is hattie we never really learn who she is or what she did to mess up her children and mess them up she did each child is damaged some more severely than others and in somewhat similar ways e g inability to form mature relationships promiscuous hypocritical delusional even insane that in itself stretched credibility for me in real life in the best of families some kids are damaged and in the worst some aren't what i kept wondering is why are these children so damaged and why in these particular ways that being said this is a first book and an impressive debut i was engaged in the stories throughout despite the structural problems more","2879":"the saga of hattie shepherd is told through a series of interrelated short stories about each of her 11 children and one of her granddaughters as we witness the affects of their relationships with hattie we learn what kind of woman hattie was born in georgia she moved to philadelphia with her mother and two sisters during the great migration when she was 15 years old the book focuses on the devastating affect that her first children's baby twins deaths had on her personality her psyche and her subsequent inability to emotionally nurture her other children none of them emerged unscathed what i found disturbing about this book was the negative images of every single man in it the women didn't fare much better had i as a middle class caucasian written this book people would have rightfully called me a complete racist i wondered as i read it how other people reacted to this book oprah winfrey herself has nominated this book for her bookclub and indeed it is being discussed currently in the oprah book club of goodreads maybe i missed something here and i'm hoping that some of you gr friends tell me what that is","2880":"hauntingly beautiful book about one womans struggle for the survival of her children and the arduose and sometimes heart breaking decisions she needed to make a social history of the very best","2881":"i have never paid oprah any mind but i hate that her 'thoughts' and underlined passages are in my kindle copy only a few pages in but it's not grabbing me","2882":" throughout this book i disliked hattie and felt sad for her children the final moving scene with her granddaughter sala made me rethink my attitude toward hattie i think it was in that final moment that i decided i liked the book this novel follows a young mother's journey from georgia to philadelphia intertwined with hattie's story are the stories of her children the kindle version of this book which i borrowed from the public library said hattie's children were representative of the great migration and that hattie's attitude toward her children could be seen as her desire to make sure they were prepared to stand up to the world although i could see this point of view it did not make me any more sympathetic toward hattie overall i think this book is a good read for people who do not need a hard and fast story line there are stories within this novel but i'm not sure there's an easily defined plot with a traditional beginning middle and end this book is good for readers who like books that wander because there are so many shifts in time and perspective","2883":"i liked the book a story full of grief and regret with hope nestled in among these tales of life","2884":"i listened to this as an audio book so the fact that the book is comprised of short stories with very little or none as some would view it overarching plot didn't bother me it was a slice of life book that showed how different the lives of the 12 siblings turned out as well as the struggles hattie herself endured i found the ending to be a bit abrupt but i think that was due to the audio aspect","2885":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was tragic hattie's love for her children is fierce and mostly unrecognized i enjoyed how each child had a chapter devoted to them either in their voice or if they were too young hattie's voice it was interesting to me that august and hattie stayed together in spite of the affairs heartache and desperation hattie is a mother to reckon with loving but not gentle","2886":"love this book such rich language and wonderful characters an american classic","2887":"i like spending a little time with different members of hattie's family but at the end i was left wondering what happened with most of them","2888":"parts of this book were a 5 parts of this book were a 2 3 thus 4 star","2889":"horribly sad no plot i really need to stop reading oprah recommendations","2890":"i loved this book hattie has had life thrown at her without a manual in that day and time the coldness of a mother wasn't uncommon i hope there would be a part two just to see the ending for hattie u0026amp sala","2891":"the stories in the book are well developed my only concern is the structure of the novel it really makes connecting the various elements of the text complicated and at times frustrating although it was frustrating to read at times i did enjoy the ending","2892":"depressing novel about the great migration lacked any likeable characters and a bit disjointed for me","2893":"this was a blind date book from the public library i was hesitant to read it it wasn't something i'd select for myself it sounded too depressing but the writing was so wonderful that i enjoyed reading the less than happy stories of hattie's children","2894":"i had a really hard time getting through this book it was really depressing","2895":"great book family relationships the american dream and life disappointments hattie is a complex woman who you can dislike but identify with during the decades","2896":"i don't understand the reviewers who complain about the lack of sustained narrative arc in what is essentially a collection of related vignettes short stories read olive kitteridge if you have not already done so to enjoy another excellent example of this genre the compilation of bits and pieces of hattie's life learned through stories of her children is exactly what i loved about this book that and the beautiful writing 4 5 stars","2897":"what a life lives segregation poverty lack of education tough living","2898":"i thought this was a great book short stories always leave me wanting more though","2899":"oh wow this one was interesting and a heart breaking the pace of the book was bumpy as the narrator of the story changed to different people to show different perspectives it started off with a bang and then slowed to a simmer the ending was a little more tame than the beginning the emotion just jumped out of the page and into my mind and brought tears to my eyes before i was ready to accept what i knew was on the next page the characters were realistic and the story stays with you","2900":"this was sad and heartbreaking yet i believe had alot of truth in it for the african american culture during these times i had to skip over parts of chapter 2 and almost abandoned the book the next day i picked the book back up and didn't put it down until finished","2901":"woeful characters but good book to discuss what was the root cause of all this dysfunction","2902":"before you could give to much to just one person their story was over i wanted more in terms of getting to know you instead it was speed dating whew","2903":" this book made for interesting reading there were many times when i caught myself saying oh my the story begins with hattie shepard a 15 year old black girl who flees georgia for a better life in the north it's 1923 hattie lands in philadelphia there she marries august a nice guy at heart but someone who fights his own demons drinking and womanizing he brings hattie nothing but disappointment and despair august and hattie's first children are twins who die of pneumonia because there is no money to get medical treatment hattie becomes more and more discouraged that life will never get any better and she wallows in self pity over the years there comes nine more children who hattie raises with a stern hand and a cold heart the chapters depict and characterize each of these children telling how being born to hattie affected their lives forever and not in a good way the twelve tribes of hattie is an oprah 2 0 book club book and is worth reading if you're fond of learning about how people of poverty live this book has little to do with race and more about to do with raising children when there is no means to take care of them and raising them with out an out pouring of a mother's love surely a common issue in today's society","2904":"this was ok it seemed like a book oprah would like the separate stories seemed too disjointed and each was disappointing in its own way somehow i expected something more of the ending","2905":"made me think about 1 influence i have on my kids 2 thankful that we don't have more than 2 children 3 how kids under the same roof can turn out so different good summer read found the characters interesting and like the device of learning about hattie through the eyes of her children their memories","2906":"typical oprah book full of angst regret complicated relationships racial strife i wasn't wowed by it was glad it was short was it about love and forgiveness maybe","2907":" instead of a novel this felt like a series of short stories with the central theme being hattie i didn't mind that each chapter was written in a different way with a different voice and in a different year or decade actually besides the first chapter which really pulled me in my heart broke for the young hattie and bell's story i enjoyed alice's chapter the most because it put me in the mind of virginia woolf's mrs dalloway at the end i felt as if i'd read a well written book with interesting characters that i was never fully invested in i was and am indifferent","2908":"reads almost like short stories loosely related to each other powerful first chapter and final chapter hattie always pushed forward and showed that it isn't too late to change","2909":"i really like the novel told through short stories style usually this collection of stories about the children of hattie were mostly depressing it was interesting the way these children could grow and turn out so different from one another but the brief glimpse of each of them was far too brief to actually know how different or how similar they may be there was some beautiful writing throughout","2910":"the format in which ayana mathis used to write this book exceeded the actual story being be told while it is clear that the loss of hattie's twins leave her harden stricken with grief and ultimately unwilling to ever express the slightest bit of genuine compassion for her living children one can't help but wonder if hattie is entirely to blame for the outcome of their lives as humans i think that it's important that at some point we take full responsibility for our own individual lives life is not always perfect and parents don't always make the best decisions in regards to what they feel their kids are in need of and often the smallest needs are over looked i e love affection and moral support each one of these characters seemed to be battling some sort of internal issue hattie wasn't strong enough to deal with everything she dealt with and thinking back i honestly feel like she mentally checked out in a way leaving her tribe to ultimately raise themselves each one of her children outside of ella because she was so young struck me as capricious i enjoyed this novel and i hope it brings awareness this ongoing battle some parents face when they aren't prepared to be efficient providers","2911":"i hate to admit this but oprahs book club rarely steers me wrong this isn't a book you really like but it makes you think each of these characters is very real and had distinct personalities which i thought was incredibly from an authors talent perspective she convincingly wrote as a man woman and vastly different ages the great mitigation is a time in history that os ripe for a lot of stories and literature and i love reading novels in that setting","2912":"i wanted to love it but didn't gonna watch the interview with the author for a better understanding of the book updateafter watching the oprah interview i definitely appreciate the main character more and her struggles there are a lot of quotes and ideas that i loved in the book but i just did not find it an enjoyable read","2913":"i enjoyed some chapters more than others but overall it was boring to me a few of the chapters were interesting but most were not my rating is actually 2 1 2 stars i am glad be fine with this book","2914":"i enjoyed the writing style of this author and the tragic story of this african american family","2915":"difficult to follow depressing i never could connect with this one it had no flow i am surprised it was an oprah selection","2916":"3 5 really goodreads you must add a half star option excellent writing but since it was a collection of short stories and not a novel i was unable to really get vested in the characters like you would a true novel characters disappeared as quickly as they came","2917":"this book reminded me of three other books 1 the book of job 2 angela's ashes and 3 when bad things happen to good people the prose was delicious but you've got to be able to take reading a book about many many unhappy people to whom bad things happen","2918":" it's gribbing from the very first page only a few chapters in and am loving it totally loved it planning on purchasing it's the kind of book that needs to be unraveled layer by layer feel like i will learn more and more about each character each time i read it i started out having one opinion about hattie and ended with another opinion by the end it's very cool how the reader learns about her from each of her children and others in the story it's nice getting a more thorough view of someone","2919":" okay i have no idea how to rate this book i liked it more than i thought i would because this is not the book type i read usually at first it seemed boring but the further i had come the more i got sucked into the story but it was not a lovely story it was sad horrible and disgusting at some points and i got mad until i realised that this is how things are life is not a big happy journey so i liked the realness of this book i just wished the stories were connected somehow because most of the characters were mentioned just once and then never again","2920":" so yeah all of hattie's kids are messed up to be expected i guess for a mother to experience the pain of losing 2 children and then closing off emotionally to everyone else an interesting take on nature versus nurture nicely broken up by chapter with each one in the pov of a child i really responded to that even though it was not a linear timeline the end oh the end the last few pages are so redeeming and hopeful that it made me cry and it i thought about for weeks often that last moment comes to mind when i am with my own children and for that i will always recommend this book","2921":"i wanted to like this book so much more than i did it had an interesting premise and i thought it would tell an interesting story unfortunately it left me feeling a bit cold and i had a difficult time connecting to the characters at the end i couldn't really tell what the book had been about and i didn't really have much of an idea about hattie","2922":"wonderful writing from this impressive iowa grad","2923":"really a wonderful first novel the characters have depth her writing style is elegant but i was disappointed with the end it left me flat","2924":"well written and interesting but sad i really would have preferred to rate it 3 5 stars","2925":"although i don't usually like it when authors change the focus of a story this book changed focus 10 or 11 times and i still found it enjoyable each chapter ended with interesting insights into the character and the author's writing had the ability to draw you in and make you care about the character","2926":" this was a book that initially i didn't think i would appreciate as much hype as it was getting especially being chosen as an oprah book club pick i devoured the twelve tribes of hattie in 2 sittings and i can't remember the last time i read a book that i was as interested in this book tells 12 different stories all from the perspectives of hattie's twelve children each story had its own heartbeat and was perfectly shaped into a beginning middle and end each story while told chronologically was not in the birth order of the children and made for an interesting dynamic that i was not expecting mathis does a brilliant job of seemlessly tying these stories together to tell the main story which is hattie's through the eyes of her children most of the characters have major flaws and some of the stories rip your heart out and allow you to be grateful for the many intangibles that you have in your life highly reccommend this one","2927":"i really wanted to like this book it just felt so disjointed i do not feel as if i got one clear story i know the various stories should have built the characters of hattie and august but it wasn't thoroughly fleshed out enough for me","2928":"why does oprah always read depressing books read it for book club i probably wouldn't have read it otherwise well written easy to read just sad to me","2929":"it was depressing as others stated hattie's story could have been many a woman's story regardless of race it hit home reminding me of my grandmother who had eight children and felt stuck as hattie did most of the story came from her children's perspectives would have liked to read more from hattie herself","2930":"interesting never had a nurturing spirit yet 11 babies i understand how she feels in that with so many you never feel you get to enjoy each one just spend your time feeding cleaning and making sure they are all ok","2931":" disclaimer as a general habit i do not read oprah books i have no problem with people who turn things to gold as general habit so long as they do it with a strong sense of humility grace and remembering where they came from oprah tends to have amnesia when it comes to her roots as she was more upper middle class than back roads barefoot mississippi not going to lie i did an end zone dance when the cover of a million little pieces was blown the fact that that hopeless dribble was swallowed whole by her unquestioning entourage was even more entertaining the fact that none of them had gone to the dentist and gotten a local priceless the twelve tribes of hattie was on my list before it was on nooprah's the story read more as vignettes than an actual novel i honestly don't believe that stories designed like this have to come full circle to be successful disjointedly perfect the ending took on some form of courage can people find faith at the end of a hard road and come out on top or are they too needy to find much of anything besides their own self destruction","2932":"this book is extremely confusing to read and didn't take up my interest you don't really develop anything i ended up having to abandon this books after a chapter and a half","2933":"beautiful writing the characters are heartbreaking and i just wanted to know more about their lives though i loved the book i am left feeling unsatisfied like it wasn't quite finished","2934":"i might have given this more stars if i hadn't just finished another book that was similar in structure to it i really wanted something more linear than this one that's not the book's fault but there it is might still have come through with 4 stars if i hadn't felt i learned more about the title character from the jacket copy than from the book itself anyway good writing excellent ability of the author to assume the voices and points of view of a diverse set of characters","2935":"the book was just ok i liked reading about each of hattie's children but i feel like the book would've been better if it focused on one or two of the children's lives more in depth i would've liked to learn more about cassie and sala more didn't like the ending","2936":"hattie is the mother of a large family the family is a bit dysfunctional each chapter focuses on one of her tribes this is a great collection of stories that comes together to paint one picture of troubled family life","2937":"a good book and a sad book in many parts the hardship of these characters is well written but slow at times and confusing as it goes back and forth","2938":"this debut novel is about the plight of african americans in the twentieth century it tells the unhappy stories of hattie and her family of eleven children in the early 1920's at the age of sixteen hattie migrated to philadelphia from georgia with her mother and sisters soon after she became pregnant got married and lived a hard life of disappointment loss and unhappiness each chapter is about one or more of her children and their trials and tribulations while the chapters are connected by the familial relationships the book seemed like a collection of short stories the novel held my interest though i thought many of the characters were stereotypical and lacked depth","2939":"great writing however i couldn't get into the story parts of the characters chapters i found fascinating but then i get bored again and skim","2940":"feels like a very messy real story","2941":"this book was certainly interesting hattie's many offspring tell her story through their eyes and the reader sees how siblings can all see a different person as their mother the tricky part about this story is i would get confused about the siblings who was who and i also thought it was a really depressing portrait of life not that everyone's lives are happy but it just dragged me down","2942":"i loved this book couldn't put it down once i got into it a definite must read","2943":"had great hopes thinking it would be similar to the warmth of other sons but it wasn't devoting one chapter to each child made for disjointed reading and few of the characters were very likeable","2944":"enjoyed this book but wanted more than i got","2945":"i would be hardpressed not to like a book that has a fight on greene street the family living on wayne and frequent trips to tulpehocken germantown philadelphia holds a lot of history and spirits and ayana mathis' novel full of sadness and missed chances to be kind recounts the lives of nine children each child's chapter almost acts as its own short story and in many ways the chapters could be read in isolation except for the fact that the cold and quick to anger mother hattie holds the story together this novel falls into the publically crying genre as the opening chapter philadelphia and jubilee left me a weeping mess before 10am on a rush hour f train to bryant park other chapters had me crying as well the tenderness which hattie lacks for anyone she loves is found in mathis' lovely prose and nicely slow storytelling while reading one feels that she is growing up with hattie her children and germantown i had the distinct plelasure of writing and working with ayana in april of 2015 her ability to negotiate backstory within a narrative a trait poo pooed in many writing workshops for not dropping a reader into live action is brilliant and exemplary i ended up loving this novel and the stoic hattie a very good amount by the work's last line mathis has also left me wondering about all of the mothers in poor and working class 1920s philadelphia specifically my great grandmother who had 16 children whom i know nothing about mathis successfully encourages the reader to consider origins and beginnings that may be overlooked and go unnoticed and in doing this she takes a subtle but strong feminist stance advocating for the recalling and remembrance of all that our female ancestors have done for us without expecting recognition praise fortune or thanks this novel is a bittersweet and lovely read","2946":"i stopped reading after about 4 chapters","2947":"ehhhhhh i'm not sure if its the writing style or lack of plot but not something i'd recommend to a friend as a must read skip it","2948":"i enjoyed the stories told in the story however i agree with other reviewers this book reads more like a collection of short stories than the story of hattie a fair read","2949":"tales of the odd and amusing and desperate lives of hattie and her children some of which i could be engaged by and others where i lost interest","2950":" the twelve tribes of hattie is an incredibly moving though occasionally confusing book it is put together by linked stories of each of the nine children born to hattie who with her mother and sisters moved up to philadelphia from georgia durga during the great migration to try and find a better life instead she became pregnant with twins at age fifteen and she married their father august the first story is of their death by pneumonia something that might have been cured had they had the money for medial care hattie never forgets this loss and her cold exterior to her subsequent children earns her the name general but as she later says her children did not think her a kind woman -- perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young '' mathis writes ''she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind '' but maybe by teaching them that lesson their mother would there are a lot of characters to keep track of all interesting and deserving of compassion","2951":"this was a typical oprah pick in that it was an very sad story the main character which this story centers around is hattie a mother raising her famiy in the most extreme poverty and the life changing event that affects the way she interacts with her children told in the perspective of each of her children gives this book make for a very interesting read","2952":" it`s hard for me to describe this as a novel for it appears to be more of collection of short stories which are all dedicated to different events in the life of hattie's children as always with this kind of collections some parts are better than others i enjoyed the writing and most of the stories had been touching and gave a small glimpse to the era in which each story was happening the downside was that at times it felt a bit too melancholic that`s not necessarily a bad thing but it felt too forced","2953":" i was underwhelmed by this book especially given the amount of critical acclaim it's attracted it's basically a collection of short stories each focusing on a different child of hattie which could have been extremely powerful but there simply aren't enough unifying narrative threads woven throughout to make the book feel like a cohesive and meaningful whole taken separately some of the stories are affecting but failed to ever make me feel like i was reading something truly fresh and original the book isn't bad by any means but it isn't great either","2954":" this book just didn't seem to do it for me i don't think there was much about the great migration as was touted in the blurb the characters didn't seem to be all that connected to each other even though they were all part of one family each character each story just seemed ok as a stand alone and since mathis said the book started as individual short stories that makes sense but really stretch the boundaries of my belief in a lot of ways my favorite chapter was the one with bell also there was very little redeeming quality in any of the characters which made them not only hard to like but also left me apathetic about them altogether overall this book was a disappointment mathis is a good writer and there were some lines that made me jealous at her facility with language but the book just left me asking so what","2955":" each chapter is tells the story of one sometimes two of hatti' s children beginning with hatti being a child of seventeen married and pregnant with twins she and her husband move north during the great migration in a heart wrenching first chapter hatti' s twins die of pneumonia the rest of the chapters take place during various times in her following children's lives there was beauty in this pain the children grew up with an emotionally dead mother and in poverty each one grew into very different lives in the final chapter hatti is 71 and faced with raising her 10 year old granddaughter because her daughter cassie is mentally ill at that point i could see hatti finally take another step in her grief over the loss of her first children even though it was to blame god it was still hopeful that she would finally give her love instead of hide it away a triumphant first novel","2956":"hattie shephard moved to philadelphia in 1923 marries and gives birth to twins all when she's 15 years old her small twins die young from pneumonia and hattie is devastated from the loss over her life she has 9 more children hattie is tough determined and not about to put up with any nonsense she struggles with a wandering husband too many bills and lots of mouths to feed each chapter in this novel tells the story of one of hattie's children a unique storytelling choice her children all have distinct opinions on hattie's mothering techniques and have found their own paths in life","2957":"generational curse book i wish at least one character would have ended up happy geez lots of readers enjoyed this book i am certainly in the minority group","2958":"what is here is written very very well i felt it ended rather abruptly however and i wanted so badly to hear more about hattie's children","2959":"this novel gives the reader a compelling look into the life of the main character hattie and her family it was interesting to read about her family and how hattie's choice to move from georgia to the north during the great migration shaped her world view with that being said it did take me a while to get through this book due to the structure of the novel i'd find myself engrossed in the story of a particular child which is usually a good thing however once that child's chapter is over his or her story is abandoned and you move on to the story of another child i understand that the novel is supposed to be about hattie and her children's perspectives of their mother but it was still a bit disappointing to leave behind a good character it was still a decent read","2960":"spoiler alert lots of different points of view from hattie's children but never linked well together i hated the ending","2961":"compelling but more so in the early stories than in the later ones maybe because the unrelenting hardship and misery get harder to take in i guess i shouldn't expect happiness in a book with an oprah's book club sticker on it","2962":"the story was okay but i was most interested in the manner in which the story was told","2963":"i expected way more than it delivered it wasn't bad just okay i liked franklin's story the best","2964":"debut author ayana mathis burst onto the literary scene when her novel the twelve tribes of hattie was selected as an oprah book club selection and it is fair to say that she is a rising star mathis tackles the great migration by creating a family filled with unforgettable characters their matriarch hattie is introduced to readers in the opening chapter as a young girl of seventeen the year is 1923 and hattie who has recently moved from georgia to philadelphia in hopes of a better life finds herself struggling to keep her infant twins from succumbing to pneumonia just a child herself she questions her decision to marry and have children at such a young age and wonders how she can endure yet endure she does hattie goes on to have nine more children each the subject of a chapter in the novel in her advanced age she is called upon to raise a twelfth child her granddaughter it is through the stories of these twelve children that the readers learn of hattie's resiliency and character while her children do not often receive the love and tenderness they crave it soon becomes evident that hattie has exhibited great courage throughout her life and has been continually motivated to ensure that her children survive and thrive in a difficult world at times heartbreaking at others spirit lifting the twelve tribes of hattie is a debut that is not to be missed mathis develops strong vibrant characters and any one of the chapters could be developed into a novel of its own mathis is an author to watch","2965":"utterly depressing the author seemed bent on focusing on failure and everyone's inability to control themselves be it physically or emotionally all of the characters had this poor me attitude ugh","2966":"goodstory line follows the life of hattie back and forth through history through her eyes through her children's eyes through history's eyes a great reminder of how you really can't judge people for their actions because you have no idea what they have been through note i listened to it on tape and i think listening made it a better story","2967":"each of hattie's kids narrates a chapter there were only three kids i wanted to smack","2968":" i honestly don't know how i feel about this book their isn't an ounce of happiness in the book yet i was compelled to continue reading this was a book club book for me so otherwise i am not sure i would have read it i didn't know anything about the book when i started it it was interesting how the author chose to write the book making each child a chapter at first i thought it a little odd but the more i read and at the end i realized everything was tied together well i don't have any sense of closure on what happened to anyone but i'm thinking that is the desired effect by the author if that is the case she definitely excelled at her goal","2969":"i think oprah got a bit carried away while reviewing this book however it was beautifully written and quite sad","2970":"the story of hattie and her family told in episodic chapters is beautifully written the stories told are varied but each is powerful in its own way the author did not gloss anything over in the stories she told which often left this reader feeling uncomfortable but necessarily so the book is a \"soft\" history lesson in the history of black experiences in this country during the 20th century and it is within this bigger context that the book can truly be appreciated","2971":"very good book but i wanted more connection between the characters","2972":" i was not too sure what to think of this until the end but now i think i do and that this is a good book the character of hattie does come out really well and in a believable way through the individual chapters one about each of her children and there were so many of them it is not easy to bring it all together the lives of the children are important for the plot in that they serve the purpose of shedding light on hattie but the details and curiosities about their life are trivial and more often left out altogether on the other hand i'm not sure whether it was all brought together well enough it was certainly well finished though i don't necessarily mean a happy ending that's up to the individual reader to decide it was a bit shallow in that there were too many lives to explore and if there were to be more detail one would have ended up with a huge book all in all in the very end it has accomplished what i think it set out to accomplish getting to know hattie and finding compassion for her in your heart","2973":"this book did not live up to the hype the characters were so negatively drawn that i just couldn't root for them the author obviously takes a dim view of men for there wasn't one positive male portrayed in the book i don't think oprah and i have the same tastes in literature","2974":"lovely easy prose i thoroughly enjoyed this book more a collection of short stories than a novel each chapter is devoted to a turning point in the life of one of hattie's children or to hattie herself","2975":" i really enjoyed this book if contained a number of rich themes connecting the people and times i was most impacted by the theme of damage which set the tone for hattie's life she was already different from her mother and sisters then the traumatic loss of her father and the life she knew a clandestine escape out of jim crow georgia compounded by the loss of her two babies all came together to create a damaged hattie who raised damaged children she was unable to see their spirits as she said but hattie's strength made her one of the lucky ones who are able to pull their love through the damage so they can see and save the people they love sala will benefit from the new hattie i wanted to know how ella faired with her desperate aunt and indifferent uncle otherwise i thoroughly enjoyed the twelve tribes of hattie","2976":" quite simply one of the most beautifully written novels i have read in a long time sentences that capture emotion and perception in a way that strikes a chord and stays with you this novel examines the great migration through hattie who arrives in philadelphia from georgia as a 17 year old in 1923 and all of her children and one grandchild 11 the 12 tribes as they cope with difficulties of their eras and individuality from the initial harrowing scene of hattie desperately trying to save her newborn pneumatic twins in a steam filled bathroom to six a philandering minister who returns to the south floyd her gay jazz musician son to the final two heartbreaking tales of bell and cassie i was swept up in these lives hattie is a presence throughout as her grit and efficiency in making do with her own troubles her husband august is no good while raising all her children yet there is always love and a completely other side to hattie when she is with her lover friend lawrence a unique lens to view the african american diaspora to the north and the trials and tribulations joys and triumphs of the 20th century for them excellent excellent book","2977":" i have almost always been depressed by oprah's book club choices and this one was no different i wanted to stop reading after the first chapter but then i fell in love with the author's characterizations they were separate stories interwoven with a very thin common plot if the author had developed the book with a strong plot line that tied all the stories together it would have been 1000 pages plus i don't usually like short stories but each of these characters was so strong i felt it was a more compelling way to develop the book","2978":"i never really know what to expect from an oprah book club choice but i enjoyed this one you will come away with the feeling that your family childhood wasn't as crazy as you thought it's told from several different pov's and it's a quick read i finished in a day and a half it's the author's first novel which is hard to believe i look forward to anything she writes in the future","2979":"overall i did not like this book the beginning was better than the ending it just dragged on i found the writing style a bit confusing as well would not recommend","2980":"i was really looking forward to reading this book but was a little disappointed each of the twelve tribes of hattie gets their own chapter well some share a chapter which makes the book read more like a group of connected short stories than a novel and the short story is not a favorite genre of mine perhaps because of the short story format which allows the author fewer pages to draw in the reader i did not become particularly connected to any of the characters and there were a number who were quite frankly unsympathetic i look forward to seeing what the other members of my book club think","2981":"too disconnected to enjoy story","2982":" i heard the author ayana mathis interviewed on npr and the book sounded interesting i had read others on the great migration and was looking forward to reading this story but it's less on the great migration and much more individual character studies some better than others the author is clearly an excellent writer and i suspect we will be hearing much more from her in the future but this book her first left me a little puzzled the main character hattie left georgia at age 15 and settled in philadelphia married a man named august and began having babies the book follows the stories of her 11 children with one chapter devoted to the first two and one chapter for each of the other nine children one final chapter deals with her grandaughter sala there are many trials and tribulations for hattie and her children and though the vignettes were good the book didn't hang together for me i wanted to know more about the lives of the children over time a more complete integration of the family history as i finished one chapter on one child i was left wondering what happened afterward it's not bad for a first book but there are others i would recommend more","2983":"i am just not sure what to think about this book kind of strange a little more foul than i thought necessary had some good parts had some not so good parts oprahs book lists tend to be of the same basic theme not sure i am a fan i keep simmering on this book still trying to decide what i think i may update later","2984":"received this arc last september 2012 free from the publisher as a gift for mocha girls read book club 1st anniversary they sent us printed manuscript copies of the book bond and with a clear plastic cover then less than a month later it is announced as oprah's book club pick i was shocked when i heard this i was thrilled to see a book i have in arc form is on her list but i never got to it for whatever reason this book is written unlike most books it centers around hattie shepherd a young mother of many children each chapter is written by and about her children in their unique voice their stories tell you about their issues problems and difficulties as well as their relationship with hattie and their father i thought the book was well written and it painted the bleak picture of hattie and her children's situation clearly as time went on as a debut author ayana mathis did a great job expressing the despair hattie goes through as see watches her new born twins suffer in the first chapter then why am i giving it such low stars well it is the ending and the lack of conclusion the chapters are told by her children at different time periods but nothing gets resolved nothing is told to the read about anyone after the chapter ends i was invested throughout the book with each and every single person but when i finished the book i got no conclusions at all as to what happened to them through out the decades the children grow up leave and make their own way done that did not settle with me at all i need something to help me understand why they are all going though this and what is the purpose don't just drop me off and forget about me i need some time of closure without telling you any spoilers the ending felt like it was a beginning of a new chapter in hattie's voice i was so expecting that but nothing nothing","2985":"what a great book the book travels from 1920's to 1980's hattie has a love hate relationship with her children fascinating read about all of her children their struggles triumphs relationships etc i couldn't put it down","2986":"look at summer challenge 2013","2987":"at first i thought no i'm not following and then it took off~","2988":"too many negro tropes disjointed this is a short story collection it is not a novel","2989":"when is going to be over is what i kept thinking","2990":"very good writing i liked the style of how the book was written i would have liked an epilogue but it left me kinda flat","2991":" ayana mathis's the twelve tribes of hattie is certainly written in the tradition of many african american women writers i have read quite a bit of them and i found the prose and content of this recent novel to be a worthy addition to that tradition but also working to develop it further - to not only recreate it but to expand it in that vein the format of the novel with chapters dedicated to and primarily from the point of view of the children of the titular hattie stretches the family narrative across time bringing us from 1925 to 1980 letting the vignettes describe how the era of the great migration can still effect black life in the north and south fifty or more years later without being didactic--letting the pain and fear of separated families be both spectre and reality for hattie and her progeny i love the form and looked forward to each chapter to learn more of hattie children and in some cases more about hattie through them however as is bound to happen in a book organized in this way some characters are just more interesting than others leaving me with a desire to learn more about floyd for example than about bell i did enjoy the glimpses we see of characters in later chapters when they are no longer the focus but that just left me wanting to know more floyd for example the closet queer womanizing jazz horn player seemed to have spent some time as an adult living back with his parents but then later found some success as a musician i wanted to know more about his life about his struggle with his sexuality about his relationship to his family and thus about the family and therein might lie my biggest criticism of the book all the children seemed very separate - almost as if they lived separate lives did not really share a house except in their fear of their mother's wrath and disdain for their father only billups and alice have a sibling relationship that is developed and as such their chapter seemed the most fulfilling and developed i felt like i learned what i needed to learn from them not only about themselves but about living in such a large family mathis should have developed those cross connections more fully for all the siblings in addition the point of view of certain chapters seems inconsistent and at odds with the book's conceit the chapter on ruthie tells us nothing about ruthie but just that she was conceived of an affair i wanted to know more about what her life was like living in a family where she was potentially an outsider or resented by her father who was not her father at all the chapter we get is instead split between hattie and her husband august and as such runs afoul of what seem like editorial mistakes slipping into hattie's thoughts when the narrative is focusing on august for example--and no this does not seem like formalistic experimentation when it happens it is too haphazard and inconsistent for that to be the case it happens again in the final chapter which is mostly from granddaughter sala's point of view but slips into hattie again unlike some other books that set in and around the great migration one thing i think this book does well is show how it was not just a unidirectional experience but that connections between north and south developed in this time people moving back and forth visits children sent back south etc it avoids the oversimplification of the experience of a great number of people moving and the nostalgia for either the pre migration south or the romanticized notion of a better life in the north overall this is a strong first novel and i look forward to seeing how mathis's writing develops and see if she can sustain the focus on her fascinating characters in her later work","2992":"interesting story of an everyday mom struggles she faced and stories of how her children turned out somewhat fragmented","2993":"it was okay great writing nothing like toni morrison though which i heard she was comparable too","2994":"a reminder that mother is a source of many things to a child demonstrative love may be limited but is not the only measure of a mother's love","2995":"the individual chapters are a bit like loosely connected short stories even though they were about members of the same family you wind up feeling that there are too many loose ends but the writing was good in many ways and it was insightful about the lives of blacks who moved north during the great migration like some other readers i got annoyed with oprah's highlighting in this edition","2996":"although i liked the story and writing the way it went from child to child made it hard to attach to charac i kept wondering what happened to one of them thinking we would eventually go back to them but we never did it was like twelve short stories with a common thread it left me feeling shallowly engaged","2997":" i was disappointed but then i think my expectations may have been too high for this book after a positive ny times review who cares what oprah's book club thinks i wasn't aware it had been listed there until i received it as a gift and it didn't make any difference to me i don't mean to say that i didn't like reading the twelve tribes of hattie ayana mathis makes beautiful language very poetic and extraordinarily visual the chapter on cassie captured interiorized desperation masterfully but the characters deserved more than one chapter each hattie's is the only one that seems to have any significant narrative arc but the arc doesn't seem to have an unfolding it just arrives at the end thud i was left feeling the way you might after hearing a technically brilliant piano solo that the playing was great but the music was maybe lacking none the less compared possibly unjustly with writers like toni morrison who cover some subjects and situations that overlap with twelve tribes this book seems to skate magnificently over complex surfaces without looking at what's beneath the ice sorry ayana mathis please write more books but next time perhaps don't worry too much about trying to be understated","2998":"well written but very sad","2999":"i thought this was an interesting book i liked having a different narrator for each chapter it helped me feel as though i was getting an honest portrait of hattie by taking each narrators view of her and mashing them together i would definitely read another book by this author","3000":"mathis evokes the greats of 20th century african american literature in her novel that tells of hattie and her family the story doesn't move forward in the linear progression that you'd expect shifting from one person's voice to the next from one decade to the next mathis weaves a complicated great migration narrative a nice contrast to the oversimplified paragraph or two blurb you might have read about in your high school history textbook themes of poverty fidelity or infidelity faith and family are ever present but they aren't tired you aren't going to find a character to fall in love with but you might find a few to hate personally i think they can be just as much fun to get to know these are complicated folk leading difficult lives usually doing their best sometimes failing miserably but i enjoyed the rich texture of their lives there are moments in the prose that made me reach for a pencil to underline a poignant or beautiful passage and that's awfully rare these days there is plenty more to unpack here with the biblical allusions but there is no need for me to do it for you in a review if you like toni morrison you'll enjoy mathis' debut novel shoot compared to morrison this is downright lighthearted fare","3001":"i wish i could give this 4 5 stars i suppose i hoped for a different outcome which didn't happen regardless this book touched me and i highly recommend it","3002":"i started this book because i was in the mood to hear adenrele ojo and bahni turpin i enjoyed it","3003":"i really enjoyed this book each character came vividly to life their stories were moving not the most cheerful but a great read","3004":"i loved this book all about a large family and each member has a story to tell it is no wonder that oprah choose it","3005":"extraordinary first novel and as usual oprah's picks come through a sad but poignant tale of motherhood unconditional love and devotion amidst the most dire circumstances choices dreams deferred and total selflessness are embodied in hattie","3006":" well this was definitely one of the most depressing novels i have recently read the book's central character is hattie an african american woman who migrated from the south to philadelphia with her mother and siblings when she was a teenager then quickly marries a man who turns out to be at best goodhearted at worst an irresponsible loser nevertheless she sticks it out with him and has twelve children each chapter of the book is dedicated to a slice of life from each child in no particular chronological order but all sad and depressing not one child blossomed under these circumstances or is very satisfied i don't think it has anything to do with the migration to the north as i remember the media explaining about this book but rather that one mother stretched to the max emotionally physically and financially cannot provide enough love and motivation for her children to overcome the desolute life","3007":"a sad story of how one parent can make or break their children","3008":"shallow with many unanswered questions held my attention but the whys are blamed on few real facts and substance the author needs to flesh out her characters which is difficult in only a chapter about each","3009":"very interesting book i could understand hattie's fear of losing more of her children and protecting herself from pain by not being able to show love to her children loved the way each child sad story was told","3010":"loved the whole book except the ending it was a little abrupt recommend","3011":"i found myself thinking about this book and the characters even when i wasn't reading i also stayed up late to read each night since starting it even though it was more of a series of interconnected short stories than a novel i really enjoyed the format this allowed the reader to focus on that particular character while still seeing the impact from and connection to hattie i did reach a point in the book where i thought isn't anyone going to be normal but then realized that was part of the point","3012":"i only got through chapter 3 and then decided i hated the book it didn't draw my attention and i was tired of reading already maybe i will try to read it again later on down the road","3013":"it's really more of a collection of short stories loosely tied together thought they were interesting but sad not on my must read list","3014":"spanning from 1923 until 1980 this book tells the story of hattie and her children and her always disappointing husband august author ayana mathis essentially gives us a collage of short stories that when bound together in the pages of this book become the portrait of a family of struggle confusion and misery and so begins the first story told from hattie's point of view about her twin children philadelphia and jubilee who were born to hattie and her husband in 1925 just two years after a 15 year old hattie and her family moved from georgia to philadelphia in the great migration living in poverty with a womanizing and gambling husband hattie is left to care for her ailing twins whose names suggest hope and promise if only this first story sets the dark and deeply sad tone for the life of this family with each story told sometimes from the perspective of the child and sometimes from hattie's perspective we learn more about hattie there were times my heart broke for hattie and there were times that hattie broke my heart the first story entitled philadelphia and jubilee 1925 and later the story entitled ella 1954 haunt me to my core though the rest of the stories struggle reach the impact that the first one achieves this author's debut novel as a whole leaves its imprint on the reader's literary soul as a bit of a side note to this review~~i am proud to say that i used my new library card to borrow this e book a whole new literary world awaits","3015":"enjoyed this book but wanted more on each of the children each story line was interesting and left me wondering what happened to them","3016":"i don't normally read oprah recommended books for the reason i wasn't thrilled with this book there is little to offer hope instead everything seems hopeless and dreadful didn't enjoy it","3017":"i enjoyed everything except the ending","3018":" this book is divided into sections representing hattie's progeny the first chapter takes place in 1925 and the last in 1980 so a lot of time is covered the format shares a lot with the short story format though there is enough continuity for it to be called a novel while i was reading it i wondered how the book would have looked if it were a family saga twice the length i'm generally not a huge fan of short stories but i like what mathis did here i can't really think of a better or more concise way to get the picture we got so it turns out that what i initially thought was a weakness looking at hattie the family and the setting through each child individually was a great storytelling choice a lot of topics are covered racism homophobia poverty mental illness domestic violence and abuse in families addictions class religion self destruction there are probably some i'm forgetting and even though none of them are handled too extensively in the 250 page book it doesn't feel like mathis really short changes you on any of them either although she doesn't spend a ton of time on the backstory the feeling of completeness or full understanding is there also i really liked the ending","3019":"i liked the method of telling the story of hattie through her children's stories just couldn't really get on board with any of their characters this gets 4 for delivery but only 2 for the characters' stories plot","3020":"excellent story but incredibly sad the whole way through","3021":"great novel with great depth of characters kept me wanting to learn more about every one","3022":"this is the story of hattie her children and their lives told in a timeline that flows back and forth in time and in society each child has their own chapter and hattie's presence in each chapter ranges from hugely influential to barely there at all but still we learn so so much about hattie how can something so messed up be so beautiful or conversely how can something so beautiful be so messed up i highly highly recommend this book to everyone this is a perfect book club selection","3023":"this is a solid read several moments in the book were heartbreaking and hilarious the sign of good writing it was interesting as a character study to see the kinds of children a woman like hattie would raise but i ultimately did not really care the children themselves were interesting but there was never enough of any one character to do them justice never enough interplay to build the complexity i desired","3024":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i can

after day and it feeling like nobody really appreciates what you do trust me i've been there and i'm there now mommyhood has so many beautiful sides but there are also days when you just want to run away but back to the story hattie was the matriarch of the family and the mother she was the middle of the wheel spokes she was the engine to the car while i could not imagine caring for that many children women do it all the time one of the best things about blogging tweeting etc is getting to know other women from all over and all backgrounds when you interact with them constantly you get a snippet of their lives who their children are what they are like who their mates are and how they parent while hattie no doubt had a lot going on and a lot of responsibility and trust me i felt for her however it bothered me deeply how unaffectionate and cold she was to her children i'm of the belief that children do not ask to come here they don't make our lives hell we created them and it's up to us to give them what they need unfortunately hattie didn't have a good husband so most of all the struggle and responsibility with those kids fell on her she had been let down by her husband but i felt that her way of raising her children left a stain and a mark on each of their lives that left them with so many personal and emotional issues that they weren't able to have a normal life once they were adults it is always my goal as a mom to leave happiness good memories and life lessons to my children so that they can be a blessing to this world i truly feel that hattie did just the opposite she left a lot of anger soul searching and not being able to identify who these children were as people which led them to be problem adults and unfortunately the cycle continued with their own children another issue i had with the book was that of all the babies that hattie raised her youngest child was given away to her sister who was unable to have children and while part of me thinks that is noble to give away a child so that they can have a better life another part of me thinks that is also selfish i cannot imagine keeping some children of my own but then giving one away how must that child feel growing up hattie was a woman of great pride also but sometimes our pride can be our downfalls she proved time and time again that her pride got in the way of good common sense and she was left with the repercussions of that there were also storylines of religion throughout one of hattie's children was a preacher some of them never mentioned stepping foot in the church hattie never taught her kids about god and left them to piece things together and speculate about such things in the end we see that she herself had found her way to religion and peace in her old age however she still hadn't quite found god nor did she allow her grand daughter in her care to find him either one of my biggest issues with hattie was the conflict in her personality of being too selfish and sometimes selfless there were times when i wanted her to be selfish and she'd be selfless other times i'd wish she was selfless but she was being selfish she just could never seem to get it just right each chapter of the book was excellent each character grabbed me in you never knew which stage the character was in their life whether it be childhood teen years or adult life until you got into each chapter i think this was a brilliant way to set up a book however the ending left me quite disappointed and wondering what next i feel like the author never tied up any lose ends or answered any questions that the reader was left with on any of the characters perhaps there will be a sequel or she will delve into each character individually more","3025":"this was a typical depressing choice for oprah's book club it always amazes me how society men think it's acceptable for men to cheat","3026":"beautiful writing but not much plot to tie the stories together except for poor hattie's dysfunctional family","3027":"my sister gave me this book and i set it aside for a bit before deciding that i would give it a chance i am not sure why i like so many others feel that if a book is on oprah's list it is not worthy of reading it is really unfortunate because this was really an amazing book if ibeing chosen by oprah has stopped anyone from reading it what a shame","3028":"good read excellent first novel from author i can't wait to see what's next","3029":"i debated giving this book 3 stars at first but after i stuck with it for a while it became more intriguing there were parts i loved about this book and parts i hated i will say this it was very realistic i wished i could have followed the individual stories of each of hattie's children longer just to see how each of their situations turned out but each story ended abruptly i didn't really like that i wished i could have seen each of her children overcome their problems but all the chapters contained a sad ending disappointing really i think the book was well written but i prefer stories that make me feel happy afterward this one was far from feel good i need to go read harry potter or something to cheer me up haha","3030":"this book went faster than i anticipated it was interesting to see how hattie's children turned out the author did a good job of subtly showing more about the family than what was explicitly shared no family is perfect and this is a great book that shows that sacrifices are always made","3031":"couldn't get in to this one made it about 50 pages and didn't care if i continued or not opted to move on to my next book","3032":" the twelve tribes of hattie begins when hattie is 16 with the birth of her twins philadelphia and jubilee and runs through a story involving her granddaughter sala when hattie is 71 within the book are chapters detailing a different child of hattie's their lives their thoughts their perspectives about their mother and sometimes their siblings and how she influences each of their lives i was shocked to discover i loved this book it's not that the characters are so completely lovable and they're certainly no angels or in any way seeking perfection most of the children's stories are just plain wacky weird disturbing strange definitely out of the ordinary but that's what makes them so compelling most of the children seem damaged in some way but they admit their own flaws weaknesses and failures instead of blaming their lot in life on hattie and the difficulties of their childhood which makes the story feel deeper and richer some of hattie's children blame her for certain childhood traumas but almost all realize she did the best she could considering what she's been through hattie's voice is heard in the beginning and at the end the rest is all in the voice of her children and in one story her sister and the change and growth in her is great despite the general consensus that hattie is not a particularly warm or obviously loving woman her love for and commitment to her family shines bright as we see more and more evidence that this mother did the best she could for her children and is continuing to do so even as the story closes","3033":"other reviewers have said it better and with more detail but in a nutshell i would say that the writing in this book is lovely but there is something lacking in the story there are so many characters but each is given short shrift except hattie it is frustrating not to know what happens to some of them even if we say that the book is really just about hattie as seen through the experiences of her children it still feels inadequate we see how her children view her but not so much how she views her children throughout her life still i would gladly read another book by this author and hope for a less limiting story construction","3034":"this novel is very interesting read it covers the life of one woman from georgia who leaves one life of restriction for another in philadelphia it is told in chapters in the voices of her children in various years that shred light on their being and relationship with their mother the author weaves a great story of strength sorrow family dynamics and life in general","3035":" checked out this book because it was available as an ebook and recommended by oprah it was an interesting tale about hattie and all of her many children though the time periods during which the book took place jumped forward a lot trying to piece together each of the children's lives and the effect of hattie's parenting on it kept me reading sad that so many troubles could plague one family but think the book ended in a hopeful tone note this book was the first book i read on my kindle reading challenge book with a number in the title","3036":"read my review here http utahmomslife blogspot com 2013","3037":" this is one of those books that's a bit hard to categorize after you've finished reading it on the one hand i read it quickly and with attention and was always eager to keep reading on the other hand after finishing i was left unsatisfied my reactions largely echo those of others here the unrelenting bleakness can be monotonous and often seems implausible while the interconnection of trauma in one generation and trauma in the next is real such an intense concatenation of tragedy in a single family seems unusual apart from the parents the characters are sketchy and it's challenging even to remember all the names of the children the siblings of this hypothetical family seem to have limited interconnections it's almost as if the only emotional driving force in the novel is the mother hattie's grief while very readable that makes for a somewhat one dimensional story","3038":"i read a few chapters boring","3039":"heartbreaking not sure how it would work for a book club it's more like a collection of short stories i very much like ayana mathis's writing style","3040":"hattie shepard leaves georgia in the 1920's after white men shoot her father dead and moves to philadelphia for a better life things don't turn out well for her she experiences great disappointment as life in the north is not what she expected and her life takes many sad turns her experiences influence how she raises her children and how they experience life the story traces the lives of hatties' 11 children and one grandchild hence the 12 tribes at times disturbing at times fascinating a good thought provoking read","3041":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed

worked well to show different glimpses of hattie through the eyes of her various children i was puzzled until the very final chapters by the title's 12 rather than 11 starting on the next generation to finish the novel was simultaneously a hopeful touch and a terribly defeatist message that the upheaval and struggle and pain continues as a reader i wished for more instances of joy or beauty or hope in the novel because these are the aspects of life that pull us through the hardships but at the same time i feel awkward as a white privileged economically comfortable woman judging any of these characters or the author herself for not seeing more beauty in their lives and yet isn't that part of what literature is for to sort through pain or trouble to find the nuggets of worth i wanted to see that some of the characters achieved some happiness that it wasn't just struggle for them all by the end of the novel as the facets of hattie's story became clearer i felt a need to map out the characters to see them all in one view coming soon more","3042":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i was excited to read this book because i love

themselves well i found some of her children wildly intriguing six bell alice i couldn't read fast enough sala and cassie's stories were heartbreaking and riveting some chapters i just couldn't grasp enough of an understanding and i moved on feeling confused and unfulfilled i was especially interested in the personal relationships how hattie was different with lawrence than she was with her husband and even her sisters how she was so cold and regimented toward her family but seemed so warm and loving toward others i loved the description of her demeanor toward the end how she seemed to have softened up and how she was there to rescue bell who'd given up on their relationship in all i felt the book was 'okay' not something i'd read over and over but not wholly awful i would read another book by ms mathis more","3043":"very gripping read about hattie and her children as they grow up in philadelphia loved the biblical parallels must re read","3044":"library e book rather depressing as of the twelve children all had real issues it seems","3045":"very well written it was amazing to me how she included all of hattie's children's stories in one novel","3046":" review of six the character six in the twelve tribes of hattie brings a spiritual dimension towards ayana mathis' masterpiece in his youth six explores the office of being a minister after an emotional childhood the chapter's theme to me is a psychological contemplation and a battle of good and evil his life is poetically foreshadowed in his name with reference to \"the holy bible \" the numerical value six is symbolized in genesis of being sorrowful and labor of man six's imperfect life bears holy and evil events that illustrate his battle and struggle to live a happy life tsix fell into a baptism of turmoil when he was a baby a tub of boiling hot water melted his flesh and inhibited him from growing the irony in this event is that six nearby died from the hot water that his late siblings philadelphia and jubilee needed in order to survive from pneumonia in chapter one as a result of his morphed body image his esteem was bare and fragile and his parents' hardly showed love contributed towards his developed isolation therefore he built dense walls of emotional barriers and become introvertly shy analytically his physiological limitations correspond with his psychological limitations of growing he did however find comfort in the embellishment of woman pitying his predicament this would ultimately influence his life as we find out in chapter \"sala \" tsix experiences an intellectual and spiritual spark when he visits the south to attend a tent revival were he leaded a prayer session and ministered he saw himself as societally worthy he was exposed to the power that he possessed by becoming eminent with himself and syncing with his soul when he consecrated himself and became self aware when he spoke at the tent revival \"he had so much power that he could afford to share it had to share it or it would explode in him \" when six was praying he biblically referenced to the jericho walls being brought down by marching around them mathis uses a significant imagery to describe six's emotional walls and social barriers that correspond to the jericho story six's supernatural spark of power and authority when he was speaking is what i like to call the book's \"six moment \" he was shown how significant he was his purpose in life and the power he possessed as an individual this moment is a moment that we all should want and anticipate because it is a pivotal revelation for our life's destiny amid his troubled emotions physical appearance and isolation i am sure six questioned prior to the revival \"why me \" the \"six moment\" is significant because it shows us that \"why me \" is not the question or philosophy that should surface our consciousness the essential question in life should be what power do i possess and how will i use it the second part of this two part question was not fulfilled in six's life following the tent revival six did not know how or what to do with his power when he was speaking and praying for people while he was ministering he defaulted to revisit his fear and low self esteem that caused him to flee from the tent and hide he was still entertaining good and his possession of fear his battle with evil is depicted when mathis uses six's fight six has an evil impulse when he attacks a boy for insulting him and physically assaulting him he unexpectedly reacted and seriously harmed the other component rage and vengeance boiled and erupted into a potential catastrophe his young elevation as leader was premature because he had no ethical or strong moral foundation as a youth he was not well rooted like reverend grist - six's spiritual leader he even said that he did not want to preach anymore after the tent revival but his desire to be sociably accepted encouraged him to keep preaching six's 30 minute anointment caused him to use his blessing in vein for the love of man this must have developed a strong form arrogance and self pride he let his past fears as a youth overcome him six's revisiting his emotional past is also imaged in the location of him going to the south the place where his parents long fought to leave it reminds me of the israelites who wanted to go back to egypt because they did not like the struggle of waiting for a change later in \"sala \" we learn that he became a womanizer while preaching prostituting his 30minute anointing for the love of an unrighteous life six brings into the twelve tribes of hattie the contemplation of good and evil it shows us to understand what power we poses and how to use it in the intent that it was given to us the chapter also reminds us not to embellish on the past as it can trouble your future","3047":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book gave insight into a period of american history that is not often discussed","3048":"not even a novel a collection of short stories which personally i do not like cold uncaring mother not a good book","3049":"did not enjoy this reading painful and events incomplete family members wf","3050":" every so often you read a book that amazes you with the writing astonishes you with the depth of the description of and voices of the characters and finally annihilates you with the turn of events this is that book this is not a light read y'all this is true literature i always know that a book is good when i can't wait to pick it back up again at the end of the day but my stomach is in knots about the things that i will read ayana mathis is our generation's alice walker definitely add this one to your list","3051":"there were some fine moments in this heartbreaking novel but it was hard to follow","3052":"this book reads more like 12 character studies than 12 points of view of one plot i would have quit reading after the second or third kid if i didn't need to finish it for book club it is well written but it felt incomplete","3053":"i liked this book when it started i thought the writing was exceptional and engaging i couldn't put it down but then somewhere along alice and billups and or cassie and sala it just fizzled and lost me i felt like she or her editor didn't know a way out at the end or it was left unread powerful then poof i was disappointed but i did enjoy it is that possible","3054":"exceptional writing especially for a 1st novel i felt connected to all the characters familiar with their trials touched by their stories","3055":"very well written story about hattie and her 12 children sad story about this large family but each child's story kept me engrossed and unable to put this book down i would highly recommend this book","3056":"i really really struggled through this book very slow read","3057":"reminiscent of toni morrison's lyrical prose and just as moving the plot of this novel is revealed through multiple narrators and each one is unique and memorable i'll read this again to explore its craft since i devoured the plot the first time around","3058":"there is some beautiful writing in this novel but i just couldn't like any of the characters it's pretty depressing overall as well","3059":"this book captivates you from the first chapter i have never cried from reading a book before but this book is by far one of the closest ive gotten to doing so the writer makes you feel as though you really know each person and leaves you wanting to know more about each one it is definitely a stay up all night page turner some parts are so sad and some parts of funny and you can relate to their emotions the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because when it was over there were so many questions i still had which i guess could be a good thing because you want more but i personally like a book to end where there is some closure but definitely a good read","3060":"very good writing engaged immediately lot of characters to keep track of and i wanted different outcomes","3061":"dark and depressing didn't finish","3062":"i don't usually go for oprah's book choices but this one is reminiscent of toni morrison and zadie smith mathis creates rich characters and how she plays with time is intriguing as well i enjoyed the shifting narration as well overall a well told family

make sure her kids have food in their bellies and clothes on their backs through her children's stories either while they're growing or when they're adults you see exactly how the loveless household in which they were raised did a number on them not a single one of the kids is well adjusted or even happy they're all suffering and most of them simultaneously love and hate their mother","3064":"the writing was quite good but because each chapter was a character sketch of one child the whole didn't have much development hattie ages","3065":"i loved the author's style of writing and i felt her characters were very interesting however i was very disappointed that the book seemed to end abruptly without letting the reader know the fate of some of the earlier characters namely the baby hattie gave away","3066":"great characters fantastic writing this book will leave you thinking long after you have finished the book","3067":"disappointing yes the story finally comes full circle but it is within the last few pages this book has twelve stories related by the main character hattie but nothing else more and more oprah picks are disappointing","3068":"i thought the writing was great and the stories were interesting but not completely captivating i would have enjoyed it more if i understood the point of the story i kept reading thinking that something more exciting was going to happen at the end","3069":" hattie shepherd is a young black woman who in 1923 leaves georgia for the promise of opportunity in philadelphia unfortunately for hattie she marries a man who is irresponsible and unfaithful and her life is wracked with sorrow and disappointment i really wanted to like to book but i had such a hard time with it first each chapter was a story about hattie's various children and while the chapters were chronological they jumped in time setting and character so much that it became difficult to follow each chapter could have stood alone but only two of those chapters actually managed to attract my interest it's too bad because the story of hattie and her children held so much promise","3070":"i liked this more than i thought i would maybe because i am a mother and i come from a family of many siblings i liked the peek in hattie's life","3071":"excellently written a little dark but so well written it was a breeze to read her descriptions of places and feelings are spot on i don't blame hattie for her inability to demonstrate love to her children because of all the heartache she went through she did love them though in just keeping them alive and out of harm's way the best she could as she aged as we all do she was able to see what feel could not when she was younger","3072":" hattie shepherd is a strong black woman who left her native georgia as a teenager to make a new life in philadelphia her twelve tribes are her eleven children and one grandchild that she raises as the matriarch and pillar of her family hattie's husband loves the children but hattie is the one that must be the disciplinarian responsible for their well being and physical care never having time or money to play with and love her children hattie was too busy trying to keep them alive the children however grew to beome unhappy adults with unsatisfying lives in the last chapter hattie comes full circle when the burden of caring for her granddaughter falls to her finally maybe hattie has a chance to do it over again and to do it right each chapter tells the story of one of the grown shepherd children and the influence that hattie had with each child as he she grew up the book could almost be considered a volume of short stories each of which was quite interesting although the ending was quite abrupt and left me wondering what came next this book was the second pick of oprah winfrey's second book club","3073":"i thought this was well written but i'm not sure what the point was very realistic characters but they all end up miserable all 12 of her children what is the point ugh","3074":"i wasn't really planning to read it just skim for familiarity but i wound up loving the writing and characters shouldn't've been surprised though because i do love interconnected short stories one of seven titles recommended in a single library blog post http carnegiestout blogspot com 201","3075":" this is a hard book to like and as well hard to not like it is not a novel but instead a group of short stories about members of the same family ayana mathis is a powerful writer there are numerous beautiful passages or descriptions but the people she tells her stories about almost universally make the worst life choices the characters are so flawed they are hard to like so i found myself thinking i wish this book would end then read a passage so rich with flavor that i would be amazed at the authors talent over all this book was worth reading even though i found it uneven it is a book i ended up being glad i read","3076":"i enjoyed this book not for it's high literary value but for the individual stories it's been a while since i've read a novel from multiple perspectives and i appreciated the voices and perspectives of each plus it was a fast read within each story chapter there continued themes of despair poverty unrequited love with just a touch of hope the author did a great job of steering away from utter gloom and towards a holistic view of the human experience","3077":"it was very hard to follow each of her children was given only a chapter for character development so it was hard to make that connection with any of them i didn't even feel any connection to hattie herself all i could think when it ended was maybe the author wanted it that way the disfunction of the family made them all disconnected to one another if it was the author's intent to make the reader feel that sense of isolation then she succeeded","3078":" i recently received an alumni update for my high school announcing the publication and selection of this book by ayana mathis for oprah's bookclub thank you oprah for bringing the book club back i don't know ayana i think she graduated before i got to school but nevertheless have to support a fellow philadelphia high school for girls graduate go girl as my grandmother would say update after reading the novel feb 2013disappointing read this novel is so disjointed from chapter to chapter just a jumbled mess really it would have been helpeful to have list of the children of hattie and august in the beginning of the family maybe a family tree as reading this on kindle i found it difficult to keep up with all the children's names birth order and the years in which the specific child parent's story took place this reads more like a book of short stories than a cohesive novel some chapters were better than others like ruth or bell but in general i felt like i never got a good sense of any of the children just a brief glimpse of them personnally and their experience with their mother also there is no insight with regard to the what happened to the children mentioned by the end of the book novel starts in 1923 and ends 1980 we see how the years have affected hattie and august relationship with each other as well as with god and with their one grandchild and daughter cassie what of floyd franklin ella ruth i get that the story is about hattie but ugh it was just a bit frustrating because i wanted to love this book from a intelligent philly homegirl who grew up in germantown mt airy section of the city and went to my high school but better luck next time ayana","3079":"great snippets of the story in each chapter interesting and distinct characters all tied together in a messy knotted ball of yarn i enjoyed the book very much while each chapter was like a short story and i'm not keen on books of short stories the book was still cohesive well written","3080":"novel told in stories about hattie and her eleven children and one grandchild heartbreaking but brilliantly written","3081":"typical oprah's book club depressing i liked the writing style of this author so i'll try her again though","3082":"i should have enjoyed this book more than i did it should have moved me more than it did it seemed very powerful but for some reason i wasn't terribly moved","3083":"disjointed stories of some of hattie's 12 children it held my interest but wasn't my favorite","3084":"excellent read excellent prose engaging and compelling love this book","3085":" i was convinced to add this book to my want to read list after reading a favorable review in the ny times learning that it was a selection of oprah winfrey's book club probably shaped my anticipation somewhat while i have loved some of winfrey's book club selections and really found nothing to like in others they do all seem to follow a sort of formulaic genre as evidenced by my 2 star rating i was disappointed by the book i found it flat i tend to be a very literal person and can often miss simile sub plots etc because i am reading for the story so i'm very willing to concede that i may simply have missed the point with this one clearly the biblical reference of the twelve tribes in the title is intentional but i struggled to understand to what end one could draw corollary between the tribes of israel leaving the slavery of egypt and making a long convoluted trek to the promised land but while the accounts of the israelites certainly show them to be irresolute they did eventually acclimate and prosper in their destination at the end of the day or the end of the novel hattie and her tribe have either succumbed or are barely standing impotent representations of all the moral and social ills that might be spawned by poverty prejudice and racism one reviewer suggested that hattie's twelve tribes were instead a picture of the slave mother of the old testament hagar apparently hagar was an often used literary figure in the abolitionist literature of the early 19th century i was offended by the unrelenting formula of character by gender in this work to quote apoorva dutt reviewing for india com the men are drunk confused gamblers and the women struggle to keep body and family together this picture is unbroken throughout the stories of hattie's own marriage and the lives of her nine children who grew to adulthood in even the poorest most addicted inadequately parented family groups one or more of the children can often bring their own determination and energy to bear or be given exceptional external support to make a better life than the one their parents had or bequeathed to them not every man who started with less than nothing after trekking the post slavery great migration north with his family squandered that opportunity or left it to his wife to hold his family together in my opinion the structure of the book with separate chapters devoted to various of hattie's children worked against any kind of cohesion instead it highlighted the unremitting hopelessness and did not serve to elevate the work as a whole i think it is too bad that this book will garner many more sales that an un influence word of mouth market would have generated and of course the more copies it sells the more its in my opinion unwarranted reputation will swell","3086":" epic i am of two minds this is either an epic novel along the lines of michener deserving of over 600 pages and because it is only 256 pages has left me with an incomplete and raw feeling or it is unbearably bleak indictment on america and we as humans and thus the reason the chapters are so spare is to leave the reader feeling raw and gutted 15 year old hattie flees the racist state of georgia for the chance of a better life nothing turns out as she has hoped and her despair resounds on the equally despairing lives of her children very sad and enforces my thoughts that we need to do better as a nation and as humans keeper","3087":"interesting in parts since it was written about the middle 1900's in regards to how blacks were treated","3088":"could not put it down","3089":"good pick oprah more of a collection of interconnected short stories than a novel if such a distinction is necessary to make not least because her approach to writing and storytelling shifted from chapter to chapter i've been meaning to review this for about three weeks so my fresh impression of it has unfortunately faded","3090":"i didn't think this was a very good book i could have stopped after the first chapter and not really missed anything it's like i already read this somewhere some place and why do it gain i cannot truthfully say that i would recommend it to anyone to read","3091":"interesting writing style and perspective","3092":"was excited to read this book all my expectations were dashed no cohesion between characters and the story line gets weaker towards the end so disappointed","3093":"well written and entertaining just felt incomplete and didn't come together in the end","3094":"gorgeous writing and a heartbreaking story one of my favorite descriptions as the story begins hattie clambered from the train her skirt still hemmed with georgia mud the dream of philadelphia round as a marble in her mouth and the fear of it a needle in her chest","3095":"a good book and interesting to read i still don't understand the term the great migration and i don't understand the title there are nine children and one grandchild the chapters are about a child grandchild it was easier to read chapter by chapter one chapter was noted with times the revealing of information was slow at first but then i got onto the idea to keep reading to find out more it was thought provoking","3096":"interesting but mostly depressing","3097":"would have been just as happy with the ten tribes of hattie but the ending was the absolutely perfect a great companion to the help albeit in a more serious down to earth vein","3098":"it was just ok i thought it would be better well written though","3099":" this is a special book there is so much to love about it but it is filled with pain and despair and really hard life experiences told in vignettes the stories of each one of hattie's children at different stages of their lives serve to describe history family class infidelity war and many other facets of life hattie appealed to me from the beginning when she naively but determinedly tried to save the lives of her dying babies she was just a child herself at 17 when that happened it set the course for the way she would mother the others getting too close or too much in love with your kids hurts when they leave you plus she had a husband who was a fun dad but not much of a breadwinner so how was she supposed to do it all some reviewers are pretty hard on hattie i have empathy for her and really do believe she did the best she could","3100":"a blood red leaf and a gold pressed in a handkerchief during the early happy days of a new relationshipblossoms blown through an open windowa jar of living butterflieslungs filled with mothsroots in a paper bag on the windowsilla hospital room with no windowa vial of natural medicine disposed ofnature heals us comforts us invades us destroys usit does not save us","3101":"this is the library's book club book for may so well written but like all the kite runners and glass castles of the world i guess a book couldn't be great if it's not sad this book basically follows a philadelphia woman's children at different points of their lives she started having babies at age 17 and had babies for something like 30 years her life is tough her kids' lives are tough and nobody is too happy i liked the unique way of just seeing a glimpse of each child but would have liked to learn a lot more about some of them it will make for an interesting book club discussion great debut novel","3102":"wow a very grim book of race and motherhood the book was at times both wonderful and tedious i picked it up intermittently it felt like a lot of work ultimately and i don't think that i would recommend it though i am somewhat glad i read the book","3103":"the first couple of chapters were interesting and then it really went down hill would not recommend this book","3104":"this book would be great for a book club i felt as though i was getting the family history of a woman i only gave it an average score because it didn't seem to stand out to me personally i will probably forget i read it in a year it was entertaining and knowledgeable i enjoyed the several stories in one book the most","3105":" i absolutely loved this book i did something that i very rarely do i read it very slowly so i could be reading it longer usually i gobble down a book i really like but i loved this book so much that i savored every page hattie is an african american woman who comes north along with her mother and sisters in the 1920s as part of the great migration away from the jim crow south her choice of husband and her choice to stay in philadelphia instead of going back south after the death of her mother forms her and forms the 11 children she eventually bears the book reminded me a little bit of olive kitteridge in its literary approach although not its subject matter the first chapter is told from hattie's perspective subsequent chapters are told from the perspectives of some of her children and finally one of her granddaughters thus we get different perspectives on hattie each of the chapters could stand on its own as a short story and the book isn't all about hattie it really is about her whole tribe what i liked most about this book was the rich characterization i felt i knew these people most of the stories were tragic but the characters are never never pathetic these suffering erring people are allowed their dignity they felt as real to me as if they had beating hearts i'll have to go back and read it again to figure out how mathis did this","3106":"quite an interesting way to write about a character by writing from the pov of her children hattie seems cold and harsh yet feels so deeply at the same time i can't say i feel the same way about most of her children but hattie is certainly a fascinating character","3107":"the novel follows a story of hattie's children i like the idea of a genealogical family history approach however the individual series of stories made it difficult to enjoy the characters i lost interest nearing the middle of the book","3108":" i have to wonder how many of these reviews are characterized by the fact that it's an oprah's book club selection i put off reading this book for a few years for that reason but i've followed ayanna mathis' writing for years before she penned the novel i was initially surprised by the set up and got a little confused in the narratives from time to time characters who were hinted at in earlier chapters reappear for a fuller telling of their stories later but i loved this of religion of strife of womanhood i loved the themes this book touched on and the truths mathis weaves into the lives of a very special brood","3109":"very good writing but i was ultimately unsatisfied with her scratching the surface of people's lives","3110":"i t was a really well written book illustrating the one family's experience with the great migration and how those struggles continued to affect the family years later only issue you don't ever really connect to one character as each chapter is told by one member of the family","3111":"here's another debut author that has really impressed me with thoughtful and completely approachable style of writing this is a relatively quick and easy read that packs a big punch as the author weaves you through the years and the lives of hattie's family while this is not a particularly uplifting read it is extremely compelling and i would highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys toni morrison zora neale hurston gloria naylor or sandra cisneros","3112":"i enjoyed the story telling and the history involved in the book but it's ending was confusing and very abrupt","3113":"this book was incredible it was a powerfully soulful reflection of one woman's journey of motherhood and her children's experiences really moving book and unpredictable book reminds me of 100 years of solitude but characters were more relatable and salient","3114":"interesting history and following of one woman and her family trials and tribulations i hated the ending i don't feel like it ended enjoyed this read brought up a lot of culture and historical prejudice","3115":"i don't know as you can read from the description there are 12 children and about 8 or so are given a voice in the book certain voices were better than others i also couldn't figure out why only 1 male narrator was read by an actual male audiobook and the other male narrators were read by a female sorry oprah i just wasn't feeling it","3116":"seemed to end rather abruptly the premise was good the execution not so much","3117":"i really wanted to love this book and the writing was amazing but there were too many characters and story lines to keep up with it was more of a collection of short stories with unrelated characters than a novel about a family i was left with a lot of questions that weren't answered and it seemed like some of the characters were not fully developed overall it was a good read but i just wanted more i guess","3118":"interesting story chronicalling the lives of hattie and each of her children over the years","3119":" i enjoyed this book but constantly found myself at wondering more about each of the characters and about hattie herself the book is structured by having one chapter for each of hattie's offspring you slowly learn more about the central character hattie through the impressions and memories of her children and family each chapter is well written and poignant in its own way and the author does a wonderful job exploring the many and varied effects of poverty and survival parenting i didn't get sucked in to the story like i might have if it were written as one long flow but because each of the chapters were essentially a short story i gained an appreciation for the time and feel of each person","3120":"mathis is a talent probably a 5 star writer but this book was relentlessly and assertively depressing never endingly bleak just too much","3121":"absolutely beautiful reminiscent of toni morrison i breezed through this lovely book and will think about it for a long time","3122":"interesting but not my type of book i saw hints of greatness here but since i wasn't really interested in sinking into this in depth i didn't read into it as much as i should for a 1st novel i must say it was a superb job with the structure between generations and building on hattie's character and development would i read it again no would i read another book by this author possibly","3123":"i would have given it four stars but there was an uneven distribution of time dedicated to the different children i would have also liked some more background information on the kids and their relationships and how they grew up each individual story was great but you leave each one wanting more as if the story isn't finished yet","3124":"i really thought the structure of the book was refreshing in terms of using secondary characters to tell the overall narrative of the book's main protagonist or secondary characters' antagonist i did want to see a little more range of hattie's character though as a result often times she was consistently portrayed as someone who was understandably hardened yet emboldened by her past but i wanted to know much more about why how etc i did however enjoy reading this book and mathis has a really nice lyrical quality to her writing","3125":"this was an oprah pick and i really liked it hattie moves north from georgia to phliadelphia to get away from the racial discrimination in the south she marries august and the 12 tribes refer in 11 cases to her children and in one case to a grandchild the stories of each child is told one at time in sort of a snap shot form the stories largely stand alone but do overlap at times some were very very good and many were heartbreaking overall a definite recommend","3126":"the stories of hattie floyd ruth and alice stayed with me","3127":" twelve children a mother who is concerned with their physical survival but can't really love them too busy and because 2 died of pneumonia and not one of them turns out ok no surprises here except that i actually managed to listen to it all i stuck with it because i was on a long road trip and because i thought there finally has to be some redemption one of the characters must gain insights and learn and grow nope disjointed because each chapter focuses on one kid and then basically drops them little or no interaction among the siblings mom keeps making the same mistakes repeatedly basically having more babies that she and the no good husband can afford save your time and re read the help or having our say if you don't want to be as depressed as the characters i think people of all colors need to have stories with redemption and hard work yes i know life is not pretty but sometimes poor choices make it even worse my poor choice was to stick with this and not read the goodreads reviews like i usually do","3128":"interesting reading and easy to focus on just a chapter at a time","3129":"i hoped for a story that would transport me into the lives of hattie's family instead i read a series of short stories that never fully developed the characters or gave me insight into the great migration it seemed the story ended before it ever began","3130":" i've read a lot of oprah's book club books and i've enjoyed most of them this was no exception and really i'd rate if 3 5 stars if possible i read it on my kindle and was surprised when i turned the page and it was acknowledgments i wasn't ready for the story to end i suppose there is no ending that hattie and her children's lives just continue on the same dysfunctional path because it's very difficult when people are born in poverty oppression and abuse to change maybe there's hope for sala just maybe hattie does understand and is willing to do what it takes to change this cycle","3131":"well written and heartfelt story that follows hattie from a teen who suffers the loss if her twins to when she is elderly and has raised 9 children she is met with many challenges but perseveres showing her true strengths","3132":" 2 5 stars this was a bleak story of a young woman who comes with her mother and sisters from the south to live in philadelphia in 1923 she marries augustus with hope only to find that hope dashed upon the death of her infant twins in 1925 from pneumonia this terrible event changes both hattie and augustus hattie loses the joy in life and the ability to show love to her growing family augustus loses a piece of his soul and his ability to be a man and support his family though they stay together and raise 9 more children there is no love or affection between them the children bear the scars of this the men become womanizers the women suffer from emotional diseases the story is told from each child's and one grandchild perspective but each one is allotted just one chapter after which he or she is barely mentioned again the chapters span from 1923 to 1980 and the way the timeline jumps and the lack of character development makes the book hard to engage with","3133":"this book is more a series of interconnected short stories then a true novel good writing style but just an average book","3134":"it was fine it wasn't awful it was in places well written and engaging i gave it two stars because i had read this before and therefore this bored me i've read these kind of stories the struggling family narrative the too many children narrative the pale imitations of famous books a tree grows in brooklyn angela's ashes etc and i just wasn't very interested by it","3135":"not as great as oprah thought but very good","3136":"i borrowed this book from the library on a whim i got the audiobook for this one i will pretty much listen to anything read by bahni turpin it looked interesting although that fact that it was an oprah pick almost made me pass on it in this book a woman named hattie has many children after losing her first children twins this book reads like a set of the stories of hattie and her children each section is for a different child's story during a different time period told in the usually adult child's voice throughout the stories the reader will also learn bits and pieces about hattie her husband and her lover some of the stories in this book were mildly interesting the stories did not seem that connected except for a couple of them the characters all had pretty big problems that did not seem to ever get resolved that made the book a little depressing it started with the death of two babies and never really left that sadness there was also no real closure as a result however the stories were well written in other ways enjoyment of this book will depend on the reader's taste in books since she seems to be a good writing i am hoping that the author writes something with a little bit better storyline and closure 2 5 stars","3137":"i could not put this book down i was so intrigued by these characters i cared about them i kept thinking about them long after i put down the book i am not black my family did not experience the great migration but that is only one facet of this book it's about dreams and hope it's about suffering and disappointment and it's about the complexity of family relationships it's a must read","3138":"what a great and moving book memorable characters and beautifully written all of the authors producing the bloated 400 to 600 page tomes should read this book and amor love to see how to write a well told story","3139":"this book was such an enjoyable read for me the best part of reading a book is when you stumble on a sentence that is so beautifully crafted or a truth so profound this book was loaded with both","3140":"i heard an interview with oprah and ayana mathis and was intrigued although i've given this book 4 stars i would have liked to see more connectivity between the characters the book read more like a collection of separate short stories rather than a novel each of the characters are sadly flawed with troubled lives different yet similar to their mother's i loved the picture the author painted of each of them some of oprah's comments were insightful but many were along the lines of oh i loved that paragraph so what why is her name part of the title ayana mathis's talent as a writer stands on her own merit","3141":"this book is a well written collection of separate stories about the children of hattie who at 15 migrated to philadelphia from the deep south stories are set in time from 1920 to 1980 and hattie plays a major or minor role in each chapter all are sad stories that examine how each family member was affected by tragic life events but there is no connection between each story","3142":"not a feel good book by any means rather an emotional journey that you can't help but be drawn into","3143":"i read this book for my book club i found the story of each child's wounded life compelling and yet again all stemming from a childhood void of love hattie the mother did not know how to love her children she felt she was too full from having to simply survive if only she had know her children needed hugs and encouraging words far more then her sharp words","3144":"wonderfully written with deeply human characters this is a sample of iowa writing at its prime","3145":" this book left me feeling frustrated for me the book did not have enough redemptive value to feel like a payoff for all the bleakness ayana mathis is a talented writer but this book did not hold together for me it's more like interconnected short stories rather than a novel none of the characters are fully developed and all of them pretty much disappear after their chapter is over this was disappointing what happened to these people some of these chapters are stronger than others i found the first chapter where we learned hattie's back story to be the strongest of all i actually felt like i was getting to know her in this chapter then she pretty much disappeared for most of the rest of the book except to reappear here or there for a few paragraphs or for a chapter or two the book is also bleak there's no hope no redemption there's a lot of womanizing substance abuse and mental illness by the end of the book i still didn't feel like i knew hattie all that well because of the way the narrative jumped around i would have preferred it if hattie had been the main narrative focus with the stories of her children as branches of this main narrative books don't always have to be uplifting but this feels more like a pastiche of sadness i think it would have been much better if it had focused primarily on hattie and her struggles throughout life and how her children grew up rather than this hodgepodge of stories","3146":"i really enjoyed this book hattie migrates from georgia to philadelphia in the 1920's she marries young and endures a disappointing marriage she struggles and scrapes to feed clothe and care for 12 children out of survival she is not the most loving tender mother each chapter centers around one of hattie's 12 children over the span of many decades each story is haunting engrossing and unforgettable","3147":" i found the way the book was setup to be an interesting idea it made it easy to read one chapter at a time in more a of a short story format i found some of the stories to be rather vague and felt like detail could have been added especially to develop the characters more i also wish that there had been more ties between the characters some you read about once and were never mentioned again some were mentioned just one additional time the may have been done to show the strong disconnect between hattie and the rest of the children perhaps the author wanted to show that she never truly connect with any of the children after her twins died","3148":" an interesting read that left me yearning for more optimism and less bleakness of each character the story commences with hattie shepherd starting a new life in philadelphia with her newborns and each chapter after follows with the life of her nine children however their lives are mired in abuse poverty mental illness bitterness or complete chaos with certain characters hattie steps in to rescue her offspring in their adult lives and others she strangely ignores altogether each child is given a one chapter spotlight with no positive attributes and no follow up some chapters were powerful and thought provoking while others severly lacked appeal or clarity","3149":"for a first novel ayana is an amazing writer sad and heartwarming too","3150":"i enjoyed the writing style very much each chapter represented one of the main character's children this is the author's first novel and i hope she continues to write","3151":"random and weird ending abrupt and anticlimactic no thanks","3152":"one of the saddest books i've ever read but still powerful i think every woman can see a little of themselves in hattie","3153":"i kept putting off reading this book because based on the summary on the dust jacket i thought it would be too depressing i started reading it sunday morning and couldn't put it down until i finished it that night ayana mathis is a skilled writer who develops her characters so they are living breathing people who the reader immediately connects with she also weaves story lines with unexpected twists so you can't help but feel compassion for hattie and her tribe this despite all of them often times not being very likable people this is not a book that when finished you can say i liked the book in the sense that it was enjoyable but it is a very worthwhile read and a story that will stay with you","3154":"i have read most of oprahs book club books and found them all good","3155":"fantastic book for this writer's first book really enjoyed how she tied everything together definitely a book to recommend to others rare do i give out 5 stars but felt like this one deserved it","3156":"what a beautiful book almost like a collection of short stories about a woman hattie who loses her first children a set of twins each chapter after that is about her 9 subsequent children and one grandchild and the lives they lead in the north so vastly different from the racially charged upbringing hattie had growing up in georgia beautifully written each chapter like a novella instantly grabbed my attention and i was left wanting more gorgeous","3157":" i read this book along with my book club i loved the author's writing as far as the use of figurative language throughout i enjoyed the flashbacks but some of the flashbacks were introduced in a confusing way which it made it difficult to follow the present action from the past action each chapter is dedicated to one of hattie's children some chapters i found more interesting than others hattie's character affected each child in different ways and it's revealed through each story it's a story of love family and painful situations overall i give the book a 6 5 out of 10 i didn't care much for the ending it wasn't a quick read or a page turner for me","3158":"this wasn't my favorite read to be honest i thought the writing was decent but i had a hard time seeing the intersection of all the characters even at the end i didn't really think i understood the plot of the book","3159":"book was great but found it hard to relate to hattie u0026amp her choices a great winter book club choice","3160":"i devoured this book each chapter could've stood on its own as a short story in my opinion but as a whole they give life and humanity to the portrait of this family the first chapter broke my heart but despite the pain it caused i kept reading and reading","3161":"this is the lowest i think i've rated a book i find the chapters long and little confusing mathis writes somewhat in the style of toni morrison but without any plot or purpose there is no reason to read this book it is depressing sad and full of tales of people with no redeeming qualities","3162":"terribly written i could only read a quarter of it before i threw it in disgust simply awful does oprah read this crap","3163":"i could not finish this book i found it very boring i also don't understand the use of the word tribes in the title as every chapter is about one or two of hattie's children there is nothing that really ties the chapters together other than being hattie's children just not my type of book","3164":"i decided to read the twelve tribes of hattie because it got a rave review in the times the author is from my hometown and i was on the prowl for some contemporary fiction so i figured i would give it a shot plus oprah recommends it the twelve tribes of hattie is about a woman who is eternally bitter from the loss of her first born children as told through the stories of her children and lover the tone of the novel is dark with each character suffering from at least one dramatic flaw the plot covers much ground religion family love death but not much happens by way of events rather the novel is mostly character exposition this would be a problem if the characters weren't so compelling but each one has you gripped wanting to learn how he she will devastate his her loved ones next this novel communicates several african american themes one is diaspora hattie moves to philadelphia from georgia in the beginning of the novel and feels as though she has come to the promised land but by the end the north has lost much of its luster and the south has regained some appeal there are manifold examples but the novel never treats black people as an other i felt as though the characters could have been my cousins even if i couldn't relate to everything there aren't really any white people in the book so maybe they are the other but as a white guy i didn't feel excluded the reason that i do not love this book is that none of the characters really have their whole story told so there isn't much in the way of closure also the ending left me unsatisfied but i won't elaborate here this book is short enough that it won't take up too much of your time and i recommend a quick read for anyone who has any interest in modern black american culture","3165":"it's not hard to see why oprah winfrey chose the twelve tribes of hattie as her most recent book club 2 0 pick from the first sentence on debut novelist ayana mathis writes vividly and sensitively of one family's journey and struggles over a lifetime creating a stirring portrait of family loss and endurance in the twentieth century when young hattie shepard arrives in philadelphia from georgia in 1923 the first thing she notices is the absence of trees mathis writes vibrantly of the urban sights sounds and smells hattie encounters as she gets off the train automobile exhaust hung in the air alongside the tar smell of freshly laid asphalt and the sickening odor of garbage rotting wheels rumbled on the paving stones engines revved paperboys called the headlines it's not entirely romantic but it's accurate much like the rest of the novel which doesn't shy away from depicting the painful circumstances of some of the characters the first chapter is harrowing as hattie loses her infant twins to pneumonia within the early pages of the book this loss sets the stage for the way hattie will love and care for her surviving children all nine of them - that is with grit and what seems to be a necessary distance for her each chapter is devoted to a child at a different point in his or her life some are small and some are grown when we meet them and the novel jumps in time from one chapter to the next each story comes alive in its own way and can almost stand alone apart from the novel but together create a beautiful tapestry of a larger life and a fascinating family tale we meet eldest floyd in 1948 as a young adult and talented musician traveling the south with his trumpet and playing gigs all the while fearful to face his true self another we see as a teenager a few years later also struggling to find himself but as a preacher with a calling in this way readers view hattie through the eyes of her children always a bit removed and limited in the amount of affection she can give some call her the general the sisters all grow up a little bit broken inside too perhaps taking this from their mother despite her wish to prepare them for the difficult world outside hattie's husband august means well but is unable to provide for the family and falls far short of hattie's hopes and expectations another son struggles to survive and misses his family as he fights the war in vietnam the twelve tribes of hattie can be a trying read at times as the characters face poverty racism and other hardships but readers are rewarded with hattie's strong and enduring spirit as she protects her children and raises her family the best she can head to www everydayebook com for more ebook reviews","3166":"just okay started out good and then was a chore for me to finish the book again a fairly depressing oprah book","3167":"not the story i expected but not disappointed more a series of short stories each one from a different year u0026amp each one about hattie u0026amp one of her children covering many years many heart wrenching difficult situations but beautifully written update this book has stayed with me all day i can't stop thinking about certain parts of it looking back on a few of hattie's children i have to wonder where the issues with mental illness came from it is obvious that more than one of them had some serious problems with it http www nytimes com 2013 01 06 boo","3168":"really liked this book although it is somewhat of a series of interrelated stories instead of a conventional novel i agree with other reviewers about the characters being hard to like and of often wanting to know more about one after that particular chapter ends very well written can't wait to see what this author does next","3169":"with the exception of the penultimate chapter which i felt lacked the connection of the others this was a fascinating book with an unusual shape each chapter reads like a short story with no explanation that that is what you are doing if it has any theme at all it would be that life is hard and it is what you make of it despite what challenges are sent your way that the families are black urban and poor and i am white rural and mid income made for some interesting cultural references i had to google including artists such as leotyne price i enjoy being transported to a different place or peoples and noting the similarities hattie is not the typical archetype mom she's complex damaged and can't give love as much as she should the book doesn't apologize for this but shows what happens","3170":" this book got better and better with each chapter detailing philadelphia housewife hattie's many children as they grow into adulthood and dysfunction and in some cases a return to the south this was a surprisingly gripping read so much mental illness in these kids how painful i thought it was beautifully written so so sad at parts and incredibly beautiful in others i especially liked how ayana mathis treated religion coming of age and colorism thanks african american lit class for that smartypants literary term this one quote i thought just summed up the book so perfectly she had been angry with her children and with august who'd brought her nothing but disappointment fate had plucked hattie out of georgia to birth eleven children and establish them in the north but she was only a chidl herself utterly inadequate to the task she'd been given no one could tell her why things had turned out as they had not august or the pastor or god himself hattie believed in god's might but she didn't believe in his interventions at best he was indifferent","3171":"the twelve tribes of hattie is powerful and sad i wanted at least one more chapter for every single character","3172":"i thought it was really well written but i was really hoping for a glimmer of hope for hattie and her family i found it a bit sad","3173":"strong characterizations and interesting way to map out the storyline but i wasn't enthralled","3174":"many reviewers had a problem with the vignette nature of this book i liked it i liked how each of hattie's children were able to tell their own story and how these stories were subtly woven together through hattie i do admit however that i wanted a little more connectedness at the end of the book but perhaps that is the nature of that family a bit fractured and disconnected","3175":"i liked it i found following each of her children a fascinating study of a family with all it's bruises and bumps","3176":"i thought the book peaked at the beginning went slowly downhill although it was still good","3177":"this one started out strong then each successive chapter i found myself caring less and less about every single character some of the stories are just genuine honest human beings trying to make a way for themselves some are lazy excuse driven beings i had no sympathy for and others were just sad i liked the tiny bit of redemptive element in the end but frankly it was just too lifetime movie for me just another oprah's book club less than fabulous pick","3178":"beautifully written characters are fascinating complex well drawn highly recommend","3179":"the book was very well written i just wish that the stories of the children were more interwoven looking forward to reading more work from this author and with an endorsement from oprah the sky is the limit","3180":"beautiful such a journey mathis writes this book with such poetry it was a joy to read","3181":"i enjoyed this book and was hoping for the best with every child i don't want to spoil it for you so all i can say is damn can she get a break misery is contagious and definitely not something you want to pass to your children hattie is one strong woman","3182":"it was a wonderful book reading each chapter where hattie and each of her children in their own chapters described their lives was very compelling you really felt like these were real people who you you came to care about and it also gave me insight into why some people especially hattie react the way they do to people and situations in their lives","3183":"this didn't make sense to me really","3184":" the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis follows the life of hattie shepard and her children beginning with the twins who died in her arms for want of a little money to buy medicine born in georgia hattie's mother brought her and her sisters north to philadelphia to escape jim crow pregnant at 15 against her mother's advice hattie married the lazy self indulgent man who would disappoint her all her life nine more babies would she nurse and feed and clothe and then a granddaughter and every beloved one of them would feel her disappointment but not her affection each chapter depicts a dramatic episode from a child's life in this deeply moving novel","3185":"i gave it a try and just put it down it started out interesting in the first chapter then slowly lost me","3186":"hated the ending it was an ok book won't keep it on my library will post it on paperback swap disappointed and that's all i have to say about that","3187":"i wanted to fall head over heals in love with the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis the writing is excellent and the story is compelling but i didn't fall in love each chapter reads almost like a short story and is focused on one or more of her children but they only get that one chapter they may be mentioned in passing in future chapters but no character gets any real closure to their story except maybe hattie each child had struggles that were connected to being raised by hattie and that's what their chapter focused on but what happened to them later did those troubles ever resolve did they grow and change i don't really know that's the trouble with this book for me http thisismybookblog blogspot com","3188":"promising at first but never developed the connections i was hoping for a good read but not great","3189":"the novel begins with hattie a very young poor black mother in philadelphia the story follows hattie and her children over the next sixty years framed by the race relations and inequalities of each time period","3190":" despite many positive reviews this book really dragged for me i liked the concept but not the execution it is the story of hattie an african american women who becomes a mother at 17 and goes onto have 12 children each chapter delves into a section of one child's life none of whom are happy or prosperous or particularly well adjusted the book begins in the 1950's and continues on well in the 80's the issues are typical issues of impoverished uneducated young people of their time for example there is a jazz musician a preacher a schizophrenic and a drug addict hattie is the connecting center but the author shares little of her thoughts or feelings shares little of the relationships between children and only snippets of their individuals lives at first it left me wanting to know more but by the end i really didn't care and just wanted to be done with their miserable lives","3191":"i would say this book is controversial and lacks a lot of hope longing for more from the author and it was just downright depressing sorry not suggesting this one to others","3192":"not a story about the great migration this is really a series of short stories about each of hattie's children each character is powerfully written but only for their single chapter was this their whole story the stories were tragic and i found myself yearning for some glimpse of hope for this family the last chapter about hattie's granddaughter comes the closest to this but is too weak and too late for me to recommend the book","3193":"normally i don't like short stories but these clear eyed unshrinking portraits that never indulge in melodrama or bogus sentimentality or self pity or moralizing in which the hard characters remain true to themselves while still rounding off a few corners was marvelous i admit the oprah endorsement had me leery what a debut","3194":"i finished the twelve tribes of hattie yesterday i haven't stopped thinking about it there is nothing happy or sentimental about these stories of great hardship each chapter focusing on one of hattie's children the last on her grandchild and progressing from the 1920s to the 1980s but there is great love and tribute to the human spirit i guess what i want to say about this book is that sometimes love looks an awful lot like loss","3195":" i had really high expectations for this one seeing as it was chosen for oprah's book club and it received rave reviews i liked it enough but did feel a little let down view spoiler in 1920 hattie shepard moves from georgia to philadelphia with her husband august in the hopes of starting a new beginning in the north she gives birth to twins and names them philadelphia and jubilee as a symbol of this new beginning and hope for a better future her babies are not even a year old when they succumb to pneumonia at the time hattie was using juju medicine to try to cure her children eucalyptus leaves and mustard poultices unfortunately the twins both died soon after they became ill after the death of her first born children hattie was never the same she fell into a sort of depression and after giving birth to 9 more children she never could really show them the love or tenderness that she could of had she not experienced this tragedy so early on she was only 17 at the time each chapter is in the pov of one of her children and it is interesting to see their perspectives throughout the story most of the children end up having some serious issues which was probably the result of not having much of a loving mother things i liked the very first chapter hattie's perspective is what drew me into the book and really got me hooked but from then on nothing really compared to that first chapter the pov of each child the healing juju techniques of the time were interesting to read aboutthings i didn't like the novel just didn't have that wow factor for me the ending didn't satisfy me enough after having kind of a dull middle it's crazy how far medicine has come since the 20's at the end of the novel in 1990 hattie thinks to herself that all her children needed to survive the pneumonia was some penicillin it was as easy as that and unfortunately medicine wasn't that advanced at the time hide spoiler","3196":"i tried to like this book however i just couldn't i like books where you invest yourself in the story this one really had no story i like books where you find yourself loving or hating the characters this one didn't give me enough time to develop that love hate relationship each chapter is about a different child of hattie however once that child has been talked about you don't hear about them again except in very quick passing maybe some people like that in a book but i don't this was more like a compilation of unfinished novellas instead of a novel","3197":" a quick read and captivating it almost reads more like a collection of short stories and hits on some very interesting topics especially given the historical time frame in which some of the stories take place i particularly liked the two chapters about two of hattie's sons one in a jazz band and the other who goes on to become a minister i felt like they touched on love and human relationships experience very well not that the others didn't another powerful sticks with you scene was the one in which hattie's sister and her husband are traveling up to philadelphia and stop for a picnic lunch at a rest stop so true how a single interaction can reinforce power dynamics and entice so much fear and apprehension","3198":"http livethroughbooks wordpress com","3199":"this story was slow to envelop my interest switching from different characters' view points and writing sometimes in first person and sometimes in third made it difficult to piece together the cast of characters after the 4th chapter it finally gripped me then it was well worth the lost sleep to find out what happened with the next person i also have to mention oprah's highlights these were very annoying in the kindle version i selected one in error early on which took me to her comment about it at the end of the book from then on kindle said that was the furthest point read so i always had to remember where i'd left off","3200":"i was really looking forward to this book i found myself disappointed it felt like a bunch of short stories a couple of the characters had good stories others were random and undeveloped","3201":"couldn't even get past the first chapter after her children died awful way too depressing to read do not recommend usually oprah picks good books not this time","3202":"the twelve tribes of hattie is the debut novel from ayana mathis and it is the story of hattie shepherd and her 12 children well 11 children and 1 grandchild the title is an allusion to the twelve tribes of israel which were named after the children of jacob the layout of the chapters is unique every chapter is written from one of the children's perspective so we get to know hattie through the eyes of her children the first chapter is compelling and heartbreaking and ends with the saddest line i have ever read in a long time hattie's children died in the order they were born first philadelphia then jubilee the chapter that i liked the most was bell's among her brothers and sisters she was most affected by hattie's stoic attitude toward her children she was the one who yearned the most for her mother's love and tenderness and she was the last one to finally make peace with her mother one of the things that first struck me about the book was how hattie's children lead dysfunctional lives it's as if none of them were normal but the author explained that we perceive hattie's children as dysfunctional because we are seeing them at the most poignant and most critical moment in their lives we are meeting them at their hallelujah moment as oprah would say on that note this novel has brought out a bit of introspection from me and has lead me to examine my life it begs the question if somebody has to write a story about you at the most critical moment of your life what would that story be i know what mine is","3203":" i don't think i've included spoilers in this review but proceed with caution if you don't want to know anything of the general plot from reading other reviews of this novel i realize that many readers have different reactions to the characters i found this novel to be very depressing and somewhat infuriating the author has chosen an interesting device to tell the story of hattie her family and her children by having each chapter other than the first told from the perspective of a different child at a different point in time unfortunately despite what hattie says were her best efforts to raise her children right they are all messed up every single kid is depressed an alcoholic womanizer homosexual in denial schizophrenic suicidal and the list goes on although hattie suffers the tragic loss of her twins early on in the book not a spoiler it's in the official description of the book to me that does not justify the lack of warmth she shows to the rest of her children throughout the rest of her life she says that she worked so hard to give them a good life that she didn't have time to be tender but i don't buy that because i don't see the good life that she gave to any of her children considering that oprah picked this book i assume i'm supposed to admire hattie for her sacrifices but i don't i think she could've done much better by her children even when you consider she was a black woman raising a family in philadelphia throughout the 20th century i don't see the loss of the twins as an excuse for the fact that her other children felt she never loved them and the harm that caused them as adults it's probably a good book club book because there is a lot of fodder for discussion but it was not my favorite","3204":"i was like omg really i don't really care for a series of short stories as each character came to life i became intrigued i wish there were more to each of hattie's children did franlin ever meet lucille did six come into accepting his gift and using it to edify god does mental illness run in hattie's family how did ella fair in the south with pearl ayana can you please do a sequel thank you in advance","3205":"in between 3 and 4 stars for this one i feel like it was overly ambitious i would have preferred less than 12 tribes but in more detail definitely worth reading though","3206":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book started out so promising it had everything that i thought was going to suck me in and take me away right from the first chapter i thought oh yes i am going to like this sadly i ended up angry how on earth could all of hattie's kids turn out so disastrous seriously kids don't all come out that messed up unless there is some really bad abuse the father loved them even though he didn't provide a lot of money he wasn't abusive he didn't drink he didn't beat their m this book started out so promising it had everything that i thought was going to suck me in and take me away right from the first chapter i thought oh yes i am going to like this sadly i ended up angry how on earth could all of hattie's kids turn out so disastrous seriously kids don't all come out that messed up unless there is some really bad abuse the father loved them even though he didn't provide a lot of money he wasn't abusive he didn't drink he didn't beat their mother he loved them and sang to them and was more like a buddy than a father wow makes complete sense the girls ended up all being crazy not a little crazy either as for hattie so she was a bit bitter who wasn't after having all those kids and constantly having to care for them ugh it just makes me angry it made no sense that her kids grew up that way unless they were really feeble minded and weak spirited and had no back bones at all so what their mother was disappointed in the not cruel not abusive not even a drinker husband who she loved having sex with that isn't abuse she gave her kids a wooping when they were bad well who didn't back then because this is an oprah pick everyone is going to rave about it to me it is just another oooo wooo is me book and i kept waiting to read where all the woooo came from big disappointment more","3207":"recommended by conniecheck our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","3208":"wow this is not your feel good uplifting book it is wrought with drama about an african american family trying to make it in the northeast in a time when they were despised and looked down upon i think this book wad well written and the author was emotionally invested if you enjoy tough heart wrenching drama books this a good pick read it in 3 days","3209":" while i enjoyed this book i'm not sure it qualifies as a novel it reads more like a collection of disjointed short stories that isn't necessarily a bad thing but i do wish we saw more of this family as a unit instead of numerous separate vignettes as it stands hattie's children barely seem related at all i also found some of the characters to be cliche trifling men u0026amp long suffering women fill these pages i wish mathis had challenged these tropes more but overall this is an interesting read","3210":"i was going to give this book 4 stars but decided on 5 stars after seeing that this was the author's debut book exceptional writing some of the other reviewers did not like that each chapter was a story of its own and not seeming to contribute to an overall plot but i totally disagree the overall plot was a woman's strength and devotion to her family through all kinds of heartache","3211":"judging by the titular biblical allusion this novel intended to deal with the legacy of slavery it does that allocating challenges and misery to each of hattie's children problematically we barely get to know any of the characters in fact just as we start to know them a new chapter starts and a new character is introduced however i guess the focus is hattie not her children she is the glue that holds the novel together through the eyes of her children we get to know different sides of her","3212":"i liked it loved how it is full circled yet so empty at same time loved sipping each child chapter with a distinct voice and style","3213":"i should have read the reviews before attempting to read this book finally quit when i got about 3 4's of the way through too depressing and no end in sight","3214":"i liked the glimpses into the lives of hattie's children powerful read","3215":"the writing is strong however when i read a novel i want a well woven story to be there it does indeed read like a bunch of short stories about each of her children but after each story we never hear from the children again all the children were damaged in some way but there's no satisfaction in knowing how most of them turned out what happened to them etc hattie didn't really change she remained hardened and cold throughout the entire book","3216":"this is a story of a young family who leaves georgia for philadelphia to seek a better life from 1925 to 1980 each chapter tells the story of a different child of the family the main character is hattie the mother of 11 children and hattie's strength and pride define resilience in the face of poverty and need i had difficulty relating to some of their circumstances unable to imagine living from hand to mouth with so many children and so little resources and as unreliable as august was as a husband his affection as a father made his character more tolerable as the story ends hattie's strength and stubbornness touches the next generation she takes in her granddaughter the reader may well wonder if their better life really came true certainly not without great sacrifice","3217":"a very unique set up that i have to admit got confusing at times since i love toni morrison and she was a big influence on the author i did enjoy the novel","3218":"i was quite excited about this book after reading oprah's first bookclub 2 0 selection wild i'm sorry to report that i feel this book regresses back to the dark themes that were prevalent in her first book club selections while the book was well written and i enjoyed how the author organized the chapters by character it ultimately was a book that began on a hopeful note but spiraled downward as tragic circumstances impacted the family i certainly can enjoy a book that has a serious theme at its core but it must be offset by the redeeming qualities of characters or a hopeful message two things i feel this book did not capture i will proceed with caution as oprah makes future book recommendations in an interview with the author she said one of the pleasant surprises someone has shared about her book was by donna seaman who said the book is about complexities of backbone i thought that was very well said","3219":"while this book was an easy read it didn't connect it felt like a bunch of short stories rather than a cohesive novel it was full of anger and regret and left me feeling rather underwhelmed","3220":"great book really interesting writing style to tell the story kept me wanting to read read read","3221":" from the very first chapter i was captivated by the story of hattie a young mother struggling with the illness of her twin babies in the most painful and simple language the author shows us in the first chapter pretty much the last vestiges of hattie's love and sweetness she is heartbroken by this tragedy which will affect her and her children for the rest of the story each chapter concentrates on the other 9 children hattie bears and lastly her granddaughter while it was an interesting way to learn more about the main character it honestly left me wanting i never felt that i got to know each of these children or hattie for that matter as much as i wanted to i ended each chapter looking for more on each character but never really getting it the writing by this first time author is amazing even if i was not thrilled with the format the writing was wonderful and i would gladly read another by ayana mathis this was a very impressive debut novel","3222":" oprah got it right again but i still didn't expect this novel to be such a compelling page turner what a nice change from the book i've been slogging my way through katherine boo's celebrated narrative nonfiction book about children trying to grow up in a mumbai slum that i was really excited to read until i started reading it or trying to read it at times twelve tribes reads like a fictionalized version of the warmth of other suns isabel wilkerson's nonfiction account of the great migration of southern blacks to the north after ww1 which the author acknowledges as an influence the novel revolves around the story of one woman's experience after moving at age 15 from rural georgia to philadelphia but it's told in a series of stories each focused on one person first hattie's heart breaking early parenthood and then each of her children's stories she had 11 kids each member of hattie's family is fascinating distinctive and struggling in his her own way during the 1960s 1980's the novel includes light handed nods to major events of the day like segregation civil rights and vietnam plus a range of subjects including homosexuality substance abuse mental illness music black evangelical christians class divisions between light and darker skinned blacks all along the way hattie is the rock enduring many trials and tribulations but she's not a one dimensional saint like figure she comes across as a real person trying her best against the odds and rarely succeeding depending on how succeeding is defined i guess anyway the novel is so well written by a young recent iowa writer's workshop grad that i just kept reading one sentence after another one paragraph after another one page after another rarely stumbling upon a perplexing phrase image word choice metaphor or sentence construction unlike my read of boo's book a rare pleasure for me it's not that the language wasn't literary or the writing complex it was literary and complex and an easy read which is no easy feat and clear evidence of mathis' great skill","3223":"this book was a bit depressing i've read a lot of similar books written by toni morrison delores phillips bernice mcfadden etc and at least 1 if not more of their characters somehow overcomes their circumstances in the end i kept reading this book and hoping at least a story of 1 of her children would end on a high note or some sort of redemption i was hoping at least the grandchild would have a happy ending but she too has to bear the family burden","3224":"felt like i've read this book before interesting historical backdrop and a sense of sympathy for the plight of the characters but nothing ground breaking or entirely memorable","3225":"the twelve tribes of hattie is one of those books that i think will stay with me forever i don't have any children but a fear of mine is always will i ever be able to love a child enough from reading this book i know the better question is will i be able to let my child know how very much i loved them this story to me is lesson in love what happens when that loved isn't shown or communicated and that affects a generation great story","3226":"a magnificent read from start to finish the author sends you on a journey through the lives of hattie and her children never allowing you to forget the pain of the opening paragraphs and the impact on the main character a must read","3227":"when i got to hattie's ninth child i was ready to quit this book i was depressed anxious and was just not sure i could take any more heartbreak mathis has written a tale that had gotten under my skin and i did not want to know anything more about the twelve tribes of hattie however i also hate to quit reading any book that i have started i am glad i finished this novel collection of linked stories or whatever it is the last three children's stories helped me understand all the characters more clearly certainly i had a better picture of hattie herself i give mathis a lot of credit for writing this it is her first novel and she says that the structure gave her some issues i had a few problems with the lack of connections between the stories but by the end i found the whole is more than the sum of the parts i am curious about what will come next from this author i had hoped to learn more about the great migration from this book although that history is important to the beginnings of hattie's life it is not as important to the novel as i thought it would be this novel is more about one family than one culture i recommend this novel to book groups readers of american historical fiction and to those who are willing to visit some very dark places i know i will be thinking about hattie for awhile longer","3228":" i tried another oprah book this one was a collection of linked stories about hattie and her children and family from 1925 to 1980 by the end of the book i was looking for more pages i had so many unanswered questions the novel covered basic issues such as sexuality parenting and the struggle of marriage and the stories were depressing but compelling... but isn't life this story helped me understand what my grandparents must have experienced having 9 children each of my parents were one of youngest in their tribes so their parents were in the 40s when they were born some of the children were basically raised by older siblings or even given to other family members when yet more babies came along it must have been hard times for those fathers having to provide for large families and for the mothers having to cope emotionally and physically with that many pregnancies and children interesting stories","3229":"all i can say is life is too short to read books that you can not enjoy","3230":"as a debut offering this book is quite moving it begins with the tough death of hattie's twins pretty much as the chapter closes and moves along to the next you can feel how much hattie's heart and spirit hardened with the loss she loves her children as fierce as any lioness but you can imagine the disconnect i enjoyed the chapters written from the perspective of each child and the grandchild each one had a voice","3231":"3 5 stars for this one a quick easy read","3232":"the writing was quite good and i enjoyed that the author really wrote from each character's perspective but as per usual the short story format didn't draw me in each story was from a member of the family but the stories didn't intertwine enough until the end for me i think she could have written a great epic novel with these characters had she developed the plot more thoroughly to make it a novel","3233":"really a collection of short stories linked by the titular character this very well written book leaves you yearning for the full story of at least one of the tribe","3234":"this book is a powerful book with some exquisitely written passages the story of the great migration in this country is a story that needs to be told and understood ayana mathis is a talented and promising writer would have rated this book higher but at times i found the lapses in time and jumping around somewhat disjointed and disruptive all said this is definitely a recommended read","3235":"thought i would like this book not at all what i had thought it to be","3236":" short stories with a theme this struck me as a collection of well written essays on life in philadelphia and to a lesser extent georgia post 1925 when 17 year old hattie moves north with her mother and sisters immediately the difference between living as a black in the north against staying in the south is apparent to hattie they are no longer expected to walk off the pavement when a white passes they are even spoken to cordially it is an awakening for her but this seems to be the only positive part of the book for each of hattie's children suffer endless problems in their lives starting with the most heart rending chapter of all as hattie nurses her two tiny babies as they fight pneumonia hattie has not made a good marriage and although her husband loves the children he repeatedly fails to provide for them hattie becomes hardened and practical and the children remember little in the way of love or affection one by one the youngsters pull away from the family into adulthood and more mistakes there is little that is upbeat about these stories and little connection between them apart from the common parent the descriptions of time and place were well written but the disconnect between each chapter did detract from the overall read oprah's comments in my kindle version were interesting and irritating in equal measure but i found i could not just ignore them 3 1 2 stars","3237":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this may be the saddest book ever and every chapter was just more bleak than the last this book tells the story of hattie a desperately poor woman who became a mother far too young and her twelve children the book is well written but it is difficult to get invested as you get a small snippet of each child's life and not one story is carried through to its end so the reader is left wondering about each character hattie really does try to do the best she can given her position in life but this may be the saddest book ever and every chapter was just more

her position in life but not a single member of the family is triumphant more","3238":" i enjoyed this one a lot really beautiful writing and the first chapter my goodness what a gut wrenching way to start a book i enjoy books that are stories within stories or that are all related to each other i also loved reading the different perspectives and finding out more about hattie as the book progressed i never disliked hattie even though she was portrayed to be kind of harsh and loveless i could understand where she was coming from and why she was the way she was you know she loved her children and was doing the best she could","3239":"i liked the characters u0026amp the writing but it left me feeling unresolved each chapter focuses on a different child of hattie's and spans from 1925 1980 some are from her viewpoint u0026amp some from the child's this structure necessitates that each chapter work as an individual short story the long time range u0026amp all the viewpoints obscures the biographical details of the characters such that after reading the whole thing i know she had 11 children but i don't know what order they came in or what happened to most of them i like a bit of closure in my fiction so i can only give this 3 stars","3240":"hattie comes up from the south to philadelphia in the great migration in 1925 she is a young married mother although still in her teens each chapter is mainly a story of hattie's children although each chapter adds to your knowledge of hattie's life story and sometimes although barely of her children's relationship with each other clearly the author intended for the kids' stories to reflect the standing of african americans at that time of history most of character's were fascinating and i was disappointed that the author didn't cycle back to have them interact with each other or to update us to what happened in their life later on would have preferred for this slim novel to have been beefed up with more details","3241":"such a good book as a mother who is empty how can you give what you don't have","3242":"like several books currently popular this book's structure is reminiscent of sherwood anderson's winesburg ohio 1919 i e a series of loosely connected short stories each of which makes its own point but also adds to the overall point impact of the book point and plot are not the same thing if you can only read books linear in structure please do not attempt this one and then criticize it for being what it is but you will miss some of the most literate and yet still poignant writing on the current market personally i feel starved for books of this caliber and was ecstatic to find this one it is so good i am sure i will read it again when i despair of modern fiction just to remind myself there are still real writers out there i could not put this book down and highly recommend it for readers of literary fiction","3243":" i really salute ayana mathis for creating this world of hattie's that not only kept me wanting to read more but beautifully weaved and intertwined each story while maintaining the unique voice to each chapter there were so many moments in this book that lingered with me and had me imagining life as hattie or one of her children and the defining moments of their lives and the narrators did a fantastic job in further sinking me into the story mathis was very convincing in creating so many emotionally real and sadly tragic characters i will not soon forget","3244":"this novel reads like a book of short stories the tribes of hattie are her children the story starts with hattie who comes to philadelphia from georgia as a teenager in the 1920s each chapter in the book tells the story of one or two of her children during a pivotal point in their lives i liked how the main character hattie was woven into each of these stories i really enjoyed this book and quickly became fascinated with this family","3245":"very raw you feel like you are looking into the painful lives of the adult children due to hattie the mother's attempts to make do and help her children survive when they were kids in the harshest of circumstances highly recommended","3246":"melancholic but intriguing stories worth the read","3247":"a very different book the first chapter was narrated by hattie and damn near broke my heart the rest were narrated by one or two of hattie's children it is an impressive look into an african american family's struggles with faith trying to find their equal place in a racist society and what family means very well written","3248":"3 1 2 our of 5 stars i probably would have given it 4 but the last two chapters really fell short up until then i enjoyed each child's story i definitely enjoyed how it was written with each chapter being the story of one or two of hattie's children and each chapter being further down the timeline with flashbacks to their upbringing it was an interesting way to tell a story","3249":"if you liked or wanted to like this book you might also enjoy some sing some cryall aunt hagar's childrensoucouyant","3250":"i wanted to like this book it's an oprah book but i couldn't finish it i found it dark and depressing from the very first chapter without any redeeming plots i started skimming to get to the story of one of the other 12 of hattie's children and each was a depressing as the next i stopped reading it not sure why this book has such good reviews","3251":"i loved the language i felt myself rereading sentences u0026amp marveling at their beauty","3252":"got better as it went on but super depressing well it is an oprah book after all guess its fitting","3253":" after sticking with this book for five chapters i am giving up i don't typically enjoy oprah's recommendations but this one has been so well reviewed the writing is good but it reads like a series of short stories about each of hattie's children i would rather have more of a plot none of the characters were relatable or likable to me especially hattie i have no tolerance for a cold distant mother i concur with the chicago tribune's review our great novelists give us fully rounded characters whose lives reflect the limitations the possibilities and the wonder of the times in which they live mathis gives us a one dimensional portrait of their suffering and little else","3254":"another depressing oprah book enough said","3255":"i found the stories of hattie's children compelling the story showed how a young mother raised her 11 children unprepared and with an iron fist the book was interesting but i wish the stories would have been tied up better in the end","3256":" i loved this perfect in every way even the ending oh my this book managed to take translate a chunk of african american history into actual lives through a description of hattie and her various children we are exposed to the human condition and in particular the life of black americans ayana mathis explores drug addiction homosexuality schizophrenia success infidelity war veterans the list goes on and on and somehow she keeps this narrative gripping and united instead of a rambling mess each of the characters were fascinating mathis does not use the hardships of racism as an excuse or apology for the addictions and vices of her characters but it does help to explain it hattie's husband was initially her achilles heel she seemed hobbled by him and yet his understanding of her was so deep and their shared experiences so powerful that while he definitely came at a steep financial price we also see that he supports her and understands her in a way no other character can this was revealed most clearly during ruth's custody argument most powerfully though am managed to describe these lives with no sense of judgement or blame in fact in the middle of a disagreement between two sisters i found myself in the odd position of being able to take sides but not wanting to both perspectives were powerfully valid but neither had a perfect answer to the custody of hattie's daughter it was interesting to read this novel as a mother to watch the children grow and see them resent respect blame accept remain alienated from and puzzled by their mother throughout it all though hattie did her utmost to be the provider her children needed and to prepare them for the world which had been so hard on her i wish i'd written a review closer to having actually completed this book it really blew me away and yet i'm having trouble remembering specfics now all i know is that i loved it despite finding myself in tears during the very first chapter i guess i became emotionally tougher as i turned the pages just as hattie did as the novel progressed beautifully written fascinating topic gripping plots and characters just a great book","3257":"hattie marries arthur and they have eleven children the development of hattie's character is viewed through the eyes of her children and one grandchild a sense of ethnic identity is the strongest flavour in this book as hattie and arthur move from the deep south of usa to unfulfilled promises in the north","3258":"i think i just kept waiting for something to happen","3259":"a very interesting book the unusual structure worked well","3260":"too depressing just too depressing","3261":"i liked it didn't love it really good in the beginning but then i felt it was so depressing towards the end all of her kids had issues and none were successful she didn't realize she made mistakes until her granddaughter was 10 i was ready to be done with the book by hearing how the 9th kid turned out","3262":"is the life story of hattie shepherd itspans from 1925 to 1980 when she fifteen hattie her mother and sister moved from georgia to philadelphia there she married soon after and gave birth to twins the first of many many children my thoughts the first chapter of this novel is devastating and heart wrenching and still somehow hopeful both of hattie's twins are sick with pneumonia in the middle originally appeared at http nomadreader blogspot com the basics the twelve tribes of hattie is the life story of hattie shepherd it spans from 1925 to 1980 when she fifteen hattie her mother and sister moved from georgia to philadelphia there she married soon after and gave birth to twins the first of many many children my thoughts the first chapter of this novel is devastating and heart wrenching and still somehow hopeful both of hattie's twins are sick with pneumonia in the middle of the night mathis shifts from the current minutes to hattie's memories beautifully in the second chapter however the action shifts both in time and narrator suddenly it's 1948 and hattie's son floyd is a musician traveling through the south my understanding of this novel shifted and i expected to read a chapter from the point of view of each of hattie's children thus coming to understand her as a mother and as a woman in time though mathis shifts back to hattie one consequence of this narrative structure was it's disjointedness i never truly got a feel for this novel as i was reading it but upon further reflection particularly of the stunning final chapter i did at times it felt like a collection of linked stories while hattie was a part of all of them in each story the reader glimpsed into the life of one of her children most of whom were only previously mentioned in passing while hattie weaved through all of the stories her children did not while this novel is the story of hattie's life it's also a commentary on the great migration he thought of the south as a single undifferentiated mass of states where the people talked too slow like august and left because of the whites only to spend the rest of their lives being nostalgic for the most banal and backwoods things paper shell pecans sweet gum trees gigantic peaches there's also an extreme sadness to this novel as i read about more and more of hattie's children i couldn't help but think him too or her too can no one in this family catch a break in life this darkness is crucial to hattie and her views on life and religion hattie believed in god's might but she didn't believe in his interventions at best he was indifferent god wasn't any of her business and she wasn't any of his in church on sundays she looked around the sanctuary and wondered if anyone else felt the way she did if anyone else was there because they believed in the ritual and the hymn singing and good preaching more than they believed in a responsive sympathetic god favorite passage it seemed to him that every time he made one choice in his life he said no to another all of those things he could not do or be were huddled inside of him they might spring up at any moment and he would be hobbled with regret the verdict the twelve tribes of hattie is a difficult novel in many ways as a novel of the great migration it is hinged on a hope we know will fail and taking the journey of a generation's disappointment is depressing still mathis is a bold and lyrical writer the first and last chapters will stay with me for quite some time","3263":"i read this book some time ago i enjoyed every word just failed to clear it off my shelf i throughly loved the individual stories","3264":"outstanding reminiscent of toni morrison not as poetic perhaps but more accessibly coherent i love that this is organized around the lives of hattie's children their various lives are individually fascinating but collectively they are every american family","3265":"typical oprah book club pick depressing with hints of mental illness thrown in hattie flees georgia and her family at age 15 and moves to philadelphia hoping for a better life she marries august a man who spends every penny she saves and has a roving eye tragedy strikes when her twins philadelphia and jubilee are seven months old hattie as a wife and mother is never the same again","3266":"should be 3 1 2 stars","3267":"none of the characters are particularly likeable but their demons are illustrated skilfully enough to make the narrative compelling","3268":"main character was fascinating really about a family facing desperate times real problem was that many of the lesser characters were not well developed author regressed to racial stereotypes some of the characters were whiny i listened to it skip discs 7 and part of 8 really could have been better","3269":"i just couldn't get into this book i know there have been rave reviews but it didn't seem innovative or original to me at all i couldn't relate to the characters maybe because each chapter was a new character and so the connection was brief u0026amp fleeting i just didn't connect with any of it sorry","3270":"i enjoyed the beginning of this book immensely but it does not follow the character introduced in the first chapters instead the book explores a variety of other characters and i just had a hard time feeling as connected as i did in the beginning so i did not keep reading i may go back to this book again though and give it another chance","3271":"i didn't intend to read this book but got it confused with a different title when i purchased it i have never read a book quite like this one and thoroughly enjoyed it the writing was beautiful and i found myself captivated by several different paragraphs throughout the book they were alternately beautiful and haunting and powerful i enjoyed that the chapters were essentially short stories with only hattie as the common thread and that we were given her story in such an oblique way","3272":" more like 3 5 the twelve tribes of hattie chronicles the lives of hattie's offspring they all lead unique existences and their destinies are shaped by their mother slowly through her 12 children we readers get a good idea of the type of life hattie lives the writing is great and i liked a lot of the characters hattie's back story is told in an intelligent manner and the feminist angle is great to however my main problem is that with the exception of the last two chapters none of the children really interact with each other by this i mean that the children are only mentioned briefly in different chapters but there aren't any explicit references to them or what the siblings think of them or even how they influenced each other one example i have in mind is elizabeth strout's olive kitteridge which managed to create great individual stories and yet manage to display the characters interacting with each other i suppose that mathis kept the children's stories separate but i do feel that some cohesiveness would have made this novel a bit richer","3273":"3 5 stars the lives they would have had are unoccupied all left untenanted p237i don't usually like stories told as vignettes but it works here the protagonist or antagonist as it were is compelling enough to remain visible and interesting even when not on stage the writing feels affected at times alice and billups franklin mostly though the emotional imagery is stunning stunning in its raw unvarnished believable melodrama stunning in its quiet matter of fact devastation","3274":"the main reason i gave this only 4 stars is that i really wanted each chapter to be an entire book i loved each one and i really wished i could get to know the characters better over a longer time as a window into the life of one woman they were fascinating","3275":"i didn't really enjoy the story because as one reviewer noted it was somewhat painful to read there was too much dysfunction for me however it was well written and interesting to read about each of the different characters featured in the chapters","3276":"mathis painted a picture of the main character through the eyes of her children with poise and incredible clarity hattie was complex while she meant well you questioned the ways she expressed love to her family for this to be her first novel mathis struck me as one who has already mastered the craft i was personally touched by ella's chapter and after reading her story others came in clear view each story undoubtedly resonates with a reader in different ways whether it connects you to a familiar story or it is your story certainly a novel i will remember for days and months to come","3277":"the beginning started off great about hattie moving from georgia to philadelphia with her mother and sister back in 1925 when she was 17 the next chapters talk about each of her children i wanted to know more about the children after their initial chapter and i was disappointed that they didn't develop the children more","3278":"dysfunctional and depressing the book jumped around too much and never really returned to any of the characters once their sad lives were addressed once it was hard for me to push through this one but i made it to the end and it ended just as as sad and depressing as it started i don't know what oprah was thinking","3279":"very sad and depressing but so well written","3280":" wow i'm shocked to find just a smidgeon over three stars for this novel i was torn between assigning four or five stars this is a fine debut novel set in rural georgia philadelphia and in between its framework is made from a chronological ordering of short stories that span more than half a century and center around key moments in the lives of hattie's offspring the stories are powerful the writing is lyrical and the handling of dialectical syntax is deft this is the story of a strong wife and mother disappointed by the life her wayward husband and their children and the flaws and failures of them all it's not a pretty story but it's beautifully told this novel surprisingly ends on a high note that is well earned","3281":"http therumpus net 2013 03 horn rev","3282":"generally solid and mathis has a great handle on language but the novel could benefit from a bit further sustained study on hattie herself also the amount of male cads in the book overwhelm a sense of genuine study concerning black masculinity","3283":"#ncborrowed from library fs philadelphia and jubilee august said when hattie told him what she wanted to name her twins ls hattie put her arm around sala and pulled her close she patted her granddaughter's back roughly unaccustomed as she was to tenderness","3284":"the formatting of the novel was interesting with each of hattie's children or grandchild getting a chapter however there was little satisfaction to the reader with such a short story devoted to each and they rarely turned up in each other's narratives characters were imaginatively drawn just not fully realized","3285":"although this is the first novel by ayana mathis the twelve tribes of hattie can stand with work by such authors as toni morrison or joyce carol oates make no mistake about it this is a story of tragedy told through snapshots of sorts decades apart in the life of a black family that was part of the great migration from the jim crow south the ending seems to be intended to give hope although it seemed very sad to me yet this is the kind of book which after finishing makes choosing the next book to read much harder despite the pile of books that i would otherwise be eager to get to because it's so good that many other authors in my queue won't measure up right now read it because you want to not because oprah told you to","3286":" this book is both a heather's pick and a selection for the oprah book club 2 0 many people will buy it for those reasons and many people will be disappointed if people like a book to have at least a spark of happiness in it somewhere they will be disappointed there is no joy to be found in the tribes of hattie if people like characters to journey through hardships to redemption they will be disappointed the unfortunate tribes of hattie spiral into disillusionment or bitterness the book introduces us to the many children of hattie shepherd an unplanned teenage pregnancy starts hattie on her long road of motherhood and we read how the lives of her children unfold in any number of dysfunctional ways each chapter features a different child or two and the stories of those children overlap with those of the others in the family only peripherally the result is disjointed and unsatisfying the word tribe in the title misleads prospective book buyers into believing that they will read about a family with a long reach and lingering legacy the reality of the story is the opposite the characters strangle themselves with their own flaws and sputter out before reaching far or creating legacy hattie and her husband august are the only threads that run through the book and they are not easy characters to love the author alludes to the biblical story of job even job gets to see god at the end of his story he has his fortune restored and then doubled poor hattie she just walks away from the church still struggling to show someone some tenderness","3287":"good read great book expect the unexpected in every chapter of the book i didn't want to put it down i lost sleep reading thin oil","3288":"i enjoyed this book for the most part my favorite chapter was chapter 3 six 1950 i could identify with this character the most i've read a few reviews in this forum and i tend to agree with some of the readers i think the characters could have been linked up to create a better flowing story otherwise not bad at all","3289":"this is a story of a proud woman who follows her heart instead of her head into a marriage that disappoints her for the rest of her life the chapters follow her story and then her children's stories what i don't like about it is that the characters were not well developed and i had a hard time caring very much about any of them including hattie the children are seen mostly as adults later in life and rarely interact with each other all of them have pretty severe emotional and or physical problems that seem to be largely blamed on their mother's matter of fact and somewhat cold parenting she provided them the basic necessities food and shelter she thought that was her way of showing love physical affection or emotional support did not happen august hattie's husband is the opposite all fun and games and no practical parenting he is a terrible provider and unfaithful husband the whole thing is a mess and the children suffer i should have cared more about all of it instead i just wanted the book to be over i heard an interview on npr with the author and oprah and expected that reading this book would tell me something about what it was like to be african american during the 40s and move from the south to the big city and how that experience continues through subsequent generations that theme is secondary to the over arching point the author makes that children do not thrive without genuine love and kindness from their mother as i am writing this review i have decided to change my rating to i did not like it this story lacks a character you can root for it lacks warmth and is depressing","3290":"there was a real disconnect between the chapters and characters it was well written and the characters were interesting but i think i would have been more engaged just following hattie's story in a more linear way i just couldn't get a sustained momentum going to continue reading or care what happened to these characters","3291":"beautifully written book heartbreaking throughout but hopeful at the same time","3292":"it took me some time to really dive into this book but once it gets going it is a good narrative the characters are memorable and intriguing the book is kind of sad but it is worth the read","3293":"good quick read","3294":"this was a book club read i found it just an ok read i was only reading a page or two a day and was not highly motivated to keep reading in the end there were elements that reminded me of my family so i think i understood what the writer wanted to impart to the reader","3295":"some strong writing but i wanted more each chapter was its own story not very cohesive","3296":"i read this book as part of a summer book club so probably would not have chosen it on my own certainly some very challenging and heartbreaking life circumstances described within i did enjoy the book but found the heartbreaking parts difficult to read at times","3297":"not a perfect book and so depressing but she's a good writer first novel a bit reminiscent of toni morrison i'm glad i read it","3298":"i really enjoyed this book great pacing and story structure each chapter is about a child in hattie's life yet told chronological hattie is a complex woman told through snippets of how her children see her the best chapter i thought was about a daughter and billups all told about one day in their lives after abandoning a book i couldn't get into this was a great read","3299":"i loved the different points of view of each member of the tribe it was sad that they didn't seem to have much interaction with each other after they grew up and left hattie each was so fully formed that you wish for a spin off to find out what happened to them in particular i enjoyed the narrative of the relationship between hattie and her husband it was scorching the love then hate resignation then the utter hopelessness of the poverty and drinking it was eye opening still despite the depressing outcomes i was sorry when i turned the last page","3300":" this book was well out of my comfort zone not one i would have picked to read based on the reviews but it was on the counter at the library so i added it to my stack thinking i might thumb through it turns out this was a wise decision i could not put this book down i read the entire thing in 4 hours beginning to end i felt like i was watching this play out on the screen as i read it you get a real sense of the characters and the world around them when i can see and hear the characters in a book this tells me it is special i hope ms mathis continues to generate this same quality of book in her writing career i am definitely a fan great job on your first novel","3301":"many african americans left the south and migrated north for a better life this is the story of 15 year old hattie shepard who left georgia in 1923 and moved to philadelphia she marries a man who seems pretty worthless doesn't work much and isn't much of a father to his children hattie bears 11 children along with one grandchild this is their story the book is divided in parts about the children it seemed disjointed to me a story would be told about one child and then that was it never mentioned again i found the basic story line depressing her children see hattie as uncaring and demanding just a couple of unkind things that were said about her not much happiness in this household or the lives of the people who live there several times i wondered why i was continuing to read this story but i am satisfied that i did complete the book","3302":"maybe because i listened to this instead of reading it i didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be there were a lot of characters to keep track of i did enjoy it and thought it was good just a bit confusing","3303":"this is the story of hattie as told through the eyes of her 12 children tribes problem is mom is the most fascinating character in this novel and you don't really learn anything about her this book is more like a collection of short stories and while some are riveting and unforgettable others are blah plus the book just ends i wish i learned more about hattie herself","3304":"the stories were well crafted but they didn't mesh together well enough for me to be enamoured with the tale i enjoyed the read each chapter made me thirsty to find out more about the family the shifts in person and leaps in time scattered the timeline while progressing it from hattie's first mothering act to her twins to her decision to shield her granddaughter from a lie in church good read nicely crafted narrative of the great migration and redemptive struggle","3305":"crap started with awkward sex i stopped at the second such awkward scene the author didn't even bother to start the story just went from one to the other empty","3306":"terrible do not recommend at all","3307":"i will ever be affected by hattie's plight it's a book every adult woman should read","3308":"beautifully written but way too sad stories there is little or no humor even black humor","3309":"a first time author that i would gladly read again i can't say that i liked the format too much with each chapter the name of another character each character had a whole story to tell and a chapter just wasn't enough time to do that hattie was a seemingly unyielding parent who showed very little emotion this attitude had much to do with how her grown children turned out in their adult lives bell's chapter was the saddest for me because it could so easily have been fixed","3310":"a really beautiful book i couldn't put it down and can't wait to read it again","3311":"i wish the author would tied the individual stories together more","3312":"first let me say the audiobook performance was amazing the story itself is engrossing but imperfect mathis falls into melodrama and strains the credulity of the reader with the sheer amount of tragedy that befalls one woman i also felt like mathis relied too heavily on the quasi short story format to mask some of the problems in character development despite this i was drawn into the story and the life of hattie and her children","3313":"didn't like it rather a waste of time like a bunch of loosely connected short stories that were all missing their endings and sometimes their middles too","3314":"how many dysfunctional children can one woman book have loved the tough love of hattie tired of the downtrodden lives quick read","3315":"more like a book of short stories each chapter is about a different character you just get to know one and the chapter ends enjoyable but very very sad","3316":"this book is underrated i cannot remember when last i read a book that moved me so much every chapter representing each of hattie's children was so beautiful and i was absorbed from the first to the very last page the only shortcoming was that the book is too short 241 pages i didn't want it to end stunning and a definite five star from me","3317":"sad but beautiful story each character's story leaves a lasting impression and helps add to what makes hattie hattie","3318":"i really enjoyed this book i loved the way the author made you feel as if you were there with each of the members of hattie's family i would recommend this book and i would read it again i gave it 5 stars","3319":"very good book that held my interest","3320":"wished there was a little more follow up on some of the vignettes good but sad","3321":"just finished this book very powerful impressive first novel reminds me of toni morrisons' writing","3322":"this novel consists of nearly independent sections devoted to various members of a large african american family in philadelphia over the course of the middle third of the 20th century each member struggles to maintain some human dignity amid various trials and dysfunction although the novel received oprah's imprimatur u0026amp generally good reviews i had trouble working up much empathy for the characters and although most reviewers except the one for the la times praised her elegant prose i like that reviewer found it mostly pretty pedestrian and it wasn't helped by the somewhat awkward readers of the audio version i listened to","3323":" this book is really a series of short stories each about one of hattie's children it spans a period of time from the 1920s to the 1980s beginning when hattie moves as a 17 year old from the south where she and her family loved under the shadow of jim crow to philadelphia where it seems like dreams may come true only they don't instead hattie's life is hard and gets harder her 10 children's lives are also hard this is not a feel good book it is a stark depiction of the challenges poor african american families faced in urban northern cities during the 20th century it is also a story about how the choices made by parents reverberate through their children's lives i can't say i loved this book but it was compelling each chapter was beautiful and painful and the voices and viewpoint of each narrator were remarkably distinct the reader has to work a little bit to put together the narrative of hattie's life but by the time the story circles back around to place her in the center again the reader knows her and how the events of her life have shaped her given all that came before a happy ending might have ruined the book but i might have preferred the end to be a little less ambiguous i'm still thinking about whether i liked the way it ended or not","3324":"i stopped reading oprah books a long time ago but this one was recommended the writing is powerful but the story is filled with damaged people not one of the 9 children is even close to having a normal life not just hard but totally broken people it would be unimaginably difficult as a mother to see this happen to her children it's that part that is so hard to read i will vow off oprah again i'm not into totally broken lives","3325":"that was a waste of time couldn't make a connection with the characters who couldn't seem to make a connection with each other","3326":" this is by far one of the best books i have ever read and no i am not saying that because oprah said it first smile this is a painful story woven together in rich detail and emotion you can feel the characters through the page from the very beginning mathis does a tremendous job of taking the reader into the life of seventeen year old hattie as she nurses her two ailing babies you feel her desperation and her need for them to survive i think the opening is perfect because i was able to understand the foundation of hattie's bitterness throughout the years that this story covers right after the death of the babies the reader is jolted into the life of another of hattie's children floyd and from there we get to see hattie and her husband august in various stages of their lives through the eyes of their children the death of the babies and the birthing of nine more children turns hattie into a woman incapable of showing tenderness to her children and it affects each of them in different ways mostly negative some worse than others like i stated this is a painful story i don't think i cracked a smile once but it is also a page turner and leaves the reader with a sliver of hope at the end when hattie attempts a bit of tenderness with the twelfth member of her tribe her granddaughter mathis' words read like a poem at times the flow is so melodic and rich i definitely recommend this story as a book to purchase if you regularly read my reviews you know that is the highest honor i will bestow upon an author","3327":"interesting stories but i felt i had met these people before not one of oprahs oh wow choices at least not for me","3328":" it should be no surprise the twelve tribes of hattie is an oprah winfrey book club selection oprah tends to favor books where african american's are struggling to make it the twelve tribes of hattie is no different the book starts off with hattie a young african american woman living in philadelphia with twin babies what happens in that chapter lays the groundwork for the rest of the book hattie goes onto have nine more children each chapter is then based on the life of one of hattie's children basically short stories with the tie being hattie knowing why hattie is as she is explains why her children become what they are a good read wouldn't necessarily rave about it would give this 3 1 2 stars","3329":"alisha one of the best books i've read in years each chapter represented a different member of hattie's tribe as well as a different era in american history offering up a fresh snapshot of cultural and family politics with every new character a must read for those who enjoyed the help and the kitchen house","3330":"i liked this book it isn't anything i would have picked on my own one of our book club ladies suggested it to read it was good i enjoyed reading it i would recommend it","3331":"i was off to a roaring start on this yesterday welcoming its change of pace with short story chapters for some historical context on hattie's hard life and her children's experiences in philadelphia a la times review that ran in the denver post this morning tainted the rest of the book for me i should have known better that to read someone else's take on this book and noted shortcomings before i finished","3332":" this book had strong points and the language was well done the only problem the structure it talked about one of hattie's child to another to another had this been done another way it may have worked out but the way it was published not so good each chapter was devoted to one of the kids solely yet after that they were abandoned some of them like six and franklin and alice i wanted to know more about with the current structure though it was not feasible to do so had i not read this in class there's a certainty that i wouldn't have read this book don't get me wrong it's not a bad book however if you wanted to analyze characters and situations and its connections it isn't the type of book you should look for advice the relationships or lack of between them is transparent and you can infer how hattie's mothering affected each child however they all turn out dysfunctional it is realistic in this aspect but there is only a slim chance that someone as detached and bitter women like hattie would continue to have children yes as humans we make mistake after mistake to make the same mistake 10 times more though is just sad hattie should have realized that it was way too soon to have more children after the occurances of chapter 1 philadelphia and jubilee hattie is the type of character we all hate too headstrong yet not independent fickle yet decisive it's not the contradictions that make her such a hard character to connect with but rather her continuous unintelligent choices i wish i could just shake some sense into her each chapter is like a mini short story had it said it was a compilations of stories involving hattie's children i may have been more satisfied at least then i'd have been delivered what had been promised but with what i did read not so much the last promise was a decent ending though promised hope though a bit too late rating 2 wandswould i read anything by mathis again so long as it doesn't involve hattie or anything historical recommended for anyone who doesn't mind taking time to make sense of what's happening buy a copy here http www amazon com twelve tribes h check out more of my reviews jinxed reviews","3333":"it was good but not great seemed like a bunch of short stories loosely connected by the mother hattie","3334":"it kept my attention and i agree that it is a terrific first novel written from the perspective of 12 different people it was a unique format just prior to picking this up i'd watched roots and was surprised how many scenes in the book were replicas if scenes from the movie that was the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars","3335":"excruciatingly beautiful a very powerful story of family and individual strength i can't remember the last time i openly wept at the end of a chapter","3336":" i should know better than to try mainstream books awful depressing miserable i metaphorically hurled the damn thing at the wall on about page 12 if you like reading about characters suffering horribly for hundreds of pages only to rise i assume i didn't even bother to check to triumph or resignation or damnation or whatever the sadistic author desires at the end you'll like it if you want a nice pleasant escape this ain't it i shall never listen to oprah again technically i didn't this time i blame npr for this one","3337":" this book was written in an interesting way one chapter for each of hattie's children you get the whole story but from different viewpoints and personalities it was well written and touching but i wasn't swept away i sometimes worry about how loving i seem to my children it is easy to get caught up in the busy work this paragraph really struck me hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind there is love in the busy work of keeping your children alive and clothed but it's not enough it's heartbreaking to see the effect that the absence of tenderness for a child can have all in all this book made me sad it's a solid 3 starts but i wouldn't read it again","3338":"what was the fuss by o about a meandering tale of a woman's unremarkable twelve children","3339":"absolutely devastating and luminous i would and will recommend it to anyone it's got a goon squad olive kitteridge style patchwork narrative if that helps sell you just read it","3340":" this book was sooo tired to me and didn't really seem to have anything new or interesting to add to this genre of fiction that aside because if the story is really compelling who cares if a novel isn't necessarily adding anything new to the dialogue about a particular subject matter i thought this was boring the book simply was not a novel and when i set out to read a novel i want a novel goddamn it each chapter is about one of hattie's children with the first chapter being about hattie herself although each of the chapters refers back to hattie that simply does not a plot make the connection was too tenuous and too contrived hey i know of a bunch of bad things that could happen to people how about i write a story about each one and pretend they have the same mom the book purported to be about family and the struggles trials and tribulations of family poverty race relations tensions between north and south bad men notably the joys of family were absent from the book but only one of the sibling chapters had anything to do with any other sibling otherwise it was simply isolated super depressing snapshots of each one's life","3341":"this book was interesting and i would recommend reading it wasn't one of my all time favorites but a good read","3342":"the one star is my personal rating having not read the whole thing i tried it because it was an oprah book knowing that some of her books are great and many are too gritty for me i made it through maybe two chapters in this before it was really too much and stopped can a girl get a good story without reading about the dark underbelly of humankind","3343":"read this for book club would not have picked it otherwise it left me feeling very unfulfilled","3344":"fantastic points of view an emotional tale of a woman that did the best she could a story of how parents can only do their best by their children","3345":"guess i shouldn't say i read it as that implies finishing maybe too soon to read another book in dialect but it left me cold after the first chapter so i moved on","3346":"i was riveted by this story one of those works that make you sooo glad to have been born at the end of the 20th century when women had choices u0026amp jim crow was in the past at least legally although about a black woman it reminded me of my grandmother in irewland who had twelve kids how tiring for the body u0026amp mind read this","3347":" in the pursuit of a better life hattie moves from georgia to philadelphia in her late teens she meets august and eventually the two of them marry but life is nothing like hattie expected after her twins die hattie is left heart broken and even though she has nine more children she struggles to be a loving mother add to that august is not the man she thought which leads hattie to make some poor decisions of her own yet through it all hattie tries to keep her family together as best as she can this is my second book from the oprah book club and to be honest i am undecided about it given the hype i had higher expectations each chapter is named after one or two of hattie's children each story revealing a little bit more about hattie some chapters stood out while some were fleeting while i agree that the writing is well done the lack of continuity was an issue once a story of one of the children was told it was done with i wish the author would have linked some of these narratives together and not kept them as separate short stories as for hattie not sure what to make of her she was a strong woman but also flawed the individual stories were interesting and the dynamics between hattie and her children changed over the course of the book all and all the book was all right but it did not stand out for me","3348":"the twelve tribes of hattie takes place when blacks were migrating north for a better life she was a child when she married and to have twins die hattie never recovered she did not love her children the way they thought she should as a result all had issues in their adult lives having thought she failed her children she makes the decision to try and love her grand daughter it's a sad but good read","3349":"could not get into this book at all this book was not written in a way that kept my attention do not reccomend","3350":"hard to believe this is her first novel exceptional poetic prose pleasantly surprised by this book","3351":"this book is dark it reads like short stories with each chapter about different children of hattie's and none of them are doing well it's hard to really feel too much attachment for any one character because you really only spend one chapter with them except for hattie and she isn't all that likeable i do feel compassion for her though she has had a really sad life full of hardships but she keeps going this book is a true testament for birth control how much easier we have it today she made a bad choice in her man and it went downward from there with every child adding more burdens still there is something compelling about this book and about hattie's strength","3352":"i am still thinking about so many of the images i love how this eloquently comes together through one mother","3353":"i was totally mislead by the hype that it was like the help it is not hattie isn't even all that likable not very coherently written either more like a series of related short stories and if it is called the 12 tribes wouldn't you think hattie had 12 kids it took a long time to fugure out just how many she had each child had the same remembrance of hattie and we never got to know her enough to prove or dispell it not one i'll be recommending","3354":" of course i had heard of this book because oprah raved about it and put it on her book club list so i got it on an e loan from my local library and i am sure glad i did what a great and engrossing read the story is about hattie a woman who left the deep south of georgian in 1932 with her mother and sisters fleeing from white men who came into her father's business killed him and burned the business down they fled across the mason dixon line to the north where white and colored people mingled adn where when a white person was walking down the sidewalk a colored person did not need to jump into the muddy road to let them pass soon after arriving hattie gets pregnant she herself just 15 years of age each chapter is titled with either one or two of hattie's eleven children her tribe adn they tell her story and their story as her children and what they endure celebrate and suffer the twelfth child is not her child in her tribe is not her child but her grandchild who comes to live with hattie in her old age my version of the book had reading questions at the end which i thought were thought provoking questions and got me to dig in deeper into the characters i read this book in just four days since i found it so enjoyable and stayed up late at night reading it the way the chapters are split up focusing on another character or two made it even more interesting and almost like short stories in itself","3355":" i love the story of struggle presented throughout this book struggle with identity relationships and the personal struggle to grow up and live the life we want to live yet being unable to do so because of life's challenges and heartbreaks reading this book was like opening a present but never being able to fully unwrap it each character is only presented through the length of one chapter then gone forever this style made it difficult to really ever fully understand and relate to the characters the writing was beautiful and the story enjoyable so not a complete waste of time","3356":" although this book was somewhat depressing i still found it very interesting the book begins briefly with the story of hattie who ends up pregnant at 17 and ends up marrying the baby's father august they leave georgia hoping for a better life in philadelphia their first 2 twin babies die of pneumonia and hattie is devastated by the loss their marriage deteriorates from that point on even though they go on to have 9 more children the rest of the novel is devoted to these 9 children a chapter to each one highlighting a period of time in that person's life the book covers a span of time from 1925 to 1980 and vividly portrays the difficulties and challenges african american people faced during that time period especially those living in poverty mathis has done a great job in developing the character of each of hattie's children","3357":"this is a book of desperate lives without much hope however the story is so well written you become easily engrossed i like a book where each chapter is from a differet perspective of the same story","3358":"this book was ok the story was ok i did not like how the author started a story line then went back and explained what happened before the story line there were so many characters it was hard to keep them straight i think telling this story in a chronological time line would have made that easier and more enjoyable","3359":"a struggle to read the whole book rather depressing","3360":"depressing and sad","3361":"heartbreaking and well written but lacking cohesion","3362":"remarkable novel great writing raw intense tough sad but also beautiful sweet sensual lyrical i enjoyed every bit of it and can't wait for more","3363":"the book tells the story of different people over different years and all of them connected to one woman hattie the story starts with hattie herself as a sixteen year old married and the mother of twins the tragedy in this first chapter will lay out the way the lives of all the other children she is to have in the years to come a story about hate love betrayal and family so beautifully written i was not sure what to expect with this story the summary did not give much away and honestly i was just excited about it because oprah picked it the first chapter left me sad and i was eager to know what happened next but of course i was taken some twenty years into the future to another character i know a lot of people did not think much of how the chapters were presented but i personally did not mind each chapter was so heavy and final that there was no other way to go but forward i did not get the ending as much as i wanted to and i might re read it i might not but it did show a little of what hattie is all about even if it is not what i wanted her to be but then again people will not always be what we want them to be we have to accept them as they are finally i think it was a good read beautifully written very sad and yes i did shed a few tears","3364":" this was difficult for me to get into the first two chapters were very sad and seemed to have little to do with one another later on there was more of a narrative flow as hattie appeared from time to time in her children's lives it will be interesting to see where this goes in our book club discussion later this week there are many topics for conversation but i felt there was little opportunity for me to relate to any of the characters overall the book was interesting i learned a little about the life of southern blacks in the north hattie was realistic but not terribly sympathetic even though she certainly deserved sympathy for all she put up with","3365":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here to me this book felt like more of a short story collection than a traditional novel it was a good read i would have loved to have seen how the family interacted as a family together most of the interactions were disjointed because of the book's format the only time we get to see the true interaction between siblings was with alice and billy i assume this was because the focus of the novel was hattie and her familial relationships and not really the family as a whole","3366":" not a lot to say about this book i wasn't that impressed by the short story format hattie's twelve children hold a chapter of the book and present different aspects of hattie after the death of her twins it was a very poetic story with lines very similar to an african parable unfortunately the great writing was a thin veneer for directionless plot and a poorly explored central character this was not really my type of book sorry 'oprah 2 0 book club' this was the first selection disappointment i ever encountered","3367":"just a stunning piece of fiction i mostly read nonfiction but this was completely inspiring","3368":"mesmerizing peek into a family over the decades each chapter is a different family member with hattie and august as the constants this is life that happens while you remember the past and daydream about the future","3369":"i was a bit disappointed it read more like a book of short stories very well written just not quite what i expected","3370":"by the time i finished the first chapter i was an emotional wreck mathis' writing placed me in that steaming bathroom with hattie and i knew i was in for the long haul some chapters were stronger than others in terms of character and story but the voice was consistently clear descriptive and powerful the book may be centered on the experience of african americans from the south moving north but it is essentially an immigrant story one of many stories of transition from one way of life to another sometimes for the better and sometimes not","3371":"this book reads like a collection of short stories i was left wanting to know how things turned out for each of her children","3372":"the book is extremely sad moves slowly and one has to read to the last few pages to learn the outcome of some of the characters it is depressing and a boring read","3373":"hattie shepard moves from georgia to philadelphia in the year 1923 she marries august a man that only gives her troubles her infant twins die as they didn't have money for medication hattie is a strong woman and goes on to raise nine more children she provides the best she can in extreme poverty but the children do not experience any motherly love or tenderness with hattie each of these children and one grandchild has a subsequent chapter about their life none of these characters are particularly likable especially the males the poverty despair and poor choices can really be depressing to read i did like the author's writing sparse but emotional and cuts right to the soul of a character each chapter can almost stand alone with hattie as the tie that binds them all together","3374":" i usually stay far away from oprah book club books but the subject matter especially the great migration intrigued me i enjoyed the book which really amounts to a lot of loosely connected stories the only real continuation is hattie and august most of the other sibling rarely relate or talk about the others with one or two exceptions and the book spans a long time i found the first few chapter the most interesting and kind of wanted to skip some of the latter chapter but overall i really enjoyed the book","3375":" i'm finding it difficult to know exactly how i feel about this book most of it is well written but i personally just could not engage with it perhaps that is a reflection on me rather than the book itself this is not so much a novel as a series of short stories the central character of each being a different member of hattie shepherd's family hattie herself married beneath her to a serial womaniser who nevertheless managed to find time to get hattie pregnant a dozen times with her no good husband barely bringing enough money and after losing her first children to pneumonia hattie's spirit and love are exhausted by the very act of keeping them alive and fed the rest of the book then demonstrates through the stories of her children's lives how hattie's attitude affected her children's lives it's all very worthy an i feel that i am supposed to adore this book but i have to confess after the first couple of chapters i was feeling slightly that i'd got the point and didn't need another 8 chapters on how terrible and shockingly depressing life can be the structure of the book also meant that i never really felt fully engaged with the characters hattie is the only constant the others come and go and are as a result developed in only one dimension","3376":"couldn't get through it gave it a fighting chance but i found it quite boring and didn't end up finishing it couldn't keep my attention","3377":"this book had some compelling writing but the way it was written left me wanting to hear more about each of hattie's tribes it also ended rather abruptly","3378":"the writing was incredible that is what kept me reading even though the children's lives were extremely sad i judge books on how much i think about them afterwards this one stayed with me","3379":"for ayana mathis' first novel i thought it was a good read with well written storyline the ending left me baffled though particularly as a christian","3380":" this is a wonderful novel about a family's move from georgia to philadelphia south to the north ayana mathis helped me keep track of the time in american history by adding the year at the beginning of the chapter the twelve tribes of hattie begins in 1925 the novel ends in 1980 it is amazing how many important issues are covered in the novel marriage death child rearing mental health motherhood family harmony or disunity really i began to understand more deeply all families are really alike in one way there is the struggle to understand one another with love while each person in the family reaches out for change i would add change to the list of issues involved in the novel hattie is like a river her tributaries children branch out and widen each branch of the river seems to grapple for away to gain personal strength away from the mother figure hattie is portrayed as remote but not hateful i am use to mothers being portrayed as very good or very bad ayana mathis did the miraculous by making this woman like a friend or aunt i might know i didn't grow to really like her or know much about her until cassie and sala made their entrance i think hattie had become less indifferent by the time sala her grandchild entered the world when i read her name sala i kept thinking of the word selah in the holy bible i decided to look up cassie's daughter's name it means a large or important room or hall esp one used in a home for the reception and entertainment of guests sala dining room -- manila times this definition makes me think sala will become the change needed in this family like a large wide open room she will gather the family back together again resew torn patches and dust the areas that haven't been dusted in ages in the end she is the harmony the music spoken of by ayana mathis it is really something to feel music to feel as though one has become music i remember that ecstasy i think it's the only time where she takes time away from nurturing children to thinking thoughts about all these child adults in her life i see her at this point as less introverted and more aware that change takes action or patterns are repeated here we are sixty years out of georgia she thought a new generation has been born and there's still the same wounding and the same pain i can't allow it she shook her head i can't allow it i felt all the painful crosses of burdens fell on the shoulders of cassie simply because when the mind is sick the whole body is sick the banshees drive cassie away from sala her only child cassie and sala were my favorite characters as sala pushes toward her mother cassie pulls away because of confusion and anxiety and fear i thought about how difficult it is to reach out for someone you love knowing you can never reach their soul it's like a wall as strong and as high as the wall of jericho is disallowing you from touching the people you love so much this is sala's legacy i suppose before she can even begin to dream some force is reaching out to steal her humanity and her true self however i don't think hattie will allow it this time hatties thinks not too old to weather another sacrifice for me the story began again with sala i wanted to know where she would go in life how long it would take to leave behind the emotional ties of her mother and what she would despise and love in life cassie sala's mother uses better words to describe my thoughts about her daughter what i feel for sala has eclipsed anything i thought was love before she was born it has made me wonder if i ever loved anything before her as for mother i think that i did love her i think i still do that's what i told sala these lines make me think mother and daughter love is far more complicated than the love between a mother and son this is only a personal guess however ayana mathis made my mind spin twirl and fall off its axis thinking of the psychology behind all types of relationships even alternative lifestyles i have begun to understand on a deeper level that relationships are what it's all about relationships keep us balanced or unbalanced what better place to begin a primer on relationships than in our families this is the beginning of all that comes before and what will come after we have long gone to our graves our voices whisper relationships keep trying don't give up try and change the pattern because a small family become wide and strong like the roots of a tree though they were small and struggling philadelphia and jubilee were already among those luminous souls already the beginning of a new nation nprbooksauthorsayana mathis","3381":"the twelve tribes of hattie is the story of hattie shepherd a woman who at the age of fifteen participated in the great migration with her mother and two sisters in 1923 hattie's father is murdered by a couple of whites in town wanting to take over his blacksmith business hattie loses her twins to pneumonia at the age of seventeen which seems to set her down a path of being an ice queen the sleeve of the book states that after giving birth to nine more children whom she raises with grit and mettle and not an ounce of the tenderness they crave she vows to prepare them for the calamitous difficulty they are sure to face in their lives to meet a world that will not love them a world that will not be kind each chapter is about one of the children and grandchild from her lineage but what is lacking is life lessons that hattie believed she was instilling in her children each child is lost confused and uncertain about how to love and what love really is because of hattie's rage and indifference towards them the chapters held an interest within themselves that left me wanting more ayana mathis tries to cram a personality and past into a chapter that is lacking and then weakly linked with the others the children grew up in a home but they all seem so separate and disconnected from one another i have found myself lost on hattie's monumental courage as she has seemed to float through life living and feeding off of rage vanity and bitterness that she herself is the harbinger of her own ruin she didn't marry for love but seemingly out of spite for her mother the love she every had was destroyed with the death of her first children the twins philadelphia and jubilee with their death seems to come a sense of coldness that none can touch or understand neither hattie herself the time jump between chapters is confusing and there really isn't a building of the characters or that of hattie the link that ties all the individuals together in the confusion it is uncertain who is the oldest and who is the baby of the family hattie's affection seems to end the moment a child is able to walk from then on they are just another mouth to feed and body to clothe the twelve tribes of hattie's problems range from bi sexuality schizophrenia tb alcoholism sexual abuse victim mental breakdown and a heavenly bed roller each of her children seem to resent her in some way and yet have found some way to make peace with their uncaring mother how it is never truly explained the only child she has ever seemed supportive of is franklin a trumpet playing musician also the bi sexual who decided to ignore hattie's advice and follow his dreams the others either depended upon themselves much too heavily in the case of alice who believes that her life's purpose is to look after her younger brother billiups and continually remind him that he was sexually abused by a trusted tutor or solely in themselves one child is invited to live with hattie and august but is completely missing in the next chapter would fit in the same timeline the stories are written beautifully individually and would probably do well as a short story within itself but to have them all tied together simply did not work the connection was lost and there seems to be no redemption for any of the characters not hattie who decides in the end to prevent her daughter from a religious experience for no other reason than that she herself was living a farce of a church life even in her sixties hattie seems just as lost prideful and vain as when she was first introduced which for a woman who married a boy she didn't love had multiple children with him had an affair with another man and birthed his child attempted to leave her husband but returned later that night and felt that she was better than everyone around her even her own children seems grossly under prepared to deal with the emotional turmoil of a young girl who has lost her mother to a mental disease hattie's own granddaughter had even questioned her own mother if she ever loved hattie once again nicely written but as a whole the story is lost confusing and fails to offer the supposedly promised uplifting moment in life","3382":"i enjoyed this but found it more a collection of short stories i'd have liked to see a stronger thread throughout","3383":"it was like peeking into windows of hattie's house i got brief glimpses of interesting characters but we never heard from them again i am not sure that i liked or disliked the structure i wish i knew more about every character both origins and how they ended up","3384":"lovely book eye opening about experiences of a widely dispersed family great characters great writing","3385":"i can tell hattie u0026amp her children will be the type of characters that will stay with me though i've read several books that at the time i didn't especially like i've found that if the characters come back to me long after the book is done it is a great work of art beautifully written about the great migration of black americans from the jim crow south to the relative freedom of the north it chronicles the pain of hattie in her loss u0026amp loves excellent read","3386":"this was a quick read there were not any happy tales but they definitely had depth","3387":"my daughter loved this book so i read it too it contains a bunch of stories that could stand alone all deal with hattie or one of her many children like olive kitteridge was a bunch of stories that included olive directly or indirectly this book was ok but had a lot of messed up people in it a couple of the stories were wrenching but overall the book did nothing for me","3388":"characters just weren't developed enough for me to feel much for any of them","3389":"i enjoyed reading about hattie and her children hattie is a flawed heroine my favorite kind however the book read more like a series of short stories some stories i wanted to go on forever and others i couldn't wait to end","3390":" stylistically i thought this novel was gorgeous and i can see why there is so much hype about ayana mathis's writing many reviewers have commented on how they didn't enjoy the structure since each chapter functions more as a short story than a part of a cohesive narrative but i actually really enjoyed the freshness that novel in stories structure brought to the table of course a few of the stories definitely stood out to me as being tighter and stronger franklin ela ruthie jubilee and philadelphia and floyd could all have been published on their own i think i struggled reading six and still feel a little lost as to what mathis was trying to say there the religious symbolism and biblical masterplots throughout definitely gave the novel a weightiness that speaks to works by toni morrison alan paton and of course william faulkner however i felt like as a whole i didn't quite grasp what mathis wanted to do with all of that religious context and towards the last chapter she started to lose me i think a second reading would definitely shed some light on this area but i don't know that i necessarily want to spend more time with these characters while fascinating and richly drawn i didn't connect with them in the way that i did with siddha absalom and rosa coldfield","3391":"souls must be fed too","3392":"really enjoyed the book although it felt like reading short stories i expected the final chapter to do a bigger wrap of the family saga it left me disappointed and wanting to know more about the family dynamic","3393":" told through the stories of each of her children the character of hattie shepard is revealed the book spans decades from the birth and death of hattie's first children to the raising of her grandchild each one of her children pulled their mother and their upbringing in the slivers of the world they inhabited one son traveled to the state of his mother's birth and saw first hand why his mother fled to the north another son became a preacher by chance and through cowardice or coincidence squandered his gifts a daughter tried to carve out a bigger piece of the pie so to speak than she could handle as hattie's children live out their lives she remains a constant presence in their stories as they reveal the sacrifices she made and the kind of love she gave","3394":"i enjoyed this book and its many characters plus the sentimental side of it involving the location where my father grew up yes hattie really has a messed up crew of kids but they are enjoyable to read about i really wish it had the closing credits at the end telling where each of the kids ended up 10 or 20 years later maybe that will be her next book","3395":" i don't quite know what i was expecting when i first started reading this book but it simply failed to live up to my expectations hattie is a one dimensional bitter mean and cold hearted woman who although has been cheated out of many of life's pleasures it was difficult for me to feel much empathy for her this fact just doesn't seem a valid reason to act the way she does with all of her children and the men in her life her character is just plain boring in the novel as well i detested her and just stopped caring about the story altogether halfway through i have a copy to give away to anyone in canada who wants to give this a try","3396":"enjoyed reading the individual stories they were interesting alone but as a novel it lacked cohesiveness","3397":"i have to say i did not like this book at all maybe the sadness of it or maybe it just opened up some old wounds it left me sad","3398":"good book the writing was good and the characters well drawn but it kind of left me hanging in the end really a long character study still worth reading","3399":"to say a little about this book is to say too much i liked the general concept of describing one to two kids each chapter i liked the main character and the time period that's it i'd say more but it wouldn't be nice","3400":" where shall i start for starters i think the length of this book is great i for one am someone who likes brief novels that still can manage to leave me with some realization i also like the structure of the book where each of hatie's children tell their story in one chapter some may argue that the structure was distracting from the emotion since the characters were centralized once in their own chapter and never again but i think it allows the reader some room to connect and put the pieces together great novel","3401":"i am surprisingly disappointed the reviews raised my expectations the writing is bold enough and the beginning promises so much but it never delivered the different chapters were held together by a very thin thread i read to end always in the hope that the next chapter would bring it home","3402":"i enjoyed this book but i struggled with the divisions one chapter per child made it a disjointed read for me","3403":"good but not great interesting the way it gives perspective from so many different people but that makes it kind of like a bunch of different short stories","3404":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here hattie's children 9 that lived and two that didn't and hattie herself are the 12 tribes hattie is portrayed as hard as ice and without emotion left her children feeling neglected and unloved jubilee and philadelphia twins died of pneumonia floyd became a trumpet player musician six a reverend ruthie the child of hattie's lover bell who as an adult had an affair with hattie's former lover franklin the ne'er do well who went to vietnam and couldn't be the family guy he wanted to be hattie's children 9 that lived and two that didn't and hattie herself are the 12 tribes hattie is portrayed as hard as ice and without

who as an adult had an affair with hattie's former lover franklin the ne'er do well who went to vietnam and couldn't be the family guy he wanted to be cassie who saw demons in the form of banshees more","3405":" this is a sad sad book about an african american mother of 11 kids all of whose lives are filled with hardship pain and grief it's not linear at all as each chapter is the disconnected story of one of hattie's children sounds like not a fun book to read right right what i did really appreciate though was walking in the shoes of each of hattie's kids because as a dad man i'd love to spend a few days in my own kids' shoes since i can't do that i can hop in pretend people's kids' shoes thank you literature","3406":"though heartbreaking in parts i thought this was an enjoyable read","3407":"wow a must read loved every word best book i've read this year","3408":" this was beautifully written but ultimately unsatisfying it tells the story of a coloured family the many children of hattie and each chapter is written from a different character's viewpoint and at a different point in time this narrative device means that you only get a snapshot of each character's life and you are left wondering what made them that way and what happens to them afterwards plus some of the characters are more engaging than others so this can be quite frustrating i also felt it was a bit unrealistic that all hattie's children would be quite so messed up and have such problems as there didn't seem to be a normal one among them the most frustrating thing for me is that you didn't really get a handle on who hattie was as you only see her through the eyes of everyone else and the sleeve description was quite misleading in its description of her as someone who doesn't show her love for her children as i think she does","3409":"i listened to this book which was a delight because it had 3 narrators one in particular adam lazarre white had a magnificent voice hattie and her children each tell their stories mostly a brief time in their lives there are problems sorrow racial discrimination but mostly hard lived lives maybe fewer children would have helped i found i wanted to hear more about some of their lives","3410":"having just finished this book i agree with many of the others that submitted reviews i think the author had a unique idea by devoting individual chapters to her offspring there was a disconnect though for me because rarely did the characters overlap i have sisters and though i have my own story my sisters and i share stories because actually it is this that makes us a family i also agree with some of the reviewers that were critical of the fact that some characters were not developed as well as they could have been i am leaving the four star rating because the book was unique and it held my interest though 3 5 stars would have been my preference","3411":"this was an interesting book i only gave it three stars because i wasn't really feeling the content to me the best story line was bell it was well written an easy to follow the rest of the children's stories caused me to go back and do a lot of re reading i really wasn't in to this book however i wanted to see how it all ended and i wasn't thrilled about that","3412":"probably more like a 3 5 halfway between i liked it and i really liked it i was actually pleasantly surprised by this book the first oprah selection i have read in a long time that i didn't find to be absolutely 'meh' i don't know why i still keep reading books she chooses i guess i hope that they will somehow be of the standard of those she chose around 13 years ago perhaps back then they weren't even that good it was just that i was 19 and naive anyway it was a good read i wouldn't gush over it though it was rather cleverly put together however i would really start to get into one of the stories reads more like loosely connected short stories rather than a novel then it would be over and onto the next no sense of resolution at all perhaps that is the point though life goes on and there is no real resolution","3413":" this was a very well written book and a very good portrait of a black family during the hard times of migration from the racially torn south to the city of philadelphia hattie the main character births 11 children and in the end also raises a grandchild thus the twelve tribes of hattie it truly is a story about hattie who has endured all kinds of adversity yet remains courageous and resilient but without the tenderness that her family is much in need of this is an oprah book and it surely seems to fit the theme of her books depressing","3414":"i give upon this book sorry to my mom and friend for giving it to you for christmas based on an interesting oprah interview with the author note to self don't give books as gifts you haven't read yourself do not recommend","3415":"it's been awhile since i finished it it didn't leave a strong impression it was good not great worth the read though","3416":"beautifully written i'm not a short story fan as so many others have written this reads like a series of short stories loosely tied together winter in cleveland is probably not the best time to read this one","3417":"very interesting read with each chapter being a different child's perspective hattie was unlikeable as a mother yet i found myself cheering for her and was happy to see her chance at a loving relationship with her granddaughter at the end","3418":" the twelve tribes of hattie is ayana mathis' first novel and it's an ambitious and far reaching piece set from 1925 until 1980 it traces the life of hattie shephrd through a series of ten stories which trace the lives of her eleven children and one grandchild the narrative technique is reminiscent of faulkner's both in as i lay dying when multiple narrative perspectives help us to see the barely present mother addie and the sound and the fury in which four narrators tell essentially the same story but mathis gives us distinct short stories each revealing another aspect of hattie in 1925 hattie leaves georgia to try life in philadelphia poor and 17 she has two children whose death is due to poverty and lack of medical care those deaths leave hattie unable to connect on an emotional level with her remaining children whom the reader meets in subsequent chapters in the novel hattie remembers a line from robert hayden's poem those winter sundays love's austere and lonely offices and throughout the novel hattie could not be more austere with her expressions of love hurt she is but she does her duties tolerating a useless husband august comforting her children through the worst of their troubles attempting to make a life for herself and ultimately rejecting the comforts of religion for herself and her granddaughter sala because we see such vivid portraits of her children and their lives hattie is the center of the novel but she is not a central figure the span of this novel takes us through the civil rights movement the viet nam war the growth of the black middle class and the economic upheavals in the unites states during this time mathis is detached and analytical as she presents these characters and the historical period in which they live this is a very compelling first novel i really do not know how to feel about hattie she fails in so many ways and yet it is hard not to be sympathetic and respectful and in the boston globe g magazine on 1 2 13 laura collins hughes wrote they come from the same home share the same last name but their experiences of family are as disparate as \"rashomon\" recollections hattie and august shepherd and their 11 children sprawling across the decades of the 20th century in ayana mathis's ripe and deeply nourishing debut novel \"the twelve tribes of hattie \"oprah winfrey propelled it into the cultural conversation earlier last month vouching for the novel as she chose it for her book club but don't let her imprimatur sway you either way opening the book should do the trick mathis is a literary newcomer but she is also 39 and her fully formed storytelling powers captivate from the first pages in 1925 hattie is a beautiful and bubbly 16 year old not long removed from georgia already married to august she revels in their infant twins jubilee a girl and philadelphia a boy named for his parents' adopted city hattie easily imagines the future with her tiny ones in it \"the next summer philadelphia and jubilee would be walking they'd totter around the porch like sweet bumbling old men \" mathis's prose is lush yet deliberate with hardly a wasted word and her touch is elegant and sure when pneumonia kills the babies at seven months hattie feels \"their deaths like a ripping in her body \" it's a ripping in her marriage too and in the fabric of their family from then on hattie becomes a colder sterner presence \"man hands on misery to man \" as philip larkin wrote and hattie's pain spills down onto all of the sons and daughters who come after floyd and cassie bell and six franklin alice billups ruthie ella yet this is not a blame the mother narrative it is instead a complex and deeply humane story of a mother's ferocious love and failures at loving it is also a distinctively american story of a black family part of the great migration whose fortunes are shaped by poverty and toil and shadowed by racism as certainly as august wilson did in the plays of his 20th century cycle mathis is chronicling our nation chapter by chapter she brings hattie and each of her children sharply into focus we meet floyd at 22 a horn player on the road in 1948 and watch as his hope and awareness dawn he could fall in love with a man spend his life with a man be happy a couple of years later comes our interlude with six a wounded teenager capable of explosive violence and thrust into preaching on the revival circuit in 1968 lovely alice a young bride risen into isolating affluence becomes untethered the fortunes of hattie's brood are varied and regret is a recurring theme we get our close up of franklin drunk in 1969 as his squad seeds a vietnamese beach with mines he is struggling to write a letter to his ex wife who has left him for plenty of cause \"what i want to say is let's try to be a family i am here and still alive \" he explains \"give me another chance to become somebody decent \" for all of their differences that is what each of the shepherds wants hattie and august included half a dozen years later when hattie is over 60 one of her children tries to kill herself in despair over a life in ruins \"i don't know what brought you so low i should have known \" hattie says blaming herself as her daughter recuperates in a hospital bed \"i never did know what to do about my children's spirits \"\"i just didn't want anything anymore \" her daughter says \"everybody's been there \" hattie replies \"everybody i've ever met \"that right there is why we tell stories and why we read them because they remind us that every pain that anyone's ever known is part of the human condition and so we are not alone every unhappy family is not unhappy in its own way not really all of that unhappiness has happened before and it will happen again likewise all of the joy in the vivid specificity of mathis's tale she is telling a universal story and it is profoundly consoling","3419":"the great migration during the early part of the 20th century to the northern states the stories of hattie and her children and one grandchild tragedy poverty infidelity mental illness this book has it all what it doesn't seem to have is a way to tie it all together i wasn't sure from one chapter to the next how each character related if they did to the other the time frames were fragmented the characters generally unlikable not a satisfying book","3420":"i really enjoyed the shift in perspective and time throughout the book it was such a paradoxical way to create a cohesive sense of hattie as a mother several parts of the story felt so genuine and raw i felt the truth in mathis's characters","3421":"this book is beautifully written but incredibly tragic it is so desolate that i stopped reading it","3422":"wow i made myself finish this but it was so dark and bleak well written yes but just downright depressing agree with other reviewers on here that i need time to recover from so from that standpoint this is really powerful writing but like watching saving private ryan i just want to curl up in the fetal position and watch cartoons","3423":"i liked the book hattie the main character was well developed but hard to understand she had a sad and difficult life had way too many children and did not know how to love them it was an accurate account of the times and the hardships endured by african americans at that time","3424":"i am not going to read any more oprah books terribly depressing i would not call it a great migration story but simply a story of dysfunction and despair very much a downer","3425":"a book that makes a parent look at their life to determine how strong a legacy was implanted before they shot their child's arrow for life each of us has withered the storms of life but how well hattie tale is two generations her life portrays three tuff lessons tear jeers and smiles well writen","3426":"i would really give this 2 1 2 stars if i could well written but so depressing with many loose ends i was relieved and annoyed when i finished it","3427":"a little difficult to follow the relatives and figure out the birth order of the children perhaps it was meant to be confusing and a little chaotic like their lives but i would have liked a family tree i was glad i bought it on sale but will recommend to others in my book club if you like this check out roots of the olive tree","3428":" i give this three stars because the writer can write and draw some scenes beautifully however i fail to see this as a narrative in any true sense these are well drawn chapters of scenes from the lives of some of the children of the eponymous hattie who is a real drag and a pain one of the problems for me is this central character as she is so difficult and painful to read about a very sore character in every way her view of life is so drab and painfully bleak i found this to be one of the main problems of this read in its entirety i fail to see the relevance of the title where are the twelve tribes we see a few of them and hattie is almost everywhere unfortunately the tired scenes of the worn cliche of the deep south and its racism is so flatly and predictably presented it's almost laughable of course presenting pennsylvania as virgin of any prejudice is also equally silly this sort of thing is always evident in a second rate writer and any critic worth their salt knows this one but apparently that doesn't matter all the marketing and promotion one can only dream about went into this one with the crowning of the oprah touch which happens to be everywhere in the e edition as the proverbial cherry on top one of the irritating things about much fiction today is that it's not all that good does not even stand against the reads of previous decades even the 90's had better books this mess a beautiful mess i want to say has no core no story and the characters don't go very much beyond the surface there is barely any richness in their personas only topical descriptions and dull dialog scenes at best it's as if this writer is preparing to write a novel here not actually accomplishing one","3429":"if it hadn't been for a book club i wouldn't have read this book","3430":" the philadelphia of today is not the philadelphia of the 20's or 50's or even 80's but if you live in philadelphia or have been anywhere outside of center city or the main line northern liberties old city or manayunk aka outside of any predominately wealthy or gentrified neighborhood you know that it can be a nasty city philadelphia in poverty is a place of true grit i live in a northeast neighborhood that is considered safe and good just low income my apartment has leaky ceilings mold and roaches i pick my lawn free of trash on almost a daily basis i make a decent salary abide by the law and have the privilege of not facing institutionalized racism or discrimination and yet even for my many advantages i manage to feel the broken spirit that comes from living in a dirty city left to ambivalence and blight at times it is work to get comfortable here to become accustomed to poverty and suffering and disorder all of this is to say that i think this book though it tabulates all the necessary ailments for highly literary selections in its narratives abuse addiction infidelity abandonment death is missing a real rawness a rawness that should be inherent in the particular part of the north that ayana mathis chose as the site of hattie's migration i don't know if it's because hattie and so many of her children spend their lives trying to maintain the facade of their dreams and the book is over polished as a reflection of the false fronts in the stories it tells or what the twelve tribes of hattie is broken down into ten narratives dedicated to each of hattie's eleven children and to one of her grandchildren most sections of the book peel back a little layer of hattie's own life in an oblique way her relationship with her drunk womanizing disappointment of a husband and her struggle to raise eleven kids with only herself to really count on i love the idea of telling a mother's story with the lives of her progeny and when i really stop to think about this book i guess you can't tell about hattie's struggle without that cycle of abuse addiction infidelity abandonment death after all if her kids were well adjusted it would mean that hattie's story had in part arrived at some fulfillment of her dream after leaving the south as i think back on the mechanics of the book now and mathis' intention in structuring it the way she did i want to give it three stars but i can't shake the feeling that there is still some iciness in the writing itself some remove from the itemization of traumas not enough reflection of hattie herself nor of this city that failed to meet her expectations and the expectations of so many others too many narratives in the story to have much of a cohesive emotional impact on me i'm not gonna knock it for being an oprah book though a lot of people are going to get something from this book and from oprah that i don't but it's a philadelphia book and it doesn't feel like it's truly of this city even though the professed spirit is the same","3431":"some chapters are better than other chapters i am making myself finish it","3432":"this is a smart intriguing book it's the kind of book that after i finished reading i had trouble picking up my next book because my mind was still wrapped about this one i highly recommend it to everyone summary each of the chapters covers one or sometimes two of hattie's children each chapter is only a small glimpse into their life but the chapters span decades the book starts in in 1925 and ends in 1980 spending most of its time in philadelphia the background of the story is the great migration of black families fleeing the south the promise of jobs and a better life brought many black families to northern cities in the early 20th century hattie came as part of this movement moving to philadelphia at the age of fifteen getting married and having babies this is almost a collection of short stories each chapter takes place in its own world often over as short of a time period as a few hours with only passing references to the rest of the family memories fill in the gaps but there's so much that's only hinted or altogether unknown at first this felt disjointed but over the course of the book i grew to love the way the plot centered around hattie without her ever being the main character the ending chapters were emotionally strong and did a fine job of wrapping such an oddly shaped gift of a book i did find it difficult that so many of the stories are tragic while i think the end of the book is ultimately positive it's not without an underlying sadness i was always waiting for someone to get a break in this book and when it occasionally did happen it was always blunted by harsh realities of their life the descriptions are quite good with both character and space well done i felt the places they occupied and the characters have such depth for so little space they are on the page the chapters really could function as their own flash fiction since the characters get only a few pages to make themselves understood as a side note this is an oprah book which means there were highlights from oprah that i could not turn off in my kindle i absolutely hated that but i believe that was the only kindle version i could get for book group discussions this is the perfect book motivations are rarely explained timelines can be a bit difficult to sort out characters make hard choices out of emotion with plenty of themes to explore in every chapter this all would lead to some great discussions","3433":"i liked the book but was expecting it to be better i guess","3434":"i enjoyed this book don't quite understand people not liking the short story quality i thought it worked very well some of the language is beautiful very effective changing the voice and style for different 'tellers' glad i read it","3435":"linked stories disguised as a novel","3436":"an emotional roller coaster","3437":"i enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second","3438":"astonishing debut the twelve tribes of hattie offers great insight into hattie and her troubled life she is a woman of great strength first chapter left me breathless rest of the stories are emotional poignant and beautiful made so by mathis' compassionate and layered storytelling and truthful prose goes right into the core of human pain highly recommended","3439":"this novel is pure heartbreak beauty and impossible to put down the characters are raw courageous and unapologetic i don't know where such talent for writing and storytelling comes from and i look forward to many more books from this new author","3440":"good but typical depressing oprah book","3441":"the short stories told of hattie's twelve descendants left much to be desired in my opinion while some stories were better than others the story in its entirety felt disconnected similar to the way i felt about the underdeveloped characters","3442":"individually some strong stories but too disjointed i would have liked a bit more cleaner transitions between stories i got confused how many children hattie had","3443":" i was skeptical of miss winfrey's newest book club choice as i hadn't been too impressed with wild by cheryl strayed but i thought i should tackle this one immediately before the masses started quizzing me on it at work i really enjoyed it the book centers on the story of hattie and the 11 children that she gave birth to her first 2 children twins don't survive and it is the turning point in her young life the majority of the chapters are told by a different child and shed new light on hattie's life some children appreciate their mother's quiet ways while others find her cold and unloving some grow strong in their talents and some allow their lives to crumble the story much like real life gives indirect views of hattie and allows the reader to compile them into their own opinion some readers will be frustrated by the fact that the author doesn't tell us exactly how to feel but those readers will probably already be frustrated by the books rough edges language sex unhappy life stories this is a book for those who enjoy a more literary story if you're simply looking for a happy ending this probably isn't the book for you words to describe this book historical conflicted engaging enveloping thoughtful and well rounded","3444":" interesting but too fragmented i wish that hattie and her story had played a more central role in the stories of her children some stories were very compelling but the last two in the book felt flat the author didn't flesh them out well i was also a bit disconnected from the book because of the way the female narrator read if this had been marketed as a book of short stories it would have been better but this is in no order not birth order not chronological i also wish hattie the title character showed up a little more in the stories","3445":"five wows for the twelve tribes of hattie as a mother hattie is a survivor and sentimentality is a luxury not afforded by her wallet gritty determined perhaps brutal and not particularly warm and loving hattie defies many odds as she raises her children in adulthood her children do not always appreciate her and they do not necessarily qualify as successful still hattie is a force to be reckoned with and one to be admired and inside perhaps a few soft corners exist i loved hattie i loved this book wow","3446":"not that great rather disappointing characters faded in and out could have been developed more","3447":"what a depressing book well written but depressing","3448":"loved the writing and the different story lines but a little bit too sad for me","3449":"this is a beautifully written book that tells a story in an inventive way ms mathis writes lovely passages that you want to return to and re read they somehow just get under your skin but be prepared it is full of heartbreak","3450":"thank you lord for the last sentence of this book","3451":" i would die before reading another book highlighted by oprah it made me feel like a sheep couldn't even make it past the first free bit come on people think for yourselves oprah is a nice lady but a novel should stand on it's own that's why i didn't like this book i took this review down once because someone accused me of being a homophobe for not liking this book and frankly i just don't want to be associated with the kind of people who run around calling strangers homophobes but you know what i didn't like this book for the reasons mentioned in the first 3 sentences and i write reviews for my like minded friends including my gay like minded friends it's exactly like the time someone on here freaked out because i didn't like twilight and said that i shouldn't be allowed to talk about books good grief i don't like mysteries either but i don't hate people who do i have a degree in lit i know books i am also pretty sensitive to the idea of a sell out i don't like it i'm a purist art the craft above all take a chill pill zealots read why i didn't like the book before you freak out","3452":"the story was well written and i did enjoy reading it it's written in short story form with each of hattie's children perspective the ending was a little disappointing i would have liked to see it all tied back together","3453":"young hattie leaves the south for a promising new life in philadelphia in the 1920's we learn about the rest of hattie's story in a series of short story like chapters focusing on each of her children the shepherd family is plagued with infidelity mental illness pedophiles poverty","3454":"3 5 stars but the writing was eloquent so i rounded up","3455":"i read this because oprah recommended it well i must admit it was a disappointment or at least this is certainly not my style i have nothing against the prose for this book i just didn't like the plot and story line absolutely unsatisfying at the end like i just wasted time watching paint dry","3456":"too much hype okay book","3457":"my book club enjoyed this book given that this is a first novel it had strong character development ms mathis' structure is an interesting one much more short story in format needed a few more threads to link the various children's stories if she writes another book i would actually read it","3458":"this is the kind of book i'd like to someday write one that tells the story of a person a place and a time through the lives of several different people mathis never softens the strong hard character she created in hattie still she causes the reader to feel a softness for a rather unnerving heroine","3459":"i'd give it 3 5 stars if i could its a good read but every chapter is a new story about each of hattie's children so its hard to really get into it each chapter was like starting a new book","3460":"wow i did not think that this book was going to end an interesting look at the lives of a family however this book was not my cup of tea","3461":" i am uncertain how to evaluate and review this book i am uncertain even about how good the book was i know i was interested in the entire book i wanted to figure out the title the writing drew me in like a moth to a flame i wanted to understand the complexities of hattie's life what i did understand is that hattie ended up taking care of 12 children eleven of her own and one grandchild hattie spent her whole life taking care of babies and children she spent all of her care for the children worrying about how to feed and clothe them and nothing left over to show them kindness and shower them with kisses and hugs in one section the minister spoke about the trials of job and how each of those trials were born by job perhaps that is the parallel in the book hattie and job bore all the trials they were given i don't think hattie found the spirit as job did i do think that hattie after eleven children was finally able to give her grandchild a more visible means of love at least i hope so each of the chapters were named after the child children that the chapter focused on each chapter then was its own short story about the child children and some part of their relationship with their mother hattie the chapters were in chronological order for year but dealt her children at different ages and in different cruxes in their lives while i did not find hattie a sympathetic character i did feel her angst she battled the world as one alone for and with the children the book engrossed me even as i felt the emotional angst of the story line","3462":"i simply could not put this book down i read it beginning to end only stopping for dinner i felt like i was seeing into real people's lives hattie and her family will stay with me for a very long time","3463":"i was expecting more twelve different stories thought there would have been more of a connection none of the children seemed to thrive as adults","3464":"3 5 rating definitely engrossing but the format left me wanting more","3465":" ayana mathis is a very gifted writer in this novel one particular chapter about the main character's son who is an alcoholic fighting in the vietnam war knocked the wind out of me in its grace and heartbreak but the novel as a whole which is made up of several chapters each addressing the main characters' children and their various failures and miseries never pulled me completely in sure the book is very sad that was hard but i think that's the point the great migration didn't offer up as much as promised but sad books can also carry you through and i never felt carried from one chapter to the next each one was like a dead lift of sadness seeing as this is mathis' first novel i would say this lack of continuity can be chalked up to being new mathis truly has a beautiful captivating way of describing real human struggle and i look forward to seeing how her writing career progresses","3466":"another depressing recommendation from the 'o' book club well written and sad perfect","3467":" extremely well written and engaging this book had a clear beginning and end yet read more like a selection of short stories it was reminiscent of 'a tree grows in brooklyn' at times but also had it's own voice i felt like i truly took a walk in each character's shoes and i felt like mathis did a good job of shining light on the gray areas that dominate most people's lives and relationships i was thoroughly impressed by the writing and each of the character's stories but of course by hattie's most of all","3468":"a bit disjointed not my favorite","3469":"i loved the way that mathis compelled metro trust where she was taking me and that the trust paid off immensely readable","3470":"oprah let me down on this one","3471":"it had its moments i felt like each character was just a shell of a stereotype","3472":"it's an interesting dynamic that has been created when the first thing i feel i need to do is apologize or justify reading something that was on oprah's list a neighbor donated this to our free little library and i tore through it in a few days well written the story is told through the perspective of the main character's children i appreciated the variety and lack of predictable outcomes","3473":"painful i was unhappy reading it even though it is very well written the last chapter surprised me at the sense of satisfaction or redemption it left me with","3474":"the characters in this immensely well written book live lives of numbing despair never quite able to overcome their own situations or rather they do not know that there might be other options and so stay enshrouded in that despair i liked how the author chose to dedicate one chapter to each of her characters but as the characters are all related so are the chapters the story comes together like a woven blanket the whole so much bigger than the individual threads","3475":"gorgeous writing but the story is so unrelentingly bleak as to feel almost sadistic","3476":" i liked this book quite a lot this is the author's first book but nevertheless has a very assured voice i will definitely follow her future writing the cover blurb calls it a debut of extraordinary distinction and i'd agree it was an oprah pick and also a heather's pick at chapters mathis is a graduate of the iowa writer's workshop which has many illustrious alumni including one of my favorites ann patchett and this book was probably her final creative project in any case it is very well done i'm avoiding reading other reviews before writing my own though i see from google that there are many reviews online i'll go back to them later the central character is hattie a young black woman who left jim crow georgia at age 15 in 1923 travelling to philadelphia with her mother and three sisters the first chapter has her at age 17 having married august a handsome but improvident ne'er do well because she was pregnant after a short encounter in this chapter we watch her baby twins die of pneumonia because she can't afford a good doctor or penicillin we follow the story of the family to 1980 though not in a particularly linear or complete fashion we only get glimpses each chapter of the book could stand on its own as a short story each focuses on one of hattie's children each one is a quite distinct character and we come into just a slice of each life often at a crisis the link of course is hattie who we see reflected through her children's eyes and experiences as often as her own it is a story of poverty and the struggle to escape it in that sense it is not just a story of the black experience though it is definitely that reflecting the great migration of blacks from the southern us to the north in the 20th century but similar stories could have been and have been told of other groups' struggles to escape or simply survive poverty eg the irish famine or to be topical life on a northern reserve in canada this sounds bleak and in some ways it is however i found it quite enjoyable to read and more or less read it straight through without putting it aside the writing is lovely i found the story also made me think of my own grandmother who immigrated from norway to iowa in 1888 and had 10 children the first of whom died as a baby they did not live in the poverty that hattie's family did they always had food for example and many happy times but the challenges of raising so many children must have been significant nevertheless","3477":"this is an oprah book and it feels like one decently written quick moving somewhat emotionally manipulative hattie left georgia for philadelphia in the '20s as part of the great migration and each chapter traces the lives of one of her children spoiler almost all of them are really sad but the book is very readable and holds your attention good for a plane or an annoying commute","3478":"i wish i could have given this 4 stars but it is a collection of short stories not a novel i kept just getting interested in a character and bam the story would change","3479":"i read this after hearing a lovely interview with the author this is a well written narrative that left me wanting more after every chapter what happens to these characters i wish it had been twice as long and revealed a lot more but it kept me reading","3480":"what a wonderful read so full of passion and grit this is an amazingly well written book the characters seem so real and the author wrote this so well that you seem to feel the pain of hattie as you read absolutely wonderful","3481":"i did like the historical context of the great migration and the struggles that hattie faced as a result of trying to make a better life for herself and her family in philadelphia i was hoping for more plot development and a sense that the characters transformed in meaningful ways the book just didn't go anywhere for me the author introduced us to a lot of characters some within the last few pages but never brought it all together in any compelling sort of way it was like i got to shake each character's hand at a dinner party but then never saw most of them them again it was good enough to read all the way through but left me wanting more depth","3482":"i loved this book but once again it was somewhat tragic and sad it was one of those books that as hard as it was to read at times i couldn't put it down until it was finished","3483":" this is the story of hattie's family as they travel through time from 1925 to 1980 it is told in well written vignettes concentrating on one child grandchild in each the problem with this unique style is that the characters never get fully developed beyond that one glimpse in the chapter titled 'ruthie' hattie takes the baby and leaves her family to run off with the baby's father lawrence leaving the other children with their clueless father august she returns the same day after apparently deciding that lawrence is no better than august later when her daughter bell begins an affair with lawrence he seems like a rather nice person is he still a gambler we'll never know so many things are just 'hinted' at it leaves you hungry for more what happened to ella after she was given away to her aunt pearl did ruthie ever realize she wasn't august's daughter there is a lot of meat here that could have made a spectacular novel","3484":"reminds me vaguely of toni morrisonlyrical emotionalthe mystery we are to ourselves and to each other","3485":"3 5 some stories were way better than others","3486":"ok i admit it not only did i judge this book by its title tribal stuff mmm no thanks but i also pushed it aside due to the oprah endorsement i was wrong let me say it again i was wrong the first few paragraphs featured in oprah mag this month had me breathless i couldnt get it downloaded fast enough the book was heart wrenching and breath taking and so painfully familiar in some parts i never wanted it to end i love this book thank you oprah","3487":"i really enjoyed this book it gives the reader a glimpse into a world that is unknown to so many of us and it covers generations it is truly heartfelt and it drew me in completely i look forward to reading more by this author","3488":"this book is well written though sorrowful in theme the title led me to imagine a sweeping epic but i was disappointed and felt a little conned actually to discover it is more of a series of interconnected short stories character studies of each of hattie's children once a character's chapter was over it was rare he or she would make another appearance despite that i am interested to see what mathis produces in the future this being her first book","3489":"ayana mathis has a very distinctive voice and a beautiful style of writing this novel is really a series of interconnected short stories i believe that each chapter could stand on its own the central character is hattie who is 17 years old when the book begins in 1925 in philadelphia she is a part of the great migration african american families leaving the south and heading north she is the mother in chapter one of two twin babies eventually she becomes the mother of 11 and each of these children or tribes becomes the focus of one of the chapters short stories it is fascinating to see an unloving mother or a seemingly unloving mother reflected through her various children's and grandchild's eyes and to see how a child living without affection becomes an adult this book was also a wonderful history lesson for me spanning from 1925 until 1980","3490":"so i almost always like the books that oprah recommends and this was no exception i almost didn't read it after i read a review from someone who didn't like it because it was just a bunch of unrelated stories hattie was the connecting force between all of the stories about her offspring and i liked how author moved us along through her life then of course the last line of the book unaccustomed as she was to tenderness was the topper","3491":"3 5 stars it was a very insightful book on the pain and consequences of the loss of a child ren not only on the parent but on the siblings would have scored higher but there were some unanswered questions endings that i would have liked 'cleaned' up","3492":"it is a collection of short stories about hattie and her children it is one tragic story after another these characters lived hard lives and became hard people it was well written but i'm not sure i would recommend it if i do recommend it i will forewarn them of its darkness i'm sure it makes for a hard read for many people that pick itup","3493":"i don't know how to summarize this book because i haven't figured out yet if i liked or disliked it fragmented writing","3494":"beautifully written sad story of a family lacking many things it seemed they all did not know how to connect with each other and lacked integrity and or the willingness to show love in a healthy way i thought the title did not make sense hattie had 11 children not 12 to count one grandchild as her 12th tribe seems a stretch just to make the biblical allusion to the twelve tribes of israel","3495":"should have known not to read an oprah book club book","3496":"beautiful writing but oh so painful and depressing i wanted to learn so much more about the characters enjoyed much more wilkerson's wonderfully researched the warmth of other suns","3497":"i really wanted to love this book but really i just merely liked it sorry oprah","3498":" i read this late last year and at first i was gravitating towards leaving it unrated i thought i wouldn't be able to give it a rating that would adequately express how i felt about what i had read sure i liked the writing in some parts and i enjoyed some chapters more than others but overall i couldn't say whether i liked or didn't like it hence my dilemma the author set up the book with each chapter being from the point of view of hattie's children and while some worked some fell really flat my final decision resulted in two stars 2 5 really and i think that adequately represents how i feel about it based on gr's system i was so exhausted when i was done and it actually took me awhile to pick up another book","3499":"although i enjoyed reading this oprah pick i found that i wanted to read more and thought the author left so much unsaid and i did not like that she made all of the twelve tribes quite troublesome and unlovable to say the least","3500":"roped me in with the first lines and did not let me go until the end the characters felt so real to me like people in my family so familiar and yet never fully knowable like real people are a success for ms mathis a very good book","3501":"last year i read the warmth of other suns and became fascinated with the great migration which occurred in our country ms mathis added to my knowledge through the fictional characters she has created in the twelve tribes of hattie as a first time writer she aptly portrays the hunger and poverty these immigrants have to endure to survive i did not give the book a higher rating because i found it difficult to stay connected to the characters you really only get to know each character except for hattie in the chapter devoted to them in a way it was like reading a collection of short stories i do look forward to more works by ms mathis","3502":"every chapter made me cry and not in a good way sadly not my type of book","3503":"very powerful and oh so sad","3504":"beautifully written the stories were lovely and i liked the way they seamlessly stood alone and connected to each other i didn't love the ending of the book but i still would highly recommend it","3505":"if i could give this powerhouse of a novel six stars i would","3506":"this was an interesting book but kind of a let down each chapter touches on a different person all children of hattie's but i was unable to connect emotionally to any of them i like to get sucked into a really good story but this one just didn't do it for me","3507":"this is an interesting but painful book about a women who struggles to raise her children with few resources and little help each chapter deals with a different child or children and the book spans the years from 1925 to 1980","3508":" i wish good reads would allow 1 2 stars i would have given this 3 1 2 if i couldi very much enjoy reading books linked together by the short stories of each character so i appreciated mathis' style i read the book in a day and a half and found the story moving as she wove hattie into most of her children's lives my one complaint is that she did not do so consistently while the siblings were never connected to one another hattie was connected only occasionally to her adult children and i would have liked her to appear a bit more often in their lives albeit in the different ways they lived sometimes new novelists have blockbusters right off and then fizzle out i have a feeling that ayana mathis has better in her and that this was good start but we will see more depth and greater novels still i hope so anyway because as well done as the twelve tribes was i think it could have been better yet as for the readers who purposely avoid oprah's suggestions it is a ridiculous reason to not read a book oprah is an avid reader and an educated woman i would take a look at any book recommended by someone who loves to read as much as i do if i am interested in the genre i will give it a go if not i won't read it why would someone refuse to read a book that a particular person recommends i find that inan","3509":" the perfect book to follow wilkerson's the warmth of other suns this book offers a look at what happens to both participants in the great migration and the generation following i absolutely adore mathis' ability to grow hattie's character through introduction to each of her offspring over several decades closing with hattie's growth and ownership of her ability to influence her granddaughter leaves the reader hopeful and empowered to create change i find myself wondering about the reference to the biblical twelve tribes i can't wait to hear about the impressions of my bookgroup buddies","3510":"i did enjoy this book but wanted to hear more about each of the children i found it annoying that they were barely mentioned again after their chapter","3511":"a totally intriguing novel about a woman who escapes from the jim crow south to philadelphia this is the story of hattie and the children she loves but can't quite nurture this novel somehow tells a story of racism strength resilience and love by telling hattie's story and the stories of her children and grandchildren while at times it seems dark in the end it seems to give a sense of redemption to the difficult life of this ruthlessly strong woman","3512":"i listen to most of my books since i am a doctoral student i think listening to it made it better it sounds like a hard read as the organization of the chapters might confuse some hearing the voice and letting the chapters come to life in my head made the book amazing to me i read this as part of go on girl book club","3513":"wow hovering between four and five stars on this one i don't typically like books that are broken down to the level this one is each chapter focuses on a different character in a different year but the author did such an amazing job giving each of these characters a distinct voice and dilemma that i really loved it with that said this book was very sad a classic case of bad things happening to good people and many hopeless circumstances overall very well written","3514":"well written but a fairly depressing read","3515":"parts were interesting but there was no cohesiveness to the story each chapter was about one or two of hattie's children i thought there would be some chapter that would bring it all together there was not","3516":"i was so disappointed in this book it ended too soon we met hattie's kids but how did they turn out very depressing book","3517":"i thought each of hattie's tribes had their own unique viewpoint and manner of speaking which i think is hard for an author to do well really liked some of her prose even highlighted one she had been with her share of schemers and men who were forever building castles in the sky all of those dreams made out of clouds when it rained and it always did they were left with nothing but the soggy shirts on their backs","3518":"rich characters rich writing i liked that each character had his or her own section at first i thought that ayana mathis wasn't weaving the family together and that this might appear as a disconnect because it sort of felt that way but in thinking about it further it was the perfect way to reveal hattie's children i just finished the book i need time to really sit and feel it thoroughly i love this book i want more this is what i know for sure smile a little oprah pun","3519":"i can not agree with oprah on this review she loved the book but i thought it was boring i didn't like how she the author kept skipping ahead in time either you didn't even get a chance to know the characters really well i gave it three stars as it wasn't the worst book i have read but it certainly didn't deserve any more then that it was just fair","3520":"enjoyable read while i liked each individual character's story i kind of wanting something at the end that would tie them all together i didn't feel like the book had an ending as much as it just stopped","3521":"yeah yeah yeah i know it's on the oprah book list i still wasn't that impressed with the writing","3522":" the twelve tribes of hattie left me with a feeling of doom and gloom it is really about how a mother can unintentionally destroy ruin suck any chance of happiness out of the lives of all of her nine children by doing the best that she can to raise them well and provide for them part of this is due to hattie's personality-she is strong maybe too strong which makes her seem unaffectionate with no tenderness towards her children also the loss of her first born children twins is something that she can never get over which is probably a big part of her constant anger and may be the reason why she seems to push her subsequent children away read the rest of this review and more of my reviews at www bookwookie ca","3523":"i read some harsh criticism of this book but i liked it i felt the author told the story of hattie in a very unique style we found out how each of her children where affected by her parenting and what they did to work out their own lives in the last chapter hattie is thinking to herself about her children they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind yes this book is on the dark side when you read about each child's life but somehow at the end i sensed a glimmer of hope","3524":"too typical oprah book of oppression and depression really a book of short stories more than one novel not my favorite style interesting but not a favorite read was very happy to finish this book and move on to something uplifting","3525":"this might be one of the most depressing books i've ever read and not in a cathartic way i agree with the other reviewers i wanted more connectivity between the characters and a plot would have been nice as well there was some really beautiful writing but overall i did not like any of the characters and that makes it hard to like dysfunction breeds dysfunction is what i learned from this book","3526":"hattie bore eleven children in the death of her first two twins hattie becomes a shell of a woman she is a victim of circumstance from the times from her relationships and from herself her husband august can't or won't be the man she needs yet he was the one person who shined with love passion and tenderness toward the children the writing was superb the twining of the twelve tales worked i felt the ending abrupt and a bit disappointing and i am so glad to have experienced this book","3527":"i loved every page of this book very motivating and touching but not for everybody not for young people you need to have life experience to really feel this book","3528":"this was ok i was waiting for all the threads to come together at the end but i guess life is not like that at least hattie did find some joy and less hardship in her life","3529":"this was a really interesting and enjoyable book ayan mathis is a great writer the writing is quite poetic with some beautiful images but not self consciously so it is about hattie and august a black couple whose first children twins are born in 1925 each chapter tells the story of one of the children and moves through time with the final chapter set in 1980 the sub text is the changing treatment of blacks in america over the sixty year period but hattie is also a shadowy figure she is the matriarch but she is enigmatic she looms large in the stories of her children and yet is unknowable she is summed up by this wonderful quote towards the end of the book hattie was looking up toward the ceiling and sala wondered what she was thinking she didn't dare ask hattie was like a lake of smooth silvered ice under which nothing could be seen or known","3530":"thought i enjoyed this book i wish the characters had been better developed each one of hattie's children gets a chapter so i felt i was introduced to them and experienced one snippet of their lives it reads more like a collection of short stories though hattie is a common thread","3531":"well written and some compelling stories but not a very satisfying read","3532":"very inconsistent storytelling there was no continuity between characters and the ending sorry it left me flat","3533":"the book itself was ok i found it difficult getting used to an audible book if you can't read and are dependent on audio it must be good however for me not used to this genre of books it dragged on and on at some point i thought i would never finish it the book itself is the story of hattie and her children all children are damaged in one way or the other even the grandchild is on the wish list of damaged persons although in some of the sub stories there is a hint that family members see each other every now and again some seem to have lost contact with the rest of the family the book has a sad tone poverty loss of children struggle to feed all the children and a dysfunctional marriage it is a wonder there are that many children and amidst all the damage and misfortune is a woman who strongly believes she has tried to do the right thing even though everyone and everything is against her no one in this book is happy and no one will become happy by reading it if that tickles your fancy this a book for you","3534":"this book was a mess i felt like mathis took a great concept a family's experience during great migration and completely wasted it this book never gains the momentum it needs to tell its story each son or daughter is given a vignette style chapter and aside from being a brief mention in others is never heard from again hattie is never really given the full characterization she deserves just periodic glimpses of her life at various stages this book was an easy read for me but took me so long to finish because i was so bored by the alice chapter i knew this would be a two star review at best it is no surprise that oprah chose it being that she chooses a lot of questionable books not impressed by this book at all","3535":"i enjoyed the first 2 3 of the book but the last 1 3 bothered me for some reason","3536":"pretty good for a downer i was glad to read it but glad to be finished with it too","3537":" i was a little disappointed in this book normally i would really enjoy a book like this a decade spanning story that follows a family through several generations but in the end i never really felt connected to the characters or invested in their story the story starts in 1925 and ends in 1980 and is told from the perspective of multiple characters there is little connection between the different chapters and it ended up feeling somewhat disjointed i did like the writing and appreciated the ideas by the author i would certainly give her next book a try","3538":"a novel that is somewhat depressing where you want to know what happens to the lives of hatties children after reading one chapter on them great book to share a discussion around","3539":"the twelve tribes of hattie is a good book yet rather odd in places thus i gave it 4 stars","3540":"good enough not as great as all the hype but enjoyable nonetheless if you are looking for a pick me upper this is not the book for you but its easy to care for the characters i normally don't like short stories but since these blend together i enjoyed it","3541":"while i enjoyed the writing and found most of the stories of hattie's children interesting i couldn't help but think man the lives of this family couldn't be any worse dealing with mental illness sexual abuse sickness adultery hunger racism sexism illiteracy poverty this family experiences everything i did get lost in the rich deep stories u0026amp recommend this book","3542":" the only reason i am giving this book a 2 is because the ending was great the only two chapters i actually enjoyed were the last two the writing throughout the book is shallow and lacks depth the characters are basically all the same in their bad decisions which might lend itself to a theme but a poorly crafted one there wasn't anything to keep the desire to continue reading it other than my goal of finishing 50 books this year i'm very upset that this was such a highly recommended book also since i read this on my kindle any time i would flip the page and the words were underlined for oprah's opinion it would immediately take me to the end of the book to read her statements no thanks not an oprah lover and never will be she's definitely not the reason i decided to read the book but now this book has deterred me from others that i just so happened upon that are also in o's book club","3543":"i found this book difficult to finish not because i didn't like the writing or the characters but because they were so damaged and i never could find much hope between these pages it's telling about the experience of people treated so badly that they couldn't find much either and it's telling about me that i expected some even though i know how bad our society can be","3544":"oprah's new book club pick i probably would have rated it higher if she tied the characters together somehow in the end basically it was a series of short stories regarding this woman's 12 children","3545":"a fine read that has left me thinking about each character and wanting more so many unanswered questions what a tormented sad life","3546":"i'm just glad it's over a better review will come when i'm not so completely over this book","3547":"i would've liked to see the characters more connected it didn't flow like a novel but liked the overall message of author","3548":"enjoyable but i wish the author would have done more follow up on what became of hattie's children","3549":" i know i am going to be in the minority on this one but i just really could not bond with any of the characters in this one i wasn't impressed with the way hattie handled things i think she was more of a limp dishrag type of woman the story could have gone off in so many other directions however i'm not the author and my opinion doesn't really matter lol still i definitely would have made hattie more more loving more caring more strength yup not going to make any friends with this review but at least i'm honest lol","3550":"the lives of hattie's 11 children and one grandchild spanning 50 years each chapter is a vignette of one of hattie's children either as a child or an adult and how they interacted with their mother or how their mother's behavior made them who they were some were very interesting others dull some of the stories danced off the pages while others bounced forward and backward to lend understanding","3551":" ayana mathis's novel the twelve tribes of hattie focuses on a family who's start was within the great migration each chapter in this novel is a story of one of hattie's children each child is suffering a different way i thought this book was okay mathis's style of writing changed with each chapter some of the stories were really hard to get through whereas others were very fast paced it took me a while to get through this novel because of how hard it was to get through some of the stories overall i thought the book was beautifully written she tied the story up very nicely in the end","3552":"more a set of interrelated short stories than a cohesive novel each chapter can stand on its own but is more powerful as part of the whole","3553":"the writing in this book is beautiful and it reflects the influence of marilyn robinson who is listed in the acknowledgments structured as a series of separate stories of hattie august and their 11 children the novel is at times almost unbearably sad and hopeless i was glad i pushed through to the end but the emotional cost was high","3554":"i enjoyed this book from the minute i opened it great first book for an author arranged in chapters high lighting her 12 children you learn who hattie shepard really is each chapter is a small novella in itself from the perspective of one child giving their insight into their mother hattie some chapters were better than others but overall the book was very good","3555":" to me this story was about life and how you're shitty life and intentions seep down and affect your children and then they have emotional problems and so on and i'm not saying this as a bad thing because honestly that is life here and now the author takes this theme and makes it into a very well written she can write story about one mother and her multitude of children through the years this isn't a completely linear novel but each chapter is divided amongst each of hattie's children plus one grandchild and gives you a glimpse into how their lives have been affected by their loving but deadbeat father u0026amp their unloving but persevering mother and of course their own life choices we see their struggles emotional deficits \"daddy issues\" and so on yes they all suffer in some way and yes it's sad depressing frustrating disgusting but the one constant is hattie whether she's in the background or in the forefront she's the life that has held this altogether the only unfortunate part is that most of hattie's children have traits that make them very unlikable you get to see where they're coming from or how they've become the people they are but i was still left feeling repulsed by many of their choices i suppose the one that might've had the most chance at a different life we don't really hear from as she is a baby during her dedicated chapter i'm curious to how she turned out... and though hattie does not give the love and tenderness to her children that they obviously crave i can't help but feel for her and understand her as a woman she loves her children she really does but just prioritizes the reality of life over the fanciful dreams of love the last chapter does show a change in hattie though and it honestly made me happy to know that she was going to try give it one last shot to \"save\" her grandchild","3556":"through the voices of her offspring we learn about the matriarch hattie from the mid atlantic to the deep south glimpses of this woman and her family are revealed i felt like this book made my heart heavy i was so sad for almost all the characters i am now in search of something with a little levity i wish the thread linking the stories together was stronger it almost felt more like a collection of short stories","3557":"interesting one generation follows another into the same cycles of life got a little tired of the same disfunctions","3558":"there is some really good writing in this book some beautiful portraits of the ache of living but i would have liked the chapters to have been a bit more connected to each other i don't even feel like the one character who connects them all hattie is very well developed by the end","3559":"finally i completed this book it took me a while to read this book it is not an easy read but an interesting read","3560":"i enjoyed reading this book the way each character had a story and although not complete from birth to death you understood each child had a role and without one a piece would be missing great read","3561":"i loved that the author jumps from different time periods and shows the perspective of her different children seeing how their mother has influenced them and still does even in adult life at times the stories were so sad i had to take a break it was well worth the read the writing was beautiful i loved that the author did not sugar coat our often harsh reality it rang true to life a great book club choice","3562":"this book is very well written which is the only reason i kept reading it felt like twelve short stories that end abruptly and leave you wondering what happened next","3563":"enjoyed the book and characters well written worth your time but something not totally satisfying about this book","3564":" rating 3 5 starsaw hell how am i supposed to rate this there's some powerful writing here but the structure of the novel prevents it from gaining much momentum each chapter is devoted to one or two of hattie's children and after they get that one chapter they're mostly abandoned for the remainder of the novel each character has to be introduced and developed within the space of one long chapter never to be heard from again mostly once their time in the spotlight has passed adding to the discontinuity are the long time gaps between chapters you get philadelphia and jubilee in 1925 followed by floyd in 1948 then six in 1950 and so on instead of a novel it begins to feel like a series of interconnected stories with one or two characters binding them all together hattie is the only character we can connect with throughout the entire book and often that connection is from a distance does this mean i didn't enjoy the book no ayana mathis is a mighty fine writer she seems to write from a place of understanding the hearts and minds of a people whose history offered them limited options often resulting in self destructive behaviors in 1923 hattie moves to philadelphia as part of the great migration when many southern black people moved north hoping to escape abuse and poverty the absence of jim crow laws allows her greater dignity and freedom from fear but financial success eludes her her husband is a hard drinking gambling womanizing scoundrel but she can't resist him in the bedroom so baby after baby after baby arrives hattie is so busy just trying to keep them fed and clothed and out of trouble that she doesn't think to give them the warmth and affection they crave each chapter shows how that life of poverty and apparent hopelessness infects each child with a certain poverty of spirit what ayana mathis does masterfully is show how removal from oppression does not automatically lift the feeling of being oppressed at the end of the novel hattie observes here we are sixty years out of georgia a new generation has been born and there's still the same wounding and the same pain healing takes more than a generation and the work is still upon us this has no bearing on the story but i found it interesting and effective the way mathis uses references to food to illustrate the various skin tones she describes people with skin the color of liquid caramel clover honey milky tea nutmeg and cinnamon and hattie who could have passed has skin the color of the inside of an almond i'm so pale that i practically glow in the dark but when i look at my skin it's not really white the closest i could get using a food reference would be the inside of a yukon gold potato appetizing ain't it","3565":"i would have rated this book 3 1 2 stars if 1 2 stars were available i liked it but didn't love it maybe because of the tragedies which underlies so many of the characters","3566":"started to really enjoy the book then found it disjointed and incomplete towards the end","3567":"i enjoyed the story and the various character prespectives however it wasn't the right kind of book to listen to the audio version there were two many characters and on occassion it became hard to follow the individual stories and know what was going on with everyone and determine how each character was connected","3568":"this is a great debut novel the writing is beautifully descriptive without being over the top i loved how the stories of each of hattie's children and one grandchild were told chronologically and how they interwove with eachother and back to hattie i didn't think the last two were quite as captivating but they still flowed well with the story i will eagerly await mathis' next book","3569":"this book was set up differently with each chapter devoted to one of hattie's children what struck me the most was how a lack of mothers love can change a persons whole life hattie loved her children but wasn't capable of showing it they were fed and clothed but not shown much affection so sad","3570":" if this wasn't for a bookclub read not sure i would have read it through to the end glad i did though it is an interesting story with each chapter representing the main character's hattie children there is a lot of references for each time table including poverty slavery and jim crow laws the book makes you think about parenthood marriage love bringing up your kids giving them what you can and if it is enough and how your kids go forward into life if they can make changes you couldn't do for them it also leaves you wondering at the end if no matter your age if you can change and make things better good read if you open yourself up to the style it is written","3571":"i loved the authors writing style however i felt at the end it was a collection of short stories with cliffhanger endings because you never discover what becomes of her children in that way it was disappointing but i did enjoy reading it i had a hard time putting it down","3572":"beautiful writing loved the concept of the book and how in theory it was organized my only critique is that i wish that hattie's children were developed further after their chapter they rarely come back and are hardly mentioned in the remaining stories","3573":"really enjoyed this book felt very much like a tree grows in brooklyn but in philadelphia a few decades later beautifully written characters driven snapshots of life","3574":"eh powerful in parts but disjointed and left me unfulfilled more the format than he writing style that was lacking","3575":"i think it was really a 2 5 a good story but a little disjointed","3576":"i would have liked more of an in depth follow up on some of the characters didn't quite get how the book ended","3577":"i would give this 3 5 stars if i could each chapter is kind of a short story about a different member of the family some were more powerful than others","3578":" another debut author who writes a series of related stories to tell a larger story i liked this one especially because each chapter was told by a different child sibling to tell the story of hattie their mother the stories go from the 1920s to the 1980s and i found it interesting how each decade and character worked together the only frustrating thing about this story concept is that some characters we only see very briefly and are left wanting to know more in the end though i was satisfied that i knew hattie and the reasons why she loved her children the way that she did and the reasons for her different ways of showing it","3579":"i really liked the story and wanted to know more about the characters introduced but the concept didn't allow that felt a little robbed","3580":"3 75 out of 5 starsi know for most readers the tepid ending can seem disheartening but i think that approach is missing the point one must remember the title because it's the common thread that holds all the stories together the reader learns about hattie through her children and is the story within the stories","3581":" it was well written but i had trouble with this one two reasons 1 it's essentially a collection of short stories that are related it's hard because i would finally be invested in a character and their story would end yet because they were the same family i didn't forget about them so i would still want to know more about them it was unsatisfying in that regard 2 it was pretty depressing most stories like life no matter how much struggle have some higher moments this had none some people like that but i read for joy","3582":"i really like the telling of who hattie is by each of her children and a grandchild i do wish there had been more of a complete picture painted of this matriarch but the poignant heartbreaking and real accounts of hattie speak to a piece of me that is at once familiar but unfamiliar with the characters and their accounts","3583":" i ignored this book when it was an oprah selection but then it became a pick by chapters indigo a heather's pick so decided i would probably like it i was sadly disappointed the eleven children of hattie are usually each given a chapter with little connection to the other chapters at the end of their section most of these characters are forgotten never to be heard of again the chapters start in 1920's one in the 1940's three in the 1950's two in the 1960's one in 1975 and the final two in 1980 we scarcely know what happened to the children who were the the subjects of the early chapters and found myself not caring for any of the characters in the book even hattie was vaguely drawn in connection to her children and remained remote the structure of the book ruined it for me","3584":"the twelve tribes of hattie is a truly remarkable novel it tells the story of hattie shepard an african american woman who moved from georgia to philadelphia in 1923 during the great migration a time when millions of african americans moved from the south to northern states her initial hopes for a better life are dashed after a disappointing marriage and the death of her newborn twins as the years pass by she has nine more children which she raises without much tenderness in an attempt to prepare them for the harsh world they live in hattie's twelve tribes are her children each chapter of the novel is told from the point of view of a different child an interesting technique that tells the story of the children right along with the story of hattie the chapters do not always go in order sometimes the featured child is an adult while in other chapters they are only infants each story is very unique the children all have their own struggles to deal with and each interacts with hattie in a different way she is the thread that holds all of the different narratives together and you find out a little bit more about her in each chapter i found that i very much enjoyed this approach i had never read anything like it before and it really kept my interest i was excited to see how each story unfolded and was always anxious to move onto the next chapter and see what that kid's story was this was one of those books that i just couldn't put down ayana mathis's writing style is both simple and poetic it has a quality of emotional honesty about it that is easy for the reader to connect with her characters are flawed but they are written in a way that makes them interesting and very readable i didn't feel annoyed or bored by any of them the novel is easy to read but still feels like great literature mathis is basically an easier to understand toni morrison this is her first book and it is an amazing first effort i will definitely be reading any other novels she comes out with this is definitely a contender for my best book of the year it's honest heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time it was a great read","3585":"not bad but not great either i think i've been spoiled by my recent readings of salvage the bones the good lord bird the warmth of other suns and men we reaped read those books before you read this one","3586":"this is a collection of short stories each based on one or more of hattie's children some of the stories drew me right into hattie's life while others seemed disjointed and too far removed to be interesting i wanted to rate it 3 stars because it was such a good book in audio format but too many of the stories fell short","3587":"i liked the writing but didn't like that the story was told in bits and pieces from the perspectives of many of the people her children mostly in hattie's life i don't usually like books that are a series of unrelated short stories and that's what this read like i would have liked it better if it were a full single story novel i got about 80% done and decided not to finsh","3588":"i loved how the author flopped around with the narrorators to tell such a true story of hattie i enjoyed the theme of our own anger strangling our future this book was highly readable and brought all the characters to life","3589":"beautifully written her style reminds me of toni morrison very touching u0026amp thought provoking novel","3590":"well written but each chapter is about different character and all of them unlikeable they are all so damaged but i have limited patience with that as an excuse to be horribly selfish","3591":"more like 3 5 stars the book picked up about halfway through but overall it felt a little flimsy i really liked the structure and there were some lovely turns of phrase but there weren't any characters that i hadn't already encountered in other books by the likes of wright hurston morrison etc i consider warmth of other suns to be the definitive story of the great migration this book is the fictionalized oprah approved accompaniment that introduces a wider audience to the topic","3592":" i really did enjoy this book mostly because the author writes with so much texture and depth that i felt like i knew the characters the downside to this book is that each chapter was dedicated to one of hattie's children so you met them and they were never to be heard from again the best word i can think of to describe it is disjointed i would have loved it if the brothers and sisters had interacted with each other i could not get a clear picture of their childhood growing up in the same house","3593":"read in anticipation of participating in a writer's workshop with the author despite the fact that the plot is unrelentingly grim the lyrical prose soars and it is difficult to believe that this is a debut novel","3594":"it was a great and intriguing book definitely a must read","3595":"if you like toni morrison you'll like this extremely depressing book but very well written and very believable hence the depressing the ending was amazing and slightly unexpected hattie is one hell of a great character","3596":"this book was well written and it is the author's first novel i gave it a two simply because i had a hard time getting into it so many of the characters were unlikable and rather than focusing on one character's point of view the story is told in short stories from different family members the jumping to different family members made the story harder for me to follow i felt so sorry for hattie with losing her first born twins to pneumonia how sad my heart also ached for her when she had to give up a baby daughter simply because she couldn't afford to care for her and the other members of her family my heart also ached at the treatment of african americans during this time in the united states 1930s 1960s i was so angry at how pearl and her husband were treated when they stopped for a picnic in virginia on the way to take hattie's baby girl the comment about chicken bone beach being dirty because african americans don't take care of things but then it was pointed out the white beach was cleaned by the city and that the other beach was not ugh at the end it sounds like hattie is going to get another chance with her granddaughter and maybe she will be more tender as grandmothers seem to be in a way that mothers cannot","3597":"i think this is technically a novel but i read it more as linked stories some of the stories i liked other i didn't enjoy as much it took me longer than usual to get through but i am glad i finished it","3598":"i really wanted to like this book and i guess i have to say that i did like some parts i just felt like the story didn't flow it wasn't evident that some of the chapters were about harrie's children you had to figure things out along the way it also seemed like the book ended abruptly and it left me with the feeling that something was missing","3599":"i really enjoyed the book i didn't mind the way the book was laid out as some did the writing was eloqent and engaging even though the topics were morose i felt myself feeling hopeful at the end","3600":"this book pulls you through many disturbing realities that are most often left unspoken and ends on one of the most thought provoking notes i can ever remember reading i would love to hear what other thoughts are on this book it's one of those books you really want to talk about it ends way too soon and is so well written that you would never need to see the movie because you feel as if you already did","3601":"this is beautifully written and intriguing the story is really several stories woven through the narrative of a single family it was a quick and lovely read","3602":"nice read reminds me of the many issues my grandmother had raising 13 kids the story gave an interesting perspective on my personal narrative","3603":"wonderful lyrical narrative that not only traces the history of hattie shepherd and her children but also the difficult path of blacks in america throughout the twentieth century","3604":"a must read mathis is a gifted writer i recommend reading this book after isabel wilkerson's warmth of other suns mathis acknowledges borrowing from wilkerson","3605":"a detailed look at what might've been one woman's experience of the great migration and how it played out generationally it might not be the story you were expecting detailed comments blogged at a just recompense karen","3606":"a very interesting premise which held my attention and brought me into many worlds i was not familiar with some choppiness in the plot and story telling but i do recommend this","3607":"i thought the book contained interesting portrayals of a variety of characters mostly children of the main character however i didn't think it really hung together as an interesting story or novel overall","3608":"well written and engaging really expresses the ripple effects our lives have on our families and the next generation so many things misunderstood that leave impressions on our children and mold them accordingly hauntingly sad not one of my favorites but would still recommend as a good read","3609":"i really liked how this book was organized one chapter for each child fascinating and heart breaking glad my book club choose this one and looking forward to discussing it","3610":"i had a hard time 'getting' hattie there was certainly drama in this read lots of people hell bent on self destruction if we were somehow supposed to blame hattie for her children's weaknesses and plight i didn't get the connection i felt like i knew two major events in hattie's life besides having an unimaginable number of children but that didn't leave me with enough to go on to figure out who she was each chapter telling a story about one of her children was a good read but didn't give me that connection to hattie that i kept waiting for my takeaway hey my life sucks and everyone in it will pay for that something i don't take very kindly to overall the book was disjointed and random and very disappointing","3611":"this is one of those books where i wish goodreads allowed 1 2 stars i almost gave up on it after the first chapter not because it wasn't well written but because it was depressing i didn't particularly care for the character of hattie but i guess i was supposed to think of her as cold and aloof some chapters were more interesting than others but there wasn't much interconnection between the children in each chapter overall it was a pretty good read but not a book i would highly recommend","3612":"i would give this 3 1 2 stars if i could beautiful prose and compelling human stories wanted more of some of the character's stories and less of others","3613":"big disappointment considering all the oprah hype no enough character development","3614":"i usually avoid oprah's books but this book did not disappoint loved the span of time and the complex characters","3615":"such a sad sorrowful tale","3616":"it was ok slow to get involved but interesting","3617":"each chapter details the sad and mostly un likable life of each of hattie's children and one grandchild as each chapter ends you are left with unanswered questions about that characters future eventually you get a vague sense of it a non united family that thrives and survives despite their hardships well written each chapter is it's own voice however that makes the book lack cohesiveness much like the family represented a","3618":"almost put it down but kept reading and grew to like the book","3619":"i actually thinnk if it had a been a more normal week instead of a week of upheaval i would have liked this book better this is one i will probably revisit at some point","3620":"despite the broken english and not knowing what happens to hattie's children after their chapter this book was compelling and realistic it showed a journey of a struggling mother though the eyes of her children","3621":" i could not put this book down i had to find out what happened next even though it wasn't that kind of book each chapter is about one of hattie's children tribe it tells the story of their mother and their life because of their mother through each individuals point of view that was very interesting to me i would have liked for there to have been a hattie chapter reflecting on each of her children in her older years but other than that i thoroughly enjoyed this book i know that this was the first novel for ayana mathis but if she continues to write like this she will be added to my favorite authors list for sure","3622":"super good kind of like little short stories put together but they all seem to tie together in an interesting way followed along with oprah's guide loved it","3623":"i really wanted more from this book the characters are completely and totally unlikeable it's about a never ending cycle of struggle where literally no one comes through better for it i don't mind depressing stories or stories of struggle and heartache but this one is flat","3624":"i liked it but wasn't totally satisfied the author did a good job introducing the characters but since it is written like a series of short stories with a common theme hattie i felt left wanting more maybe this is a good thing if she were to continue a book series developing each storyline a little more","3625":"actually this was kind of disappointing the first chapter was the best the rest just sort of fell apart in my mind perhaps i was just more interested in hattie and disappointed that the focus came on her kids and only her obliquely","3626":" oprah is always on point i've read over a third of of her book club picks and they have all made think a certain kind of way that to me is good writing my goal is to read them all now honestly some of her picks have provoked more thinking than others nonetheless her books are typically great writing and great story telling over the years i've liked some writing styles over others and some story lines over others but at the end of the day i've never had a bad read from her book club picks so when she said that the twelve tribes of hattie was transformative i was all in now i cannot say that it didn't transform her life but for sure i can say that it didn't transform mine was it a good read yes without a doubt transformative no the author tackled some important issues child sexual abuse class race infidelity womanizing homosexuality and the complicated issue of abuse in the black family it's all there and when you think about it with 12 children you are certainly going to have all these important and disconcerting issues within a family this book started as a wonderful migration story chapter one was brilliant a young marriage seeking a better life in a northern city and the failure of that promise rooted in the hard reality of life up north and youthful pride i was all in then came chapter two and i said hummm and by chapter three i was confuse now don't get me wrong each chapter was great story telling where the book went left for me was with the structure by the third chapter i felt like i was reading short stories and not a novel the thing that made this book great was the thing that made this a weak novel each chapter told the story of one or two of hattie's children and it may or may not have mentioned the other children even hattie was a passing thought yes each child was birthed by hattie and therefore this book is true to it's title the twelve tribes of hattie but the thread that connected them in the writing was incredibility thin at best with a failed attempt in my opinion to try and bring them all together in the last chapter what makes this book powerful is that each chapter is a well written and the author tackle's important issues each chapter is a page turner for sure but with each new chapter there was a level of disappointment waiting to see how this was going to become a novel i gave it 4 stars on good reads because over all it really was a good book and each chapter was thought provoking this is ayana mathis first novel and she is well on her way not just because oprah choose it but because she is clearly not afraid to deal head on with important issues in the african american community such as homophobia class skin color and child abuse i recommend this book now black folks are always talking about how oprah never chooses african american authors which by the way is not true so this is your time to pick up this book and not only join the discussion but support this raising star i'm already waiting on ayana mathis next book","3627":"sad read reminds me that no matter how hard we monther's try we will always be doing something wrong and our children will be themselves","3628":" it did not read like a debut novel this is probably one of the better books i have read this year ayana mathis is a brilliant story teller her tales about hattie shepherd her life spanning decades in philadelphia in the early 1920's to the 1980's her sad and loveless marriage the individual stories told about each of her 12 children whom she brings up in trying and heartbreaking circumstance the book is about real love hattie comes across as hard and often mean to her children but she represents real love the beauty of ayana's language is stunning you act like your whole life was one long january afternoon lawrence said the trees are always barren and there's not a flower on the vine ayana tackles issues around race identity loss homosexuality abuse addiction infidelity mental illness religion sacrifice and poverty in a way that resonates so profoundly with the reader i felt i knew each one of hattie's children because at some point i have met or was that person an incredible fantastic read it felt like a toni morrison or even zora neale hurton book at times this is a great compliment to the author just because of the sheer beauty of description and language that the author used i really loved this book","3629":"don't read this unless you want spoilers twelve tribes on unresolved meandering storylines i suppose i deserved this for thinking that this would be the one time i have ever agreed with an oprah recommendation","3630":"loved this my extended review coming soon","3631":" 3 maybe 3 5 stars for the well done writing i so wanted to love this book i thought from the synopsis i had found the family saga that i was craving i think the idea behind this book telling the story of one woman and each of her children was a wonderful beginning but all in all it fell a bit flat for me by the time i got to the end hattie escapes a not so wonderful childhood with hopes for a better life those hopes are quickly snuffed out and she seems to always be reaching for her dreams but never grasping them mathis paints a great picture of hattie and i felt her slowly slip into acceptance that her life would never be what she hoped for that said i found her a bit cold and never really warmed to her the book is divided into narrations from each of her children this really worked for me to see how they each made there way out into the world raised the same yet becoming such different adults what did not work for me is that i became interested in their stories and then they were gone and i was moved on to the next child i kept waiting for mathis to bring them all back around later to see how they each ended up i didn't feel i got that much like their mother not connecting with them i had trouble connecting to the book that said the writing was very well done there were some historic aspects as well as very descriptive settings and situations i was able to envision what was going on and picture the scene i was a bit disappointed overall but it was a good debut i would read her again","3632":"the twelve tribes of hattie tells the life story of hattie through the eyes of her children the construction of the book was more interesting to me than the actual story and i have mixed feelings about how successful it is each chapter is told from the point of view of one hattie's children and i like the idea of developing a character by how others see her as opposed to how an objective narrator or the character herself views her actions and choices the downside is that mathis's narrative jumps years at a time with each new chapter so that stories that are started are left without an ending and that left me feeling like i only got bits and pieces of the story that said those pieces are always beautifully written and often thought provoking and moving the twelve tribes of hattie has some interesting things to say about family love faith and adversity and i think its troubled characters will stick with me for a long time","3633":"the story is strong and necessary the writing didn't do it for me","3634":"hard life of a young mother starting out in the early 20's with too many children who are damaged by her distance and coldness of just getting through the day with a husband who just fools around and spends their money on women u0026amp drink children need to know that they are loved everyday of their young lives which is more important than food and clean clothes","3635":"i loved this book and found it a very interesting story about all of the children and one grandchild of hattie it was very inventive and original for the author to choose to tell each chapter from a different point of view and i also liked how it moved forward in time from one chapter to the next the idea to take an in depth look at a poor african american family with all of its hardship was quite different and unique from anything i've read i was impressed with the author's ability to make me understand hattie how difficult everything in her life was and what little things she did to try to find some happiness","3636":"a very touching and sad story of poverty racism redemption of a family that made the great migration of african americans to the northeast the chapter on bell broke my heart","3637":"the twelve tribes of hattie ayana mathisthis is an atmospheric read richly detailed and well observed it recounts the trials and tribulations of a family who escape from georgia in the 1920's and find a kind of refuge in philadelphia the matriarch has come from a relatively well to do family and despite ambitions to better herself and her family finds herself trapped in relentless poverty having to put softness on hold while she cares for her expanding family i found the narrative easy to get along with and engrossing there is much to learn too within the pages of this tale about attitudes clearly this is a subject close to the author's heart and one which will resonate widely cleverly the tale is weaved around the stories of each of the children however as the story progressed i felt myself disengaging ever so slightly perhaps because as a device switching points of view works well but is hard to sustain through a whole novel characterisations were clever and careful but towards the end the device of \"one chapter one child\" felt as if it had become hard to sustain we get glimpses of real brutality from hattie set against a background of business like disengagement with no time for expressions of affection or love perhaps then it is unsurprising that the children seem to come out of their experiences badly the oldest surviving son is relentlessly promiscuous and tormented about his sexuality one child is badly burnt in a bath of hot water one child endures years of sexual abuse one is a deeply disturbed alcoholic one child contracts life threatening tb and two children develop mental illness it may be naive to ask but is there no happiness in poverty apparently not and yet from the mind of the most disturbed child come such vivid and interesting passages of colour and startling insight i did gain a lot from reading this novel and i am happy to recommend it but please remove rose tinted glasses there is much to learn but little to rejoice in fran macilvey author \"trapped my life with cerebral palsy\"","3638":"this was an interesting read where each chapter was about one of the main character's children the characters were pretty tragic but i enjoyed reading this novel","3639":"this superbly written book would be five stars except for its conceptual weakness while the structure is clever each one of hattie's children gets a short story of his her own that format is at odds with the novel of one family a short story like a novel is based on conflict and desire desire is the subject of all fiction because it is the subject of all human behavior we desire when we want something but also when we lack something when we are unhappy and have problems and that's the problem with this book all of hattie's children to fit into the short story form are made unhappy and with problems failed lives it's frankly unbelievable you wonder how terrible these parents were to raise such failed children who for example spoilers are mentally ill feckless womanizers feckless manizers alcoholics epileptics secret homosexual not a problem to us but a problem to them bored drugged rich housewives it's all very soap opera some explanation is reductively given by giving hattie only two characteristics her great pride and her hardness lack of affection because she had so many children she was overworked and beaten to the ground and so she didn't show love and that raises the question of why did they have so many children there wasn't the pill but there were condoms this novel is humanely written with striking imagery and psychological realism of being part of a family and it has excellent individual chapters like the heartbreaking first and six and floyd's stories but as you read on and encounter another shepard child with a melodramatic and terrible life there's also child abuse it becomes wearing mathis in part goes the forrest gump route having one character needlessly at the vietnam war where of course something terrible happens okay that sentence was stupid vietnam was a terrible war but hopefully you know what i mean i would have rather seen a traditional novel about one family going through the great migration and surviving it all or for the most part instead of the tales of woe presented here four stars for her prose and some of her characters and stories","3640":"i wanted to love this book but i just didn't it was average story telling and i would have liked more depth to the characters and more on the interaction or lack thereof between the family members","3641":"couldn't help but compare this to one of my all time favorite books by barbara kingsolver the poisonwood bible ayana mathis does an incredible job with the different voices of each of hattie's twelve children at the same time you have disdain for hattie you also love her through the hardship she endures and the generations she brings into the world i couldn't wait to keep reading these stories even though there are 12 different narrations it feels like a complete whole","3642":"this book did not flow for me the way the children are chopped into different chapters with usually no relevance to each other until the final chapter was disheartening","3643":"i really enjoyed the book a real page turner it was shocking how different each of hattie's children would become i was impressed with hattie's courage and stoicism i don't think i could handle","3644":"really wanted to like this book but there was no flow it didn't really go anywhere all the different points do view could have been very compelling but instead it felt disjointed","3645":"4 5 5 although i have read many unfavorable reviews i really enjoyed this book keep in mind that is not a happy story it's style and intertwining stories reminded me of olive kitteridge","3646":"when a book reaches the coveted oprah book club list you know it will be wide read and in the case of the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis it's richly deserving of the nomination even though it's mathis' first novel she writes with the poignant voice of a veteran author each chapter is dedicated to one of her children and through them we learn more about hattie--her intense self reliance and her yearning for a better life mathis presents a flawed character--hattie is not a storybook version of a loving mother we see the toll motherhood takes on her \"'somebody always wants something from me ' she said in a near whisper 'they're eating me alive '\" and we get the sense that the children have to nurture themselves because hattie is unable to express her love in a form they will readily recognize \"when hattie's children were young they'd called her the general they thought she didn't know but she knew everything about each one of them she could feel their vibrating souls \" she's surrounded by people who need something from her--a seemingly neverending stream of children an unreliable husband judgmental family members--giving us the impression that she's unable to relax and breathe in fact she seems to be coiled so tightly that the only outlet is in her fierce devotion to her children but we also see that she has built her own prison--she made herself indispensable the linchpin that holds everything together \"he couldn't stand that he was unable to act that he needed hattie to come along and solve the problem of hattie having left him \" the book opens with a tragedy and throughout we see the hard and sometimes horrific choices that hattie made all of which seemed only to strengthen her resolve from the first pages mathis writes with an intensity that is nearly vicious in its grip the prose is visual \"nothing but white row houses across the street crammed together like teeth...\" and engrossing \"hattie clambered from the train her skirt still hemmed with georgia mud the dream of philadelphia round as a marble in her mouth and the fear of it a needle in her chest \" the book is an emotional whollop but is well worth the read","3647":"i was disappointed after oprah's big hupla","3648":"vivid characters but be ready for generations of one horrible thing after another happening to these poor people hattie reminds me of olive kitteridge in a way though she's darker than olive less snarky and more sad resigned all the difficulties of a long life heaped upon her and exhausting her and wearing her down","3649":"this is oprah's new book pick i thought it was amazing especially for a first time author the story centers around hattie shepherd who moves from georgia to philadelphia great story told from differing viewpoints of hattie's children very moving great author","3650":"it was beautifully written but the story didn't grab me just sad","3651":"won this from first reads thank you very much ery interesting family story told through the eyes of different characters definitely an author to watch","3652":"at the start of every chapter i was lost by the end of every chapter i loved the characters","3653":"i thought the book was okay but didn't care for the ending to me having faith in a higher power would of given her granddaughter strength seemed that was lacking with her children","3654":"painful i can't imagine living with an emotionless mother how our young experiences haunt us throughout our lives causing the soul to close up on love and affection hattie is definitely an iceberg","3655":"couldn't get beyond chapter three i'm all for human suffering but where's the upside to these short stories posing as chapters","3656":"beautiful writing but jumps between stories","3657":" good read but hard to keep characters straight or form bonds with any characters except hattie who is not too easy to love was more about how women who are forced to give birth over and over and over may not be ready to be mothers the most poignant story is at the begining when hattie loses her baby twins the poor thing is never able to fully grieve and therefore never able to fully give herself to any of her other children thought the story would have more to do with the great migration and the changes that african americans faced moving from the south to the north but the story was not really about that at all","3658":"this book is not meant to be happy and cheerful so bring your kleenex the writing is real and raw the subject matter is covered well and gives the reader a glimpse into lives of those who struggle and conquer or sometimes can't quite make if","3659":" i was so looking forward to reading this book and perhaps that is why it disappointed me so my major complaint with this book is that it felt like twelve rough sketches for twelve interesting novels with great potential in fact more than one of the stories left me wanting a great deal more and feeling quite let down that ms mathis had not chosen to develop that particular character any further none of the stories had enough flesh or substance to exist on their own nor did they bear enough of a connection to each other to sustain any kind of narrative flow which even in a short story collection especially one such as this which ostensibly revolves around one woman and her children and one grandchild is absolutely necessary many of the stories felt incomplete and though ms mathis' writing is rich and flows easily i could not help but feel that this work read very much like a work in progress rather than a completed collection finally we learn very little in the end about hattie other than what becomes a very one dimensional portrait of a rather unsympathetic and unbelievable woman living through the great migration","3660":"good book deep and complex","3661":" a 3 5 i have to say i was a bit disappointed with this book it being my first oprah's book club read i expected a lot the book is wonderfully written sentences are clear and to the point and words are masterfully woven together that at times the feel is very poetic the book is divided into separate scenarios that follow single life changing events of each of hattie's the protagonist children and one grand daughter every one of these instances looked at separately is very impactful to the reader to see the relationship each child has with their mother hattie is very emotional even when hattie's mentioning within a scenario is extremely brief by the end of the book you grow to appreciate hattie even though as you will read she wasn't the best mother her lack of emotional connection to her children is what drove them down a certain way it takes her a while to realize so but when she does and when the reader realizes in what way hattie loved her children you will appreciate her you will applaud her for her strength and you definitely applaud her for what she does in the last story scenario with her grand daughter however i did have issues with the book first of all this doesn't necessarily read as a novel it came as quite a surprise because the cover does indicate that this should be a novel the way the book is set up makes each scenario read like a separate short story characters that are introduced and intrigued me for a chapter are entirely gone the next never to be heard from again there may be the mentioning of a name here and there but those instances are rare this is disappointing because i wanted some more depth to these individual characters they were mostly presented in isolated situations so seeing them interact with one another was not an option i guess this irks me the most because it kind of feels like false advertising if it had said short stories on the cover it may be a different story with me the redeeming quality was hattie as she is the only character we follow throughout the entire book we see her arrive to philadelphia a helpless child and grow into a strong and courageous woman who will do anything to see her children survive even if it means sacrificing their love but i must admit halfway through the book the effect of that theme kind of wore off it was only towards the end the final 2 or 3 stories that brought everything together neatly and gave hattie a redeeming quality while it's definitely a good read it's not one of my favorites i expected more but i appreciate it for what it is ayana mathis is a great writer and will definitely pick up her next work perhaps her storytelling method will have improved by then and hopefully she blows me away","3662":"this is an intense book i had difficulty staying with it because each story it is a collection of short stories where all the main characters are hattie's family is extremely deep and emotional every story was a roller coaster and i ached for the characters i highly recommend this book all the characters are so three dimensional and just jump off the page","3663":" these stories which read like short novelettes weaves around and through each other creating a tapestry of one family's history colored by the agony and happiness love and sorrow pain and redemption that every family experiences at one time or another mathias' skilled storytelling brings each character to life when they need to shine and allows them to recede to the background when necessary for others to come forth \"the twelve tribes of hattie\" is a brilliant piece of fiction - one that has the staying power to live on long after the fame and adulation have died down","3664":"well written misery lit should have been called the 12 trials unlikable characters seemingly without a hint of redemption","3665":"really liked this book no review right now","3666":"awesome totally absorbing finished in two days","3667":"a sad book but i enjoyed it nonetheless the characters were totally believable and despite their shortcomings likeable although each persons story stands alone a bit like short stories they totally kept my attention and all of them flowed together ina very natural manner definitely worth reading","3668":" it felt very incomplete the ending was far too simple for the complex stories that were built up over the course of the book also i thought more would be done to capture one's interest in the bunches of characters but i kind of found myself thinking why did the author introduce another character and why should i care about them i would have liked to see more interaction between the siblings also when a chapter ended i wish it was not the last time we heard from a character save a few besides the few times they were thought of by other characters i was looking for the book to read like a lot of khaled hosseni's work where we have an introduction that gives a great idea of the culture and setting then seeing multiple characters live their lives and then they all start to come together and the loose ends are tied into a neat knot and the story ends the book fell short of my expectations but it was sort of interesting to see how each of hattie's children were effected by her being overwhelmed by 12 children and her lack of warmth and even abandonment what also sort got me was the end where we see hattie's character development i wouldn't reccommend this book it read like a draft that needed some work another book similar to boy snow bird that either needed to be longer or not written","3669":"not sure why i read this wouldn't recommend it","3670":"more than anything this novel is damn depressing starts with two dead babies and doesn't get any happier hattie is the matriarch and the stories are both hers and her children's i heard someone say it was reminiscent of the warmth of other suns and i would say that's true to a point quick read but have something lighter lined up","3671":"i like the way the author makes distinctions in the characters with her writing style as well as descriptively i see the development of hattie ofver the years and the other characters as well the writing is fine","3672":"beautifully written hard to read...","3673":"it took me a long time to finish this book because the book tells the story of hattie primarily through the lives of her children and it jumps from child to child each chapter i was almost done with the book before i really gained interest the author's writing however is superb her descriptions really help to provide a clear picture of what is happening in the characters' lives","3674":"i gave it up i should have realized that since i have never liked oprah's picks i wouldn't like this one either","3675":"i thought that this was a well written story with a strong yet flawed mother at the center of this family each child in this story in their own way has struggled in the world through pain and hardship as try to leave their childhood behind however hattie the mother remains focal in their story","3676":"well written interesting stories but ultimately pretty bleak the folks were survivors of so much pain and deprivation and lack of love","3677":"wow i am so glad that i did not purchase this book because if i did i would really be disappointed i instead checked out the audio book at the library and it was a let down i tried but sorry to say it is just not going to work out i usually like historic fiction books but this one didn't do it for me","3678":" i probably would have scored this book higher if i hadn't had the audio version i wish i had read this book instead of listening to it i really enjoyed the story but did not love the reader she was great with the characters' voices but there was something about the way she read the narration that i did not like the story itself is pretty compelling so much so that i wanted to hear more about most of the characters from each vignette i found myself a bit disappointed at the end with the lack of follow up on some of the stories definitely worth the read though","3679":" this story was very well written i really thought that the author captured the culture and time well i did not like that there was little connection between the childrens' stories since each child was only introduced and discussed in one chapter i felt like i was reading a series of short stories i expected all of the stories to be woven together in the end so when i turned the last page i was surprised i had reached the end for this being a first novel i look forward to mathis' next book","3680":"liked some of the chapters but it was a bit like a book of short stories with a loose theme and that didn't really work for me","3681":" there are no rainbows and unicorns in these pages and i do believe this is one of the most depressing books i've ever read but i couldn't put it down each chapter deals with each of hattie's children at a specific point in their lives and i kept reading and hoping for something positive to happen it never did hattie was one of those mothers who had a difficult time expressing love in a way that let her children know she loved them this quote from the book sums up her tough love approach they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind the story covers decades from the time she's a teenaged mother until she became a grandmother at the every end with her grandchild there's a glimmer of hope that maybe--just maybe--hattie will learn to show love in a different way and by doing so she'll be able to save that last child from the unhappiness her other children experienced","3682":"i can see why this would make a good book for a book club but many of the vignettes seemed really familiar it brought to mind the more classic books dealing with the struggles of being poor and african american invisible man their eyes were watching god etc but didn't really add anything new or interesting","3683":"this book was too painfully sad for me if you like depressing books this is a great pick i enjoyed the imagery the writer was able to create but i just could relate to the characters poetically speaking this book has moments of brilliants but i need rainbows","3684":" this book is phenomenal while somewhat failing at the same times the stories are exquisitely told and the devastation of poverty racism and oppression is apparent subtly and overtly throughout but it's structure of many disparate stories is challenging we learn how some of hattie's children eventually fare and nothing at all about others one story gathers momentum then another just falls flat i loved the writing the spirit of the novel and the depiction of hattie herself but in the end it felt like something was just missing a worthwhile read despite the structural difficulties with the novel","3685":"this is the third one i have read from the oprah list it is extremely powerful and 'sticks' to you well written and super depressing life story of a mom that tried to do her best at parenting but failed miserably we see it through the eyes of everyone in her life deep and moving","3686":"this beautifully written debut novel follows the life of hattie shepherd a young black woman who escapes the deep south in 1920's america seeking the promise of freedom and opportunity in philadelphia however as each tragic chapter unfolds we discover that the promises sought prove almost mythical the author leads us through sixty years of struggle viewed through the eyes of hattie's children this was an exceptional story and the character hattie is one i will not soon forget well done ayana mathis","3687":"well written however i felt like i've read these stories before and i needed more info about some characters","3688":"i was relieved to be done with this book the writing was beautiful and the scaffolding of the novel ingenious the story is told through the eyes of each of her children each chapter involves a different child or grandchild the characters are deeply flawed and maybe that's what made this so hard to read so much heartbreak and for most characters no redemption","3689":"i really enjoyed this book although parts of it were so hard for me to read the images of children suffering the words i could feel them","3690":"i really liked this book but it took a while to read the characters didn't connect and the book was very disjointed it did paint a good picture of the hardships of the times through several disjointed stories of the children of hattie i gave it a 4 because it was very well written but had a problem doing so as it was a book that didn't keep my attention from wondering and i keep waiting for it to finish","3691":"the book has a nice writing style and exposes issues i am unfamiliar with so for that i'll definitely give it a few stars the structure of the book 12 different short stories about 12 different characters which all are supposed to relate to the main character is interesting unfortunately because evey chapter is about somebody new there are times of disconnect and randomness it does sort of circle back so it's worth it to just keep reading","3692":"this book did not hang together as a novel each character had his her own story which encompassed a very small segment of their life some of the chapters were well written and moving a couple might have worked as a stand alone short story but as a whole it lacked unity or any real sense of family i never got to know any of the characters on more than a superficial level","3693":"a story of love and survival that transcends middle class conceptions of marriage and parenthood and provides insight into the true meaning of devotion","3694":" set in philadelphia each chapter was told from a different perspective over the course of several decades one of hattie's eleven children and one grandchild it was beautifully written but disjointed the stories never connected to each other it was simply told about a year in the life of each child we never saw how the children ended up where they were or for some if they ever got things straightened out i started off enchanted by the struggle of hattie and her husband but quickly became bored with the lack of development hattie was often presented as cold and unloving and it was only in very brief clips where we were introduced to her inner dialogue that we understood what her motivations really were the final chapter did finally show her turning things around and making a necessary change i was in tears in the very first chapter but that feeling of intensity was not maintained through the whole book and was a little disappointing i would have loved to see the stories more interwoven to see hattie have more a presence in the story ayana mathis's beautiful style was the only thing that held my attention","3695":" this promises to be a downer but i feel compelled to check out the hype beautiful writing but the structure of orbiting stories around one main character who is a peripheral presence in all but two or three of the chapters doesn't have the same pull for me as a more conventional novel narrative i don't care that much about hattie because she's barely there although my favorite chapters were the ones in the middle of the book in which she and her husband august figured prominently and surprisingly i didn't find it as depressing as the early reviews had me believe oh and i kind of hate that this book is being billed as a novel of the great migration okay fine hattie fled georgia and settled in philadelphia and other than one brief and poignant scene about her relatives coming north and getting harassed at a highway rest stop there isn't a whole lot of the migration tale here but maybe that's because isabel wilkerson's the warmth of other suns nonfiction already told those stories and told them so well","3696":"this book is well written and thoughtful i felt that the portrayal of each character interwoven with the life of hattie captured the true essence of her difficult life it was a heavy read with content that didn't lighten up at all","3697":"this was an intriguing book but i was disappointed that the characters never connected i was really surprised read disappointed with the way it ended felt as if the story just dropped off maybe that was by design to lead up to a sequel s in my opinion the only reason the book has gotten the attention it has it b c oprah has hyped it mind you i don't make my book selections based on oprah's recommendations","3698":"very well written not a happy book","3699":"very good engrossing and jaw dropping not long enough to tie everything up","3700":" in this debut novel mathis looks to celebrate the resilience of generations of black american women but for me it underlines their suffering and the dysfunctional lives that result from poverty persecution and prejudice hattie leaves the south for philadelphia as a pregnant sixteen year old over the next decades she has 11 children two of whom die in infancy and a grandchild the twelve 'tribes' of the title hattie's husband august is a well meaning but ineffectual man each of the chapters explores an aspect of the lives of one or more of hattie's children all of them tragic in some way some of the chapters are stereotypical but overall this set of connected stories strikes a truthful and compelling note","3701":" if i didn't live in a philadelphia suburb and regularly visit the city of philadelphia i probably would have rated this book 3 stars the additional appeal of geographic familiarity added to my enjoyment of the story many reviews comment on the ineffectiveness of the fractured quality of this novel i actually find this stylistic choice to be very effective at communicating the frustration that hattie and her family experience their lives are like so many separate strands that try as they may simply can't be weaved into the coherent story of the american dream that they so desperately wish to achieve","3702":"it was an interesting read but not as engaging as the author herself as seen on super soul sunday sad depressing thoughtful but not a book you can't put down not a book where you will miss the characters style similar to olive kittridge a book about which i have very similar thoughts and feelings","3703":" 4 5 stars the is was a beautifully written and profoundly sad story of hattie and her children i listened to 90% via audiobook until it expired via digital library and then i read the last two chapters and reread others the readers of the audiobook were terrific all of the chapters is about a different child or children except for one which is about a grandchild the stories weave together hattie's and august's her husband life together over 50 years the children's stories are haunting as they struggle to find their way in the world most are not successful meaning happy or settled even those who attain a comfortable financial existence while most of the stories are told through the eyes of the specific child there is no question of hattie's influence there is no joy or traditional happy ending yet at the end there was a sense that the next generation will have a better time making their way through life hattie and august had may obstacles most self imposed in their path and this had an impact on the children that said the parents and children while living in the north still faced the harsh reality of prejudice of the 50s 60s 70s and 80s the great migration turned out to be not so much a chance to escape the jim crow south which it certainly was as to enter a different form of discrimination an exceptional first novel for this author i look forward to more novels from ms mathis i do recommend this book but do not expect the stories to be tied up in a pretty little bow at the end","3704":"lived her tribes each one was so unique and loved in a different way it had a kinda depressing and sobering quality to it that i appreciated in a weird way","3705":"powerful storytelling written in the form of several short stories which together span a period of over six decades with the character of hattie shepherd being the connecting arc","3706":"i am having a hard time trying to decide how i really feel about this book i found myself liking something about each one of the characters but couldn't really get involved because the author goes from one child to another leaving me kind of hanging never really knowing what the end story was for any of them and there was at least one of the kids that i would have liked for them to have had their own story and they didn't wish the author would have at least maybe got them all together at the end to maybe give a and here's where they are now kind of thing but not sure even that would have done it all in all it was okay","3707":"i would give this 3 5 stars but we aren't allowed so 3 it is i liked this book but i didn't love it while the prose was beautifully written i think the structure of the book was what kept me at a distance since the author doesn't tell a typical linear story but instead employs a series of vignettes i felt somewhat disconnected from a few of the characters and not completely invested in their stories also i found some of the chapters more involving than others so overall the book was a bit uneven for me","3708":"2015 reading challenge a book with a number in the title books and beer book club july selection","3709":"perhaps even a four but i couldn't quite settle there i felt as if not every section a kind of vignette adding up to all the possibilities of spreading lineage not every section was as strong or maybe i needed them to curve around each other a bit more i can say this the first chapter is devastating and gorgeous and i held my young son in my lap rocked him to sleep as i read it of course i'd have him so vulnerable as i read about the struggling twins and i could feel those babies in my own arms there are some gorgeous moments of prose he felt panic scudding in his chest his anxiety was replaced with an ecstasy that spun in his chest like a ball of fire the soft shirring of the leaves a gold flare rose above the treetops and peacocked into a fan of light what i feel for sala has eclipsed anything i thought was love definitely grateful to this new voice looking forward to more","3710":"highly disappointing read i only finished this book because i wanted to attend the book club meeting at my local library the main character was a mean and cold mother and never changed i know enough mean women and prefer not to spend quality time reading about more women there was no hope or glimpse of improvement it was just another poor black story i know all elements of afro america life needs to be spotlighted but this novel added nothing to the story of afro am people","3711":"yes this book was heavy but it was also well written at times it was almost unbelievable that hattie's nine surviving children each had such serious deficits shortcomings and problems but i suppose that that was a result of having a mother rendered inept and cold by the grief of losing children","3712":" mathis is really a good writer she has to be because she has to develop meaningful characters giving each family member or so a chapter of this novel which is almost more a series of overlapping vignettes the many children introduced throughout exist almost solely within the confines of their own chapters which i found a tad odd although the reflections on a life full of loss and suffering of sacrifice and the cost of sacrifice of people born into poverty and the difficulty to rise above it of the role of stoic strong women and feckless irresponsible men often feel profound and not devoid of a ray of very occasional hope or happiness the author does not bring out much that is positive in this big poor dysfunctional family it is a sad dreary world that they inhabit and the portrait that emerges of the matriarch hattie is of a sad lonely woman who has left her children mainly an inheritance of loss and lack of love","3713":"s hattie it takes us through their shared trials and tribulations and how they experience the same situations differently based on their age we can see how racism and poverty impact a large family in disparate painful ways the writing in this book fits its subjects and makes them more relatable each chapter narrates the history of a child or grandchild of the title's hattie it takes us through their shared trials and tribulations and how they experience the same situation's differently based on their age we can see how racism and poverty impact a large family in disparate painful ways","3714":"when i requested this book from the library i did not realize it was an oprah book club selection i knew immediately it would be about a dysfunctional depressing family oprah seems to like those the story is about 15 year old hattie shepherd who flees georgia in 1923 to philadelphia to better her life she marries too young and to the wrong person and subsequently ends up with 9 children the book reads more like a collection of short stories each chapter is about one of hattie's children or grandchild with hattie's influence and actions affecting their lives i think the writing is excellent i love the descriptive word choice character development was great i feel each of the character's stories could be developed into a whole book i am especially curious about what six did later in life i did think the story lacked depth and it is probably because of the format of having each chapter be about another child with rare comments about the others","3715":"oprah got us again this book was horrible the titled should have been hattie's short stories had to press my way to get to the end","3716":"i liked this author's style i thought the different storylines were interesting enough but i felt like it ended abruptly i didn't like that many of the threads were left hanging and i never got to find out what happened to some of the characters","3717":"absolutely wonderfully written i did have an issue with all male characters being so irresponsible immature selfish also everything turns out so bad in spite of hattie's efforts pretty sad","3718":"well written heartbreaking and harsh slices of both hattie's life and her the lives of her children's the book covers more than 50 years i'd wished the stories didn't end so abruptly","3719":"this just didn't grab me in the first couple chapters so i decided to move on to another book too many good books i want to read","3720":"book on cd performed by andrele ojo bahni turpin and adam lazarre white in 1923 fifteen year old hattie shepherd along with her mother and sister left their georgia home for a new start north of the mason dixon line they thought they would find a better life in philadelphia but hattie got pregnant by and married a man who would prove to be a huge disappointment her first born twins die of an infection that a little penicillin might have cured hattie never gets over their loss but raises her other nine children with grit and determination if not much tenderness the novel is told in twelve chapters each detailing the story of one of hattie's children or grandchildren over six decades and reads more like a collection of short stories than a cohesive novel with a single story arc the book jacket implies that mathis based the novel on the history of the great migration when african americans fled the deep south for the hope of better jobs in the north some prospered finding good factory jobs on which salaries they could support a growing family some floundered succumbing to the temptations of the big city streets gambling juke joints and drinking some of them returned to the south but because she focuses on this one dysfunctional family she loses the larger picture i like the way that mathis uses the stories of hattie's eleven children and one grandchild to illustrate so many possibilities in one family especially when including hattie's sisters pearl and marion there are huge disparities in fortune - a professional man who owns his own business contrasted with a woman facing eviction for nonpayment of rent some of them find solace in religion some seek it in the bottle some have strong marriages others seem incapable of forming any lasting relationship i found myself angry with several of the characters for their lack of integrity or ambition or motivation and yet i understood that poverty can result in isolation and hopelessness i know too that the issues facing these characters - sexual identity mental illness poverty abandonment discrimination marital infidelity - are difficult to handle when you have a strong support network and virtually impossible to overcome when you are emotionally isolated this is mathis' debut novel and i see evidence of a great writing talent i'll probably read another book by her but at the end of this novel i find myself struggling to explain my reactions to the book as much as hattie's children struggled to make a good life after being raised by such seemingly uncaring parents the audio version is performed by three talented voice artists andrele ojo bahni turpin and adam lazarre white i think this contributed to the feeling that this was a collection of stories rather than a novel","3721":"this book was a disappointment reviews made it sound interesting and good it was not it was choppy the story did not flow or connect and at the end you are left thinking hmm what was all that about a waste of my time i do not recommend it","3722":"a very powerful book with some hard hitting themes i liked the structure and found it enabled me to reflect and ponder continuously whilst reading it also provided pace and structure to what could have otherwise been an overwhelming family saga the characters were incredibly well drawn and their stories interweave magnificently to highlight the true love hattie bestows upon all her family throughout her life as a wife mother and grandmother","3723":"powerful subtle emotional and memorable hard to believe it is a first novel by this author","3724":"this book can be devastating but it's also beautiful","3725":"i am always leery of oprah's picks hence prepared myself for disappointment when i picked up this book twelve tribes is actually surprisingly good i liked that each chapter is devoted to one of hattie's children the reader gets to know a little bit more about hattie the sacrifices she made and the reasons why love is so difficult for her for a debut novel i applaud ayana mathis and look forward to reading another book by this author","3726":" as other reviewers have mentioned this is a difficult book to like or categorize there certainly are some lyrical passages the book is structured like faulkner's as i lay dying shifting from narrator to narrator as a mother remembers her children and children remember their childhood the biblical allusion in the title isn't well developed hattie's children don't go on to create a nation or even in most cases have children the things that happen are tragic painful yet don't always create sympathy in the reader the first chapter has a 17 year old hattie trying to save her twin babies from pneumonia in 1925 she is unsuccessful and of course that tragedy colors her relationship with her subsequent children unlike faulkner mathis makes it hard to see each of these children and one grandchild as part of a coherent family their experiences are too diverse one child is a successful jazz musician but another child isn't allowed to take free music lessons siblings do often have very different versions of their childhood but that isn't discussed or made clear in this novel i never found a theme beyond life is hard","3727":"gorgeously written best book i have read in ages","3728":"oprah's high praise made me immediately get this book however during the one hour interview the terrible misery and sadness was never mentioned i could not deal with it and of the 55 pages i read the writing was good but not fabulous like oprah said","3729":"beautiful so many powerful moments articulated beautifully i could have done without oprah's commentary in the e book version sorry oprah","3730":"a very powerful well written book","3731":" i felt as if i were not connected much to hattie i can sympathize with the death of her twins but then cannot sympathize with her somewhat showing of indifference toward her living children perhaps her character was not developed enough so i couldn't relate to her only with that daughter who almost lets herself die does hattie show tenderness each child had such a tragic life why their lack of a happy childhood what was the emotional benefit of hattie moving north i mean it is obvious that it gave them choices but they didn't do so well with those choices maybe that is the point","3732":"this book was well written but it was just so hopeless starts out sad and just gets sadder and for me a big thing that was missing was the connections between characters i understand that each sibling gets a chance to tell their own story but it seems weird that there wouldn't be more crossover between characters who grew up in the same house with the same parents anyway i did definitely like parts of it and i never wanted to stop reading but i was hoping for a more redeeming ending","3733":" favorite quotes it seemed to him that every time he made one choice in his life he said no to another all of those things he could not do or be were huddled inside him they might spring up at any moment and he would be hobbled with regret she put all the blame on august she never for one minute stopped thinking he was the cause of every bad thing that ever was and he never stopped hoping that one morning he would wake up and prove her wrong if she would stop hating him for one day one hour he'd have the strength to do the right thing by her this was the life they had nobody could ever know it like they did they owed it to each other to stay together that was their bond though it was also true that when assembled the family put her in mind of a group of roaming solitary creatures rounded up and caged together like captured leopards nobody ever thinks he's going to become one of those failed men those bums that normal people won't make eye contact with ashy old men with cirrhosis and matted hair and a room in a flophouse and nobody ever thinks i didn't before i got sissy's letter that those old men probably have wives and children who have had to forget them","3734":"excellent story of life lived hard expertly told tale woven throughout the story of each of hattie's children the author gives you insight into hattie throughout and how the children grew to become the people they did i highly recommend this book","3735":"this book is basically a collection of related short stories it's an interesting way to tell the tale of one particular african american family over about 60 years good quick read","3736":" this is not a feel good novel i'm usually okay with that none of the characters are likeable i'm usually okay with that most chapters are written about a different character with hattie as a common bond i'm usually okay with that it might be the combination of all three of those things or something else but this book just didn't do it for me i never felt pulled to pick it up and putting it down was very easy in the end it left me feeling unsatisfied i wanted to know more about the characters and how if they evolved i was saddened by every single character's story lots of survivors but no thrivers hattie's tribes were very damaged no doubt because hattie herself was very damaged i would have to think long and hard before reading another book by this author","3737":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a tough book to rate i wanted longer chapters about each character and more insight why did all of the children turn out so terrible was it because of hattie's coldness is it really hattie's fault that she had no love to give because she was a mule from 17 44 what was the author's point i needed some perseverance and overcoming of hardships the characters had hard times and lots of mental illnesses","3738":"i started reading this book before i realized that oprah had it on her new updated book club and i still liked it hattie has 12 children and she is tough with them all each chapter of this book is about a different child and their lives and how their mother affected them i actually enjoyed this book more at the beginning than the end i t was a really good read but i think it kind of faded near the end but hatiie always had a hold on her kids","3739":"the twelve tribes of hattie was a powerful first novel for ayana mathis though i felt some stories deserved two chapters to flesh out the characters more by the end of the story mathis plot development made sense to me i did not like that alice and billups chapters were combined into one because i personally needed the back story of who was thomas and why hattie had her children over there in the first place but i gave it 4 stars because it was definitely a page turner mathis' writing was riveting and so powerful that the trauma in the story caused me pain and i had to close the book at points to give myself respite i also enjoyed the nuanced ways that mathis integrated race class colorism the great migration gender sexuality motherhood u0026amp fatherhood family relations the list could go on i am looking forward to her next novel","3740":"i loved the idea of different perspectives of mother by her children and it reinforced to me that you never really know what a person has been through unless they choose to share it so be kind to everyone","3741":"one thought kept coming to me birth control this was a very sad read the writing was poetic at times broken parents have broken children","3742":"too relentlessly down","3743":"i actually did like this one although at some points it was hard to \"like\" because of all the sadness and heartbreak the characters experienced i enjoyed reading the individual threads about the children but i was hoping the author would bring it all together at some point in the book as for the ending i wasn't a huge fan and thought it was rather abrupt","3744":"rating 3 5 stars pretty good read and some beautiful language just hard to keep the momentum going in a novel that shifts characters every chapter but i still thought thy story came full circle with hattie and august","3745":"the book is beautifully written however it did not endings to each child's plight for instance the oldest son has strong attraction and romantically linked to men and although they gave some reasons this part of the story did not give any ending to what happened later on his life each chapter about hattie's children gave insight to her as a mother and their family life this book was likeable but their endings are missing","3746":" this is not my typical reading fare but i did it for the book club some seriously beautiful writing but many chapters i read every other sentence because they were so painful i have a difficult time with books like this the characters get in my brain and i worry about them long after the book is over though with this book whose main character was the time period the vignettes of the children of hattie were merely a vehicle to describe it i might usually be unsatisfied with not having some wrap up on each character but in mathis' book i felt like it was appropriate because as i said before they merely to me painted the picture of who hattie was slash became and of the period of time that shaped her and thus her family good book but i hope i get to choose our book club's next selection","3747":"i liked some of it but overall it read like a writing exercise not a book","3748":" this is the story of a family after they migrate from georgia to philly in the 1920s with hopes for a new life the center of this story is the character of hattie mother of nine children that she raises in extreme poverty and martial strife through the force of her own will hattie is a complicated matriarch that casts a long shadow over the lives of her children she is cold devoted proud restless and crushed by love and obligation her character is wonderful and develops throughout the book the chapters in the book are narrated by different family members with her as the common thread and some were better than others it felt like a series of short stories although there were some that were so powerful and heartbreaking i could barely read them","3749":" if half stars were possible this book would get 2 5 because half of it was okay and the other half i disliked on many levels i appreciate that mathis wanted to capture the effect of the great migration on three generations of one family but many pieces of the book were poorly executed and overly contrived the two chapters in first person franklin's and cassie's were barely readable their voices rang hollow and inorganic their emotions and responses were almost comical due to their poorly written portions cassie's chapter in particular should have never made it past the first edit in its published condition on a more positive note i really liked hattie she was believable she was real she had a reason to be the way she was the rest of the family receives little sympathy from me one aspect of the novel i particularly enjoyed was mathis's masterful use of scents and smells as emotional triggers for her characters her descriptions of these sensations were particularly well crafted and served as a creative unifying motif overall i like the premise i like the main character i dislike the execution the book maintains its three stars because of hattie mathis's idea and effort and three of the chapters being very well done the twins' ruthie's and ella's","3750":"the structure of this novel was interesting as each chapter introduced one or two of hattie's children and then they were not really relevant beyond their specific chapter it was really a series of short stories with a common thread running through them after i accepted that it wasn't going to read like a novel i began to enjoy it not was i was expecting but fine writing nonetheless","3751":"an amazing book with the backdrop of the great migration in the book we hear hattie's story of coming north and then the stories of her eleven children and one grandchild she begins by telling us of the death of her twin infant babies her first two children philadelphia and jubilee she broke my heart as hers was broken i didn't want to read any more but i did and i'm glad it was excellent","3752":" what did i think i'm still thinking feeling absoluted bogged down with second grade common core standards i decided i needed to start reading something else and stretch my mind i sent out bookclub invitations and put mathis' twelve tribes of hattie at the top of my list there is so much buzz online she's on oprah's bookclub list and she is 39 and from brooklyn the fact that she's my age and her debut novel is on the bestseller's list made me want to jump right in i was not disappointed the story of hattie and her migration from the tortured south of the past to philadelphia in the 1900s searching for something beautiful the hope of a better tomorrow the story opens with a sorrow that remains throughout the novel the hatred hurt betrayal and pain she carries with her on the journey to the so called new land never leaves the promise of a whole new world was plagued with disappointments after each chapter i would envision hattie this beautiful woman so coarse and cracked a vessel cracked in so many ways yet still holding together the matriarch of the shepherd tribe tending to and leading her people with a quiet strength and a committed deep yet broken hearted love the love that acts in tangible ways to do only what love can or would do but a love that sometimes doesn't allow others to feel or see it until too late if ever i wanted more and was disappointed by the way some story lines abruptly came to an end that said this book had a haunting effect and imparted beautiful lessons that all should be mindful of be careful how we love and fight with your all to remain whole the world is harsh and is waiting to swallow pieces of you pieces that you need not just for your survival but for the survival of others the others that dare to love you favorite quotes hattie wanted to give her babies names that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in georgia so she gave them names of promise and of hope reaching forward names not looking back ones philadelphia and jubilee maybe we have only a finite amount of love to give we're born with our portion and if we love and are not loved enough in return it's depleted \" they were companions mother and children equally vulnerable and yearning drifting through days together even now that floyd was a grown man there was an understanding between him and his mother and hattie was the only person in this whole world with whom floyd was serene he missed her stillness floyd it seemed to him that every time he made one choice in his life he said no to another all of those things he could not do or be were huddled inside of him they might spring up at any moment and he would be hobbled with regret lawrence and hattie i make a point of seeing the sunset even if i am on duty i go on deck to watch the sky darken into twilight it helps me remember that this strange place is still the earth and i am still on it he came across a poem he liked so much that he read it night after night this is the hour of lead remembered if outlived he couldn't recall the title or any more than those two lines it seemed to him that he could never get a proper grip on any of the beauty in this world drowning doesn't look how you think it would do you understand what i'm saying to you hattie to lawrence he had so much power that he could afford to share it had to share it or it would explode in him he could be kind if only for that hour because he was if only for that single hour strong six i won't stand here and tell you what you should do but i want you to know that this ain't that ella ain't suffering and she ain't dying we had that pain hattie and we'll have this too but you got to understand it ain't the same thing august to hattie i feel such heartbreak for august too you're coming back tomorrow right bell to hattie yes girl hattie to bell#thosesundaynights i will probably have more to share as the days pass and i meet with friends to discuss this book","3753":"three words sum this book up beautiful painful heartbreaking","3754":"beautifully written but structurally disjointed i like short stories and this could have been just that trying to connect all the stories through hattie make it a novel technically but it feels incomplete trying to pass itself off as one complete story i actually found each chapter or short story quite compelling certainly not boring and quite a quick read but now i feel unsatisfied","3755":" although i only gave this book 3 stars i still do recommend it the author has a real gift for crafting beautiful multi layered prose imagery woven together with emotion and sensation when she has it it is breathtaking but she is inconsistent her technique of giving one chapter to each of hattie's children is an interesting literary device but i often found myself forgetting important details about characters who were mentioned very briefly in the beginning and didn't get fleshed out until much later in the book the novel uses hattie's family to illustrate very well the great migration and the devastating effects of poverty racism and lack of access to medical care sadly hattie's children all felt a sense of isolation even when they were surrounded by others as the reader i knew that they might have been able to reach out to others for support but they either didn't know they could or they didn't want to let anyone know that they needed help the struggles each character faces in this story give readers much to think about","3756":"the characters were not developed but the moral was anybody can change for the better","3757":"great book i was able to visualize the characters in all their uniqueness i look forward to reading future novels by ayana mathis","3758":"it's going to take me awhile to digest this book it was powerful and disturbing","3759":"i loved this story hattie a strong survivor who can never quite opens her heart to her many children after losing her first born twins at an early age her life comes full circle through a lot of pain and anguish reminds me a little of the help in the sense of the struggles of african americans in the 20th century a good read","3760":"it took me a long time to finish this book the writing is impeccable the author has an amazingly fresh voice the reason for the two stars is i just couldn't buy into the characters i guess this sort of novel just isn't my cup of tea","3761":" got it this weekend and already 2 3 of the way through immediately engaging and riveting sad themes and a unique structure that apparently annoyed some reviewers but i'm just in awe of the beauty and power of the writing structure and scope update finished it this am before heading to work the last third wasn't as strong partially because at that point it just seems incredible that each child would be so deeply hurt or confused and it starts to read like a laundry list of mental illness however it is still a powerful and well written book and one that kept my interest throughout based on the reviews i read after finishing the book it seems like people who disliked it disliked it for one of two reasons 1 it's bleak this much is true and or 2 the structure only allow for brief glimpses into the lives of some characters while i definitely understand reviewers who are frustrated we don't learn more about each section child to me this only shows the skill of the author that we have so much interest in every person introduced especially when she has so little time to capture our interest while not every section was even i remain in awe of the authors skill and compassion and will be thinking about some of the characters even after i've returned the book to the library","3762":" excellent book and a great first choice from oprah's new book club it tells of the migration of hattie shepherd and her no good husband august from prejudiced georgia to the more enlightened philadelphia however they encounter almost insurmountable difficulties there hattie starts out as a warm loving woman which changes upon the deaths of her twins to a more stoic inaccessible woman she goes on to give birth to nine more children who end up calling her the general the book relates hattie's story as well as those of her nine children who end up damaged and fragile due to their upbringing the book is beautifully lyrical intermingling the stories of these nine children and how they manage the minefields of their lives and their tenuous connections to their mother i highly recommend this novel and it may end up being the best book i read in 2013","3763":"wowowowow this debut novel had astonishing pull there was something bone deep compelling about the structure and rhythm and pace of mathis' storytelling i loved it as haunting and deeply melancholic as it was it made me very happy in the reading","3764":" where do i began i understand why this book was a oprah book club selection it introduces an interesting perspective on black motherhood and the great migration somehow motherhood in this novel is both freedom and bondage for a light skinned black women who grows up in the south only to move to the north in hope of something new and fulfilling the overall story is an interesting one but i can't say i enjoyed the writing always good book to read alongside warmth of other suns it does add another layer to our understanding of the great migration","3765":"interesting read great writing however each story was too dark","3766":"i listened for over an hour and did not find enough to make me want to continue i may try the print version","3767":"it was hard for me to get into but once i did i really liked it the writing is good and the characters are intriguing what amazed me most was that just like her children i wanted to know more about hattie and to feel that she can love a good read but better to think of it as short stories than a novel","3768":"although this book was well written i found it terribly depressing i understand that black women and men have struggled and dealt with the issues presented in the book such as losing children and having gay children or ones with mental problems perhaps there are those like hattie who dealt with all of them during their live times after reading a couple chapters i dreaded thinking what was going to happen next also there weren't any characters that i liked if the purpose of this book is to show how awful someone's life can be it certainly accomplished it","3769":"extremely well written with a range of voices and experiences very intense strong characters and lots of unexpected turns but relentless darkness and suffering i would have liked a little more light hope and happiness here and there easy to see why oprah chose this book","3770":"some stories were more captivating than others","3771":" having taught creative writing for 39 years perhaps this book best exemplifies what is so hard to teach how to write memorable 3d breathing and feeling characters i especially loved how each of hattie's children's chapters developed not only the child but also hattie hattie is the real heroine of this book i'll never forget her beauifully written i suppose there's not enough plot line for some readers but for me it was all about hattie and her children who they were what they became how they evolved","3772":"absolutely loved this book","3773":"hattie leaves georgia for philadelphia at a young age with her mother and sisters hoping for a tester life she marries augustwho never does anything to better their lives this is a novel set into short stories about hattie and and nine children what she deals with every day and how her children viewed her and what happened to them later in life it","3774":"the stories of hattie and her children are entertaining but forgettable the book just doesn't live up to the hype","3775":" this novel is actually more like a series of interwoven short stories focusing on the various children of the central character hattie although most of the stories are riveting in and of themselves none of the individual characters are adequately developed nor are the relationships between the siblings particularly well defined more disappointingly hattie herself is a rather shadowy figure not coming together well into one cohesive portrait from the depictions of her rendered by her offspring there are simply too many points of view at work here tearing the narrative in many directions and mathis would have probably done better to focus on only a few of the children as her main characters fans of the help by kathryn stockett will doubtlessly be interested to read the twelve tribes of hattie but will not necessarily find this tale as moving or articulate","3776":"i honestly expected more from this novel given all the buzz around it although i certainly do not harbor any ill will against it it was pretty much run of the mill and nothing special","3777":"this book was well written and full of characters i cared about heartbreaking real and not always pretty this family left me wanting to know more about them their pains and theirs hopefully eventual triumphs in the end i was left with hattie opening up to tenderness expressing her love i suppose i must be content with that","3778":"an expertly woven story that tells the life of one woman through the lives of her people her children husband lover and grandchild as well as her own story gives insight into the struggles of families who went through the great migration of african americans moving north in the mid 20th century to escape brutal racisim and jim crow laws of the south more of an intimate memoir than historical though powerful","3779":"f mathis a cheryl's rating 3 starsthis is a dark and challenging book that leaves the reader hoping for any break from social dysfunction poverty or adultery reading much like a collection of short stories it chronicles the lives of the central character hattie's twelve children while it is beautifully written it's tough to get through all of the harsh stories if you really need something to wallow in this might be a good pick","3780":"i wanted to love this book i did when i started it but when i finally got back to finish it and read through it i did not in fact like the structure of the book there were some powerful moments and some good chapters but the book itself felt very disconnected there was a strand that unified the stories but it was a relationship nothing was developed in this connection","3781":"it's not exactly a novel and not exactly short stories i wasn't sure if i would like the format but the author is so skilled that i did these are an affecting set of lives and it seems no one gets a happy ending a nuanced look at one family and the consequences of living and loving in particular ways","3782":"i'm still mulling over a review but there is some really powerful emotive writing going on i did find some chapters a little contrived but i certainly like that each chapter is a short story with just some common characters namely hattie in each","3783":"this felt more like a series of short stories than it did a novel each chapter focused on a different character in a different living in a different decade representing a different experience the commonality they're all family unfortunately however they are not related and their relationships with one another and their mother hattie aren't developed enough to bind them","3784":"this one is difficult to rate very well written but each chapter is dedicated to one or two of hattie's children we never learn of their fate and the book ends as abruptly the chapters paint a picture of the great migration and the difficulties faced by those in the north and south at the time but i wonder if the book would have been that much better if it had focused on hattie rather than a chapter a child","3785":"we see the life of the mother of 11 children unfold as told through the adult child in a chapter very interesting way to tell the story as the reader constructs the mother's physical and emotional development using the eyes and thoughts of her own children this tale surprised me and i actually had to look up some things which i always enjoy as it expands your knowledge engrossing and well written albeit not a happy ever after ending","3786":"interesting how so many people coming from the same home can end up so different as grown ups otherwise not that interesting","3787":"interesting snapshots of separate but linked lives in random moments in time read like short stories","3788":" not the best book i have ever read the author had opportunity to tug at the readers heart but failed hopelessly of all eleven children and one granddaughter everybody in this novel was dysfunctional not a single one had anything 'normal' about them evidently it was a collection of short stories that the author stuck together and it sure read like it not one cohesive story that related to the other i thought is give oprah book club another try same results as before never never never again","3789":"each chapter reads like a short story chronicling the life of one of hattie's children","3790":"i expected to love this book and when i did not i thought maybe the problem was choosing an audio version instead of print the book seemed so disjointed and difficult to follow that if i were reading it in print i would have been going back a lot to figure out who the characters were and how they related to the others and therein lies a lot of the issue i have with this while the writing is excellent at times there is little that ties the story told in each chapter with the chapters that have gone before as each chapter tells about the life of one of hattie's children i expected to see the development of one story with continuity and with characters who are developed throughout this was not the case and left me unsure in each chapter how these particular characters fit into the overall story or what connections they had to each other taking each chapter as a totally separate entity so that this reads more like very loosely connected short stories is a better approach to take however each chapter is so depressing that i can't really recommend that others read this even if they change their expectations i did give this book three stars because i think this writer is very talented much of her writing demonstrates an excellent skill and i would try something else by her i also have to say the narrators in this audio version were excellent","3791":"i immediately heard toni morrison's voice reading this book to me that's not a huge surprise since i am simultaneously listening to morrison narrating her audiobook beloved however i was surprised when i flipped to the acknowledgments and saw morrison's name listed there are similarities in the writing styles but the twelve tribes of hattie is much more likable and is easier to read at first glance the book is organized simply each chapter is in chronological order and is dedicated to one or two of hattie's offspring but it's actually quite sophisticated because of the way each chapter carefully reveals more about the family and hattie herself it makes me curious about the order in which the book was written and if she shuffled the chapters to get it right i normally read books set well before i was born but i liked how this book started in the 50's and worked it's way into the 80's it made the characters more relatable knowing they would have been alive when i was young","3792":"incredible superb every second of this novel was breathtaking from the use of language detail and ability to use story telling both in narrative form and what would be described as 'passing down' stories in african american culture the novel is powerful and the structure is incredible ayana mathis is brilliant","3793":"goddamn i loved this family drama i just want to know where they are now","3794":"very interesting format with each chapter about a person in hattie's life for me this was a glimpse into another life so unlike mine the characters are deeply flawed and struggling but somehow there is hope for something to come out better provocative","3795":"another depressing oprah read agree with others that this book reads more like a series of short stories characters are related to one woman descriptive and well written but so very sad","3796":"this was a good read by a new author for me it was a little slow in some parts but it kept my interest to the end","3797":" this is more like a series of vignettes than a novel the common bound is the family relationship hattie and august married young go through life with little joy this is reflected in the stories of their surviving 12 children they are all dysfunctional sad and isolated there wasn't a character to like in this novel i am surprised that oprah listed this book in her book club she has always maintained that one has to take responsibility for their actions and not let past failures and tragedies pull you down but that is exactly what hattie and august do as a result their children are also negatively effected not sure i would recommend this book","3798":"loved this the first chapter was so heartbreaking the chapters on floyd and six were a bit rocky for me but after that i loved the book more and more with each chapter several of the chapters reveal a lot about hattie's character and being able to compare what the reader knows about hattie's backstory with what she is like from the perspectives of her various children and granddaughter makes for a very compelling read the ending of the book was absolutely perfect as well","3799":"i was wrapped up in all the of character's short comings goings and all the drama that ensued in their lives i couldn't stop reading until i was finished","3800":"i really liked this book it was set near where i grew up in germantown section of philadelphia i would describe it more as interweaving stories than a novel it is powerful and heartbreaking and would appeal to men and women","3801":"heartbreaking even by oprah book club standards thought provoking on many levels parenting self awareness and mental health education privilege and american history","3802":"not impressed tries too hard to be a faulkner classic but too disjointed","3803":"so far loving this novel in stories one of the best books i've read this year one of the best books i've read in a long while shameful it's not been nominated for a slew of awards and won at least one","3804":"great story telling i really enjoyed this good recommendation from olivia","3805":"very emotional read some part were hard to read but i'm happy with my furst oprah book club selection","3806":" immigration may have built modern america but migrations have shaped it from the push to the western frontier to the people uprooted by the dust bowl as told in steinbeck's the grapes of wrath the american population has been on the move ayana mathis' extraordinary debut novel the twelve tribes of hattie is the story of this migration - but it's not a historian's telling the titular twelve tribes are the eleven children and one grandchild of hattie shepherd who leaves georgia in 1925 as a 17 year old bride and moves to philadelphia with its cruel winters but potentially brighter future excerpt from full review at for books' sake","3807":" from jacket in 1923 fifteen year old hattie shepherd flees georgia and settles in philadelphia hoping for a chance at a better life instead she marries a man who will bring her nothing but disappointment and watches helplessly as her firstborn twins succumb to an illness a few pennies could have prevented hattie gives birth to nine more children whom she raises with grit and mettle and not an ounce of the tenderness they crave she vows to prepare them for the calamitous difficulty they are sure to face in their later lives to meet a world that will not love them a world that will not be kind captured here in twelve luminous narrative threads their lives tell the story of a mother's monumental courage and the journey of a nation","3808":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was a very quick read it was interesting in the way that the each chapter described a different child or children of hattie and hattie was described through the children i read it quickly but didn't love it it was sad to think that a family with nine children had absolutely no successes only a couple of the children had children of their own and all of hattie's children had major issues and struggles","3809":"not my favorite book it was dreary and honestly what was the point","3810":"this book is so beautifully written every paragraph is a work of art the beauty of the prose juxtaposed with the depressing subject matter makes reading the book an experience rather than just a story mathis is a talented writer it's a very creative descriptive and interesting re telling of a pivotal time in history","3811":" this is the story of hattie shepherd as revealed through the lives of her children almost a novel in short stories the connecting thread is family hattie is part of the migration fleeing the south in the 1920s for better opportunities and a better life in the north after becoming a mother at seventeen and losing her firstborn twins to pneumonia hattie's outlook shifts and her attitude is reflected in her parenting as the troubles and challenges hattie and her children face are told her strength and desire for more for the next generation is revealed","3812":" usually i really like the books in oprah's book club and i had high hopes for this one i did enjoy it but my main problem with the book is that there really was no ending no resolving of any of the problems or issues the people in the book faced you were introduced to a lot of interesting characters with different personalities but it seemed as though i only received a tiny piece of every person's story and actually for the most part the connections between them were not explored either i just felt a little let down when i finished the book","3813":"listened to this on audio maybe i would've liked it better if i'd read it but it didn't seem to contain much of a plot to me and i didn't find myself caring about any of the characters","3814":"i wanted more from this book there is a lot of drama without a lot of depth and many interesting events and characterizations that are left unexplored","3815":"this book was so full of vivid language it didn't take much effort to paint a picture of the scene as the array of characters progressed though their respective tragedies i became more emotionally entangled with the story trying to figure out how hattie the mother and main character had the strength to survive it all beautifully written and moving","3816":" i just finished this book on my kindle and reading on a kindle definitely changes the way i experience reading i liked it but did not love it i found the chapters disconnected i also found it hard to remember which child was which and given that i was reading on a kindle i could not flip back to the first chapters to remind myself of who was who in birth order and i would have loved a final chapter tying all the previous chapters together when i finished the book i asked myself what was i supposed to learn from this book another dysfunctional family more dysfunctional kids but each child and hattie was appealing in his her own way and i truly loved their individual stories i just wish i didn't have to do all the work in trying to connect them","3817":"really liked the book just wanted more from the ending","3818":"i was disappointed each of the stories were more desolate than the previous one a much better book which she credits is the warmth of other suns a non fiction account of black migration like this book it focuses on several stories of people with more detail and background information","3819":"hattie shepherd see the irony in her name is the mother of short stories oh sorry of 11 children this is after all one of oprah's recommendations not so much a book about the great migration read warmth of other suns for that discussion it's more about the relationship between parents and children that may or may not exist","3820":"going to read this despite the fact that's it's oprah the great migration fascinates me well that was depressing not a single character to care about and this was not the great migration that i know about not reccommended","3821":" i was originally drawn to this book because it appeared in so many book reviews and was listed as an oprah book i'm so glad i took the time to read it a rich story full of colorful and unique characters gives a reflective insight to what life was like for poor black families after the emancipation proclamation hattie her sister and her mother headed north like many blacks did at the time although there are som flashbacks to her youth the majority of this story takes place from the time hattie got married this book captures in depth hatties life as a married woman with many mouths to feed hattie has a loving and yet unreliable husband and many children with many problems and issues the chapters of the book go in great detail about her children one chapter and one child at a time the story disects what it is like to live in a family on the edge of survival during a very hard time in american history hattie is a complex character that for some reason is easy to relate to in her most human stregths and weakness","3822":"i tried hard to stick with this book i only finished it because i kept hoping there will be more to the story each chapter is about one of hattie's children and through it all what links them is hattie the matriarch of a large family who has endured various trials and tribulations in life the disappointing thing about this book is that the each story does not quite have a conclusion indeed the chapters have little connection besides hattie","3823":"my real issue with this book was that i didn't want the some of the stories to end some of hattie's children were described so beautifully such as her young son who became a preacher that i wish she explored in further depth on the other hand some stories felt superfluous in all i would recommend this book as a worthy read i really got the sense of hattie's strength and resolve she may not have been a traditionally loving mother nor comfortable with affection but she kept her children fed and as healthy as she was able","3824":"my kind of book generational epic she can write my only frustration was that i wanted more some of the stories left off and didn't pick back up it was beautifully written","3825":"i was a bit disappointed with this book each child was a chapter in the book and althought i like hattie in some ways i didn't care for her in other ways this is the story of hattie her husband august and her family i enjoyed some of the stories more than others and just felt a bit dissatisfied with some i thought that what happened to the children was left up in the air and after all the detail in the book it just ended abruptly there were lots of times i felt confused with the story and where it was going","3826":" at first i wasn't sure how i felt about the book being told from different perspectives i assumed the book would circle back around to each character but instead it felt more like a compilation of short stories where the characters only had one chapter to tell their side of things nonetheless mathis is a superb writer whose words i enjoyed savoring and for a speed reader like me it means a lot when i'm inspired to linger over every word i'm wanting to buy this book so i can read it again even more slowly this time for that reason it definitely deserves 5 stars","3827":"there were some interesting and moving parts but overall i found it to be kind of depressing","3828":"it was certainly well written but it was one of those books where its hard to like anyone feel bad for them yes empathize with what they struggle with certainly but actually like not so much","3829":"really enjoyed this book each chapter is about one of hattie's eleven children but doesn't tell their whole story just enough so that the reader knows who they are some really great passages that make you think first book for this author i'd read more would be a good book club book","3830":"this book was good but it was hard to follow in some places when the narrative lines switched the first chapter made my heart hurt for hattie and i was drawn to her character i felt that liking ripped away by the end of the next few chapters and by the end of the novel i thoroughly disliked her there was so much pain tragedy and outright victimization both real and imagined in the minds of the characters themselves that i feel very drained emotionally after reading this book","3831":"no real story line hard to follow each chapter not well connected to the next","3832":"the book jumped around in time and only gave snippets of each character's life i would have liked some more cohesiveness but the individual stories were interesting","3833":"i really enjoyed this book i love seeing the perspective of this strong woman and how she dealt with life's trials as seen through the eyes of her children in some ways i was left wanting to know more","3834":"excellent i was engaged the whole way through each story was fascinating and deep i loved it","3835":"i usually am disappointed in oprah's book selections but i really liked this book","3836":"i found this book difficult to get into but when stepped back and thought of it as a series of short stories then i liked it better it is a dark vision of the black diaspora from the south and tbe portrait of hattie is so angry and destructive that it is difficult to feel sympathy for her","3837":" original review posted at my blog http ararebit wordpress com 2013 02 mathis takes a unique approach towards understanding one woman through the diverse life experiences of her twelve children more like a collection of short stories than a novel per se each chapter spans a period of one child's life some are intimately intertwined with hattie their mother and some mention her only briefly throughout mathis meditates on survival race relations love and motherhood during the great migration in 1900's america the author knows how to go for the gut since the novel is so character driven with each character's flaws and inner conflicts laid lyrically bare the novel thrums with emotion especially poignant vignettes focus on a tormented young man who wonders if his remarkable preaching abilities are a gift or a curse a mother gone mad and a sailor who wishes he were a good person but is too weak to behave righteously i wished though for more continuity and a true plot arc after each chapter i wanted to hear more about that person's life and story perhaps if mathis had framed her novel with a bookend structure pairing each chapter with a corresponding one later on or if she had interwoven her characters' lives i would have felt more coherence instead i moved on to the next half tale and the next","3838":"i finished it that is the good part what a downer of a book","3839":"the book is beautifully written but horribly depressing thanks oprah","3840":" some of the writing was brilliant however the book did not hang together left too many hanging questions about what happened to many characters character development was weak not much hope in the book it might have been helpful for the author tie in more history to better explain why characters all seemed to be so highly flawed i felt that the disjointed chapters with each chapter focusing on one character did not work well needed some better editing to tie the story together better we read this for my book club we had a great discussion over the book one of our book club members had lived in black community for years and was able to reflect on her past experiences","3841":"just finished reading the twelve tribes of hattie and i loved this book i like how each chapter was set up and written a masterful piece of work and i can't wait to read more from the author","3842":"i think this book deserves more than three stars but not quite four i enjoyed the way it was composed each chapter was dedicated to different character so it felt more like i was reading a collection of short stories instead of a novel it all begins and ends with hattie and her character is strong as it is flawed and i loved it","3843":"the concept of dreams crushed runs rampant throughout hattie's grief affects the totality of herself ach what a mess","3844":"i decided to read this book when i received numerous recommendations based on books that i had previously read when my local library received the book i was really excited however that excitement soon became disappointment after only reading the first four chapters i decided to give up i felt there was too much unnecessary information and i felt hattie's character wasn't well developer i do wish anaya mathis the best and congratulations on her success","3845":"did not finish so much negativity main characters with few redeming qualities i have better ways to spend my time","3846":"i tried to like this book i really did it was just too depressing even though the characters were related i struggled to link the stories together in any meaningful fashion","3847":"depressing no hope if you want to read a book where there is absolutely nothing uplifting this will be perfect for you just horrible i kept thinking somehow it was going somewhere surely it would all tie together nope all disjointed paints a picture of a struggling miserable women and her many broken children can not recommend","3848":"all of this time she had been wanting to die and wanting someone to die with her and she'd thought walter was perfect because most of what was human in him had already been killed by the time she met him this is the writing i love ayana delivers this story in such a great way very hard to turn away from","3849":"amazing still thinking about it highly reccomend","3850":"parts were beautifully written but the book simply wasn't able to do any character justice including especially hattie just too many stories and no character development","3851":"i kept waiting to feel more interested in the characters but it never came","3852":"this book needed a giant dose of hope somuch heartache but a good read","3853":" there was some good stuff here if only she had written it as a normal novel instead it seemed as if she wrote a bunch of short stories some of which made little sense because we didn't know enough about the characters and the only thing that tied them together is that each chapter was about one of the children i don't agree with the bad reviews given by readers who didn't even finish the book a review can't be given if the entire novel is not read actually the last chapter is the best when we finally get to understand hattie and her life at that point i found that i really liked her i am disappointed that she didn't do a better job of crafting this novel because i think it could have been great i'm not sure about her editors and mentors what were they thinking i listened to the audio but also had the book so i went back through it to catch things i missed while listening 2 18 14 addendum attended an author event with ayana and now understand a little bit more about her thinking as she wrote this novel she is quite intelligent and soft spoken and sincere but i think the problem was that she knew what she was trying to do so it made more sense to her than it did to the readers who started getting lost about what was going on she did write each chapter completely separately from the other so while she knew each character and how they blended we didn't and needed more of the information that she had in her head anyway that's my take on it","3854":"it took me awhile to realize what was going on in the book what the author was presenting about half way i never read any reviews before reading it halfway through i realized what the author was doing and then the book picked up it is not what i expected and therefore i ended up understanding the presentation and characters in the book","3855":"well written but left me wanting a better ending still a pretty good read","3856":"while the book is very well written it is incredibly sad and depressing not one chapter is happy all her children craved a mother's love and she couldn't give it just sad","3857":"this author writes beautifully however i found this book to be very depressing and would not recommend it to anyone","3858":"this was perhaps the saddest book i have ever read a true example of how anger ruins a family","3859":"wonderful so well written almost like reading a book of short stories tied together with a bow a thin thread ties them all together one of the best books i've read in a long long time and i read constantly","3860":"what a wonderful book from a first time author i can easily see why it is oprah's book club selection as there is so much to talk about each chapter follows the tribes or children of hattie a poor black woman who moves from georgia to philadelphia the chapters span the years 1925 1980 and are really loosely connected short stories while hattie is not always a likeable character and her parenting skills vary through the years her strength always comes through certain chapters are more interesting than others but there are no weak ones","3861":"oprah's latest book club offering from first time novelist ayana mathis is a family saga that follows the shepherd family through five generations from 1925 through 1980 the story opens with 17 year old hattie a recent arrival to philadelphia during the great migration north from the terror of jim crow south in a steamy bathroom trying to save the lives of her infant twins who are stricken with pneumonia despite their \"names of promise and hope \" philadelphia and jubilee die and hattie is never able to get over her grief her soul withers and she becomes bitter and unloving alienating her husband and the children to come who along with a grandchild make up the twelve tribes hattie's children spend much of their lives trying to tap into any compassion left in their mother yet hattie's pragmatic view is that \"what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies \" hattie remains throughout the novel a flawed woman angry and lacking in tenderness but an unwavering force dedicated to her children's survival each chapter of the novel is devoted to one or more of hattie's children and their journeys mirror changing aspects of the black experience in america mathis moves briskly from one story to the next from floyd who returns to the jim crow south as an itinerant musician wrestling with his homosexuality to bell stricken by tuberculosis and her memories of an affair with a kind man who had made her mother happy years before to franklin who stands watch on a beach in vietnam at war with his own demons a marriage that fell victim to his alcoholism and gambling the most realized portrait is of six who is weighed down by scars both physical and emotional six has so badly beaten a neighborhood boy that he is spirited off to alabama to tour the tent revival circuit although the townspeople believe that the teenage six has the \"gift \" he believes that he is nothing more than a ruined instrument of god who finds that it \"was only in church that he felt compassion for anyone beside himself \"mathis has a gift for showing how heavily history weighs on a family as despair brings down subsequent generations and dreams die a slow death but the weakness in her book along with some writing that at times is flat is that the numerous strands of the plot fail to connect to one another a chapter on billups suggests that he was sexually abused as a child but other chapters set in that time period give no indication that abuse occurred hattie reluctantly gave away her daughter ella to her childless sister pearl \"as if she were a dog \" and we never hear about the girl or pearl again characters appear and vanish and there is little sense that they belong to the same family while mathis has decided to opt for scope something is lost when the reader is deprived of immersing himself in the characters who are never fully realized","3862":" this book about the children of hattie shepherd reads more like a collection of short stories than a novel each chapter tells the story of one or more of her children some when young and some when older it begins when she marries august shepherd and moves from georgia to philadelphia this begins in 1923 when she then gives birth to twin babies and it ends in 1980 after she has given birth to and cared for nine more children it is also the story of how she survived a life of turmoil and adversity i felt a little disconnected from the stories unfortunately the author's writing style didn't completely draw me into the lives of hattie august and their children","3863":"a very well written book but painful","3864":" this one caught my eye at the library what an amazing first novel for ayana mathis the novel follows hattie's life by allowing the reader a one chapter insight into each of her 11 children and 1 granddaughter the story begins as hattie her mother and sisters make the move from georgia to philadelphia in early 20's she sees the north as a place of opportunity for black people and is excited to begin her life there as hattie falls in love and marries the wrong man her life is consumed with babies and survival hattie's children see her as distant and unloving in fact they call her the general what they don't understand is that it is taking all of her energy to see that her children are fed and clothed because her husband is a womanizer who does not keep a job the lives of her children are completely up to her getting to know each of these children as adults with the baggage they carry from their childhoods is the focus of the novel","3865":"this novel is beautiful heartbreaking and timeless each story reads quickly and masterfully connects with the other characters my heart breaks for hattie who can be cruel lonely desperate and loving any mother will find herself somewhere in this woman's home i read for characterization at which this author excels this novel will stick with me","3866":"this is about a most dysfunctional family not one seems what would be considered 'normal' in our society mathis writes the life of hattie through her eleven children a grandchild her husband and sisters but i found it too scattered mathis does bring her good intentions forward in her writing style","3867":"it was unusual i wasn't really sure what to think i won't say that i truly enjoyed it at some times but it held my interest and kept me coming back to see where it was going to go","3868":"the trials and tibulations of hattie an african american woman who moves from georgia to philadlphia told through the stories about her children the stories are all very compelling but i wish there had been a family tree or clearer descriptions of how the children all fit together","3869":" four and a half stars have you ever read a book simply because it would not leave you alone i did not want to read it but every time i looked at a book website walked into a bookstore or opened an e mail regarding books there was twelve tribes of hattie staring at me and tapping me on the shoulder the synopsis and reviews did not sound promising and i kept rejecting it until finally giving in just so the thing would leave me alone well no one is more surprised than me at how fascinating it turned out to be hattie shepherd has 11 children during her life starting in 1924 at age 17 each chapter is devoted to a different child and in this way we learn hattie's story and those of the children though she is extremely lacking in tenderness and affection it is clear that hattie loves each and every child however they are all damaged in various ways due to the lack of emotional love the shepherd family drama is beautifully and eloquently written by new author ayana mathis she takes us vividly inside the action with rare talent though the stories are certainly not happy she writes with an undercurrent of hope which kept me rapt throughout","3870":"its been a loooong time since i have read such a beautifully written book the author is an artist such that you can see and feel every character and their pain yup its an oprah book so there is pain but its worth the read'","3871":" after a heavy diet of young adult fiction this novel was like coming up for air mathis creates a world that is achingly real the rich psychological roads paved by the author created a space for me to wrestle with the scars and existing injuries created by unfettered racism misogyny and poverty in our society it begs the reader to see how these strings of social ill are weaved into all of us and the insidious role they play in our interactions with one another the novel challenges the reader to see beyond the surface of those with whom we interact and consider the deep pools of life that have shaped them what makes this novel so powerful is its ability to move beyond the intellectual and into the personal the novel allowed me to reflect on my own youth and growing up as my compassion for hattie's distance and reserve grew i could pause and consider my own splintered relationship with my parents the love and disdain that hattie's children held for her was all too familiar as hattie's world was laid out before me i could feel myself soften even if just a little to my own mother who has relaxed with age like hattie at the same time i understood all too well hattie's children's reserve that developed over years of habitual response to anger and rejection these complicated family relationships were filled with longing and love with the chemistry that binds people to one another despite all the messy human nature that comes between i am dubious that finding myself wandering in the pages of this story was accidental it is what makes me admire mathis in her storytelling abilities it is this ability to tap into the human experience that makes stories like the twelve tribes of hattie worthwhile through hattie mathis tapped into a vulnerability that lives within each woman and mother hattie's relationship with augustus revealed the importance of women to be in relationships with men who are adults and share a sense of responsibility to their families the rare moments when august came to hattie's defense or gave her support were the moments when hattie was at her strongest perhaps the most striking scene was when hattie was left with the excruciating decision to let her sister pearl take her youngest child ella august stepped in and articulated the wound that pearl's judgment and self righteous attitude was inflicting on hattie august's ability to ally himself with hattie in this crucial moment gave her the strength she needed to make an impossible decision i highly recommend this novel i found myself reflecting on the way in which hardship and persistent culturally accepted inequity shapes people it was impossible to ignore its affect on me and ways in which i am both powerless to it and bound to work to change it if people are to be empowered to be their best selves","3872":"there were parts of this book that i loved but i was left dissatisfied by how many characters were featured and abandoned and how many others were never really heard from for example the chapters entitled ruthie and ella were not really told from their perspectives like the other chapters about the other children and billups didn't get his own voice i was hoping for one chapter at the end entitled hattie where we could have learned more about who all these people became","3873":"it's definitely hard to read a new chapter as they are like a short story each time but the stories are great and the family is super complex great writing for sure","3874":"this book is so good it's about a husband and wife then each chapter after is about their kids funny how life turns out sometimes","3875":"there are certain chapters i would give four stars the author's descriptions are at times quite vivid the last scene is one of my favorites","3876":"beautifully written","3877":"i have trouble reading books where the narrative's pov changes a lot which is what this book does so when i first started reading this it was a struggle and then i finally really got into it i enjoyed it but i think i'd have preferred it a lot more if the story was told a more linear fashion at the same time i doubt the author would have been able to fit as much in as she did if it had been from one pov","3878":"i typically enjoy books with lots of characters but this one was way to loosely connected and you never come back to them my biggest point of contrition meanwhile it ends on what i can only call as a to be continued type others wise it was a heart felt book that i could relate to","3879":" impressive loved it i enjoy character driven books even more than plot driven and this was certainly strong on character development i have read other reviews that compared it more to short stories than a novel okay i can see that in some ways but to me it was a novel in parts i didn't see it as a novel about the migration so much though as that was only in where hattie came from and had very little to do with anything else again that didn't seem to make any difference in the way this book was so beautiful intimate heart wrenching and honest hard to believe this is a debut novel","3880":" the twelve tribes of hattie is about hattie shepherd and her 11 children the story is told in the form of 12 narratives spanning from 1923 to 1980 the aspects of writing craft that i thought the author used well were creating characters and building tension although the story is about hattie you never really hear anything from her directly instead each of the 12 narratives is told from the perspective of one of her children when the children where infants as in the case of philadelphia and jubilee and ella the story is told in 3rd person narrative thus what you learn about hattie and her life are sprinkle throughout the book in snippets and telling details you learn that hattie was an unloving quick tempered secretive mother through the various interactions and memories of her children you also learn that hattie's lack of warmth is the source of the conflict between her and each of her children the author did not use time well at all there is some sequence to the story as each narrative progresses along from 1923 to 1980 however the snapshot method that was used was a little disconcerting at times while you learn a lot about hattie over the course of the story you only get pieces of each child from their narrative were it not for hattie being a consistent thread the story would not have flowed at all the children's stories were told almost in insolation and they barely mention the other siblings it was almost like reading 12 short stories also i hated the ending s the book had an ambiguous ending and so did each of the narratives the reader is left to wonder what happened to hattie and each of her children did ella hate hattie after she gave her away to her aunt did franklin die in vietnam did cassie suffer from schizophrenia other than philadelphia and jubilee the reader has no clue what became of hattie's children such a frustrating end","3881":"brings to mind gloria naylors evocative tales amazing first novel centered around a southern woman who moves to philly in 1923 with her family each chapter is set in a different time focused on one of her children all the way up to 1980 stunned by the unexpected ending","3882":"i would actually give the book 3 5 stars for the story and 4 stars for the writing i wish the characters were more developed less flawed and offered the reader some hope i liked and related to hattie throughout the book but in the end she left me feeling sad and empty it turned out hattie wasn't so likable after all and this was nothing more than a story about an ineffectual mother","3883":" i loved this book loved in a way i haven't loved a book in a long long time each chapter focuses on a different child of hattie while still telling bits and pieces of the main story each chapter takes place at different times along hattie's life with each of her children basically each chapter is like a short story with small details linking them all together i thought the story telling was superb and the writing spectacular i want mathis to write a hundred more books because she has captured my heart with her debut novel and has left me wanting more","3884":"really enjoyed this book despite the fact it upset me quite a lot as have recently had a baby and it tweaked the old hormones a tale of a mothers love through such hardship and what this had to mean in those difficult times made me reflect on my actions as a mother and the effects on a child's whole life something also borne out in the next book i read dinner in the homesick restaurant by anne tyler","3885":" it had great promise in the plot and premise but the shortcomings began immediately with the second chapter she builds elaborate and complicated mini story lines that are interesting but has holes and gaps leaving the reader yearning for more information at times it seemed disjointed and unconnected and the characters all siblings seem more like strangers in a short story novel the only constant is hattie and august whose relationship is probably the only one that is resolved by the novel's end","3886":"although i would hesitate to recommend this dark novel to anyone i was fascinated by hattie and her strange family the writing is spectacular and i couldn't put it down shades of toni morrison but not as hard to understand i will get on oprah's book club site to see how others feel","3887":"i really tried to like this i started it once and abandoned it i started it again and couldn't finish","3888":"i really enjoyed it it was different than i expected but i liked it honestly felt oprahs comments were a little shallow with the relaunching of the book club a little more effort surely was warranted","3889":"this book about a family with 11 children is really just a collection of short stories that span over 50 years hattie the matriarch has tense and complicated relationships with her children she tries to escape at one point but becomes resigned to her situation overall the writing was good but there really wasn't a strong thread linking the stories together none of the children seemed happy or fulfilled","3890":" i did my own book review of this but think it deserves extra attention in goodreads i was alerted to this book when the author was interviewed by oprah i was so captivated by her authenticity and honesty that i immediately went to my ipad for an impulse buy it was a very good impulse the book is really like an old school novella but all the characters are children of hattie in the title or hattie herself i really love the insider glimpse of the great migration i am a history buff and have sat at many a knee hearing stories from older relatives but as i got older i realized so much was not told because people were not accustomed to speaking their pain so i am grateful to ms mathis because she is speaking for so many people with this book","3891":" oof this is such a tough sad state of affairs this family is broken each person within it deeply wounded struggling with demons mathis' writing is terrific but i feel disappointed in the structure this novel is more like a collection of short stories each chapter a vignette of the life of one or two in some cases of hattie's children i thought many of them were good and perhaps this was to add to the 'fractured whole' of it all but i found it just didn't work well for me it often felt too abrupt and incomplete aside as i was reading i was also wondering about mfa programs feeling mathis must have attended one she did iowa i don't know what this means in the context of my review but i find this interesting sometimes i feel odd when i can gauge an author's writing background based on style i am conflicted about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing but i worry that mfa fiction programs are allowing their students to lose what may be unique about their style and asking or pushing them to conform to something else anyway mathis' characters are very interesting but i felt some voices blended in with others while some were much more distinct if you are a sensitive empathetic reader this book will probably leave you feeling very melancholy there is not a lot of hope in this book i was left feeling this family will never escape all of their varied anguish and the cycle will perpetuate the twelve tribes of hattie her 12 children were given a heavy load in life the parents august and hattie begin the book so young hattie's 16 with newborn twins one prolonged tragic moment sets the tone for the rest of their lives hope and light have been sucked out of this family i am glad i read this book but my heart and brain are going to need a couple of days to recover","3892":"the novel follows a family led by matriarch hattie through the 11 children and one grandchild each chapter delves into the life of one or two individuals and in the process reveals more about hattie hattie's life changes after the death of her twins and hardens her to the world around her while an intteresting idea the chapters show only brief glimpses into each life making you feel like you don't really know them in addition none of the children have happy lives except for possibly one its more of a look into how a family can get stuck and never recover that everyone is flawed and that one event can have lasting consequences for generations the book ends on a hopeful note implying that hattie can do things differently the second time around","3893":"of course i read this book because it came so highly recommended by oprah not that i live and die by what she says but have found her book club choices to be great novels i was captivated by the first chapter and finished it with tears rolling down my face i thought it was going to be a rough book to get through based on my emotional reaction it was beautifully written and it took me a few chapters to figure out the direction of the book meaning it is a character study it was not exactly a page turner but i still enjoyable it was sad and tragic at the same time this book told the story of how the presence of love can both make life worth living and yet leave a path of destruction and despair","3894":"very very emotional has that oprah's book club flair in that its about a sad women who has seemingly insurmountable circumstances that are in her way","3895":"this book is very well written it was most impressive as the first book from a new author each and every character was interesting even though it was hard to like them at times this book was definitely much darker than i would have preferred i don't mind tragedies in books as look as things turn out in the end there were no happy endings in this book","3896":"left me wanting more why was hattie so cold not just the death of her twins each snippet of her other children's sad lives told chapter by chapter we're stand alone stories and hard to take i wanted to know more about each one as time passed but it never happened","3897":"does it matter that life doesn't wrap itself up neatly at the end does it matter that drunkeness adultery and mental illness haunts us along the fringes what is to become of this family this tribe of peoples scattered that barely recognizes its own brothers u0026amp sisters in the shadows","3898":"3 stars i liked the story line but would like to know whatever happened to the characters","3899":"was well written and interesting to have one chapter devoted to each character it's a dark story and didn't seem to have much of a flow or connection between the chapters or characters should provide some good discussion at our book club but not one of my favorites","3900":" i loved the story and it was incredibly powerful but i thought that the way it was written wasn't quite as good for the character development as it could have been nobody got a whole lot of time in the limelight although in the ending chapters this actually was pretty effective i thought that the characters were so fascinating and should've gotten more time to be developed each on their own in a novel to me it read more like a collection of short stories tied together by a single connecting thread than a novel still good though","3901":"i didn't finish this one it just didn't grab my attention yoo bad because it seemed to have so much potential","3902":"i liked this but i wish it were longer so each of the stories could have been more developed","3903":"i liked the writing in this very much but the fact that each chapter is dedicated to a different one of hattie's children means that there is not all that much connection between them it felt like a not so clever way to call this a novel when it was really a series of loosely linked vignettes hattie is there nominally throughout all of them but just barely in some","3904":" i just finished reding the twelve tribes of hattie and i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed it the characters were so well developed and real you felt like you knew them as you read about their experiences i find that i like a book best when i like at least one of the characters although most of the characters including hattie had some kind of downfall or struggle they were complex and made me want to know more about them even though there was a limited discussion of each person each was described in enough detail so that i could imagine what their past or their future held for them i had the feel of toni morrison as i read and was pleased to see ayana mathis mention her in the acknowledgements i know so of the other reviews considered the chapters to be disjointed or more like a series of short stories but i enjoy something from time to time that isn't a straight in a line sort of novel","3905":" via everydayebookfriday january 11ayana mathis' the twelve tribes of hattie a stirring portrait of family loss and enduranceby courtney allisonit's not hard to see why oprah winfrey chose the twelve tribes of hattie as her most recent book club 2 0 pick from the first sentence on debut novelist ayana mathis writes vividly and sensitively of one family's journey and struggles over a lifetime creating a stirring portrait of family loss and endurance in the twentieth century when young hattie shepard arrives in philadelphia from georgia in 1923 the first thing she notices is the absence of trees mathis writes vibrantly of the urban sights sounds and smells hattie encounters as she gets off the train automobile exhaust hung in the air alongside the tar smell of freshly laid asphalt and the sickening odor of garbage rotting wheels rumbled on the paving stones engines revved paperboys called the headlines it's not entirely romantic but it's accurate much like the rest of the novel which doesn't shy away from depicting the painful circumstances of some of the characters the first chapter is harrowing as hattie loses her infant twins to pneumonia within the early pages of the book this loss sets the stage for the way hattie will love and care for her surviving children all nine of them - that is with grit and what seems to be a necessary distance for her each chapter is devoted to a child at a different point in his or her life some are small and some are grown when we meet them and the novel jumps in time from one chapter to the next each story comes alive in its own way and can almost stand alone apart from the novel but together create a beautiful tapestry of a larger life and a fascinating family tale we meet eldest floyd in 1948 as a young adult and talented musician traveling the south with his trumpet and playing gigs all the while fearful to face his true self another we see as a teenager a few years later also struggling to find himself but as a preacher with a calling in this way readers view hattie through the eyes of her children always a bit removed and limited in the amount of affection she can give some call her the general the sisters all grow up a little bit broken inside too perhaps taking this from their mother despite her wish to prepare them for the difficult world outside hattie's husband august means well but is unable to provide for the family and falls far short of hattie's hopes and expectations another son struggles to survive and misses his family as he fights the war in vietnam the twelve tribes of hattie can be a trying read at times as the characters face poverty racism and other hardships but readers are rewarded with hattie's strong and enduring spirit as she protects her children and raises her family the best she can","3906":"written as short stories from the point of view of mom children and grandchildren enjoyed reading this one look forward to book club discussion","3907":"this is ayana mathis' first book and the writing is fantastic the twelve tribes of hattie centres on hattie and her family hattie is a black woman who escaped the racial tensions of the south for philadelphia with her mother and sisters during the 1920's the twelve tribes refers to hattie's numerous children with each chapter devoted to one child and providing the reader with a snap shot of a particular time in their life while the writing is superb and the book is a real page turner i found the story structure quite fractured and disconnected as a whole the chapters a snap shot of a moment in one child's life left me wanting to know how they did after that moment or realisation it felt too much like the characters where plonked on the page and i didn't think the stories of the other siblings filled in those gaps or provided links in any adequate way to pull the story more tightly together each child seems to be dealing with some kind of pain or damaged in their highlighted moment and i think the impression is that hattie was to blame i think the writer is trying to convey that hattie was doing what she could for her large and demanding family and each act regardless of its terseness or fridity was done in hattie's own way of loving and caring i certainly felt compassion and empathy for hattie she was doing her best to me this seemed like a number of short stories portraits that mathis has attempted to link together a talented writer remember this is her first novel but i did want greater cohesion between the characters and a stronger sense of their individual futures i would like to give this 3 5","3908":" i'm sorry i didn't like this it was very depressing everyone is impressed by hattie's courage i am not she had too many children her husband august is no good hattie doesn't love him but clings to him on the odd nights that he comes home hence the 12 tribes each of their children was a failure in his or her own eyes although their house was always too crowded the siblings have almost no interactions with each other if you think this review is bleak spend a few hours with ayana mathis' debut novel each chapter details how hattie and august's progeny slowly and painfully subsist mathis is a talented writer but i think her story is more desperate than hardy's tess and jude the obscure","3909":"this story got my attention immediately but waned as the chapters went on the characters were strong but in some instances they seemed confused or i became confused i couldn't keep them all straight the assumed connection between the characters failed to explain who they were maybe i should read it again i really would have liked to understand the 'base' character hattie long before being introduced to her children and felt more of a connection within each chapter","3910":"i gave it up the writing was good but every time i began to get pulled into a character the chapter was over and that character was gone the flow was all wrong","3911":"it would have been a 4 but i wasnt fond of the ending was hoping for more of hatties take on her life but never got it other than a few sentences that didnt satisfy me","3912":"i enjoyed a few parts in the book but it wasn't a story that stuck with me wouldn't recommend it","3913":" the storytelling in this book is beautiful and i particularly appreciated listening to it in the audio format i have come to really enjoy books that have vignettes of stories in each chapter bounce from character to character in every chapter or leap through time and space in the various chapters this book did that exposing a child or two of hattie shephard through the years in doing so the pieces of hattie's life and surroundings were slowly put together like a puzzle what it missed was how each of the stories came together meshing and intersecting the characters and vignettes","3914":"4 stars for the writing i did not really like hattie although nearer the end of the book i warmed to her a bit more i could not believe that all her children could be so miserable surely some of them could have been happy it was a rather depressing book","3915":"a great portrait it's not a family saga but a patchwork of stories that show how attitudes and emotions bleed through the generations hattie never healed and her pain is passed on to those closest to her this book cleverly illustrates the horrific impact of slavery and jim crow on american families","3916":"listened to this book on cd while driving it is difficult because the lives in the book are difficult compelling but sad somewhat heroic i have the book too and did read pieces and it is well written it was certainly well spoken which does not often happen","3917":"and the question is was hattie a bod mom or a good enough mom i find it hard to think she could have been any better living in her time and her condition what did she need to give her children to enable them to survive when she learned how easily they could be lost","3918":"powerful read great characters and real relationships you know these people would recommend to anyone","3919":"i didn't particularly care for this book the writing was good but the structure was so disjointed that it took away from the story","3920":" hattie 17 ends hattie 71 married to august

child from age 17 to age 46 and the fucked up lives that those children lived it's pretty depressing and another novel that focuses on the terrible qualities of men but it's beautifully written and engaging","3922":"a rather depressing story from a sad part of american history in the last century hattie shepherd is 15 and flees georgia for philadelphia with the hopes for a better life her husband and life are nothing but disappointment struggle hopelessness and anger she rears her nine surviving children in fear and prepares them for a world of difficulty and hatred what they craved was tenderness and love how do you seek a better life when you only know bitterness ignorance and adversity","3923":"i'm amazed at how vivid the characters became to me even though they basically only got one chapter each","3924":" i hate this book not because it's bad but the author has talent and wasted on something mediocre mathis is a product of a master's writing program and it shows in every page of this book there is nothing inherently wrong with the story but she decides to play with structure hattie's story is not told linearly but through the personal stories of her 11 children because the book is so fragmented we never get a good picture of any of these kids or hattie these sections are fairly short and we only follow them for a brief period in their life usually a few days and except for hattie they are not revisited moreover mathis decides to give each of the characters some cliche problem molestation racism schizophrenic disorder homosexuality crisis of faith philandering and tuberculosis it's as if she made a list of issues and just attributed them to each story line it doing feel real it felt forced trite as if the author is begging you to feel for characters instead of giving you a reason to the story itself held promise hattie born in the beginning of the 20th century leaves georgia and moves to philadelphia with her new husband they quickly have twins that die as babies to the flu and things are never the same they have 9 more children in succession but hattie closes her heart to them after losing the first two august the husband becomes a philanderer and never works as hard as he can the family is always poor with not enough and always more mouths to feed the children grow up with issues of their own and resent their mother because they never felt the love they craved since this covers virtually the whole swath of the 20th century we see how blacks get treated over the years all mathis needed to do was keep it simple she could have told the story through hattie's point of view the point of view of one of the children or an omniscient third person narrator instead she meshes together 10 incomplete short stories that doesn't satisfy the main story arc moreover she ended it at the expected point of hattie being old but not at a natural end point the conflict was not addressed and everything is still a bit of a mess and nobody learns anything from all the hardship so what's the point if you don't have one than you don't have a book","3925":"pretty much exactly what i expected with a bit more mental illness","3926":"each character well developed so you get a picture of the entire family's dysfunction stemming from a misguided young woman trying to save her numerous children in the most basic sense of the work ending up not really saving any of them finally getting a second chance with the following generation","3927":" i'll start off by saying that i'm anticipating reading more from this author her descriptions of the smells the scenery and the emotions that the characters were going through were so so detailed that you really get the picture i did however find the structure hard to follow because each chapter depicted the story of a different character and different time period after developing each character the chapter would end rather abruptly and then flip to another character and time period although the structure of the book left something to be desired i look forward to other works by this author","3928":" what a fantastic book i devoured it in just a day i was amazed at the author's ability to tell the story in multiple voices and make it credible it is a novel that reminds you of how hard life could be after a migration georgia to philidelphia and how the scars of life disappointment and love can affect you more than you ever realized until you see it reflected back to you in this case in the lives and struggles of her children a wonderful ode to those who endured the migration segregation racism poverty and gender bias as a part of our country in 1928 and a cautious reminder not to become complacent or these beliefs may yet again wrest our society and citizens into shards","3929":"beautifully written","3930":"compelling beautifully written and thoughtful there is something in each of these stories that resonates","3931":"so so so so good the kind of book you just get completely lost in and only come up for air when you've read the whole thing in one sitting can't wait for more books from this author wow","3932":" i really enjoyed this book initially i didn't get the hype as i continued on however i got it i recognized many of the characters including hattie in my own life and came to a place of understanding a passage i loved hattie knew her children did not think her a kind woman perhaps she wasn't but there hadn't been time for sentiment when they were young she had failed them in vital ways but what good would it have done to spend the days hugging and kissing if there hadn't been anything to put in their bellies they didn't understand that all the love she had was taken up with feeding them and clothing them and preparing them to meet the world the world would not love them the world would not be kind p 236","3933":"lfpc read for march 2013 also oprah reads book club","3934":"this was a great story i liked the time period and setting i had tears in my eyes more than once","3935":"so happy i got this in my book club's chinese book exchange at our christmas party i wasn't too happy i had the bone bed stolen from me twice though rating 3 5 stars","3936":"mathis writes eloquently about motherhood alcoholism poverty mental illness love courtship death and loss i liked how the stories of her tribe spanned many decades i wished i knew more of how all of their stories ended","3937":"great book","3938":"well written interesting way to show a life through the impact on and development of her children but after a while i thought that every sort of life problem was going to be dragged in to describe the child's life all in all most of what everyone suffered from was the effects of lives trapped in desperate poverty","3939":"to me the title suggested triumph possibly out of adversity i didn't get that i think this was one of the most depressing books that i've read was glad when it finally ended","3940":"the book is a great description of the black culture each chapter is a different story of each of hattie's children it covers hattie as a young pregnant 17 year old up until she is 71 the only negative is that each chapter left me hanging i wanted to know what happened to each child","3941":" each chapter takes on a new part of hattie's life raising her 12 children with her absentee adulterous husband i looked forward to each new story but was equally disappointed in each hattie is an unloving cold and abusive mother who continues to procreate because she just loves having sex with the man she hates the most surely even in the 1950's there was some birth control the children starved and poverty stricken grow into mentally ill drug and alcohol addicted and incompetent adults i don't have to love the characters or the plot to like a book but there was no cohesion transition or resolution to any of their stories the longer i read the more i couldn't stand the hattie's stupidity","3942":"this book reads like something that zora neale hurston or toni morrison might have written this is the story of hattie and her husband august she moves to philadelphia during the great migration and gives birth to a pair of twins who don't survive long enough to celebrate their first birthday afterwards hattie gives birth to ten more children who grow up to become a variety of colorful figures each chapter is told from the pov of one of her children and one grandchild and relates their experiences but in the background of each story you learn a little more about hattie and august so the book is really about the family some reviewers have said that they never heard anything more about certain characters after their chapter but i don't think that they were paying attention as other family members relate what happened to their siblings in their own chapters it's really the story of family and it is a really interesting read also a pick for oprah's book club if you're into that","3943":"very good especially for a first novel but i found the whole rather depressing as none of the characters really seems to have resolved their lives in a positive way by the end of the book i kind of wanted to know more","3944":"if i were to get nit picky i'd give this more of a 3 5 5","3945":"i did not like it usually a fan of oprah's book club so i was disappointed","3946":"i really loved this book it reminded me a lot of olive kittredge in that you learn about hattie through the filters of her childrens' experiences the writing was beautiful and haunting in places","3947":"i'm surprised that the average rating for this book is so low i thought each chapter was rich enough for a novel all its own","3948":"this is an exceptional first novel reads more like linked short stories than an integrated novel my review in the san francisco chronicle http www sfgate com books article t","3949":" i must admit that the oprah boost made me less than eager to read this book which was a book club selection i expected sappy and undemanding was i wrong from the beginning mathis's style is self assured and commanding she draws clear and living characters who act reasonably given what she tells us about them i do wish one of the tribe members was happy although i guess i could call the ending a happy one for bell and maybe for hattie just as hattie was bashed around by life her many children are also beset she is able to keep them alive mostly but she's ill equipped to tend to their emotions because hers also are so hidden except for her anger actually i wish i knew more about her anger she has had a hard time but she's almost paralyzed by anger there are other ways one could respond to her setbacks so i'd like to know why she chose this one oddly enough this book reminded me of olive kittredge in that it's a series of short stories really that draw a picture of the title character we don't see a great deal of her but we learn about her from other characters this seems to be a popular structure lately but it is tricky to do well mathis does it well indeed a very strong debut","3950":"some references were not authentic or believable i liked the writing but expected a stronger story considering all the hype some parts seemed even convoluted without true feeling i don't know why i really liked it i've put it on my read again shelf","3951":"this novel is about hattie's twelve children each chapter covers each child's now adult life and how they are struggling or getting by in life the time in the book spans around 40 year's time and has a melancholy vibe as each person hattie included is struggling with their own demons","3952":"the last 10 pages stunning would make for great discussion on to read more about the great migration the warmth of other suns","3953":"for whatever reason i did not want to like this book i didn't even want to read it i think i was hooked by the end of the first page a deft unflinching look into the lives of hattie and her family i got so caught up i felt their sorrows many and their joys few i lived in the heart of their struggles with them came out the other side with them i can't say they were better people or worse people at the end but they were people i could relate to","3954":"this was not a lighthearted read it was tough and contemplative and at times melancholy but it was still a wonderful insight into the trials of a woman just keeping her enormous brood of children alive","3955":"the book was ok it was very well written but there is no real continuity between the stories and is more of a book of short stories she writes really well but every story is sad","3956":"an exceptional first or second or third novel but oh so depressing on a late dank dark and cold winter night","3957":"warning mild spoilers i want to preface this by saying how much i appreciate what mathis did here she tells a grander story through the little stories and although the characters are pretty much contained in their own sub story except for hattie and august we don't necessarily need them to be written into the entire story because by the end we get it we get the loss and the pain and that for this family the freedom hattie fled for has not been found the world is cruel whether you reside in the jim crow south or the brotherly love of the north each chapter containing its own character could almost be self contained and studied as a lone short story i am intrigued as to what would happen if a piece was taken out and studied in isolation of the rest i'm pretty convinced it could stand on its own and have some short story merit which i think is extremely impressive but because they are pieced together and offer up a greater narrative we learn about this family in its entirety and by the end we get to know hattie even though her narrative is only contained in bits and pieces in that way dare i liken it to olive kitteridge but by the time the final story is told i am left with an unsettling feeling where's the redemption where's the hope the hope that is offered up in the first chapter is squashed upon its arrival and as a christian to have the redemption and hope of christ ultimately taken away in the final chapter left me feeling defeated has hattie's heart been so hardened to the cruelty of the world that even the love of god has not been able to poke holes in her heart","3958":"i am going to cut and paste the review i wrote for olive kitteredge in 2009 because i can pretty much say the same thing for ayana mathis and the twelve tribes of hattie though strout is undeniably a great writer the problem for me with olive kitteridge is the genre i think there could have been a beautiful novel there all the elements of a great story were scattered throughout the 13 short stories but the story falls short because the short story doesn't allow for enough development i can fill in the blanks but isn't that the job of the author that's why i don't write they do it much better than i ever could i wish i would have loved it more but i didn't pick up the book as soon as i walked in the door or look forward to reading it before bed","3959":"this was ok i did not realize that each chapter was a short story about one of hattie's kids some of them ate just plain dislikable well written just not what i expected","3960":"felt like this story needed more it was too succinct for me maybe that was the editing the characters and plot are well developed but i wanted more for the story maybe i wanted more from hattie or her legacy her children and their lives","3961":"needlessly depressing","3962":"i have no idea how to rate this book it's beautiful in so many ways but it's not a book one likes so terribly painful maybe i'll write a review i have to recover first review 3 23 13there is only one way i can make myself like not appreciate not admire not respect because those i already do like this book and it is if i imagine it representing the author's childhood in the acknowledgments she writes to the philadelphia school for girls for being a light in the darkest part of my life that would be her childhood now if i'm an author who wrote a book about the terrible suffering the befalls each of the nine children of a cold and distant mother and a drinking absent father and i went to great pains precisely to show how terribly fucked up each child of this couple is and if in the acknowledgments i refer to my childhood as the darkest past of my life well it seems to me i'm inviting the reader to gather that i had a distant emotionally disconnected mother and an absent father and that this caused me unimaginable pain this goes hand in hand with the very forgiving portrayal of both mother and father who in spite of their glaring shortcomings are devoted to their children and love them albeit in terribly flawed and entirely inaccessible ways also mother's and father's personal anguish is contextualized they leave jim crow georgia and come to the north as it happens philadelphia full of hope and optimism hattie 16 is pregnant and soon gives birth to twins she clearly adores hattie and augustus 17 live in a rented home but have great hopes soon to buy a house that the twins are a seal of this promise is imprinted in their names philadelphia and jubilee at 7 months the twins catch pneumonia and die maybe they die because is 1925 and in 1925 babies died of pneumonia maybe they die because they would have died in 2013 too maybe they die because hattie prefers old wives' remedies to the medicines recommended by the doctor who knows philadelphia is cold philadelphia is humid philadelphia is not georgia this death marks the end of everything of augustus's ability to stand on his own two feet and keep on walking or hattie's capacity to be emotionally available to her children of a future of middle class living the rest of hattie's children's life is spent in hunger abject poverty emotional starvation and the distress of living with parents who are so embittered with each other they can't even be in the same room except clearly to have sex and make babies each child is marked by his or her own brand of misery one is schizophrenic the background is a background of dislocation in the south maybe hattie and augustus would have been happy the north is cold and unforgiving the north is lonely yet the south is intolerable unlivable and the children in their own ways all die i can make myself like this book only if i think that ayana mathis described her childhood otherwise i'll just have to settle for admiring it and hope that whatever demon haunted this young writer was exorcised in the writing of this book and the next book will have the same expertise and artistry and none of the deadly bleakness because this deadly bleakness broken only and with much welcome by a tiny rain of sun right at the end gives me nothing","3963":" ugg can't believe i wasted any moments of my life reading this the only reason i gave it two stars was that i thought the author's writing had potential this is a very depressing book it is slow moving i sort of felt like i was walking in mud up to my knees and couldn't escape there are many hot button issues here a few too many if you ask me what exactly was the author going for trying to grab readers with signs of the times the stories themselves are disjointed hattie is not a likable character and all the tribes have major flaws i believe mathis could write a good story i wish she would write about something upbeat and happy this one for me was a major letdown and i could not recommend to anyone","3964":"typical oprah book very slow","3965":"i enjoyed this book quite a lot even though for me it didn't quite live up to the hype this may be because of the overall concept which caused the book to read more like a series of short stories and i don't like short stories the stories were related but i found it hard to get properly involved with the characters since the perspective changed so frequently still there were some beautiful observations and heartbreaking moments i guess i just keep hoping for a little bit more","3966":"this book wasn't as bad or depressing as others said but it was very real and raw it was more like eating vegetables than donuts i gave it 3 stars because i don't see it as a book i'll tell all my girlfriends you've got to read this although i feel the writing was excellent","3967":"the stories of hattie's children were good but i think the book ended too abruptly","3968":"despite my tries i cannot finish this book i am just not loving it and don't feel attached to the story or characters perhaps i'll try it again in a few months","3969":" this book drew me in from the beginning i think that ms mathis did a wonderful job developing her characters the pace of the story was good and kept me engaged and i love her choice of telling the story in vignettes it was brilliant to see the world through the eyes of each character i really enjoyed it my only critique is that i felt like there mathis didn't really nail connecting a the characters who are all siblings to each other and b the characters to the main character hattie the connections were tenuous at best and i wished at the end that there had been a better wrap up update about each of the characters it may have required another 100 or so pages but i think it would have been worth it","3970":"a very thoughtful storyline that brings you through the lives of hattie and her children over time each child has a chapter from their viewpoint so you get the full story of the shepherd family's successes and failures","3971":"really enjoyed this one so much that i wish for more on eachof the tribes","3972":"the writing was good but i wasn't expecting each chapter to be a different story about a different character it prevented me from becoming invested in the characters and from gaining momentum to finish the book i did finish but i didn't come away with any strong impression positive or negative","3973":" bookstores crumble under amazon's hegemony book sections vanish into journalism's glory days and book critics fade behind a cacophony of online reviews but oprah abides in the latest demonstration of her awesome power the talk show diva smiled early on a debut novel scheduled for release in january knopf one of the nation's most prestigious publishers immediately bowed to o's wishes more than doubled its print run and moved the release up a month -- into the publishing wasteland of mid december more power to her so what if all the important best of the year lists have already appeared along with the national book awards nothing is more valuable than that \"oprah's book club\" sticker on the dust jacket which guarantees ayana mathis's novel a vastly larger audience than it might have drawn making the selection for what she now calls her book club 2 0 winfrey invoked the name of the author of one of her earlier picks nobel laureate toni morrison but that's potentially misleading although they both write about the travails of african american women mathis is a more accessible writer her prose style polished at the iowa writers' workshop is clean and transparent and though she manipulates time and chronology in sophisticated ways she never leaves us as morrison sometimes does in the dense mist of her private vision see \"a mercy\" \"the twelve tribes of hattie\" falls into that growing tradition of books that hover somewhere between a novel and a collection of short stories -- an unintended effect perhaps of the workshop setting that so many writers pass through nowadays like the chapters in kevin powers's iraq war novel \"the yellow birds \" sections of mathis's book cry out for anthologizing but their effect grows richer and more complex as they accrue the first chapter set in 1925 is a fever dream of parental panic a tale about the death of infant twins that suggests \"the twelve tribes of hattie\" will be the kind of overwrought maternal tragedy that winfrey is too often unfairly charged with favoring in fact mathis has something more subtle in store the next chapter picks up two decades later and each subsequent chapter jumps ahead a few years rotating through the lives of hattie shepherd's many children -- \"the twelve tribes \"among the wonders of mathis's storytelling is her ability to orient us gracefully in each of these new settings some of hattie's children have wandered far others have remained under her care but none can escape the infection of her anger her incurable resentment at her husband \"the greatest mistake of her life \" who subjects her to \"these endless pregnancies \"the first adult child we meet is 22 year old floyd an itinerant trumpet player who has his pick of fans after every gig the subject of this moving story is all its own but mathis quickly establishes themes that run throughout the remaining chapters despite his promiscuous treatment of women what really troubles floyd is his attraction to other men twenty years before stonewall this young musician has no way to comprehend himself except in the tropes laid down by his family's church -- as an abomination a judas far from home floyd feels \"like a kite broken off from its string \" his increasingly reckless desire is \"a thing too awful to be tolerated \" denying his affections \"floyd smelled his cowardice he was all rot inside \"while a violently homophobic culture exacerbates floyd's self loathing that desperate sense of inadequacy is the horrible legacy hattie has left to all the children she raised with such ferocious single mindedness they yearn to be normal settled respectable -- to grasp the prize that has eluded their mother healthy or sick successful or impoverished none of them ever feel the balm of her love even her glad handing husband thinks \"if she would stop hating him for one day one hour he'd have the strength to do the right thing by her \"that longing for her approval takes a fascinating turn in the story of six hattie's runty teenage son badly scalded in a childhood accident he grows up seething with rage but also prone to fits of divine eloquence in church grace comes \"on him like a seizure and then leaves him frail and hurting \" mathis writes \"he knew his jesus spells were another indicator that he was a freak not merely of body but of spirit his soul was susceptible to god's whimsy just as his body was susceptible to any opportunistic thing that might hurt it \" sent away to preach in alabama church revivals when he's just 15 six regards his ability to inspire and heal as a curse a power that makes him feel inadequate and fraudulent this enthralling chapter laced with allusions to the gospels delves into knotty issues of spirituality and doubt in ways that recall the work of john updike and marilynne robinson as these tragic tales play out and the death of her twins fades from immediacy there's a risk that hattie will seem just a harridan a frigid wife an angry mother who whispers at one point \"somebody always wants something from me they're eating me alive \" but mathis returns to her again and again adding new dimensions to this portrait of a matriarch constantly struggling against poverty and disappointment \"how was she supposed to bear a life like this \" she wonders we see her abandon a chance for romance in favor of her family's survival and in the novel's most breathtaking chapter she considers a sacrifice that will kill her too many writers of literary fiction tend to stage intimate stories in the hermetically sealed worlds of their own clever imaginations but mathis never loses touch with the geography and the changing national culture through which her characters move \"the twelve tribes of hattie\" is infused with african americans' conflicted attitudes about the north and the south during the great migration after fleeing georgia with her widowed mother young hattie vows never to leave philadelphia where she and her children eventually settle for good but the past holds a tempting allure for many of these regional refugees fears about how they'll be judged by white people and fellow black residents inform the attitudes and longings of these women for decades \"they were most of them perpetually donning and polishing their northern city selves \" mathis writes \"molting whatever little southern town they or their families had come from five or ten or twenty years before or bragging about their families' wide porches in whatever good negro neighborhood they'd lived in which was just a roundabout way of demanding that philadelphia give them their due \"in the long family arc that mathis describes the painful life of one remarkably resilient woman is placed against the hopes and struggles of millions of african americans who held this nation to its promise without oprah's intervention \"the twelve tribes of hattie\" might have been one of the greatest novels of 2013 but now -- just in time -- it's certainly one of the best of 2012","3974":"this book was like a collection of separate short stories rather than a novel","3975":" a 4 5i caught the tail end of an interview with mathis and oprah winfrey on npr a couple of months ago i thought to myself that the book sounded like something i would not normally read therefore i was going to read it i am very glad i took the chance the book is tremendous it is laid out more as a collection of short stories than a traditional novel format each chapter story brings to life an episode from the life of hattie or her kin but the episodes mathis writes are the darkest and worst for each character each is a low point a realization of the cruelty of life a disheartening soul crushing episode that will shape them forever in this way the book is brutal i felt beat up reading it the blows keep coming they are bruising they are relentless they are the hardships that hattie's family faced but this is the brilliance of the book mathis's choice to string together these horrible episodes these moments of heartbreak and distraught is what makes the book so powerful mathis could have written about struggle and overcoming overcoming trials seems to be popular these days but instead mathis focuses on the cruelty of life even when escaping from the south life is still tremendously hard for a hattie's family the story is about an african american family but the story transcends race or cultural boundaries it could be about any family during any time trying to make a better life trying to start again somewhere new it is a story that starts with so much hope but quickly is swallowed by the reality that life is hard and always will be it could be the story of my own grandparents mathis's writing is wonderful too she includes rich vibrant details that brought me into the story i always felt i was right there with the characters whether the setting was a living room a juke or a tent revival meeting my two favorite chapters were cassie's and floyd's cassie's is perhaps the most desperate she is losing her mind and mathis lets me be right inside that confusion floyd's was perhaps the saddest for me more than anyone else he is dammed to a life of dissatisfaction his realization is the cruelest the future he faces knowing he will never be able to openly follow his heart is the bleakest what mathis does not write about the good times that certainly can be gleaned from cracks the story gives you glimpses of moments of happiness and contentment that fall outside the horrible episodes the book deals with is as important as what she chooses to include a lesser author would have failed at this but mathis succeeds and flourishes i highly recommend this book","3976":"an interesting story from the south about hattie and her children each chapter is about a different child in a different time period than the other stories one of the first chapters is about the first born twins there is sadness happiness and whole variety of other emotions while you read this book it was a good book","3977":"one of the most beautifully written books i've had the pleasure of reading in quite a while my only criticism be the lack of minimal amount of hope which seems to appear in only the first and final chapters a lovely novel","3978":" i enjoyed the novel i think a lot of people have different feelings toward hattie while reading and after reading the novel and i understand why i can see the point of people saying she was a bad parent and how her action turned her children into what they were for me i felt like she was a woman who was a victim of circumstance herself which made her ill equipped to be a loving mother i didn't like nor dislike her i felt for her especially after reading the first chapter which was heartbreaking and ella i remember my mom always saying some people are much better grandparents then they were parents of her parents and by the end that was my sincerest hope for hattie","3979":"as a result of the tragedies in her life hattie becomes a cold and bitter woman she won't let affection in or out refusing to make her heart vulnerable to loss when she gets older she yearns for another chance to be make things better but can only shed her defenses a little each chapter was the story of one of hattie's children relatives i did like viewing how other people saw hattie as well as her husband august","3980":"i liked this book i'd give it a solid 3 5 stars it's really more of a collection of stories over 50 years about one women told through stories of her children than a novel","3981":"this book was completely unexpected it was somehow just what i needed at the time however","3982":"i had to keep putting the book down it was difficult to finish it had so much despair i also wanted to follow the lives of the characters into better spaces for each though so i became interested and even invested in their lives continuity seemed too choppy and i had to get used to it it was like the author dropped her mirror and one looks at these people's lives through the shards of glass","3983":"this book was sad i feel like all of the characters just ended up so miserable it is possible that they accepted their lives and decided to make the most of it but the tiny glimpse you get of each of them suggests that they are broken it was very well written but i wanted to find out how it ended for all of the characters","3984":"i was surprised i didn't hate this the oprah's book club sticker is usually a guaranteed non starter but i was reviewing it on cbc radio it's very iowa writers workshop y but satisfying in its high realism i keep thinking allegory like the bible","3985":"an oprah book club pick for this month i usually don't pay much attention to that but this book engaged me with the first few pages the story of a black family in the south first book by this very talented author definitely worth reading","3986":"it's an easy read but not as compelling as i had hoped","3987":" i loved the writing it reminded me of olive kittridge in that each chapter is about a different child of hattie's but unlike olive kittridge which tells a larger story of olive this doesn't tell a larger story of hattie or her tribes like many of the reviewers on good reads i was hoping for more connectivity between the stories characters and more into the twelve tribes concept and the great migration i did enjoy reading the book as the writing is really strong i just want something more something that makes me long to get home from work to read and be with the characters something","3988":" definitely one of those almost fives i enjoyed the author's slight experimentation with point of view shifts between third person omniscient pov into close third and then first i especially enjoyed the author's experimentation with dual first person shifts with the same character's voice between the exposed and the hidden the language and emotional feel of this novel is powerful and poignant the structure made me think of how multiple point of views can be combined into one story how even a collection of what seems like multiple short stories can be transformed into a novel the only reservations holding me back from giving it five stars are my preference for more lyrical abstract complex language and i would have liked to have seen more experimental risk with the form and structure of the multiple povs and voices","3989":"i thought this book is overrated it has a good storyline but the plot wavers and you lose interest as the book progresses for the simple reason that no one of the narrators are known you get to know them chapter by chapter the main protagonist is on the sidelines it will take patience to finish this","3990":"i loved this book mathis is a very talented author i could see the scenes in my mind as though i was watching a movie loved","3991":"this book is a series of short stories where each character is some how related to hattie to make it interesting something terrible happens to each character so can be a depressing read but when i got to the last story i was actually sad the book ended i was hungry for more","3992":"this book was on display at the library and i decided to pick it up i am glad i did this is a very interesting story told from a different point of view i like it when authors do a little something different this was one of those cases the story of hattie is told from each of her children's points of view it was a little hard to keep track of how much time was passing between the stories of each child but otherwise a very different way of telling the story of a mother this book will make you laugh and cry you will hold on the the edge of the book waiting for more there are some sexual references a little swearing particularly from one son's part of the story otherwise clean highly recommend","3993":"whoa what an emotional rollercoaster","3994":"the ending lost it for me it was really engrossing up until the last section it was good though and i liked that each section was from a different child's point of view ultimately it didn't quite live up to the hype for me","3995":"this book was well written and an easy read which is what i was hoping for i should have read more about it though because the book was not a traditional novel but rather a series of stories about each of hattie's children over the years i prefer a cohesive story as i did not really get to know any of the character's that well including hattie each character had one chapter and that was it","3996":" a very difficult book for me to rate on the positive it was thrilling to read i was suspecting slow drama given that this story tracks the lives of a dozen people over time but i was surprised by how gripped i was in each chapter even when the action occurring was only minimal a great testimony to the power and skill of mathis' writing i found myself thinking about the characters and story throughout the day and very much wanting to return to the book i also enjoyed the story on a personal level and found it quite relatable to the northern black experience in some ways it felt like i was reading my own family history which was a real treat i found myself relating to hattie and understanding her hardness something it seems that many others have been unable to do negatively another reviewer labeled this book misandry on display while i think that is a bit harsh the book does indeed have a tiresome and trite habit of portraying men particularly black men in a negative light why so many black women authors of whom i am one feel a need to do this i do not know but i think the truly novel thing to do would be to actually portray some black men in a good light they exist furthermore the book had a strange anti redemptive theme to it which i didn't quite understand could it really be true that all 12 of hattie's kin could end up so miserable yes this i think is the natural outcome of a parent who does not know how to care for her children's souls as hattie herself admitted still it would have been far more believable to me if there was more of a mix of outcomes for her kin the book was far too negative for me although admittedly there were spots of light and seemed to also be overly pessimistic about religion which i did not appreciate all in all though a fantastic read and a talented author","3997":"a tough read well written in parts choppy and disconnected in others still it did drag me through it and i was sad when each person's story was done","3998":"was so sad to see this book end could not put it down","3999":"enjoyed the book but wanted more from the ending","4000":" the twelve tribes of hattie by ayana mathis depicts the great migration with a gut wrenching beauty as it follows the shepard family through perilous trials and tribulations this painful family narrative exposes secrets lifestyles anguish and situations still relevant today despite being set in the early 20th century readers may find themselves questioning the advent of african american progress in america as many of the problems faced in this book continue to plague black america today the great migration refers to the time period in which 6 million blacks migrated from the rural south to northern states in hopes of better lives for themselves their families and future generations in the twelve tribes of hattie hattie relocates to philadelphia as a young girl with her mother and sisters upon arriving in philadelphia and observing the racial climate as being far more tolerant than the cryptic alabama she and her family left behind hattie asserts early on that she will never return to alabama not even to visit relatives that stayed behind hattie is beautiful and is the daughter of the only storefront owner in her hometown she seems to have a bright future ahead of her however when she weds august and they lose their children shortly thereafter both parents change for the worse august becomes a womanizing gambling alcoholic who's only contribution to hattie is intimacy that results in nine more child births children that they struggle to care for and hattie her heart becomes cold... like ice although she provides the physical and material things her children need emotionally she is drained absent and bitter each child is affected by her emotional distance and seeks solace in other things and people the twelve tribes of hattie depicts each of hattie and augusts' children as a separate chapter and narrates their life journey and interactions and interpretations of their parents as they too navigate life during the great migration each child unique in his or her own way faces demons too heavy to carry on their own yet too heavy to fully share with their emotionally distant mother and irresponsible father the source of hattie's emotional distance and overall discontent with life is complex and multifaceted yes she loves her children dearly but she suffers a deep regret for the man she married and the financial woes she's plagued with daily the institution of marriage even when both parties were unhappy was a lifetime commitment during this time period despite one failed attempt to leave hattie accepts her fate and continues her life as mrs shepherd although it crushes her spirit every day although the twelve tribes of hattie is not a relationship or self help book the power and influence our lifetime partners have on our lives is an important lesson readers' should hone on in married and single readers alike should understand hattie's dissatisfaction anger and sadness as a realistic outcome of marrying dating and even entertaining the wrong person how different this book would be had she married a man of upstanding values character and morals however the brunt of hattie's anger does fall on herself as she is the primary conductor of her fate and of her life perhaps hattie's view of religion was one of the most astounding aspects of her personality christianity played a large role in the lives of sothern and northern blacks alike especially matriarchs and continues to play that same role today however for hattie religion buzzed in the background of mind it was there but never a primary focus for her as the narrative matures hattie even stops her granddaughter from being baptized hattie figures that god never showed up throughout all of her suffering and she refuses to allow her innocent granddaughter to go down that path despite the nasty looks she receives from her fellow church goers hattie is firm and whisks her grandbaby away from the altar mental illness infidelity paternity marriage poverty shame grief and guilt rear ugly heads in this exceptional debut novel the twelve tribes of hattie is not a novel that will make you feel good it instead challenges you to question the plight of blacks in america understand the sacrifices ancestors made for things they'd never benefit from in their lifetime but hoped future generations would reap look closely at those you allow into your life and learn to identify appreciate and reciprocate real love some readers will struggle with the lack of a real conclusion at the books end while i agree that a happy ending or an ending in general would've provided closure to the many questions one develops throughout the course of the novel i recall my mentor telling me \"review the book you read and not the book you wish you read \" therefore i interpret the lack of a succinct conclusion to replicate the reality of the story perhaps there is no conclusion because hattie's story continues to live on through matriarchs both past and present for more of my reviews please visit britlit review","4001":" i enjoyed reading this book and am not really bothered by the structure as other reviewers have written because the story is about hattie in the end and not about her children even though each chapter tells the story of one or two of her children hattie's character and story are well developed through the stories of her children and it's pretty bleak even the ending which seems like an attempt at redemption for hattie doesn't fully redeem her or give her a completely peaceful ending it's not the structure or the bleakness that keeps me for giving it a higher rating though it's the sense that i had read this before same themes same nuggets of pain same unresolved problems that have bled down through our troubled history to plague black people and in this case especially black women not much depth or originality within the canon of literary fiction that was birthed by toni morrison alice walker and their forebears","4002":"this is more like a collection of short stories than a novel the common denominator in the stories is of course hattie what a collection of sadness dysfunction and self destruction very few happy moments that said mathis is absolutely precise in the psychology of her characters and the book is a fascinating study of what happens to a family when it is perceived that the mother's love is withheld","4003":"overall this book was pretty good with good writing mathis put forth a great idea by using the children to tell hattie's story but i still don't feel like we got a complete picture of who hattie was it was a lot of well what happened in this book","4004":"read like short stories each chapter about a different one of hattie's children never did see them as a family","4005":"finished it but it was not a fast page turner the stories seemed disjointed but perhaps that was the point to illustrate the dysfunction of hattie's family this is not a book i will retain on my shelf","4006":"after all the oprah hype i was disappointed i would have like hattie to have more of a voice since she was the central character in the book i didn't feel that the book clearly depicted the connection to the migration of african americans in the '20's as the lives of each of these characters may easily and more likely be attributed to the result of a lack of attention and nuturing when they were children as well as the repercussions of unresolved grief","4007":"the structure of this book shouldn't work but it does to tell hattie's story through the years with snapshots of her children and the lives they make for themselves is so original i can't think of a book where it's been done before by choosing such a format mathis shows us the jim crow world of the south and the exodus of so many black people to the north hattie's children all born in the north face issues of homosexuality crime betrayal infidelity mental illness it's a great read","4008":"i'd give this one 3 and a half stars it was more entertaining to listen to the audiobook than to read the paperback i rarely feel that way all in all an interesting story","4009":"this was a bit depressing but well written it was almost like a series of short stories it made me realise how easy i had it as a kid","4010":"couldn't put down wish she had more books wonderfully written","4011":"beautifully written but quite depressing","4012":"as sad as it was to read sometimes i really enjoyed this book i loved the beautiful way the author gave a different voice to each child and her descriptive writing style well done","4013":"april 2013 book club selection","4014":"this book was a monumental waste of my time it is obvious that the author was trying to be unique and edgy with the way the book was laid out but it ended up being a jumbled disjointed mess it was as if some took a jigsaw puzzle and threw all the pieces on the floor and then took half the pieces and put them together with no rhyme or reason","4015":"really enjoyed this book i liked how each chapter was it's own short story yet hattie was a presence in each so that brought the chapters together it was a sad story but i felt hopeful in the end","4016":"a collection of stories about hattie and her many children it was beautiful at points but painfully sad at others not much redemption in this book","4017":"sad story good read regardless","4018":"a little depressing but still an okay book","4019":"i should have put this book back when i saw it was an oprah book doesn't she ever pick a pick a book with an ounce of happy on it not one happy person in the whole story","4020":"i'm not going to finish this one so this is an unfair assessment i'm giving up after chapter 3 midway through 4 the characters so far are extremely dull and depressing to me so far it has been a very uninspiring read and i just can't bring myself to finish it","4021":"i liked the book and how it presented the life of each of hattie's children but i have to agree i would have like a more complete ending the story really is a reflection of hattie and the effect she had on each of her children that being said the reader can create his own assumptions","4022":"allegorical novel about slavery and race uses biblical references twelve tribes of israel in the same vein as toni morrison bleak but then oprah loves her some cheerless storytelling","4023":"it started out so good i loved reading about hattie as the book went on through the stories of her children each one was a little bit sadder than the last by the time i got to the last story i could hardly stand to read it the last 1 4 of the book was just depressing not redemptive or uplifting either for such a good start i was really disappointed","4024":"when i complained to a friend that this book was depressing she asked what the redeeming quality was that made me keep reading it i had to think about it a while and realized that it's because the book is so well written the imagery really resonated with me and the characters are ones that you still find yourself thinking about days after you're introduced to them while i won't be rereading this anytime soon ok let's be honest probably never i would be willing to read another novel by the same author in hopes that the overall tone isn't quite so bitter and sad","4025":"i hate to admit it but i have up on this book a few chapters shy of finishing very well written but way too depressing for me","4026":"i really like how this was written each of hattie's children had their own chapter but life was so bleak for all of them i was just so hoping for some happiness","4027":"i went between 3 and 4 stars it felt incomplete with no resolution","4028":"this book is still a good read","4029":"i promise i'm not one of those people who scoffs at any book that gets good publicity i loved the last national book award winner and from a practical standpoint i think that all fiction writers win when a novel does well because publishers become that much more likely to sign more of us but this novel is just not ready for prime time to give credit where due it has an ambitious conceit and it sets the bar high with a few strong chapters early in particular floyd and six unfortunately it falls apart in a hurry and we get chapter after chapter of emotional manipulation presented without any subtlety and employing just about every african american archetype without ever delving deeper to really get to know an individual character hattie herself the putative protagonist of the book is a total cipher whose only character trait seems to be that she's angry over an ancient trauma there is no sustained narrative no nuance in the narratives we get and no greater point to it all except that african americans have gotten a very raw deal it's probably worth it from time to time to remind people like me of this raw deal and it might even be worth it to do so repeatedly but this novel doesn't lend any new insight into that deal or into the legacy of racism that is our country's great human rights failure mathis's prose is smooth and she deserves points for her willingness to try a big difficult undertaking but this book needed substantial revision for it to achieve its true potential","4030":"i likes the characters but the way it was written felt so disconnected","4031":"once again oprah has made a good pick for her book club definitely worth reading well written different from anything i've read lately","4032":"not a fan although i thought it was well written i did not like the structure of the book each chapter dealt with one of her children and that was it you were left wondering what became of each of them","4033":"this was an interesting easy to read novel but not in my opinion worthy of being a best seller i chose to read it it for two reasons sometimes oprah is right about books and the title my grandmother was named hattie and my favorite niece is named after her it struck a note in me a side note hattie in the book has a sister named pearl my grandmother hattie had a daughter named pearl hattie is a young black woman only seventeen when the book begins with a husband and twin babies after leaving georgia with her mother and sisters two years before and settling in philadelphia she marries and in quick succession loses her mother to death and one sister to the south she is alone in a cold and lonely town poor and scared the tribes of the title are hattie's children each chapter named for one or more their struggles and experiences from the twins of the first chapter philadelphia and jubilee suffering through pneumonia in the harsh winter to cassie whose mental illness causes her elderly mother such pain the book skims over the issues of the times from prohibition jim crow civil rights sexuality alcoholism and disease as well as mental illness and religion but never really addresses any of them the ending is unsatisfactory and abrubt without any kind of resolution","4034":" well written that's the best i can say for this story i felt terrible for hattie for so many reasons but she turned her back on her last chance to redeem anything at all for her tribes on the last page didn't like this story cuz any opportunity for hope was always stomped out she may have been able to be a good mom had she been given the help and support she needed when her twins died and if her loser husband wasn't a philanderer i just really didn't like the characters in this story at all giving it 2 stars because the writing was good","4035":"incredible book beginning to end i wish that each chapter was another 100 pages the character development was incredible but not deep enough for me beautiful prose","4036":"no joy in this book but it's well written characters are not likable and i kept waiting for one to cling to he she never came","4037":"liked it although upon finishing the book wondered what happened to the lives of the other children","4038":"just didnt interest me foul language a turn off","4039":"in my not so humble opinion this book is a piece of garbage i look forward to dropping it off at the used book store and getting it out of my house i considered throwing it away but to date i have only honored one book in that way funny enough it was another oprah book oprah has gotten a number of things right in her life but this book is not one of them from the first page until i decided to stop reading this book felt like a personal assault it represents everything that gets under my skin i could write a thesis but i will reserve my energy for more enjoyable pursuits suffice it to say this book is more of the same the downtrodden who can't catch a break the whole family should attend counseling and get out of my head","4040":"just thought it was ok if you interest is in the migration of blacks to the north cities read warm of other suns it was much better","4041":"this book was a wonderful surprise and mind blower from a new author told in separate voices it might have swamped a less talented author while it might leave you wanting to know more about each member of the tribe what good book doesn't leave wanting more hattie is well pictured and it is her story yes it is an oprah book and with that comes an expectation of a sad story but she does know good writing as well i love that oprah gives such a boost to beginning and established writers it means we are reading","4042":" we always wonder how much our mom influences our adult life here is a book that centers around hattie a mother of 12 she is a very real wife and mother trying to survive at a time when getting through the day feels impossible when her 1st children die of pneumonia not a spoiler hattie never gets over the loss which then centers her life and choices the many children that follow seem to be troubled souls and spend much of their life looking to tap into any compassion that mom may have left for them this is a book that shows you how heavily history can weigh on a family","4043":"2 5 stars although the writing was good the 12 different stories were a bit frustrating to read there was no flow maybe there wasn't supposed to be and all the stories were just plain sad each person in the book was damaged in some awful way and it was hard to endure their pain with them or in fact like them i should have put this one down much sooner","4044":"more like a series of short interconnected stories than a novel lots of gaps and less than satisfying glimpses into characters lives not uplifting in any way well written","4045":"got 3 4 through when my library check out expired since i doubt the misery of hattie's tribes will relent even a smidge in what's left i'm moving on","4046":"dysfunctinal family poverty is a terrible infliction sometimes no way out i was left feeling very sad about this family","4047":"http abookloverswalk blogspot com 2","4048":" overall very enjoyable i really enjoyed the snapshots of life of hattie and her children as african americans on the edge of poverty refugees from the jim crow south between the 1920s and the 1980s the setting and characters were incredibly detailed and realistic i loved them my only complaint is that it was really a series of snapshots of the lives of these individuals and we never got much follow up or closure on most of them i felt the novel was more interconnected vignettes than cohesive stories if you get attached to characters and need to know what happens you will be disappointed if you accept this book for what it is beautifully framed and narrated moments of time than you will enjoy this book greatly in one of the stories the son who was in vietnam the narration abruptly switches from the female narrator who has done previous chapters told in a male voice to that of a male voice actor it was extremely surprising and a bit jarring but after the first couple of minutes adjustments were made and i appreciated what the new narrator was doing with the character","4049":"overall a good book and well written i didn't like that each chapter was devoted to one of her children it made the novel feel fragmented at times","4050":"ayana mathis's debut novel compels from the first page as it tells the story of hattie mathis and her struggle to create a life for herself and her family during the 1920's great migration through threads that express the experience of her children and grandchildren the various narratives are poetic as they are gripping and though the novel has garnered some criticism for its structure the seemingly disparate threads do cohere in their connection to hattie the protagonist of the novel whose resilient spirit perseveres and radiates hope despite the shattered dreams and seemingly irrecoverable losses that she faces","4051":"it was good up until the story abruptly ended out of nowhere with nothing to tie anything together overall disappointed","4052":"as a mother this book provided a lot of points for reflection i couldn't put it down","4053":"i have a strict no oprah book policy i read this because it was recommended by a well respected book group that will teach me no oprah books","4054":"wow i didn't like how it ended we never saw the whole family together but i discovered that i could identify with hattie on some levels","4055":"2 5 stars a meager stab at toni morrison style multi generational epic","4056":"hattie is an african american woman who escaped the jim crow south with her mother when she was just a young girl the north held the promise of freedom and a better life for her family however the twelve tribes of hattie describes all of the heart ache hattie endures in the north much of this pain is centered around her children and her marriage hattie a proud and beautiful woman finds her life in the north is nothing like she expected she fights to survive and she fights for the survival of her children i loved this book the heart break hattie felt was tangible and immediate from the first few pages it has been a long time since a book has grabbed a hold of my soul and shook it perhaps this is because i am a mother and african american with deep roots in the south whatever the case may be i know hattie and her children and i am better for having read their story it is a reminder of what black people suffered and endured in the name of a better life although this is a book about african americans it isn't just a book for african americans mathis explores issues like poverety infidelity dreams mental illness homosexuality and pride issues that every human can relate to without being preachy mathis allows her readers to draw their own conclusions about these short comings of all humanity a final word ayana mathis reminds me of toni morrison and alice walker she is sure to be a literary great for many years to come i can't wait for mathis to publish her next book","4057":"it was ok if the characters had not been black this would not have been of any interest to me did learn a bit of the black culture always interesting to learn about cultures different from mine","4058":"this lady went through it it's almost like watching the stories of family members lives unwind the beginning of her story with losing her twins changed her life forever i felt a sadness and emptiness for hattie she wanted to love her children but circumstances did make for a good nurturing environment it makes me wonder if her parenting style pushed her children into behaving and making some of the choices that they did i think in the end she tried saving her granddaughter by stopping her may not have been a good decision to someone but everything the gave to god and chance backfired so she may think trying something different will get her future generations a better chance","4059":"3 5 stars author is clearly a talented writer some characters more memorable than others but all had such sad stories","4060":"pretty good book for a debut novel i really enjoyed it","4061":"i've been searching for the right thing to say about this one i didn't hate it but i had a hard time loving it which is what i think the author wanted us to feel about hattie herself i agree with a lot of the other reviews on here that this felt more like a loosely connected set of short stories than a novel there were some beautiful and powerful parts in the novel but most of the time it felt like a chore i particularly enjoyed floyd and bell's chapters but hated six etc i felt like the last two chapters were a very strange discordant note to end on especially when i was hoping for a bit more of a conclusion i wanted to know hattie more intimately but i suspect that the scraps of her personality that we are allowed to know were purposeful on the part of mathis we are not meant to know hattie as she knows herself but as her children know her i think the most frustrating part of the book is that the children all seem so distant from each other and so we get no follow up on any of their trajectories even though there are huge jumps in time that should allow us a glimpse into the future of some of the previously chaptered children while we're getting to know another i had a brief hope of meeting floyd again in alice's chapter but was greatly disappointed a good read i imagine that it would be great for book clubs and english classes but a bit of lonely trek alone","4062":"i expected more from the book it dragged in parts and was predictable lots of figurative language and drama very flat at times","4063":"this book does not have a plot each chapter just discusses each family member disappointing","4064":"this book is difficult for me to quantify her writing is compelling i just had to keep reading the characters are real you can feel what they feel however they could stand alone as 12 separate stories i didn't get any thread of connectedness at all nor much of a story per se","4065":"very descriptive realistic and glum an oprah's book club selection","4066":"i really enjoyed this book it was written well and the chapters were tied together nicely this author could really write w emotion pain and heartache","4067":"interesting story however i didn't care for the structure of the book it was too all over the place i felt conflicted after reading","4068":"ok but once again oprah suggests a totally depressing book","4069":"this book was okay hard to describe lots of negative and pain a mother who stayed with her husband even though she was not happy kept having children and those children were either messed up or unhappy or all the above","4070":"pretty good for a first novel i have a feeling it'll be turned into a movie especially with oprah backing it i think it read more like a short story collection with each story being able to pretty much stand alone i felt there wasn't a connection between all the stories and that's something i would've liked to see read","4071":"i just finished this book it was a book that was ok not my favorite","4072":"there were some incredibly great and promising sections as well as some disappointing sections since this book is told from the perspectives of several family members i suppose that was intentional","4073":"had some great moments fell short during some of the middle chapters but picked back up at the end i love the idea of each chapter representing an offspring reminded me of for colored girls","4074":"usually i steer clear of an oprah's book club book i have read several recommendations and only 2 were worth the effort to me the twelve tribes of hattie was well worth the effort i loved this book and the beautiful almost lyrical writing by ayana mathis i will recommend it to everyone who loves to read","4075":"i only read a few chapters when i realized the characters were the type of human beings i did not want to relate to and hattie the mother left me cold","4076":"i enjoyed this book and the way the stories were told","4077":"loved this book from every angle loved how the story of hattie unfolds from the stories of each of her children it is a story full of despair each of her children has been damaged in some way by hattie's apparent indifference but you also come to realize that she truly did give them everything she had to give also love the ending which leaves you with hope that her grandchild will have a fighting chance at normal a very unique and thoughtfully told story that every woman can relate to on some level","4078":"not nearly worth all the hype although the storyline was likely not far from what life was like for many african americans fleeing the south in 1920's the book follows her life over the next 30 years the story is dark and grim and downright depressing i don't find hattie to be the heroine who saves her family but one who simply lets life dictate to her i was expecting hattie to take charge and make something of this new life in the north but that did not happen i give this book a pass","4079":"very entertaining each chapter is about her offspring and reads like a bunch of short stories nice read for vacation and summer beach","4080":" so so don't want to say too much and spoil the book for others but although the prose was beautifully written i felt let down by the story and the lack of redemption for the main character everyone was miserable no one found success or happiness and it was just a bitter sad story i guess i am partial to happy endings or at least feeling like there was some payoff for investing in characters as you read their story of course if you are anything like me you will read the book anyway and not take my word for it it is a quick read so there's that but my goodness why is it so out of fashion to write an uplifting story these days these new young authors are so intent on morose tragic characters we read to escape the morose and tragic not wallow in it lol i will read the author's next book but i do hope she will write a more positive story the next go around","4081":"the twelve tribes of hattie is a well written debut novel telling the story of hattie and her children through various decades the book is structured so that each chapter gives us a glimpse into the lives of hattie's children with a chapter assigned to each child the children are all very different and unique in their own way it's a sad story as the common element with each child is that hattie never really appeared to connect with them on a personal level as a mother but rather cope with them day to day as best she could perhaps sacrificing her love for them because of the hardships she faced in her life there's no doubt that ayana mathis is an excellent writer i really wanted to love this book and i really enjoyed mathis writing but i just felt i didn't enjoy this book as much as i wanted to i didn't connect with it in the way that i wanted to i did like the structure of the book each chapter giving us a snapshot into the lives of hattie and her children but i just felt that there was no depth to the story or the characters and only a few of the children's experiences really captured my attention other than the author's writing which i think perhaps was so good that it overshadowed the story and characters i liked this book but i didn't love it i guess i'm pushing to three stars with the majority of my three stars going towards the author's writing personally i didn't 'feel' this book and i guess i kind of felt short changed with this one","4082":"interesting insightful harrowing difficult truths made for a great book club discussion","4083":"the structure of this book is non conventional but i really liked that hattie's character was developed completely through her children's understanding of who their mother was to them","4084":" this book doesn't have a plot but is rather a series of vignettes featuring a moment in time in the lives of hattie's children the vignettes give the reader a look at what has become of hattie's children while painting a picture of who their parents hattie and august were some chapters were difficult to get through while others i just couldn't get enough of the author builds characters well but this format of a book always kept me wanting to know more about each person the children are often not mentioned but in passing in the other chapters so your time with them is brief i enjoyed the author's overall style of writing and would read something of hers again however i didn't completely love this book the format was sometimes jarring and frustrating when chapters seem to end abruptly some chapters were boring mostly because i just didn't care much about that character","4085":"oprah's second e book choice it kept my interest but i wanted more from each chapter each chapter is a very short story about hattie and or her children not uplifting as each child has health or emotional issues i did keep reading","4086":"an overall sad depressing theme to this woman's life mostly didn't love this book as it was a collection of stories so there wasn't much flow to it took me forever to get through it","4087":"the twelve tribes of hattie was my first book from the shelves of oprah's book club selection and so when i found that my local had it i hurried and was the first to get thinking that it sounded like a good book to read not because oprah recommended it well unfortunately i was wrong i ended up being just a 2 star rating book hopefully next time oprah will have a better recommendation for me","4088":"not as depressing as most of ophrah's picks making the best of what life gives you","4089":"interesting way to tell a story each chapter was a different voice","4090":" a brilliant first novel although hattie and her children's lives have not been filled with joy and happiness ayana mathis has a way of making you feel compassion for them without making it too depressing to continue reading when i reached the end of the novel i wanted hattie to have had more children so that the book would not end i am eagerly a awaiting her future endeavors i am not a fan of oprah but have always found her book club picks to be enjoyable and enlightening and this book was no exception i do not follow her discussions etc that go along with her book club but will definitely continue to read the books she chooses for the club","4091":"this was a quick read but the plot felt empty and unfinished not one of oprah's best book club books","4092":"i think that books take you into a different world and this book did just that i really enjoyed the writing because with every new chapter a new story emerged with a new main character and i was taken into each character's world so flawlessly from one chapter to the next few authors can pull that off well i think that the pace was set and got me ready for the next story as each one ended i think in a lot of ways the organization of this book jumping from one child to the next reflects what hattie's life and her children's lives must have been like because how can a story about a woman and her 11 children be told without jumping around so much in the same way how could hattie have given each one of her children all the tenderness affection and attention they needed desired when there were so many of them she began having children at a time when there weren't many options for women who became pregnant she had to have the baby and that's what women were supposed to do anyway get married and have children i think ayana mathis really gets to the heart of the experience of many black women at that time it is hard to read sometimes but it is very real this book was definitely very heavy at times there were points when i wanted to cry and stop reading i had to take each chapter bit by bit because each story brought a new dilemma a new heart aching story it was a little too real for me at times but that made it a great read there aren't enough books that portray the experiences of black men and women especially throughout the 1900's when segregation was still alive and well and when the u s had only begun to change it was definitely eye opening to say the least","4093":"started off good didn't like the end pretty good read","4094":" hattie is an african american woman whose story covers the years from the early 1900s to the 1980s she bears 9 children the story is told from the point of view of hattie's children i did not like the way the story unfolded for me the various storytellers made the story haphazard and disjointed i never felt that i was able to get to know any of the children well there was no continuity between chapters the chapters that were told from hattie's point of view were the most interesting since i gained some insights into her character as much as i admired mathis' writing style her style alone cannot carry this book it is not a very compelling read","4095":"very depressing but beautifully written","4096":"incredible writing the ending chapters bring all the lives in the tribe of hattie to fruition and you finally understand hattie why she was the way she was how her mothering impacted her children's lives and how she finally came to be tender one of the most amazing books i have ever read","4097":" ayana mathis's debut novel \"the twelve tribes of hattie\" is so good and beautiful and emotionally draining that i actually began to question whether it was truly mathis's first book and or whether she really could be as young as she claims to be 42 the book has the finesse and power of an experienced writer and the heart and soul of a much older person one who has lived several generations one will not get past the first chapter unscathed whether or not one chooses to continue reading knowing the power that mathis wields at sucker punching us in the gut and setting the stage for a lifetime of hardship and tragedy for the family at the heart of the novel is entirely dependent on the reader but i heartily recommend drying your eyes you will be bawling i assure you after just the first chapter sucking it up and carrying on it's worth it at the heart of the story is hattie shepherd a young black girl who fled georgia with her family in 1923 during the great migration and settled in philadelphia where she vowed never to return to the racist south she was 15 years old at the time shortly thereafter she met fell in love with and married a man named august a man who would prove to be a source of constant heartache and headaches but who she continues to love despite her better judgment they had twins that hattie enthusiastically named philadelphia and jubilee the twins never made it to their first birthday dying from pneumonia that could have been prevented with penicillin which they couldn't afford the rest of the book follows in chapters that could be read as their own self contained short stories much like elizabeth strout's novel \"olive kitteridge\" the nine other children that hattie subsequently birthed each one in their own way is impacted by hattie's tough affectionless but loving upbringing floyd a wild carefree jazz musician who slowly begins to discover that he is gay but he discovers simultaneously that he is too much of a coward to admit it six the boy who nearly died as a youngster struggles with faith and fidelity while becoming a well known revivalist preacher ruthie the daughter that hattie has with another man during a period in her life in which she can no longer tolerate august's philandering and laziness ella the daughter she gave up given reluctantly to her childless sister to raise in the hopes of a better life alice and billups the two with a horrible secret one that threatens to ruin both their lives especially alice who lives with an unexpressed regret and a guilt over the fact that she couldn't protect her younger brother billy when he needed her to franklin the one who went to vietnam leaving behind an unhappy wife and a child he will never meet bell the one most like hattie in spirit and temperament and thusly the one who feels the most unloved cassie the mentally ill child whose illness thankfully has a name and a treatment if she is willing to accept it sala cassie's child hattie's grandchild who embodies a late in life second chance for hattie to provide a child with the proper guidance she couldn't offer her own mathis's writing has already been compared with the writing of toni morrison one of my favorite authors and it is an appropriate comparison mathis writes with a keen eye for history and an even keener knowledge of the human condition this book is wonderful and mathis is definitely an author to keep an eye on in the future","4098":"this was an outstanding book that made me feel a lot of feels my heart broke in the first chapter each chapter is told from the perspective of a different child or grandchild and they really build together and give you an interesting perspective of hattie over the years without directly showing you hattie or her feelings necessarily i've read other books where each chapter is told from a different perspective and it can be hard to connect with the characters or to find the connections between people the seamless transition from one child to the next really speaks volumes about this author i found this book at the library where it was put on display for black history month i wouldn't have found it otherwise and i'm so glad i've read it","4099":"this was a very interesting book it amazed me how the relationship between august and hattie remained intact they had so many troubles which reflected in the behavior of their offspring i really enjoyed how we got greater incite into the lives of the children as adults although we really did not get to know them as children seldom do you learn how the characters lives carry on into the future","4100":"very well written especially for a debut at times almost unbearably sad but such is life motherhood in all its distinctive features some things you can't apologize for you just have to try get around them for your own sake too so you cab have a little peace","4101":" less than the sum of its parts the book soars when the author focuses on hattie's direct experiences in both the first chapter and two other chapters towards the middle of the book hattie's emotions and pain and her relationship with her husband august are rich complex real and heartbreaking the other chapters focused more narrowly on hattie's tribes her many children and their hardships have nowhere near as much power each child has a unique and more outlandishly unhappy fate than the last ultimately making the work as a whole feel false and melodramatic if more of the unhappiness in this novel had come from the the more commonplace but just as harrowing tragedy of poverty alcohol drugs lack of healthcare etc instead of so much out of the ordinary bad luck the work as a whole would have succeeded in being far more moving","4102":"the plan seemed good to me and i selected twelve of you one from each tribe deuteronomy 1 22 23i'm assuming that when most people see oprah's stamp of approval on a novel they will all read that novel and love it i am usually dismissive of such novels as i was with the twelve tribes of hattie when it first came out everybody i encountered was making such a big deal over it i was like please insert petulant eye roll here now here i am after almost a year since it came out i have finally read the twelve tribes of hattie and i pretty much loved it the story is simple hattie sheperd is a fancy fifteen year old african american girl in the early 1920's she hooks up with a young man named august who is a ne'er do well who knocks her up they get married and move from georgia to philadelphia hattie gives birth to fraternal twins named philadelphia and jubilee unfortunately they die when only a few months old after that devastating loss the couple never really quite recovered from emotionally hattie goes on to have nine more children the twelve tribes of hattie is their stories along with hattie's and august's the twelfth tribesmember is a granddaughter named sala i think the genius of this book is its simplicity ayana mathis did a good job with bringing an individual voice to each child it provided a snapshot into their lives whike providing a clearer picture of hattie the saddest aspect about this novel is that maybe with the exception of ella none of the children were happy they each had their own trials and tribulations struggles and fears with only the triumphs few and far in between it was realistic in that way children cannot grow up in an environment with a mother as seemingly cold and angry as hattie was and not suffer any reprecussions life kicked the living daylights out of them where some were beyond reparations but not all is bleak as there is hope for sala all i can say is you did good oprah","4103":" the story covered many characters as in many children of hattie the tale of hattie migrating from the segregated south to philadelphia when she was 15 years of age and her affair with lawrence and ultimate marriage to floyd leads to her finding her way somehow she herself was a teenager ill prepared for the trials and tribulations ahead the many characters are individually developed and followed through many difficulties while it was difficult to follow the many people explored eventually i was able to follow the family development","4104":"i really liked the book i would have loved conclusions on the characters","4105":" this book was okay i didn't enjoy the narrative style of jumping around from person to person and it seemed a bit forced at times that being said there were some wonderful moments in the book i think it ended well and i most enjoyed the stories of cassie bell and ella there were some great lines in the book too the lives they would have had are unoccupied is a good example i think the book is more a testament to loss and how it can fill a life up with its void and the ripples outward from that loss i would have rated it 3 5","4106":"enjoyed this book i really liked the layout introducing family members one at a time at various points in their lives","4107":"well worth reading although i was not as in love with it as some reviewers i would probably rate it 3 5 stars it was an innovative way to explore the effects of hattie's life and her choices and societal racism on her children at times the writing was very powerful and evocative other times the plot and the writing felt like nothing i have not read many times it actually felt like interlocking short stories i could imagine each section in the new yorker as a stand alone story ultimately yes i did have a poignant picture of hattie but i wanted more about the children and their relations to each other more of a sense of how hattie affected each one and they influenced each others' lives","4108":" i have mixed feelings about this book the stories were moving all of them but i think i wanted more insight into hattie and how she ended up the way she was we don't learn much about her childhood before marrying august but we just get snippets of her personality from her children's stories i suppose it could be blamed on august but i feel like there was more to it than that i don't understand why she was so unhappy and it seemed as though she was so resentful of the children but i had to ask myself why she had so many why keep having children and did any of them end up better off once they grew up hard to say i can't really pick out a favorite chapter because they were all hard to swallow in some way but i think i felt the most connection to alice u0026amp billups story my favorite character was willie","4109":"the book was full of great writing for me the way in which the chapters are separated prevents me from really engaging by the time i get to know the character their part is over i really wanted to learn more about floyd six ruthie and ella","4110":"i would have liked to have known a little bit more about what happened to the characters i feel sort of hanging in the air with this book but it was a good story","4111":"this book was very good","4112":"these are almost interconnected short stories than a novel some characters i just didn't like so i had a hard time finishing this","4113":"kind of slow some chapters were better stories than others","4114":"this is a difficult book to review it's a novel but every chapter is based on someone else so it often feels like a bunch of short stories it made it feel a bit choppy to me which is why i don't usually like short stories i suppose the overall theme is that hattie didn't show her children the affection they needed and therefore failed them all in one way or another in the end i think she sees that and is trying to turn it around","4115":"liked the idea each chapter going into one of hattie's children and grandchild but it felt disjointed at times","4116":"liked the writing didn't find much redemption or triumph in the stories of her children hard to get through to the end and find just sadness and only a teeny glimmer of hope in the granddaughter i didn't put it down though the writing was powerful","4117":"too depressing for me right now","4118":"some of the stories of the children were better written than others i liked the book enough but i found myself waiting for some connectivity that being said i really like the way it ended with hattie and sala","4119":"powerfully written one of those books with rare depth and levels of meaning is it inspiring no but that's not the point","4120":"this is a well written engaging story the structure is interesting piecing together a life via loosely connected narratives about hattie's 12 children ending with a story about one of her grandchildren not surprisingly given the time frame and history it's a heartbreaking piece but not gratuitously so it's worth reading and a nice companion to the warmth of other suns","4121":"i really liked this book however i wished that she would have developed the characters more i feel that all i got was a little peek into their lives i wanted more","4122":"beautiful writing heartbreaking story of one woman's battle against crushing poverty and ignorance as told by her children","4123":"good story but not mesmerizing it pulled up short for me i had hoped she would tie it all up for me in the end but she didn't the writing was very good though","4124":"softly calm and sweet","4125":"i really liked this book i was immediately drawn into hattie's life in the beginning pages she made choices throughout her life good and bad that affected each of her children in different ways she is a complex character and with each chapter her decisions and actions became more clear it took me most of the book to warm up to her i definitely look forward to reading more ayana mathis","4126":"this story had such an original feel to it i was hooked from the first chapter and finished it feeling satisfied with the way that all the mini stories within it came together this is not a feel good overly ideal view on a family it's raw and real and heartbreaking at times but i enjoyed it more for that reality i think this is well worth diving in to","4127":"this is a difficult book to rate for one the book chronicles the lives of a family and its struggles i don't recall one uplifting aspect of the narrative second there was not one character i found relatable or respectable i don't know that i would recommend this to someone looking for a relaxing or enjoyable read however i may recommend this to someone interested in the great migration or woman focused literature","4128":"hattie and august's first babies are twins who die from pneumonia this death informs the rest of hattie's life the book then tells the story of each of her subsequent nine children as well as one of her grandchildren as a mother hattie was not a warm loving mother as her main focus was on clothing and feeding her children august wasn't much help he was a womanizer and did little to change the status quo we see in each of her children the effect her inability to show love has had this is a typical oprah book in that it deals with blacks and it's depressing it is however worth reading","4129":"sorry hattie your family is just not that interesting also wondering why the author is so obsessed in making just about every character an adulterer or a fornicator had to cut it short","4130":"fabulous book stayed up to read it in one sitting fascinating interpersonal relationship and character developementcan't wait for her next book","4131":"i wasn't able to give this novel the attention it deserved i think i would have liked it more had i read rather than listened to it the audio format demanded more attention than i could muster i felt removed from hattie and wished she had a stronger presence in each chapter so that there was more of a connection between them i don't plan to finish listening but will give it another chance in paper one day when i have the leisure to concentrate on the language","4132":"totally sad and depressing multigenerational poverty addiction no thanks","4133":"i was unimpressed throughout the majority of this book the themes and stories weren't unique enough although the writing was engaging near the end is where it started to turn for me and the story became deeper but overall i would really rate this 3 5 stars not horrible for a debut novel but not amazing either","4134":"the book had it's good parts and some interesting people it also seemed disconnected one chapter to the next maybe thats what the author was trying for saying that related people sometimes only have a very small but important thread with each other","4135":"a very different concept for a novel short stories linked by the main character but each story speaks of the struggles the emotional conflicts the social stigmas and issues and underlying all of this is the pursuit of a mother who was striving for a better life for herself and her children a better future these are all sad stories but the author does such a good job of developing each story and elaborating on a different issue in each short story","4136":"wow what a family","4137":"excellent read i found myself sympathizing with hattie even when i disagreed with a lot of the ways she handled things with her kids i guess being a parent i can see how all the things she went through in her life made her the way she was i can also see how all her experiences shaped her as a person and a parent","4138":"i listend to the audiobook and i liked the tale of hattie's life and her kids","4139":"each chapter is basically a short story detailing the sad and dysfunctional lives of hattie's children hattie herself was a bit of a mystery a mother who was harsh with her children but comes through in the end as a loving person","4140":"the book is well written but leaves the feeling that it isn't finished","4141":"six word review hattie shepherd loves with a fist","4142":"as mentioned by other reviewers this more a collection of short stories with related characters than a unified novel showing one character's growth and change over time it's not an uplifting story of motherhood hattie does the best she can in a bad environment but in her push to meet the most basic needs of her children food water shelter clothes she loses whatever ability she had to be loving and tender she's not sympathetic and neither is her husband who is an alcoholic womanizer the children portrayed in the book are also dysfunctional which is understandable given how they are raised the book illustrates vividly with writing that draws you in that dysfunction breeds dysfunction maybe this succeeds more as a description of life after the great migration","4143":" i have to admit that i almost stopped reading this book after the first chapter the heartwrenching story of the twins' death was almost too much but i figured the tragegy couldn't get much worse i was wrong so i continued like many other reviewers i have somewhat mixed feelings about this book i liked the overall writing and felt that the author painted a vivid picture of the events with her words as another reviewer said you could almost 'smell' and 'taste' the scenes however because of the way the book was written with each chapter introducing a different character with no relation to the previous chapters i found it difficult to connect with any of the characters each of their stories were so incredibly tragic so i felt sympathy for them but not a lot of empathy even with hattie because she was so emotionally detached i found it very difficult to feel anything for her even knowing her story so overall i would say that i liked the book ok and i appreciated the writing but i kept hoping and waiting for more connection and i would love to know what happens to sala","4144":"this book was a series of short stories because each chapter was about a different person but all were connected to hattie hattie had migrated to philadelphia from georgia as a young

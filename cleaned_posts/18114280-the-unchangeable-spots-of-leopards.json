book was everything i'd hoped it would be everything i thought it would be and then i got to the end and promptly forgot everything because it's utterly forgettable and cliched the calvino comparisons are premature misguided","2":"interesting but confusing and also entertaining i'm pretty sure i blew through this one too fast to really catch it all","3":"hmmm this book left me a little flat i didn't hate it but had difficulty caring about the characters style of the book is a little stream of consciousness drifting in and out of the story and stories within the story 2 of the central characters are writers i kept wanting the characters to snap out of it and move on with their lives not a waste of time just didn't do much for me","4":"i so wanted this to be based on the author's real life to really complete the story","5":"well it took him 12 years so it's tight he lost me a little with the literary genius and self absorption but i read the whole thing for the big reveal at the end where i thought i bet writer snobs love this stuff maybe writers are just writing for other writers after all and english professors picked it up in the super new section a the library some of my girlfriends might like it","6":" i loved his writing and i was going to rate it a 5 star up to the middle at the middle it became nonlinear and a bit acerbic more acerbic than need be also it became so nonlinear that it became hard to follow yet it was so well written that it deserves a 4 star rating... that alone is a feat so it's a story of a kid who learns he might just have an ability to write after an unexpected evening with the love of his high school life she encourages him to write about the evening with her which he does which then leads to his college life the writing is funny and spot on about his college life and experiences it's part two what was found that i have difficulty with he was so writing on a 5 star level until he went into this nonlinear guess what i want you to wonder about mode a great work about writers and how difficult it is to write a novel a great book about growing up and becoming an adult through turbulent college years his editors should have worked with him more about the second part of his book............","7":"this book is either an incredible tangle of metaphors or a hot mess i would read a chapter and decide that this was a masterpiece and couldn't wait to recommend it to friends the next chapter would leave me cold and confused definitely an author that i would like to see a second novel from in order to determine if i like his work","8":" the unnamed narrator of the unchangeable spots of leopards is an aspiring fiction writer who views the world for its literary possibilities instead of its reality debut author kristopher jansma masterfully plays with his audience throughout this novel teasing readers by blurring the lines between truth and lies plagiarism and acting and fiction and life the narrator claims his mantra is the line tell all the truth but tell it slant from emily dickinson's poem but i think the real inspiration for this novel comes from the last lines of that same poem the truth must dazzle gradually or every man be blind jansma's style of fold ing stories inside of stories inside of stories is refreshing and engaging and while his young and spoiled characters at times were grating i believe he made that choice intentionally the elevation of prose changed within each level of this novel which shows a truly remarkable control of storytelling and if all that weren't enough leopards also features my favorite country iceland and mentions halldor laxness whom i have a literary obsession with i very much look forward to future novels from jansma this is a mostly lighthearted and fun read one which i would recommend to any aspiring writers even if that aspiration has never produced actual writing","9":"it was difficult to rate this book the characters were not all that likeable there really wasn't a lot of action taking place and i'm not sure how well i even understood what the author actually had in mind however the prose is wonderful and the storytelling unique and quite clever i should probably give it a second reading sometime and then take part in a book discussion as i feel like i probably missed a lot or maybe that was the author's intention","10":" i absolutely adored this book this story was full of beautiful prose and was also a totally unique reading experience sometimes it felt like a collection of gorgeously written short stories and at other times like a page turning novel i loved the way the spiraling stories and switching of names and identities gave me a feeling of never being quite sure of things yet due to the strong themes of truth lies and story telling it never felt too 'meta' or so high concept as to be too challenging i really couldn't put it down also the narrator at times reminded me of richard in donna tartt's 'the secret history' and as that book is an absolute favorite of mine there is no higher compliment from me this book left me dying to talk about it with others i'm definitely going to recommend this to my book club thanks again tex for the loan of such a wonderful book","11":"i loved this way more than i expected to it's a book i only picked it up because it was available as an ebook from my public library and the bit about kristopher jansma being a cross between f scott fitzgerald and wes anderson but it ended up being delightful i liked how the text changed as the book went along and the meta meta meta approach to storytelling i can't wait for jansma's next book due out in february","12":"more nabokov than fitzgerald if you go by one of the many blurbs but i don't really see what the hype is about this is a well written book with a lot of clever bits and nicely composed lines but there is nothing in it that's compelling the unnamed author trope falls short in that it's hard to care about someone who knows himself so little especially when you don't even have a name to hang onto his overriding love for evelyn and adoration of julian jeffrey is all that keeps him going but it's not enough to empathize with and too minimal for a main character's driving force the structure is nice but i also have to disagree with the blurb that states that calling it postmodern wouldn't do it justice this book is the epitome of postmodern writing burdened with the author's own overly literary knowledge coyly self knowing and unafraid to wink continually at the reader just fractured enough that it seems confusingly smart but is really just kind of unfinished feeling in that way the wes anderson comparison is a good one since i always come away from his movies feeling like there was no real character development and no real story that i can mull with satisfaction once the credits roll i did want to like it and i did finish it but the conceit is so tiresome even for a short ish novel that i didn't feel at any point that if i put it down i'd be missing out on any great ending went with 3 stars for the effort of it but there are many far better books being written these days","13":"at first it took a while to get into but once your in your in and want more","14":"i really enjoyed reading this book sometimes it was difficult to decipher the between the author's truth and lies but overall i loved the author's description of his experience in loving a beautiful woman a not so beautiful woman and his friendship with an author as crazy as he is","15":" i loved loved loved the writing this was a book club book for me and during the discussion of the book someone mentioned that the book became more enjoyable for him once he decided to treat the book as a collection of related short stories rather than a regular novel that made perfect sense to me because i was a little uncomfortable with the way the narrator jumped around from one story to the next i would get wrapped up in one of his stories only to be dropped into yet another one the beginning of the book really sucked me in as the narrator told how as the son of an airline flight attendant he practically lived in an airport terminal while his mom was working and how he spent his time writing then the book moves on to his college experience and his relationship with julian another aspiring writer and on to his experience as a college professor and on to dubai and on to africa and on to iceland and on to luxembourg and finally back to the airport terminal it's possible that the book could be more about the writing process than about the narrator at any rate a very well written interesting read","16":"know how there are books that you're kinda iffy about but you feel like you have to read them this was one of those books for me i wasn't super keen on reading it but i felt like i had to because of all the buzz about it it's a cleverly written book the narrator is telling the story of writing the book basically he's also telling the story of his friendship and bitter rivalry with another writer julian aka jeffery the relationship that they had and they way they both acted made me really happy i wasn't a writer the narrator is crazy jealous over the life his friend has and julien is just crazy period and his fame makes is worse i don't know if they became writers because of that or being writers drew it out of them in the end it was an interesting book i listened to the audiobook and it was very well done it's short only 250 pages but it packs a big story in there it's definitely for the contemporary literature lovers out there very intriguing debut novel","17":"was nice to read something really different i enjoyed the book","18":" what a read at first i was a little put off by the typical literary tropes main character rising from humble beginnings meeting a wealthy eccentric best friend and then of course the gorgeous unattainable love interest i almost stopped reading but there are so many rich layers and twists through the course of this novel that it barely even matters what the baseline characters are without giving too much away i'll just say that this book gets richer and more engrossing the more you read and that it surprised and delighted me","19":"strange engrossing and fun quotes i like but i brace myself for the increasing likelihood that jeffrey is soaked through like a ladyfinger in a caraway tiramisu p 202 'a book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us' kafka p 207","20":" the unchangeable spots of leopards hits a reading sweet spot for me it's a concise well told narrative a series of short stories that add up to a complete novel all overlaid with a postmodern evaluation of the nature of fiction so the book gets off to a great start and the opening chapters stories deliver on the initial promise they are compelling touching and memorable reminiscent of michael chabon's initial work however as the book progresses i felt a loss of momentum and i had more of a so what reaction at the end of a section instead of an oh wow because the narrator is a habitual liar the book is about the relation between lies and truth i expected that the stories might wander far afield but the latter portions of the book seem more absurd more contrived and thus less compelling i enjoyed the book i gained insight into the nature of fiction and how truth can be woven from lies that said i was disappointed so how to rate the book it began as five stars for me and then i reasonably took away a star for the latter portion but then i irrationally took away another star for my disappointment i wanted the book to be much more than it turned out to be this is jansma's first novel i'll certainly keep my eye out for his next which may more fully deliver on his initial promise","21":"read other people's reviews but i was totally caught up in this book while understanding why other people rated it less highly find out for yourself","22":"at first i thought this was going to be a whimsical take on the sad young literary men novels that i'm getting a little tired of but then it ended up being a but more clever and winking cheekily plays with truth and plagiarism and lying and doubling and appropriation and fiction and homage and etc never achieved any kind of emotional depth but wasn't working too hard in that particular direction fun quick worth a peek","23":" can a leopard ever really change his spots can a person ever change these are the timeless questions that kristopher jansma asks in this enchanting debut novel about three great friends two men and one woman their triumphs and failures in life and love and their globe spanning adventures from the jazz clubs of manhattan to the villages of sri lanka these three remarkably engaging characters grow up and grow old fall in and out of love write novels and wed wealthy european aristocrats what a pleasant surprise jansma's book is thought provoking funny heartfelt and unpredictable he also writes with perfect pacing knowing just when to shift gears and tell the story in a fresh way it's rare i've read a novel that so completely captivated my attention while also challenging my assumptions and while i can't say i loved the characters i was consistently interested in them and was glad to follow along in their journey highly recommended","24":"very entertaining read about a writer it did require some allowance for imaginative scenerios like your lover becoming a royal princess and a wild cat finding you in the dark the narration had a high fidelity mixed with lonely planet feeling overall a good novel","25":" i loved this book not the best thing ever but thoroughly enjoyable i can understand why some might not like it but for me it was very amusing and full of easter eggs i have no doubt that as i go over bits of the book in my head i will fall more and more in love with it it is also one of those books that i think if you go in with high expectations you'll feel disappointed although not b c the book is bad but b c you'll miss its beauty i selected this book as a book club read after having first seen it on a staff recommendations shelf at a small bookstore and second having read that the village voice said it was f scott fitzgerald meets wes anderson i didn't know what that meant but i definitely wanted to find out especially being a wes anderson fan through much of the first half i wondered why the village voice had written that then suddenly i got it from then on it was just a fun ride it reminded me of when i was watching adaptation and suddenly got it once you get it you or at least i start seeing all these easter eggs recognizing the allusions to other great authors' works and lives as well as to parts of itself it made me want to start all over at the beginning just to see what i missed i haven't done that yet but when flipping through earlier bits to check some things out i instantly saw connections that i had missed on first reading i have no doubt that if i should go back and reread it i'd find it even more amusing yes it's confusing it's deadpan that's its beauty kind of just like a wes anderson movie","26":"when one chances on a unique book one doesn't question it one just reads and allows him or herself to get washed away in its beauty of words and language and so to say enjoy the experience for whatever time it lasts there are very few works of art that manage to bring that out in me and when they do then i do not think twice about giving in the giving in process then takes place on its own before you know it the novel has claimed you and you are in a trance you wait for the book to be over and then want some more the characters do not let go and you are waiting wondering what to read next this happens to me most of the time and it happened off late when i finished reading \"the unchangeable spots of leopards\" by kristopher jansma it was the title that did it for me sometimes titles play a very important role in luring the reader to pick up the book and give it a go i have always believed in that and this time as well it worked for me the book is about a writer who wants his life to change and thereby his tale begins he is the narrator of the book and he is out there to confess it all - of all that took place and how he got to be where he is at the narrator is an enigma of sorts he isn't named throughout the book his so called nemesis is also his friend - julian mcgann is at the height of the literary peak and the narrator isn't anywhere close to that he is struggling with his book and only wants it to be the very best amidst all this but of course is a woman to sort of complete the story julian's enchanting friend evelyn the mysterious girl who got away and the narrator hankers after the narrator is almost caught in two worlds - that of fiction and reality trying to make sense of life and his story let me also tell you that this is a debut novel and it is beyond brilliant jansma has followed only one rule while writing this book there are no rules to writing to me that is a bold step which totally works where the writing style is concerned it sometimes reads as a meta novel sometimes just random sentences that come together beautifully and sometimes just confusing which makes sense after a while there are losses along the way that the narrator faces and the reader's heart goes out to him the read is challenging it does take some time to get into the skin of the characters however once you are into it you understand the method in the sort of madness the story takes place almost around the globe which to me was one of the other highlights the pace works like a charm and before you know it you are done with this rollercoaster of an experience it is pleasure to absorb just about everything in this book it is clever funny romantic and sullen as well \"the unchangeable spots of leopards\" is about life","27":"wonderfully confusing made me think i love unreliable narrators","28":"i didn't enjoy this book at all perhaps i've missed something the point of it all not quite sure","29":"not my kind of novel the intricate and some might say clever plot kind of kept me going but the characters were so unlikeable that the whole book just kind of left a bad taste in my mouth","30":"i liked this much more by the end than i thought i would half way through i do wish i knew what the narrator's actual name was that irks but i need to read it again it begins where it ends where it begins and only after getting all the way through it do you understand where you started still can't figure out why the narrator's best friend's name changes midway through the novel","31":" this book defies description picaresque in style the talented mr who traverses the world kristopher jansma is a busy young man not only able to write his first novel but carry a full teacher's load at suny this debut novel has been described as a funhouse of a book referencing such authors as the reader recalls for me the two biggest influences seem to have been italo cavino for the interbedded nested stories and martin amis specifically the information at one point a story within a story within a story blatantly recalls a plot more familiar as a scene from a movie based on a book and one character asks another does this remind you of anything and i say yes but woven together so slyly cavino is referenced at one point that the jokes do not seem self serving but respectful because i asked what he was reading and if he finished everything he started he inscribed my book as follows i really hope you will love this book and finish it i did mr jansma i did","32":"lovely story not like the usual books i've read and that was a good thing","33":"i got this book in the mail and tossed it on my bed a few days later after a housewarming party i came in and started reading it even though it was late and i was kind of drunk it wrapped me up right away immediately engaging it begins with the narrator describing how he lost a manuscript the first of many in the airport terminal where his mother left him while she worked as a flight attendant it follows his high school days working in a museum cafe his meeting with julian and evelyn and his travels all over the world pieces of his own fiction crop up here and there perfect complements to the truth but often indiscernible from it writers and artists will especially like this book for a couple reasons first for the fantasy it presents as the lives of career writers who spend their time drinking zubrowka vodka going to iceland and quoting hemingway at each other second because i think we can all identify with the jealousy of a friend with more talent it's a deceptively fast read with clean prose that hides a lot of insightful ideas and i felt a bit of a different person after i finished it i was reading about the narrator in manhattan dubai and luxembourg and i was thinking about how much i wanted to be in those places too how i'd finally do interesting things and meet exciting people if i could only go to other places then there's a scene at the grand canyon and the narrator says out of all the wonders of the world this is the only one that lives up to the hype i only live a few hours from the grand canyon and i've never seen it i live right next to other beautiful places i ignore and i live in a huge city full of people who are as interesting as people anywhere but i don't even try to find them i just keep waiting until i can go to france or whatever which i'm not even sure i can ever do so i booked a weekend trip to sedona because i've never been there either and i'm bringing this book with me to read again i don't know if this is a permanent change or just me feeling restless from reading so much about other places but either way i'm looking at my life in a new light and i think that's one of the most incredible things a book can do","34":"writing itself is great but story was too choppy for my taste","35":"this is my second reading of this wonderful story after finishing it the first time i felt like i wanted to start all over again however i waited almost a year to me the story was just as engaging as the first time but i picked up so many nuances that i had missed the first time i find myself pondering what exactly happened and with an unreliable narrator it's sometimes heard to tell what is truth and what is not and i guess that's the point it is so intriguing i may just read it again","36":"this was a really fun book to read the main characters self destructive in the driven artist way are a little hard to like at times but the way this story is told is brilliant i had a hard time putting it down once i picked it up definitely recommend it","37":"great book i had high expectations due to the reviews and was very happy that this lived up to them it does remind me a bit of wes anderson's films quirky and heavily character based i will definitely re read this at some point in time","38":" this novel shows some talent but on the whole it doesn't hang together well it's marred by too many stylistic tricks and gimmicks that seem to have been added as a way to get the manuscript to cohere when it wouldn't have otherwise if you take away the tricks the gimmicks and the shifting locales now africa now luxembourg now iceland you aren't left with much i'm afraid jansma may go on to write a strong novel in the years ahead but this novel despite its occasional glimmers of real talent can't be considered as such","39":"quite enjoyed this book great writing it has its confusing moments as it's basically a story wrapped in a story wrapped in a story in essence the same story is told with three different albeit the same protagonists i will admit that i did go back and re read the beginning after getting to the end everyone's a character except when they're not \"somewhere in this empty space between my lies and fictions is the truth \"","40":" be prepared to be wowed by the depth of writing from first time author kristopher jansma he shows moments of brilliance as he develops plots within plots and seamlessly switches between past present and everywhere in between you can't help but think jansma had great fun writing the book and it plays out on the pages spoken in first person narrative jansma plays with the mind of his readers as he never actually reveals the true identity of the narrator personally i found it intriguing it keeps the reader off kilter guessing who is actually telling the story and wondering if at some point they will find out a mystery is always good right likened to salinger capote and hemingway jasma has no difficulty pulling off not only a book of literary fiction but one that is filled with humorous undertones and a cast of eccentric characters an example of which is jasma's haunted julian mcgann also named jeffrey and anton depending on which story his is written into a brilliant writer who sequesters himself with nothing but cases of alcohol and cigarettes chained to drunken madness shutting out the world as he weaves his thoughts into novels could jasma in fact be channeling hemingway with mcgann's character the polar opposite to mcgann is the narrator a man as it turns out that has questionable morals he lies drinks and sleeps his way around the world living off the backs of people he uses a different identity in each of his incarnations professor writer college student and scorned lover he loves evelyn who is a friend of mcgann's a broadway actress from a wealthy family who marries an indian geologist japanese royal or a luxembourg prince no matter who it is another man the unchangeable spots of leopards is a tale of enlightenment and self awakening a coming of age story the book reads like it contains a moral left for the reader to decipher in their own way for me was about making the right choice be it good or bad for others it may be completely different or they may not find a moral at all all i know is the book was refreshing it is one of those all engrossing reads that you are sure to keep picking up a friend to crawl into again and again bottom line the book is un put down able disclaimer this book was given to me by viking penguin group for an honest and unbiased review","41":"it's never a good sign when you have 50 pgs left in a book but drop it like a hot potato when a new book is waiting for you at the library parts of this story are really good but i kind of lost my way 2 3 of the way in why do these characters have more than one name","42":"this book looked interesting and i was enjoying it until i read this sentence on page 13 emphasis mine i loved to play but the other boys on the team hated me because i was better than them and because my mother was a flight attendant and didn't belong to the briar creek country club like their mothers did if the author can't manage to write a grammatically correct sentence and if the author's editor can't manage to correct his client's atrocious grammar then i don't have the time to read this book especially as this is a book about being a writer","43":" i am collecting a little treasure trove of novels about books and writing and i will quite happily tuck this debut in there i know not everyone appreciates these kinds of clever books written by book nerds for book nerds but i do i love this unreliable narrator a writer who calls himself nobody i love his meta storytelling and i love the way jansma packs in the literary allusions not so much as a test for the reader but as sincere homage the plot travels revolves around three lovely young people with big ambitions our narrator nobody his best friend and literary rival julian and julian's glamorous friend evelyn the story of their intertwining affections and relationships is interesting enough on its own but the way that jansma buries stories within stories books within books was what really made me fall for the unchangeable spots of leopards file this one with cloud atlas if on a winter's night a traveler and mr penumbra's 24 hour bookstore for its well drawn characters intricate plotting and many buried treats for book nerds","44":"phenomenal debut novel one of these insanely clever and well written books that actually made me read the first chapter all over again once i'd finished it just to see if i could keep up with it second time round can't wait to see what this author produces in the future very gifted erudite and so bloody young it's not fair he'd better not be good looking on top of all that","45":"this book has some great postmodern trickery going on and it didn't even all click until the end i think i'd like to reread it at some point and pay better attention to see exactly what the author did along the way my only real gripe is the story got a little too cute at the end but it was redeemed for the most part by the last chapter very promising first novel and i look forward to reading more of his work jackie when you read this i definitely recommend","46":"why would i put it on my book discussion shelf if i put it on my abandoned shelf i could use a reason to try again i really dove into this book and read non stop and then i just tired of it","47":"neat collection of short stories that tell a young man's life","48":"things that were found like this book a crafty and flat out enjoyable read for me anyway you may hate it but i doubt it","49":"highly recommended even read for an hour at 4am while hubby was settling toddler","50":" the truth is that i actually have the greatest respect for those fantastic liars says the narrator after occasionally dabbling in adopted personae he is now basking in comfortable shoes teaching but under a stolen identity someday i'd like to teach a class entirely about them late great american fakes my humble thesis will be that america no longer desires the truth only the reasonable facsimile thereof like battered lovers we're willing to settle our sense of values still holds us to dismiss that which we know outright to be blatant lies but we avoid the truth with equal intensity we wish to remain in the gray interregnum of half belief when at all possible jansma leads us through a winding tale that mixes truth lies love and conflict to illustrate the struggle for identity of his hero i enjoyed his wry humor and whimsically exaggerated adventures","51":"i think this author thought he wrote a better book than he actually did although my five year old said it had the best book title ever","52":"as a writer and a writing teacher i'm really glad i read this book i have to disagree with the blurb's characterization of the narrator as hopelessly unreliable i use unreliable to describe a narrator who willfully or deliberately lies to the reader to me it's a literary device used by the author to manipulate the reader as a means to an end usually enabling the author to drop a big twist at the end here the narrator is reconstructing the past as we all do in a light more favorable to himself and or more protective of his self image whether it works or not is another question in addition as a writer the habit of invention is so deeply ingrained that it becomes nearly impossible for him to tell the strict or literal truth indeed he has been trained that the truth can only been seen on the slant in neither of these cases does he set out to deceive the question for you and me is what is the truth the literal facts or the emotional truth behind them the spots on the leopard or the color of its coat discuss","53":"this book was amazing i loved what it brought and found myself flying though the book","54":"this book never seems to get anywhere just when things get interesting it skips ahead eight years to something totally different which i found very frustrating","55":" this is a story i'd like to read again maybe in a few years after reading a few hundred more books i think i may grasp it differently than i do now that being said i really liked it it's quirky i like quirk i like following the story lines different in name and setting but same in personality and relationships reads like short stories it's fun challenging to follow but when you do meet that challenge it's with a smile and full of literary echoes i like the frustration in the writing the consuming terrifying blissful rage filled moments writers feel there's something in the friendships that makes me think of hemingway's the sun also rises one of my favourites certainly this year","56":" these stories are all true but only somewhere else so says the narrator of kristopher jansma's appealing yet frustrating novel in stories the unchangeable spots of leopards from an early age he wanted to be a writer and he simply can't stop reinventing himself and the situations around him as a teenager in north carolina he introduces himself as a character in a wilkie collins novel when pressed into service escorting a girl he is enamored with to her debutante ball in college in the berkshires he meets the eccentric and talented julian mcgann a flamboyant writer whose skill inspires rivalry and inspiration--julian's career reaches great heights while the narrator finds himself benefiting only when julian's mania gets the best of him but in addition to the inspiration julian provides he also introduces the narrator to the beautiful evelyn a world weary actress with whom he becomes quickly enamored evelyn is certainly fond of the narrator but enjoys the control she has over him and the two have an on again off again relationship for years when evelyn finally decides to get married the behavior of julian and the narrator lead to the trio having a falling out that lasts for more than 10 years that's where the book falls off the rails in my opinion suddenly the narrator is impersonating a college professor telling tales to a newlywed couple in dubai writing papers for college students in sri lanka searching for his salinger esque friend in ghana and at a writer's retreat in iceland and tracking his one true love or is she in luxembourg julian mcgann is now inexplicably called jeffrey oakes and evelyn's wedding to an indian scientist somehow is transmogrified into a wedding with a prince from luxembourg and the conclusion in the same airport where the book began is a little magical but a little perplexing i think jansma is a terrific writer and i loved the first half of the book the relationships between the characters the adventures they found themselves in the rivalry between writers all were compelling and enjoyable but when you have a main character who is more enamored with reinventing the truth at every turn you don't know what to believe or when what you're reading will suddenly turn into something else i kept waiting for some sort of explanation about which parts were true--was his friend's name julian or jeffrey who did evelyn marry but the narrator and the book were mum on these details i love books that leave you guessing and i love those that challenge the truth but i struggled with this book because it never tied things up for me perhaps it was never meant to but in the end i thought this was a book with tremendous potential that sadly and somewhat frustratingly was never realized","57":"a writer writing about writing and his struggles with writing i'll definitely reread this at some point to fully grasp all the characters","58":"meta meta meta this thing turns back in on and references itself so many times that it's got more switchbacks than a mountain pass in a word wonderful it's a must read for anybody who doubts the ability of literary fiction to entertain and be considered high art at the same time i won't say more because to do so would be to ruin it","59":" this was different from anything i've read before i don't even know where to begin to talk about it so will have to come back to this review later later the author continually referred to the theme of the woman that got away and the friend who became more famous there were also many references to his gold wristwatch and to gold in general gold paintings leaf etchings etc maybe someone more accomplished at analyzing literature and all could explain to me why there was the same theme every chapter but some of the details kept changing the famous friend's name the name of the woman who got away and the location she moved to etc the first chapter was even the same as the rest except that it was a high school girl and her popular brother i thought that those characters were similar to the other chapters","60":"i liked this book there was energy to the narrator and to the story and the many locations appealed to my own sense of wanderlust it didn't hurt that part of the book was set in ghana i have more to say about this book but i just finished and i think i need to think about it a bit first","61":"i found this an uneven book it started off good i like the first two chapters stories hated the next two chapters where the characters were insufferable pretentious early twenty somethings though maybe that was the point of the author the characters were supposed to be unlikable like that still no fun to read the book picked up again once the main character left the usa it wobbled again in the iceland chapter but redeemed itself at the end as long as you don't expect too much you could be entertained by this book","62":"cant wait to discuss this one with my book group definitely a candidate for favorite book of the year","63":" when tony asked me what i thought of this book while i was reading it i kept telling him i didn't know how can you not know he asked because i can't decide this is another title i received as part of penguin's first flights program meaning another debut novel this tells the story of a writer one who has lost every book he's ever written one who seems to be exceedingly well versed in the art of deception and reinvention one whose glimpses into his secrets and stories make it difficult to believe a word he says i often struggle with unreliable narrators sometimes it's more work than i feel like doing while reading a novel but when it adds something wonderful to the story it can be a truly exciting experience this is what i meant when i said i didn't know how i felt about my book i couldn't decide if the narrator was making me work harder than i wanted to or creating a truly unique and fascinating experience with the novel in the end i still don't have an answer i do know that this is perhaps the quickest i've read an adult book in a long time compulsively reading and turning pages as quickly as i could i know that the book is exciting and really different i do know that as i was reading and once i finished i wanted someone to discuss the book with this is a stellar debut full of interesting ideas and unusual happenings i will definitely be looking to see what else jansma has up his sleeve and i will be bothering tony to read this one so we can discuss it","64":"a little off beat but overall an enjoyable read","65":"one of those you never fully know what's going on kind of books which means i never fully relate to the characters it doesn't help that you never find out the narrator's name and his friends' names keep changing but lots of interesting locations and insight into writers' warped minds","66":"a throughly enjoyable book the writing is unlike anything i've read before the maim character spends lots of time researching subjects in for his writing and it seems the author did the same the descriptions and the characters are so unique and well developed a very smart and enjoyable story","67":"would be 2 5 stars if goodreads ratings came in halves seems intended for former english majors those who can pick up on its myriad and sometimes clever allusions and those who believe that the greatest of human accomplishments is to be immortalized in print so i thought i'd like it but ended up finding it self absorbed and pretentious","68":" given the narrator a writer who loses manuscript after manuscript who could resist a book with an introductory page that reads if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact the publishers the three main characters are two writers and an actor each of whom invents and reinvents themselves over the course of ten years the underlying questions that struck me were the following 1 can we know who we are 2 can we choose identities for ourselves without those identities overtaking us 3 can we choose to change ourselves over time or do we possess the unchangeable spots of leopards","69":"an interesting read and a nice break from cerebral academics kind of quirky but well done","70":"my problem with this book is that when it is great it is wonderful but it spends too much time lagging and wandering between excellent moments also the preface is the best part","71":"this was honestly the most unique piece of literature i have ever encountered i am surprised now that i put it down for a six month period without ever having the desire to pick it back up again until i forced myself to a few days ago since then i have hardly been able to put it down i am truly at a loss for words to accurately explain my feelings on this novel and that rarely ever happens it was witty beautiful confusing in a good way and honest in the most dishonest way possible this is definitely a book i would love to re read and will be encouraging others to pick up as well i look forward to seeing what else kristopher jansma produces","72":"i had this from the library for a total of five weeks and couldn't get past the first chapter i might try it again when my kids are in school and i can concentrate then again i might not","73":"i feel incepted i'm still not entirely sure what the true story was but then again maybe that's the whole point very unlike anything else in recent memory","74":"what a weird and fun book this turned out to be from the start you know that the narrator isn't going to be the most reliable of people and proceeds to churn out various stories that may or may not be true about his relationship with a famous author and a female actress reads a bit like a collection of short stories even though they are all linked together","75":"reminded me of the great gatsby following a hapless young writer as he chases a rich and crazy rich mate there is also the unrequited love of a socialite although familiar the author made you feel like the story was new again","76":" i read this book in just a day it was impossible to put down i loved that the author keeps you guessing you never know what is the truth or what is part of his book within a book at one point there is even a book within a book within a book the iterations were fascinating the narrative follows the life of an author from his first story at the age of 8 to his twisted attempts at life and novels in middle age he travels across countries and identities and the descriptions of other characters' thoughts and far flung reaches of the globe are amazing and poignant loved this truthful glimpse into a writer's brain","77":" i almost rated this one star and that was factoring in my debut star bump i decided to go with two because in contemplating this i believe jansma is probably a better author than this book suggests also because i read an advance i wanted to allow for the fact that perhaps there was a final rewrite that made this better than what i read this felt as if the author was trying way to hard to be clever inventive and witty as if he could just see the reviews saying witty inventive in the end the only thing he came up with that was inventive was the title this was confusing if it was anything for example why did one of the main character's names change half way through it why did the country of the prince change was it because i was reading an uncorrected proof i certainly hope so otherwise it made absolutely no sense whatsoever one review i read suggested that perhaps this was written for writers okay but aren't writers also readers in fact i dare to postulate that the best writers are also great readers they know what appeals to them in a story i don't see this being as successful in the longterm as this initial buzz would seem to indicate i know i for one am glad i read an advance and didn't waste the money on this wish i could say the same about my time","78":"a globe spanning story with an unreliable narrator that engages you and makes you think all along the way beautifully written explores the concept of what is really the truth reminds me of a more accessible david mitchell book loved it jansma should be a household name this guy is good","79":" not all the leopards are metaphorical...look i won't claim there aren't disappointments but after decades of selecting books for myself i've gotten pretty good at guessing what i'm going to like and from the first time i heard even the briefest description of the unchangeable spots of leopards it was high on my must read list i mean seriously the title alone somehow it just spoke to me and i wasn't disappointed but the odd thing is when i read the jacket copy the part that i really honed in on was about the rivalry between the two writers and while certainly that is an element of the novel's plot such as it is that's not the part that i should have been paying attention to no it was phrases like \"search for identity \" \"web of lies \" and \"exploration of the nature of truth and storytelling\" that are really at the crux of kristopher jansma's exciting debut novel let's back up... there have been some fantastic novels that blurred the lines between fact and fiction through a variety of narrative devices in life of pi yann martel opened the novel in direct address to readers eventually becoming the character of the writer and when the bridges of madison county was published a few decades ago so many readers wrote to the national geographic believing the tale was true that they made a museum exhibit of the correspondence i digress but the opening of the unchangeable spots of leopards brought these examples to mind because the first page after the table of contents says this \"if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience \"interesting we move on but that opening note is never quite forgotten and this tale begins again in direct address to readers in the form of an author's note it launches \"i've lost every book i've ever written \" and the narrator tells the tale of that first loss you will learn of others along the way the last line incidentally of that author's note is this \"these stories all are true but only somewhere else \" and this coming after not one not two but three separate epigraphs on the nature of truth interesting the novel's first person narrator seems earnest enough but be prepared for sleight of hand--or whatever the literary equivalent might be the storytelling here is unconventional it's meta fictional it's challenging it's non linear it's literary and oh yes it is always interesting jansma's characters are... well to be honest they're not all that likable when you get right down to it but they're well drawn enough for familiarity to breed contempt and in the scheme of unlikable characters these ones are not so unpleasant as to put you off from following their journey you'll note that i did not describe them as \"believable \" because there's a heightened quality about the trio at the center of the tale and the circumstances they find themselves in as they chase and or flee each other around the globe jansma isn't trying to replicate reality there is artifice throughout and it's very intentional his writing is fantastic it's read aloud eminently quotable just a pleasure to absorb everything about this novel is stylish stylized and sophisticated it's also very funny it's gonzo romantic clever and the sort of book to remind readers and writers both why they do what they do in short this is an exhilarating debut novel my instincts were right on this time score one for me","80":"enjoyable book which has a nice twist to it","81":"9 5 10 really liked it great characters and story and i liked the narrator need to read again at some point since i devoured it too quickly the first time best book i've read so far this year","82":" this was lots of fun to read a core story among short stories that purports to be the truth and other stories written fictionalizing that and all progressing over time who knows what is the original truth if there is one one major character's name changes unexplained about halfway through certainly suggesting that all the stories before or after that are fiction despite their origins in each other in reading this i am reminded of await your reply which in addition to being quite a thriller was about identity and identity theft also about one character trying to locate another i am also reminded of the white hotel which told substantially the same story perhaps by a mental patient several times from several points of view","83":"one of the more unique and engaging novels i've read in quite some time the unchangeable spots of leopards is an exploration into the nature of truth through the use of the unreliable narrator device in a fresh exciting way after finishing it i found an insatiable desire to go back and read it again","84":"i loved this book it is going on my list of all time favorites","85":"for me the first and last chapters really set this book apart from others the friendship between our storyteller and his friend competitor drives most of the story but i wouldn't call that the strong part of the book the struggle to find the right words by the main character seems distracting as well having said that i still give it 4 stars because it is an impressive book everyone needs to experience it in their own way to decide","86":"use of a narrative device unreliable is he telling the truth or not didn't work for me and i didn't feel connected to the characters seemed forced","87":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here had really high hopes for this book after reading a sample on ibooks but was gradually disappointed the beginning of the book from narrating his childhood airport days up till the college years were 4 5 star worthy along with the plot getting more and more unbelievable as the book progressed cue the metaphors on suspended disbelief fictional stories etc the characters grew more melodramatic and unsympathetic all the female characters were very flat and i especially wish i knew more ab had really high hopes for this book after reading a sample on ibooks but was gradually disappointed the beginning of the book from narrating his childhood airport days up till the

interesting but also written flatly male characters were just ridiculous and the metaphors time spots jungle cats etc just hit me over the head too many times honestly disappointed more","88":"if jansma meant for this book to satirize itself then it's funny if not then it's not very good it's a book about writers struggling to write well by an author who is struggling to write well he clearly wanted to do something clever and layered all things i enjoy but it was not done well it felt like it was written by a precocious teenager who might eventually be a good writer but was not there yet","89":"this started out okay and then petered out at times it comes across as a bit pretentious it's hard to write about writing it seems very inward focused the constant diversions into more embedded plot lines is a bit like borges but lacking the richness","90":"the first words of the book should give a greater foreshadowing to the rest of the book if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslettu0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience the story played out in a complex but not complicated mix of multiple novels within other novels","91":"wow a lovely twisting turning plot or is it names and details beautifully written and just a little bit sad","92":"amazing book will read it again","93":"a literary masterpiece in its interconnected episodic plot merry christmas","94":"this felt like goldfinch lite someone reinventing himself being snarky drinking a lot zzzz funny at times but never believable or engaging","95":"i really liked this book but if asked why i wouldn't be able to tell you it was crazy confusing and compelling all at the same time tell all the truth but tell it slanted is a quote by emily dickinson that has an important impact on the plot of this book the main character is nameless entity who goes by many names in his quest to become a writer a college professor teaches the narrator to tell the truth but to tell it slanted the narrator takes this to heart lecturing others about the essential influence of deception in literature he holds back his own truths to his friends lovers and even to himself he loses himself in deceptions which affects his writing at times i was not sure where the direction of the plot was taking me the book is divided into two sections what was lost and what was found each part is consistent with the general plot lines but details such as names and locations have been changed which part is the truth which part is slanted is anything true and if so to what extent at one point the narrator talks about how truth is manipulated to convince readers to think and feel certain ways maybe that's why i liked it the author convinced me through the power of persuasion and manipulation through fiction","96":"received from goodreads i was uncertain about this book going into the second chapter when the story started to take a different route than the first chapter i thought it was going to be one novel but the story took many different turns and the characters many different names it went far beyond my expectations i couldn't put the book down for the life of me finishing it in about 3 hours this novel was so unique with each chapter a different puzzle piece while following the overall plot absolutely fantastic kudos to the author for pulling this idea off many others would not have been able to","97":"i didn't really enjoy this book that much i debated abandoning it several times but continued to trudge through it the first two chapters were pretty good but after that i just found it really boring very talented mr ripleyish at times","98":"i want to like this book because it is unpredictable and unique but it's missing a soul i think the author wants to express something but i have no idea what that is i found the characters lacking in any sort of appeal relateability and evolution","99":"the village voice called this f scott fitzgerald meets wes anderson which is the sort of blurb that draws me to a book like a shark to chum to say i was disappointed in the product here is an understatement there are three major characters in this book and they're all priviliged pretentious assholes you spend the book rooting against i don't think jansma is necessarily a bad writer but i found nothing to recommend about this effort","100":"this is one of the most breathtaking incredible novels i've ever read everything about this book the writing the characters the story the twist at the end that brings the entire piece together this is a truly remarkable piece of work u0026amp i wish that i had the words to fully describe how amazing i think it is","101":"this is a really well written inventive book there were parts of it though that i just wanted to skip through not sure why i kind of felt like i knew where it was headed and i was kinda right i don't mean to lessen it's brilliance though these characters and the lessons will stick with me for some time a very good read over all","102":" i wanted to love this book it is certainly original and also quite clear that jansma has a talent to share with the world to be fair i was taken in by the first chunk of this book and then again towards the end in the last two chapters but the middle nearly lost my attention too much chaos too many lengthy interjections our narrator struggles to be a writer while his best friend struggles because his is one and jansma inserts his work into the story while i like the idea there was too much of it for my particular taste at one point in the arc copy anyway the story our narrator is working on lasts for 20 pages afterward which it took me nearly the next 100 or so to get back into the main story thus the frustration as the main story i liked quite a bit okay so i almost tossed the book due to all the interjections but in the end i am glad that i stuck with it if only to see how jansma wrapped up the beginning i liked so much it will be interesting to see what jansma does next","103":"one of the few books that after i finished it made me immediately want to retread it a bit gatsbyesque but fascinating look at writing","104":"i enjoyed the first half but not the second half so much","105":"damnit i was just going to call this catch me if you can meets f scott fitzgerald until i noticed the side blurb that calls it wes anderson means fsf must mean it's true","106":" this book eventually made a full circle and won me over but it took awhile i listened to the audio production which is excellent but the characters keep morphing and i found it difficult to keep track of them in the first few chapters i was also confused by the time period everything about the manic writing jazz clubs plays boarding schools etc was screaming 1920s 1950s in my mind yet the story actually takes place in the 1990s 2000s for some reason i was always jarred by the mention of airports and recent cultural events references","107":" what a book what a book a good book according to me is actually defined by its last sentence you should stay intrigued until the second last sentence but the last sentence should draw the whole thing together and it did this book is about life thinking you love the person you wanna love 'cos it looks good and leaving the person you really love 'cos it doesn't suit your plans having friends you betray but many years later you reconcile because you realize you've both been scumbags and you're better of being scumbags together the real life of stealing ideas wandeting around being clueless hurting people finding yourself in akward situations nearly turning mad and in the end seeing your life for what it is and trying to do the right thing this is a must read for sure","108":"i listened to this on audiobook and loved it i think there is one more star to be had here from me and i'm surprising even myself here by saying that i am going to buy the book and actually read it judging from the reviews here i am not the only person who felt that this work of fiction is worthy of at least a second go around i must say i felt slightly confused for the first part of the book but once i let go and just went along for the ride i was more than captivated there is a lot here to digest so many stories and so many questions this conjuring of tall tales is perfect reading for anyone who enjoys reading about writing or writers and also for those of us who marvel at make believe that is so original and so well done bravo to this new young author look out for my next review of the same book and hopefully one more star","109":"there are so many problems with this book questionable treatment of people of color the author has met either no gay men or too many he's not comfortable writing women the story writes itself up its own ass in the last 25 pages i should not have liked it as much as i did i blew through it i enthusiastically looked forward to the next round of story telling it avoided pretention when the story all but begged for it much of the imagery was exquisite in its effortlessness it tied most of the story together without a mawkish or overly packaged quality it's not the best book i've read this year but my thoughts keep drifting back to it","110":"it was very well written but the characters were a little too privileged a little too precious and twee for me the coincidences were a little too coincidental the accidents a little too accidental the cleverness a little too clever but did i mention it was well written beautifully written but a little too beautifully written can you dig it","111":"unusual challenging full of phrases i want to record in a journal of favorite literary phrases such as they bring up their phones and hold them at arms length like so many yorick's skulls a book for readers","112":"connelly is fantastic as ever","113":"maybe i'm just not high brow enough to understand the puzzles or low brow enough to find the pleasure i was able to look past the fitzgerald hemingway mix in the first half to find some parts that were enjoyable and relatable to bits of my past but i was really turned off by the left turn of the second half of the novel i felt like the author was just writing some loosely connected short stories whilst trying out the different writing styles of his favorite authors the second half also felt at times like it veered from fiction into an article from the nation chronicling the plight of some poor third world country sure i learned some stuff about the people of sri lanka and ghana but the journalistic style didn't really seem to fit that well or move the plot forward in a meaningful way","114":" the narrator of the unchangeable spots of leopards is the ultimate phony i borrow holden caufield's word intentionally as this book owes a tip of the hat to salinger with liberal doses of fitzgerald and hemingway as well it was well written and enjoyable enough but julian and especially evelyn never matured into three dimensional characters the narrator even seemed to realize he never saw evelyn as anything other than the stereotypical manic pixie dream girl but at that point their relationship had passed it's sell by date and she faded off stage into two dimensions as for the narrator himself his constant self reinvention to the point of having no idea who the hell he is coupled with a desire for fame and fortune certainly hit the current reality tv star obsessed american ethos on the head but much like the reality stars themselves he was ultimately a hollow man who left this reader feeling rather empty there are some gems of ideas about writing in here and the conceit of the book is fairly original but it's not a book who's words i want to be my last i guess i'll have to look up that jeffrey oakes book for that","115":"i loved this book especially the two page rant about how to become the favorite professor but also the quest for love and identity that is the core of the story and all of the lies and stories we tell ourselves and others a long the way","116":"i liked it at first but when he started writing about a guy writing about a guy i stopped reading boring","117":"one of the best books i have read in years the layering of storytelling and use of language is masterful an especially high recommendation for writers and english majors","118":"actually 4 5 interesting and humorous this book is full of lies or perhaps just different ways of seeing the truth either way by the end i had a coherent whole and a great affection for this most unreliable of narrators","119":" a wonderful twisty well researched well narrated debut novel and you know how i love my unreliable narrators still if the tenuous nature of truth and the unreliability of memory as well as writing are what you're looking for as well as stories within stories then i'd have to say that oyeyemi's mr fox is far superior to tusol not only does she address these issues in beautiful prose she also brings up the issue of how women in literature and culture are far too frequently made to play certain roles fit certain molds learn lessons or have the biases of their narrators and authors painted onto them and unfortunately there is a lot of that going on in tusol though our narrator author does sort of address that he's doing this at the end of the novel it's halfhearted at best the female characters in tusol feel flat static seen through men's eyes this is a very male book and i do admit that it does fall into the trap of post modern male narrator gamesmanship that so many of these novels do it's well done but still it follows the trend i'm not saying you should ignore this book it's a great read and first novel but if you really want to see this kind of thing done at the highest level mr fox is your book","120":"i loved this book i can see its flaws a writer writing about a writer struggling with writing but i love it despite its hyper self awareness i appreciated the spiraling stories within stories that jansma creates and even the moments of confusion as names and identities constantly switch it's a smart thought provoking novel about storytelling identity love and literature this is the second book i've read recently in which the author points out that the best stories start in the middle the other being another 5 star we are all completely beside ourselves in both the narrator is not completely trustworthy as lies stories come out as easily as they breathe but they appeal to me because they force me to think about the entire concept of truth how did i wind up in dubai well it's certainly an interesting story one of my better ones unless of course you want the truth the truth is only slightly less interesting than the story but then again it's the truth so it has that unique quality of all the possible stories out there from the fantastic to the mundane only one of them qualifies as the truth best of all inermixed in the philisophical questions is a good solid story about a triangle of unhappy people just trying to figure out how to move forward","121":" it took me a while to figure out how i wanted to start this review this is only because i am torn about this book on one hand i like that mr jansma played on the idea of deception and liars each chapter was like a mini story that just added and built onto the next story kind of like a movie within a movie also i liked all the different places that i traveled in this book however on the flip side of this book i never really connected with the characters for the same factor as to why i liked this book...the deception because the characters played with deception this made them less likable another factor was that this book while they were short stories chapters i was not instantly drawn into the book it moved somewhat slowly however mr jansma is a good storyteller he gets into your mind and makes you try to separate the truth from the lie the unchangeable spots of leopards is a thought provoking book","122":"what a read totally kept me engaged and staying awake until midnight to finish it","123":" this is a debut novel by jansma and a royal humdinger it is in more than one way it is basically a pursuit novel pursuit of an old and extremely eccentric friend and a stunningly gorgeous friend and lover the narrator who goes unnamed is in love with evelyn from the moment he meets her but there is something mysterious in her eyes that he can't quite scope out for all the days and nights they spend together his friend julian is also his nemesis since they meet in writing class and julian always writes easily the best pieces driving the narrator to distraction throughout it all the narrator is steady to one principle he is a liar he makes up identities as he makes up his stories he is also careless with his manuscripts to an extreme so careless that he keeps losing them into a lake another to an editor that he befriended bedded and betrayed and a third buried in an african landfill along with his watch and a tweed coat his fourth manuscript he is working on throughout the novel we are reading the novel is constructed as a series of linked stories with the same set of characters anchoring each story since the story is about writers it is also about writing a crucial scene between julian and the narrator consists in fact of a discussion of the reality of characters in fiction versus real life julian accuses the narrator of being befuddled as to which is which both with himself and with evelyn \"can you even tell the difference anymore between what you've written about her and who she really is but how could you you've made everything up even yourself for god's sake \" the narrator's quest for who he is and who evelyn is and what is reality takes him to dubai iceland ghana and of course luxembourg for its finale there is much meat here and the philosophy never gets too heavy but it is not an easy go if you want a break from summer pap westerns and detective fiction give this a try to clean your palate","124":"modern brideshead revisited two college friends along with the fabulously wealthy one's friend like a sister who becomes the love interest of the other live large until she decides to marry another the whole tone of the novel shifts interesting read not a masterpiece","125":"great story that comes full circle at the very end","126":"love the beginning hated the middle the end did okay","127":" the prose in the unchangeable spots of leopards is exceptional and often exquisite the composition is reckless daring innovative exuberant and self assured it's a book that i should have loved but my heart felt atrophied from lack of use it almost seemed as though the book was so keyed into its own cleverness that it neglected to care about the characters i think my desire for some emotional connection is behind my impression that the writing was uneven there were moments where i couldn't have cared less what happened next and others where i couldn't put the book down that all of the characters underwent a continual transmogrification throughout the story--changing while remaining the same--was delightfully clever but probably served to further alienate me from those characters if i could sum up this book in just a few words it would be clever but aloof there are lightning flashes of genius here but they never really penetrate beyond the superficial without the necessary grounding they remain bursts of brilliance that leave no mark","128":"i enjoyed this though it was really all over the place and there's the issue when a young author is writing as a young author of wondering how much of the style is the author's and how much is the author's parts of it were very good and then parts got a little histrionic and but since the story dealt with young histrionic types it mostly worked though it had its exhausting moments ice fishing in upstate new york southern country clubs the grand canyon sri lanka africa that's a lot of ground to cover jansma takes on an interesting meta kind of conceit playing around with the idea of source material and truth telling and how and what gets converted into fiction the book is set up as a series of tightly linked stories or maybe they're really just chapters some of them work well and feel complete in their own right some less so on both counts but it was still pretty readable","129":"i liked it it's starts out in the triangle of nc so that was a nice locale the protagonist also travels a lot throughout the novel which adds some interesting venues to the novel i loved the characters and i loved the fluidity of the truth throughout the story do it","130":"wow i hadn't felt the urge to publish how much i'd liked a book since i found milan kundera's the unbearable lightness of being a few years ago jansma's writing is captivating beautiful and mesmerizing and his writing style is unexpected which stories were true which stories were fiction i absolutely loved it","131":"the unchangeable spots of leopards is a poignant story about the creation of stories and how sometimes fiction isn't so fictitious the author of this book who is supposedly unknown has lost every book he has ever written each chapter reveals more about him but none of them are told in a straightforward manner in the end fiction is equated with the art of lying it's the trick of pulling information out of the everyday and weaving it into a tale that's a bit more than the truth the author must face the truth of his fiction his stories reveal his true feelings about his subjects rather than reality this approach soon catches up with him with catastrophic results one of my favorite parts is early in the book julien and the narrator are supposed to read an award winning short story the only problem is that the stories are mostly factual and bring up some dirty secrets about those in the room they can't read it without offending someone with the truth every chapter ends with a story the author has written about the events in the chapter fun and playful without trying to be meta fictional or clever this theme plays out throughout the book important events are hidden through stories the character writes about those events at times in the story you are reading a story that the character is writing and then reading a story that character is writing it is inception esque i remember reading a book earlier this year called all men are liars this book might have a better title with all writers are liars he has great fun with his concept and it was an engaging and thoughtful read favorite parts in my hand i held my little rolled up paper bomb the words still hidden safe inside i took another slow breath carefully unfurled the paper and pressed it firmly against the podium i prepared to lay waste to everything in my path p 56 suddenly it seemed that my whole life was static years of garbled nothingness sitting at a library carrel letting my imagination do the living p 93i didn't understand what he was talking about clearly he was losing it but how could you he continued 'you've made everything up even yourself for god's sake well here's the truth let me remind you--the biography of you son of a man who had a layover in newark and the flight attendant who brought him peanuts with a smile that afternoon recipient of a vacheton constantin watch that your mother found wedged between two first class seats and stole for you so you'd be able to count the hours she'd abandoned you one time escort--paid escort--to a debutante ball and introduced to high society as a character from a wilkie collins novel you project these fantasies onto us it's fun playing the people you think we are but this is where it stops this isn't some story anymore this is her life and you don't get to do this p 112and for this imperfect immortality what prices have been paid how many livers lungs and veins shredded polluted shot how many children deserted family secrets betrayed sordid trysts laid out for strangers to see how many wives and husbands shoved to the side how many ovens scorched with our hair gun barrels slid between our lips bathtubs slowly reddened by our blood and twisting rivers that drowned us how many flawed pages burned in disgust and reduced to ashes how many flawless moments observed from just a slight distance so that later we might reduce them to words all with an unspoken prayer that these hard won truths might outlast the brief years of our lies p203","132":"sort of a book for book snobs well crafted and planned but not necessarily what i was craving at the time","133":"i loved this book i picked it up on a whim and i am so glad i did the writing style drew me in right from the start and it was really hard to put down it does allude to a lot of different literature but for me the one that came to mind most was brideshead revisited the trio in this book matched julia sebastian and charles i even found the personalities to be very similar that said although it seemed familiar it is difficult to put in words a review of this book as familiar as it is it is something very unique as well i don't know that i have ever read a book quite like this one","134":"lovely book lots of plot changes leave you disorientated now and then but that's also the fun of it","135":"deliciously pretentious in the most respectful way i mostly devoured the theme of time and too how brilliantly it was organized i look forward to the next book of jansma's","136":"overall not worth the time","137":"between a 3 and 4 i have a tough time making up my mind such an odd story i liked the characters i've romanticized the idea of what a writers existence must be like but now i thank my lucky stars i'm not driven to write this book portrays it as a sickness and i believe it would be fun to talk about this novel with an author many layers here","138":"inventive and unique told in a tightly twisted narrative structure a book about a book inside a novella about a short story character names and places may change from section to section but it is all centered around a story of three friends and the half truths that are told through a struggling fiction writer's stories each section is a piece to the larger puzzle the entire truth only clear when put together as a whole","139":"i liked the first two stories but then it got weird too weird for me at least","140":" when i was young very young and not so young tv and books filled my life with one playmate available in the area i read my books watched the tv carefully selecting among the three channels played with my companion whenever i could and longed for many more friends for adventures far beyond riding my bike in the driveway or down to the corner in the fullness of time in an expanding teen age world then the college years and then the years of travel women crazy adventures parties black tie and house rent i found many friends many passions many causes many adventures as years passed i never led a conventional life yet did the conventional things married became a father divorced married divorced married became a grand dad and slowly slipped away from parties and large numbers of friends and adventures i never returned to tv but became more consumed by books which had never left my life now we need to tear ourselves away from our books in order to go dancing or to a concert or party once the compulsion to experience is quenched we can return to whom we started out as kristopher jansma has written this story for us in flowing prose and with introspection wonderful characters wit whimsy and with a dash of revelation into the writer's soul recommended","141":"i listened to this book because the e book wasn't available from the library i wish i had read it because the language imagery and sentence structures are artfully crafted hearing the story was enjoyable but seeing the words would have made my experience more enjoyable","142":"interesting premise but i got bored with the unreliable narrator' as soon as he left the country","143":"i read about half of this book when i realized i didn't care about the characters and wasn't even able to nor interested in following their stories i really wanted to like this one but i just didn't","144":"they are always so odd in novels -- makes me feel quite normal i read it in a day so it's interesting but not overly challenging interesting story i love reading about writers -- they are always so odd in novels -- makes me feel quite normal i read it in a day so it's interesting but not overly challenging","145":"jansma's novel held such promise for me and i did find it pretty captivating for the most part i do love stories with unreliable narrators and ones that blur the lines of \"truth \" but at some point--where did it start after the half way point --i started to get a little restless and uninterested and that \"meh\" feeling held onto me through the end even though it was quite clever and i should have been oohing and aahing and i can't really explain why that happened","146":"this book is beautiful it's tender emotional and gripping i wasn't sure for a long time that jansma was going to be able to tie it all together but he did and without just forcing ends into place this would be a great book for any point in an author's career much less the first novel","147":" this is highly addictive for fans of literary fiction it's lit fic crack i sped through it in a day and a half but i absorbed it too quickly the first time so i had to start over and re read it at a slower pace as the unnamed narrator describes the work of another writer \"it is the rare sort of book that resembles nothing else and yet somehow seems intensely familiar from the first line you feel your own heart begin to beat differently once it's over you want to begin it again \"that is precisely my experience with this book there is a great con going on here - our narrator is both unnamed and unreliable - but there is another level to this inception esque con at work i was hooked so rapidly that i had a surreal sense of being hooked as though jansma had cracked the literary fiction formula and used it to cook up this new form of irresistible lit fic crack i embraced the book so readily i wanted to throw it across the room i might have done it had i been reading a typical advance copy but i got this through netgalley a first and a touchscreen isn't especially useful when it's embedded in the drywall somewhat like the three books our narrator has written all of which have been lost in an author's note he explains that this book is pieced together from the remnants of those other books and that in the empty space between them - in the cracks as it were - is the truth","148":"a story that has stayed with me after it's finished","149":"nope just nope i found the characters unrealistic selfish and unsympathetic and the writing just felt painfully self aware striving for clever or charming or maybe even a little mad but not hitting anything meaningful the first few chapters intrigued me but i had to force myself to finish this one","150":"the writing is superb but this novel is just too clever to be truly enjoyable-- it ends up being tedious","151":"this book is like reading a writers draft names change places change situations change and what's left is the story of a would be writer and his friend writing and rewriting the same story over and over again","152":" if you like books about books and meta level fiction you will love jansma's novel and it's not so high concept that it's difficult to read it's actually quite fun the protagonist of jansma's novel is an aspiring writer and as such he is consumed with the task of writing and its affiliated tasks reading great works of literature having adventures so that he can write what he knows workshopping with other writers taking creative writing classes writing drafts revising and despairing that one's work isn't original enough but don't despair the book's setting isn't restricted to a writer's garret you get to tag along to airport terminals manhattan night clubs train travel in asia open air markets in africa and the theater in luxembourg with some additional stops in vegas iceland with a few more stops in between but more than anything the novel considers the adage that all good writers are liars who have trouble keeping fiction to the realm of writing and nonfiction to the realm of their lived experience both tend to merge for a while i tried to keep straight what was fact and what was fiction and then facepalm i decided to just sit back and enjoy the ride because of course there is no fact in this novel the whole book is a work of fiction and it's a big old celebration of the ability we have to just make things up as we go along in real life as well as in the pages of a book the structure is a series of short stories that end up folding in on themselves the character names change events in the protagonist's life become fodder for his fiction and the authorship of the entire novel itself comes into question as we go along but particularly by the conclusion these little puzzles tease the reader throughout and i'm still trying to figure out what did jansma just do there and this is his first novel i can't believe this because his satire and his musings are very mature and his allusions are skillfully deployed he has an amusing section set in africa where the protagonist and a fiction editor flirt discuss the use of doppelgangers in fiction oh be still my heart it's fun to get lost in all the literary allusions and the snarky and angst ridden psyche of the protagonist and his best friend writer while thinking about the wacky and whimsical world of fiction writing","153":"this book is absolute genius i love it so much wow","154":"this book had the potential to be very funny yet serious i just found it to be boring the narrator was too annoying for me to enjoy his story i did like the last chapter though it made up for the complete lack of interest i had reading this book","155":"highly entertaining the credibility of the narrator is intriguing","156":"this book was the ax for the frozen sea within me","157":"this was not nearly as good as it should have been and i say this as someone who this book was totally intended for as a struggling writer i can definitely get into a book about the same but this one was simplistic unrealistic and meandering the nameless narrator is unreliable in an annoying way as he weaves together related yet separate anecdotes of his life as he pursues a writing career a princess and a sense of truth the themes are cool enough but the execution was far too obvious and so while there were moments i related well to the story stories there were too many other moments when i felt like i was watching the dumb movie rather than reading an intelligent thought out and carefully crafted story","158":"tell the truth but with a slant this emily dickinson quote from the book best describes it i still am not totally sure just how sloped the slant is and i really love the book for it","159":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i love this book i liked how the details kept changing so i never knew what was real and what was fake it really made me realize that maybe some of the smaller details in real like are insignificant also it gave me a glimpse at a new perspective on life also my writing teacher when describing the book explained that since he is a writer we start out not really trusting him but by the end we could not help but doing so i found the opposite by the end of the book i didn't trust a thing th i love this book i liked how the details kept changing so i never knew what was real and what was fake it really made me realize that maybe some of the smaller details in real like are insignificant also it gave me a glimpse at a new perspective on life also my writing teacher when describing the book explained that since he is a writer we start out not really trusting him but by the end we could not help but doing so i found the opposite by the end of the book i didn't trust a thing that the unnamed narrator wrote furthermore i liked how it never glamorized writing as a profession it shows the struggles toils and let downs of being a writer finally i liked the end too the main character kept trying to write the story as we were reading it and never really could grasp the ending till finally it happened and i think it happens they way it should the guy does not really get the girl and to me it seemed realistic instead of the typical running off into the sunset moment over all i really enjoyed reading this book and i think it should go down in history as one of the greatest of our age more","160":"i enjoy a book that comes goes full circle","161":"this novel started out really strong for the first two thirds but then it lost my interest toward the end i just couldn't get behind the narrator's obsession with his supposed soulmate a shallow inscrutable woman","162":"our lives are all made up of a series of episodes of adventures of happenstance of chance what if you tried to capture it all but a slanted version that you could leave behind in the written form this book captures that goal and the madness of its attempt https faintingviolet wordpress com","163":"this book is like the biggest bullshit i've ever read but i seem to believe it and surprisingly loved it this is like the essence of storytelling or how a tale would be told you have the main storyline that remain unchanged but the details seem to change every 5 minutes the next thing you know you can never tell a made up stories apart from the truth but it sounded good anyway so why not living it maybe this is what they call modern literature but heck what do i care i thought this is brilliant","164":"simply brilliant","165":"fantastic book and i'm not one to write many reviews extremely intelligent and well written what can i say the author narrates a great timeless novel from the point of view of the main charachter an author who struggles during his life trying to write a great timeless novel as far as writing books about authors writing great timeless novels as his friend actually writes a great timeless novel and it asks what a great timeless novel really is or more poignently what is a great timeless life is it mostly fact or fiction and ultimately is the quest really worth it what price peace of mind he gives you a piece of his mind to ponder the question the main character is an anti hero my favorite type of character that isn't necessarily a good person but one you can't help but root for it's riveting introspective and highly entertaining i think that's what great novels should be","166":"i really liked this book a friend gave it to me and i had no idea what to expect but it was really good clever in the way it was written like so many different stories so at the end you don't really know what was real or what was a lie a book about a writer and the people he meets in his life his stories and his lies would recommend","167":"this book didn't take me into the theme that i thought it would to much of the surprise of me and the protagonist life ended up scattering all over the place it just goes to show that trying to be other people who are trying to be other people ends up weird and tangled half way through the story the characters ended up swapping names and i still didn't really get a good grasp of that","168":"this book seemed to me to have the flavor of gatsby and ripley i didn't love it but it kept my interest well enough i did enjoy the jerky transitions between chapters i felt that emphasized the chameleon nature of the main character","169":" i really thought that this book was going to be a bust i mean yet another novel about two rival friends authors this time who are so self involved you just want to smack them how many of these stories does the world need the narrator and his more talented friend julian who also just happens to be drop in a cold beautiful actress as the main character's love interest and i was ready to drop it back in the return box at the library however about halfway through the plot started to get interesting of course the 'girl who got away' evelyn the actress gets away she's all set to marry a boring but successful scientist who just happens to be the son of some minor branch of indian royalty the narrator who has been hired to report on this celebrity event is plotting to ruin the wedding and then write about his feat instead however he gets sidetracked by a very high pill popping julian and the escort he's hired to act as his wife julian is gay and a total prankster who calls herself bethany absurdity follows absurdity the narrator has sex with the 'wife ' gets in a fight with julian over that and julian's assertion that the narrator projects too much of his own desires onto others which impedes his art and life the wedding goes off without a hitch the narrator aware for the first time how much evelyn 'acts' her way through life this is the point where the novel actually became interesting for me disillusioned with himself and his friends he breaks off on his own at first he takes on the identity of a journalism professor with whom he shares an apartment but who never returns from an overseas trip he bluffs his way into a teaching job at a small college teaching his own creative cynical brand of journalism to students who are by and large enthralled by him the head of the college is less than enthralled when he finds out his new professor is an impostor enter the opportunity to teach at a university in dubai provided by an admiring students whose father has important connections to exploit next up in the continuing metamorphosis of our hero writing essays for a fee for asian college students in order for them to qualify for higher education admission while on the train to sri lanka the last five chapters are the best it's too bad the novel took so long to 'warm up ' in the end i was happy that i stuck with it","170":"rudyard kipling's how the leopard got its spots is one of many pieces of literature that the unchangeable spots of leopards alludes to perhaps the most telling allusion is the line from an emily dickinson poem - \"tell all the truth but tell it slant\" since jansma's book is a series of slanted tales told by a highly unreliable narrator the fact that you never really even know this narrator's name enhances the colorful telling of the chapters that read more like individual interconnected tales than a novel the narrator makes it clear in the opening chapter that he is a writer and piques the reader's interest by announcing \"i've lost every book i've ever written \" his life story - from childhood to adulthood - is told through episodic adventures that take him all over the planet europe hong kong sri lanka iceland for a while he assumes the identity of professor wallace and teaches methods and practices of new journalism in dubai this entertaining chapter includes a portion of one of wallace's supposed lectures on truth in journalism which announcing that \"ours is a new generation of plagiarists armed with wikipedia and google we can manufacture our own truths\" throughout the novel he maintains a rivalry with julian who is also an author and a romantic quest for evelyn who eventually becomes a princess at one point the narrator muses \"somewhere once i read that the only mind a writer can't see into is the mind of a better writer \" jansma is clearly a reader's writer the unchangeable spots of leopards is a reader's theme park of a novel holden caulfield narrating the princess bride scattered throughout are literary references doppelgangers and leopard sightings - real and imaginary i enjoyed this book largely because jansma fuels my faith in the value of literary fiction","171":"william boyd and dave eggers come to mind i enjoyed the structure of succeeding short stories well connected but standing up together perhaps on the tired side was the central vision of brilliance bound to craziness overall it was fun imaginative contemplative and compelling","172":" this is a great debut novel and when you get to the end expect to be unsure of who the real characters are and how much about them is made up by the narrator verses how much is part of who the author wants you to believe the characters are no doubt you are confused already the real name of the narrator is never revealed to the reader and the author creates layers to each character's true self through the use of stories told within the story itself the narrator an aspiring writer creates an identity for himself that is by turns stolen from the best traits of others made up as he goes along and sometimes revealed through his adventures and stories i was a bit bothered by the ending where the reader is left to provide their own conclusion in the sense that the narrator's actions don't seem to resolve anything one way or the other in terms of whether he has really grown or changed also i found some of the tales told to be less than compelling and almost wanted to skip through some of those sections still a great read and very well written so i will look for more by this author","173":"i am about 1 4 of the way through and so far it reads like a young adult novel i am not sure where all reviews of good even beautiful writing come in the writing isn't refined the story so far is rather bland and the characters aren't well developed i certainly wouldn't call it a breathless work unless you get breathless over cliched young romance and overworked metaphor i am going to keep reading in hopes that as the protagonist matures so does the writing please jansma prove me wrong","174":"very rare to find such a literary novel in today's world reading this book is like reading a modern day relationship between hemmingway u0026amp fitzgerald great read","175":" the book is made up of interlocking stories with very repetitive themes on writing what makes for a writer and the nature of truth i didn't find the themes especially interesting the first time and by the end of the book i found them very tedious as well as to be honest the characters who wallowed endlessly and pretentiously i didn't really even find the dialogue or the way the characters interacted with each other to be especially credible or interesting and i will forget the book quickly having said all that and though i wouldn't recommend the book i found much of the writing to be very beautiful and a lot of the time i spent listening to the book went by quite enjoyably","176":"this is a great throw away book for me that sounds so harsh but what i mean is i really enjoyed it and my time was well spent with it audio on double speed but i can't see myself getting passionate about it in any way including recommending it interesting characters in interesting situations and questions of life vs fiction","177":" this book reads like a mirror facing a mirror stories reflecting stories until you realize it's all one story that's been flipped and retold an infinite amount of times in an infinite amount of ways a painstakingly self reflexive tale that traverses the globe a little bit cheesy at times but very smart when it comes down to it this book reinforces two literary truths 1 there is no truth 2 everything is true oh and a bonus 3 writers can be undeniably envious creatures nicely written nicely done also the paperback cover of this book is amazing favorite line referring to a row of airport terminal clocks in each of them you can see what the time would be but only somewhere else between them all you can if you wish determine what time it is here these stories are all true but only somewhere else","178":"\"the best novelists make you believe as you read that their stories are real you hold your breath as raskolnikov approaches his neighbor with a raised ax you weep when no one comes to gatsby's funeral and when you realize you are being so well fooled you love the author all the more for it \"this book was delightful and frustrating ultimately a rewarding read highly recommend","179":"entertaining story within a story within a story coming of age tale about story telling smart and twisted","180":"this is simply one of the most fantastic books i have ever read usually fiction doesn't do it for me because i don't believe it this is the whole truth slanted from chapter to chapter he wove an intricately tangled web of characters whose lives mixed and came full circle this is a masterful book that will forever be in my top 5","181":"truth or lies original writing or plagiarism fragility or confidence genius or pretender the protagonist struggles these as a writer friend and lover the story is a page turner and very cleverly and beautifully written jansma's understanding of the writer's challenges comes through as he creates a memorable story this book is very good and well worth the read for those who love literature","182":" this is an allegory fictional autobiography of a writer that's written in first person from a number of characters no i did not make any errors in that first sentence it's all true or it's not for this book is about truth lies and stories told to the self and to others to wit at one point the main character is injured and as he feels himself bleed out he ponders his imminent demise he finds himself fairly philosophical and begins to evaluate what he has done and what he has accomplished in the now shortened span of time he's had on this earth mid reflection he realizes that his story to himself is quite like a hemingway short story and actually it occurs to him that it's not his story it's hemingway's then he begins to think about the exact words and structure he might use if he lives to tell this tale which clearly he did since i'm reporting on my reading of the incident hemingway fitzgerald checkov donne the shelleys poetry theater the great themes of literature they're all here along with debutantes writers' retreats sri lanka africa and a leopard there's even a place where a beautiful girl counsels the main character that rich girls don't marry poor boys this is the english major's version of catch 22 it's utterly fabulous don't miss it this is one that i'll read again and again","183":"i love and hate this book halfway through i was mad for being taken into a story and buying in and then jumping tracks the end tied it all together and in the end i am reminded of how we began and the themes are spinning me but at one point this book gave me comfort and in the end discomfort it is well written and there are good stories and the moments of genius and the work with themes is expert but i can't help but feel that this is the author's self indulgent drunk high blathering of internal fears and may be a cop out but maybe it's smart","184":"i did not find this book clever or multi layered just tedious after carefully reading the first half i gave up and just skimmed the rest of it i wasted a beautiful summer afternoon that i will never get back","185":"fun really enjoyed it from beginning to end the narrative kept me on my toes","186":"this was a great book kind of catcher in the rye esque i loved the way the story unfolds and comes back around full circle i wish i was one of those impressive people who can really break it down in a book summary all i know is this had great characters insightful depictions of some pretty messed up lives and yet in the end there is some semblance of strength hope and survivability sort of like a lot of recovery stories","187":"some part of this books i absolutely loved certain parts really worked and then he'd switch gears that frustrated me because it seemed unnecessary at points but the writer has a great imagination and really likes trying to fit in as many book references as possible","188":"best i've read in years comparable to hemingway unbelievable","189":"this book was well written and i'd often think about and envision different scenes long after i read that chapter give it a try","190":"refreshingly different i thought about it long after i finished it","191":"probably really only a 3 5 but i'm rounding up because it's a debut novel with a lot of promise clever and well written but not terribly substantive it would be a terrific airplane read","192":"odd but compelling well written odd","193":"i had a good feeling about this book when i picked it up but i wasn't expecting to feel the way i do now that i'm finished jansma is a new strong and clear voice he creates characters that you hate to love love to hate feel for and root for and all without ever giving us the main protagonist's real name this story never drags and the detail puts you in every location that the protagonist finds himself in were there times when i felt like i knew what was coming yes a few actually but it wasn't a predictable story in fact as a reader the moments when i discovered i put together just a small fragment of the whole i felt accomplished and satisfied and knew that jansma would not let me down in the last couple of months i've read some incredible novels ones that will stay with me for a long time but this one is different it's special and to find out why you'll just have to take a chance on this new writer the way i did","194":" i won my copy of this book free as part of the first reads program jansma had me hooked in the authors not when he said so that is the story of how i lost my very first book i've lost three others since a novel a novella an a biography the first is disintegrating steadily at the bottom of a black lake the second is in the hands of a woman whom i love and will never see again the third is in a dusty african landfill wrapped in the bloody tatters of my tweed coat my gold watch still in the pocket how can you not read on after that for who does not love a good mystery and the mystery here is how jansma could have lost not one but three of his books one would think he would have learned caution after the first or second the first chapter about the author's childhood reeled me in but then subsequent chapters left me wanting to put the book down my problem with it is that while it is smartly written the line between truth and fiction is blurred and i find i'm more of a black and white reader and i want to know which parts really happened and which are truth told slant which characters are real and which are caricatures of real people i guess i like my books to fall neatly into fiction and non fiction and spots falls somewhere smack in the middle also although spots is supposedly one novel that follows the same character over the course of his life the chapters read less like chapters and more short stories in a collection somewhere between pinkerton and mcgann and malice and desperation in the grand canyon it dissolved into an f scott fitzgerald novel with the characters being horrible to each other and drinking themselves into oblivion and changing their personalities like most people change their underwear","195":"i bought this book because of the beautiful cover but i'm so glad i did because i loved the story the characters are flawed but fascinating and i adore a story within a story and this has many three lost souls come and go through each other's lives often bouncing off each other like human bumper cars but through it all they love each other and strive to please each other as only true friends do do yourself a favor and read this book","196":"i have to give this five stars due to the quality of writing but it was a little out there for me i think i'm too old for it gorgeous writing told in connected short stories and very literary some parts were just too weird for me although i usually adored the end of each story and really liked its ending","197":"when jansma writes about one of the many books within the book nothing sacred that it had the rare quality of seeming like a classic on the day it was first printed with a clever consortium of low lying postmodern puzzles to occupy the highbrow and heartfelt hijinks to captivate the low brow it is the rare sort of book that resembles nothing else and yet somehow seems intensely familiar you get the sense that it's not really nothing sacred that he's trying to describe it's his own text while a quick engaging read and solid prose the intertextuality and reflexiveness seems forced conceptually a novel that's really a sort of fictional autobiography by a writer publishing his first book about a writer who is still trying to find himself and write his first book seems clever but that's the problem jansma falls in love with his own cleverness he's one in a long line of modern artists to equate 'clever' with 'good ' the allusions to hemingway fitzgerald dostoyevsky or maybe shteyngart and others are everywhere sometimes explicit sometimes more suppressed announce jansma's awareness of his anxiety of influence but without adding much else and while this sort of meta reflexiveness is interesting enough it just doesn't make up for the predictable cliched plotlines and just slightly too over the top characters the intellectual value of jansma's puzzles don't overcome the lack of actual aesthetic value","198":"great themes truth lies and friendship enabling relationships","199":"absolutely brilliant my new favorite book and i know it won't be replaced soon","200":" the unchangeable spots of leopards is a cleverly crafted literary debut that recalls salinger fitzgerald tartt and quite hilariously bruce robinson's brilliant comedy withnail and i an intricately woven series of stories within stories its meta nature dazzles rather than annoys quite a feat when stories about writers writing stories are a dime a dozen jansma has written a superbly entertaining novel that questions the very nature of truth and whether in the end it matters at all these stories are all true but only somewhere else","201":"\"if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience \"","202":"beautifully written i loved the style and found myself frequently mesmerised by his sentences the story isn't a linear one and is very intriguing i only didn't give it five stars as i was a little disappointed by the ending very cool u0026amp clever u0026amp perfectly brilliant just not how i wanted it to end but then i am a hopeless romantic","203":"i'm a little tired of authors who try so hard to be clever jansma definitely is clever writing about a college kid then adult who continually opts for articulate over essence but it was a chore to read i didn't like any of the characters he did end the book appropriately though","204":"while incredibly confusing at times i still couldn't put it down very reminiscent of fitzgerald's writing you want to root for the narrator but it's difficult at times","205":"received an advance ebook from edelweiss torn between 4 5 and 5 really loved the characters and the story","206":"enjoyable but not very far above the fare being churned out by the rest of brooklyn's writers the time jumps and scattered settings read like gimmicks and it tends to hammer down its point a little too hard","207":"this book was delightful the story had me hooked from the paragraph in the prologue where the narrator describes the fate of his four completed books and even then as you follow him through the creation and loss of each of his writing even that is a slanted truth the most superficial description is about writing and not writing and one author's path through his twenties but it's much more about truth and lies about how we choose the stories we tell about ourselves and how that defines us the arc between creation and letting go about the search for meaning and who we are and how the path of that search circles back around itself because we were always right there it's a beautiful well written book with sharply defined scenes and unexpected interlocking language i recommend it","208":"this is a writer i would take another look at in the future","209":"this novel started out so promising i devoured the first three chapters giddy with the promise of what i thought had the potential to be a five star novel for me then came chapter four and every chapter after sigh it became a slow spiral into a discombobulated novel in which the narrator lies so often that even the reader is confused as to what is true and false read full review at http theinsomniacbibliophile blogsp","210":"the book is very cleverly written i enjoyed the way other works of literature were referenced and tied in and wondered if we would hear from rudyard kipling and we did very interesting characters with mostly unchangeable spots","211":"charming in places but it kept losing me whenever it veered towards the fantastical","212":"an excellent book and a clever story about the importance of truth and lies both in books and real life","213":"read it at the right time in my life didn't want it to end impressive work by a young author turned my interest back towards fiction","214":" note viking press provided me with a copy of the unchangeable spots of leopards for the purpose of this review grade

kristopher jansma proves in his debut novel an experimental piece of fiction doesn't always have to feel like an experiment to its reader the unchangeable spots of leopards is packed with literary innovation in the form of plot structure setting and character identity but those elements don't detract from the book's emotional weight in fact they enhance it jansma tells stories within stories that span the globe and build a fascinating personality for the novel's nameless narrator an aspiring writer with a best friend who happens to be his literary rival while that competitive relationship is a strength of the novel the narrator's two primary love interests are somewhat underdeveloped his obsession with them tries to be authentic but the two women appear in so few scenes that the source of the passion feels forced there are moments of pure poetry in the unchangeable spots of leopards starting with the title and jansma's use of symbolism is restrained yet powerful his novel may be a challenging puzzle but solving it is both an enjoyable and gratifying experience","215":"3 young friends the narrator and his close friend julian are would be writers evelyn is a young actress and the love of the narrator's life julian writes the great american novel and falls apart the trio has a devastating breakup that lasts for 10 years while the narrator wanders the world making up stories and reinventing himself constantly very interesting story","216":" the unchangeable spots of leftists if it were possible on goodreads i'd rate this a 3 5 because it was definitely somewhere between liking and really liking nevertheless it's a difficult book to rate because my feelings about it went up and down in quick succession like the double hills on the comet at hershey park the first 50 pages the hook was set and i was blissfully being reeled in nearly unaware of the book itself which is when i know i'm absorbed but by chapter four i started thinking of bill murray in groundhog's day not that the book is really comparable but i simply began to think of that plot as i read it cruised downhill from there with chapter seven irritating with its political pot shots but by chapter nine i was getting interested in the story again and it held me all the way to the nebulous ending i realized that i enjoyed reading the author's acknowledgments almost as much as i did the book itself leah miller please by all means take your husband's last name i was a miller once myself and having people butcher and repeat the acquired eurosurname is ever so much more fun than being asked all your life are you related to so and so miller which of course you never are so really it is jansma's prose the way he uses words like keys to unlock images and sensations and landscapes to entice a reader into his philosophy that i really appreciated warning spoilers the plot or unplot made me sad it embodied the muffled throb of this generation's desperately lost heart everyone in the story seemed to be suffering simultaneously from an absent father wound and out of that a broken identity from the narrator himself to billy to the little luxembourg heir that had no one to read him his bedtime story i don't know whether the author intended this but it's a sorrowful picture of the explosion of the fatherless generation across the planet and out of it the lack of identity the drifting the lack of truth the inevitable self destruction that follows king me what an ironic summary of life in the self absorbed self centered julian it was the embodiment of the me generation and that was the other thing i didn't like julian and i didn't like evelyn they were all smug and smart and self assured in their cynicism but every time they were around others i just kept thinking kindness would go so much further than your respective intellect and transitory good looks all in all look forward to seeing jansma's future work because i think the story could be much better he already writes phenomenal prose p s my favorite quote from the book is this describing julian's wealthy superior parents they both looked as though they might buy the auditorium just to burn it to the ground brilliant","217":"i thought that this book was pretty terrific at times the story had the energy of the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay but could equally show a darker talented mr ripley like side","218":"marvelous novel about a writer and his friends told in the form of chapters that are almost short stories i don't want to give anything away so i'll just say the writing is excellent the characters are vibrant the dialogue is smart and funny and the whole book is a great reading experience loved it","219":"i read to page 198 and then stopped i loved the idea of a character who changes to meet the environment that he is confronted with but found that it was difficult to keep me grounded in the storyline the job changes and living situations felt to outlandish and unreal to make it seem like this might be a plausible experience after awhile i got tired of the characters and their narcissistic ways i might at some day try it again on vacation with nothing to interfere with my reading the story so i can keep better track of the storylines","220":"have you ever embellished a story to make it more exciting you play it off as truth time after time i admit it i have don't judge i love to tell stories about awkward things that happen to me and a lot of awkward things happen to me what really makes an entertaining story is the small details but who really remembers them so i embellish my stories little white lies littered among the truths to entice laughs and imbue irony sometimes i tell them so often that i swear i really did those things which is the real story does it matter maybe the real story is the one that feels most real to me welcome to the story of the unnamed character in jansma's debut novel told from the point of view of a struggling writer he tells the story of his life in two parts two stories of his childhood and teenage years before reeling through college with his best friends julian and eve as he and julian strive to become writers julian successfully so and he and evelyn do the dance of an early twenties non couple and then ten years down the road as he is on a quest to re find these two people he lost and to perhaps find himself for the first time ever the unreliable narrator tells his life story through three novels that he has lost in each one some of the supporting details change but we bounce from common theme to common theme it leaves you with the sense that you may have the slightest idea of what is real but regardless you are entertained throughout despite being thoroughly entertained i didn't really feel like i connected to any of the characters they were just that characters and nothing more each one was a caricature and so eccentric in their own way that it was nearly impossible to feel any type of connection with them while i wondered what would happen to them i didn't really care it was curiosity and not real investment i will keep my eyes open for more by this author and hope that he grows as a writer the potential is definitely there","221":"one more time i just could not finish a book despite the recommendation of my book club can't even really say why exactly except i got bored with the main character","222":"this story had such a great sense of momentum behind it it was a fast and fun read i loved jetsetting around the world with the narrator but my favorite parts were when he would pause for some quiet lovely moments of observation the characters made me laugh and got me frustrated which is always a good sign","223":"loved it totally original and engaging i look very forward to his second book","224":"almost flawless i loved it but it does feel a bit like a first novel maybe just because of the subject highly recommended and i can't wait to see what this author comes out with next it feels open u0026amp honest lyrical and new","225":" i was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy this weekend it's very smart and very well written and also very young but in a very good way i love the book within a book within a book and the fact that the three main characters are basically the same three main characters throughout i love that the narrator doesn't have a name and that we aren't quite sure if there's a fourth book within a layer because jansma himself might be playing with us the whole time i find myself thinking of great gatsby inception eternal sunshine of the spotless mind i fell into the story right away and i can't put it down edit now that i've finished it i love it even more great ending and consistently wonderful through the last word i can't wait until march","226":"it was gorgeous my heart feels overwrought and at peace all at once","227":"a charming self aware tale of a writer coming to grips with the truth or at least as close to the truth as he can get sharp insightful yet still heartfelt and poignant a great first novel","228":"you should just read this book seriously","229":"this dragged for me towards the end but ultimately i loved how jansma plays with the idea of truth in both fiction and real life how do we ever know what is true we assume that writers write fiction from their experiences and that what happens to their characters happened to them but we can never really know similarly do we ever truly know an individual people always put on acts as evelyn does and some may even present fictional selves to the outside world as the main character does this novel is presented in two halves with two different though similar life stories for the main character it leaves the reader wondering which one is true if any the whole story is very meta at one point the main character writes a story about a writer writing a story part of which is included in the first story which i like i think i would need to re read this novel to even try to figure out which half of the story is true a worthwhile read for writers those looking for inspiration to write those who enjoy coming of age novels i seem to have read a lot of those lately especially those written from the perspective of white authors which needs to change and those interested in the idea of truth vs fiction and how each are present in life and literature","230":"meh sometimes engaging but i often felt unconnected to the story didn't wow me","231":"\"tell all the truth but tell it slant --\" goes emily dickinson's famous line which informs every aspect of jansma's debut the novel delights in slanted truths it is at once an homage to great fiction and a challenge to the limits of a reader's suspension of disbelief ostensibly the globetrotting coming of age tale of a struggling writer his rival cum best friend and a beautiful girl--the one who got away--the novel is less concerned with its well trod narrative and far more with the nature of fiction itself never before though have metafictive irony and an unreliable narrator been rendered so compulsively readable jansma fills these pages with literary winks overt and nuanced while his narratives recall everything from fitzgerald to bob dylan to tolstoy but as jansma wryly alights on each cultural touchstone he simultaneously unmoors his own tale the one who got away is married alternately to a member of the indian royalty a japanese emperor and a luxembourgish prince his best friend goes by julian then jeffrey and elsewhere anton the unnamed protagonist meanwhile seems to adopt and discard lives as quickly as he loses manuscripts personas blow away as easily as pages the most appropriate appellation he adopts is outis the greek word for \"nobody\" that odysseus another well traveled protagonist uses to fool the cyclops as i read i found myself picking up and dropping each parallel narrative weighing them trying to determine which was the most diegetically true ultimately though each of these slanted stories reveals a truth about society or self more easily comprehended as fiction than when those same truths are encountered in the real world jansma's fiction embodies dickinson's admonition \"the truth must dazzle gradually or every man be blind\" or else as our nameless narrator writes \"each of these is true but only somewhere else \"","232":"decided to read it after all this is a writers ode not a readers story some nerdy humor kept it going for a while but didnt sustain the never ending tale l ots of editorial hype probably pushed this book ahead","233":" this book gave me a headache i wanted so badly to understand it and as much as i don't want to admit it was lost the majority of the time i can't decide if the reason for my confusion was the author's inability to portray the story clearly or my own inability to pay attention to detail i would definitely not recommend reading this while tired or skimming through the pages with little attention to detail i still can't decide if i love it or hate it want to throw it away or recommend it to everyone i meet maybe this confusion was what jansma hoped to achieve if so job well done","234":" goodreads is asking me what did you think about the book well i wish i could answer that coherently but the unchangeable spots of leopards is so different to anything i've read in a long time that i don't know what to think my mind boggles days after finishing it i still can't work out what is really is about is it about a writer's journey to publishing his first book some tongue in cheek memoirs by the author is it magical realism where nothing is what you think it is and everyone changes in a fluid way though their spots never do is it a bizarre love story i honestly don't know it is such a bold confident crazy cheeky debut novel the author has balls and an uncanny ability to put some gorgeous sentences together a winning combination the writing is lovely and creative at the same time i suspect that there were many hidden metaphors and references i simply didn't get presumably other writers or better educated readers than myself would get a lot more out of this book a case of 'pearls before swine' with me i'm afraid in fact the only thing i didn't like about this book is that it made me feel a bit stupid well i probably am and confused especially in the second half of the book where names and locations changed faster than i could say leopards' spots perhaps i made it more difficult for myself for spreading this out over three weeks this is a book that should be read within three days at most or else one risks losing the plot literally as soon as i finished the book i started it again and when you read it you may very well do the same it's a very clever structure at least i thoroughly enjoyed it one of the many fun things about the book is the publisher's note in the beginning \"if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience \" i love it the audio book is performed by one of my favourite narrators edoardo ballerini who already did an outstanding job for beautiful ruins and once again he nailed the narration perfectly","235":"3 5 stars a fascinating tale of a struggling writer with vibrant characters and interesting locations the first half of the novel was better the second but the story maintains interest long enough to bring you to the finish","236":" any book that begins if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience is surely not going to be run of the mill this portrait of the author as a young man involves three friends the author narrator his friend competition as a writer and evelyn the only character who keeps the same name throughout the book the two writer types reinvent themselves tell tall tales write stories that may or may not be true and generally make writing look like a miserable profession so much pain uncertainty self doubt this was not the best book to read while i was sick in bed because jansma has written something smart and complicated perhaps requiring more brain cells than i had available the plot dodges in and out of the present and past the characters flit around the world and i think much of the point of the book is that one should not trust the testimony of a writer i expect to ruminate more on leopards and predict jansma's characters though hardly likeable folks may come back to haunt me","237":"beautiful complex and engrossing","238":" this book is polarizing in that it's a novel about the shamelessly unreliably narrated life of a fledgling self absorbed writer as a fledgling writer and let's admit it all writers are self absorbed to a degree myself i loved every moment of jansma's first novel leopards is a unique novel in that every chapter makes significant jumps across time and location often the characters' names even change because the narrator is someone who finds truth in lies like all aspiring fiction writers over the course of the novel these short stories weave together into one cohesive tale of love loss and redemption in the process capturing the shaky voice of a young writer who knows that even though the names and places are different he's been telling the same story for years","239":"this is kind of like the movie inception because it is a story inside a story inside a story sometimes even deeper the basic premise is that things are not always what they seem and that each individual can't help but have their own spin on their history spin lies slanted truths perhaps i really enjoyed it","240":"delightful a little stuck up at times but a fun adventure filled read","241":" the unchangeable spots of leopards is brilliant the novel tells the story of an unnamed narrator his writer best friend julian and their mutual friend and the love of the narrator's life evelyn as the narrator struggles to reinvent his life into fiction and \"tell the truth but tell it slant\" we see the details of his life change ever so slightly with each chapter but while names places and small details may change throughout the novel the narrative is so compelling that the reader forgets to care as i neared the end of the novel i found myself caring less and less whether it would be revealed which were the real details and which were fiction while the 'slant' of these characters changes constantly it is clear that their essential truth remains the unchangeable spots of leopards is a brilliant defense for why we need literary fiction - that good fiction while it may not tell the facts always tells the truth","242":"i like a little magical realism as much as the next girl but i almost always have mixed feelings about tricky trickster books it's usually not fun for me to be in the hands of a pre confessed unreliable narrator i am then pre disposed to feel the author is as likely as the cat in the hat to see his toy boat sunk deep in the cake and am usually not wrong about that solid and some really lovely writing saved this for me but all the twisty turns of the plot seemed ultimately uncalled for","243":" i got this book for free through the good reads first reads giveaway it is a very well written story with twists turns and vivid descriptions all the way through i won't give away anything plot wise but the ending makes you want to go back and read the beginning all over again i enjoyed it for the most part there were just some parts that seemed to drag such as the stories within the story you'll see what i mean when you read it but overall i became attached to most of the characters and anytime i find myself personally invested in the well being of a character i consider that a win if you're looking for a smart read with like able characters this book is worth checking out","244":" quotes i listened to the seconds escaping and i knew then that each second was just escaping to a different clock somewhere even farther away and that the seconds just went on and one escaping like that forever 7moreover i didn't want anyone to know where i was from exactly not that i was embarrassed per se i simply had never been anywhere before where nobody knew me knew my mother knew of my father's absence knew my life story there at college i once again felt as though i touched down on another planet and with each successive day i grew more convinced that i'd suddenly be identified as an alien and sent back to whence i came 31 tell the truth but tell it slant 31this seemed to be julian's philosophy on life that no one could ever hope to get the breadth of the whole thing so he would stick to the extremes and assume the middle was thus covered 39she looked at everything like it was a sad smaller version of something she'd seen somewhere else it was how she looked at me 44my humble thesis will be that america no longer desires the truth only the reasonable facsimile thereof like battered lovers we're willing to settle our sense of values still holds us to dismiss that which we know outright to be blatant lies but we avoid the truth with equal intensity we wish to remain in the gray interregnum of half belief when at all possible 121language you go to explain is not a boring and worthless system of grammar and spelling but a tool that can be used to manipulate the weak and the stupid 132maybe an idea like love cannot ever be stolen away just as it cannot ever have belonged to me and only me 159they're both down by the lake watching old rituals become unforgotten again 189 here the other me says picking up the bottle of epiphany much of it seems to have spilled out i want to live i want to live and let tina love me i want to live and find jeffrey and drag him out of whatever hole he's crawled down i want to live and every morning i want to write something that's worth wrapping my heart in when i die 189he can't know he is the same unless everything around him has changed it's like black spots on black fur you can't see them but they're there all the same 240","245":"totally wacky but somehow still unbelievably brilliant circular and fantastical silly and deep confusing and clairvoyant not at all what i thought i was getting into and not at all what i usually want from a book and yet i find myself studying the portrait of the author on the back jacket flap trying to figure out how he got so smart and creative and wishing i were too","246":"kristopher jansma's the unchaneable spots of leopards was an enjoyable read the narrator changes half way through the work which is both confusing and sort of fun strong character development often humorous he explores the truth in storytelling following the lives of three engaging characters through a globe trotting journey north carolina nyc africa iceland europe a great new voice and am eager to read more from him","247":" the writing in this book was very very good people who enjoy good writing and a well told story should definitely read and enjoy this book it was shocking how well jansma creates a world full of hooks and holes and interesting flawed characters that makes it all feel so real you can very easily imagine just such vain scared petty egotistical smug people acting as the people in this book the book deserves two reads as there seems to be two ways to understand the story based upon how one believes the narrator one of the themes is fluidity of personal history and how one chooses to frame themselves upon an initial read you can choose to believe the narrator at mostly face value there are little inconsistencies though that upon a second read make one wonder was the act of writing the story the narrator leaves actually the act of writing or creating his own personal history i found all of this interesting to think about upon completion the friendship of the three primary characters reminded me somewhat of the friendship triangle in brideshead revisited equally co dependent interesting deluded entirely dependent on the view of the teller and yet also very authentic the narrator as mentioned earlier is incredibly unreliable and yet charismatic in his story telling delivery this book has the trendy very meta aspects such as the narrator smugly referencing how interesting his story is when drunkenly telling another couple about it in one scene in the book as well as the ending which i will avoid spoiling the plot has a few strange holes that seemed unnecessary if taken at face value as they jilted the flow of the reader and had no relevance to the story but again they maybe serve as clues to view the story in a different light other issues could have easily been addressed with a simple aside such as one character who was married to one person suddenly being referenced as being married to an entirely different person with no context regardless i am greatly impressed and will highly await whatever he writes next","248":"life of pi but not so cutesy what was real and what was not so wonderful to be able to question as i went along and to never know everything for sure a beautiful joyful read","249":"oh boy was this book good and i mean really good it is a story about stories within stories and people who wrote the stories it is layered and keeps you guessing till the end this books took me to places i didn't even know existed and it keeps me rooting for the protagonist all the while even though he is a compulsive liar the unchangeable spots of leopards was truly a interesting ride and not to mention the fact that this is his debut novel","250":"when i started this book my first impulse was to put it down immediately it quickly becomes clear in the first page of the author's note which by the way isn't a true author's note but is actually a contextual part of the book which once i read that is actually the reason i kept reading as that innovative technique hooked me in that this book is about a writer ugh based off a completely non scientific estimation i would guess that around 20% of fictional books about the modern day feature writers as one of the main characters compare that to the number of writers i know i personally know one person who has written and published a book even that is just a sister of a friend and it isn't that i am a super socialite but i would guess i know somewhere in the ball park of about 600 people by name i got that number from some research the ny times referenced back in february of 2013 so by the logic of the number of writers that appear in books were applied to my life i should know doing math 120 writers yeah i am guessing even writers don't know 120 writers ok let's say i overstated the number of books with writers as main characters let's say it is closer to 5% that would be 30 a bit more reasonable but i can't say that i know 30 people of any one profession except the one that i am in medical technology and that is the crux of it writers often write what they know about and they really really know writers because they are writers and their friends are writers and they go to writer's workshops and talk to writers and argue with writers and read what other writers have written about books about writers and end up thinking that writers are the most interesting people in the world which is all to say that i am sick to death of reading about writers they aren't that interesting but this book which is completely and totally about writers and writing stands out from the fog of self absorption and excessive naval gazing and turns out something that is hilarious poignant meta and abstract it is chock full of cliches that jansma blows up and turns on their heads and overflowing with literary references to dostoevsky to shelley to kipling and i am sure there were a few that were over my head that i didn't notice the premise is pretty simple a lower mid class mildly pretentious kid with a zeal for writing but not a lot of talent latches onto a rich eccentric literary genius and they proceed to form a friendship over literary arguments fine wine and extreme competitiveness and jealousy but their relationship falls apart and the main character goes off on a world trotting journey that brings him back to square one simple enough but attached to that simple plot is an intricate layer of details all made possible by what evolves into an unreliable narrator each chapter in the book could conceivably stand alone as a short novella or story as if the writer of each decided to abandon the story and then start a new one with a slightly different style and slightly different details but picking up where the plot of the previous chapter left off what you end up with is a heterogeneous mixture of plot lines styles and details that leaves you as a reader wondering what exactly is true and what is false which is the real story but then you remember that you are reading a fiction book does it matter what is true and what is false and that in the end becomes the whole crux of the book to me everything we read everything we watch see feel experience is it real or is it fiction we experience something and then we move past it do we remember it or is it lost if we lost that memory did it ever happen do we remember the events as they actually happened or do we accentuate parts delete others add to embellish so that at the end of the day are we really who we are as a result of what happened to us or are we the result of what we think happened to us i don't normally quote sections from books in my reviews but i loved this little bit from toward the end i wait for him to settle in it is important to be comfortable when you're just a small boy alone in a big place he'll change but his fact never truly will he'll go on day after day unsure if he's all that different from the day before later he'll look back at the things that are happening now and he'll think they were almost like something he read about he'll know they happened to him but they may well have happened to another person with another name in some other place where the clocks are on other times in the story of tonight he'll be himself but costumed in the gentle lies of memory and the soft fictions of yesterdays some stories he'll lose along the way in truck stops on old computer drives in boxes in dank basements still each day he'll wonder has eh changed and everything else is the same or is it exactly the other way around this book is good especially for a debut work i think anyone could like it but this is especially for those who are literary minded or like the millennial attitude on life think of the magicians globe trotting novels think ghostwritten or protagonists who are pretentious think cather in the rye","251":"clever smart crazy good read i found it very interesting as it started then it got a bit murky for me although always smartly done it finishes up very well and all comes together it's so very different from most books i've read it may not be for everyone but i did enjoy it","252":"review to come","253":" the unchangeable spots dramatically drops a plumb bob into the depths that separate truth from lies fact from fiction biography from autobiography in its wake is a taut string of a plot that is a joy to follow as it wraps around the world and more enjoyable to reflect on when you reach the end on my first read through i was subjected to inception level confusion as i traced the chameleon characters whose names change but whose roles remain comfortably familiar this evokes wonder instead of despair as if recalling memories of your own history after one too many sips of polish bison grass flavored vodka more than anything this novel made me realize that all fiction writers are liars and jansma is one of the few who so boldly admits it","254":" ah this book it's basically about writing and writers with a ton of literary allusions that mostly work although the awful scene where a group of girls hold up their phones like so many yorick skulls was just dreadful but i lol'd at page numbers page numbers my kingdom for f____ng page numbers it is also a love story that channels fitzgerald sometimes effectively and sometimes not so much it is at times confusing and redundant it reached a point where i felt not only was the character starting over but so was the author and the middle of the book stunk sorry i started off in love then hated it then eventually liked it well enough so three stars because there is potential for more good from this author all in all the writing was pretty decent and i'd be interested in seeing what jansma does next","255":" literature by a literature lover for people who love literature made evident by the dozens of authors and artists that are name checked homaged or \"plagiarized\" if the speaker's admission to such an outright act can be called such it is a deep and nuanced book while simultaneously enjoyable at surface level like the bestseller described therein however like the brooding jeffrey of the novel it is an unstable narrative and some of the chapters fare better than others the latter ones indulging in more melodrama which is unfortunate after such remarkable opening chapters jansma possesses self awareness that satisfies in varying degrees as some of the \"coincidences\" told are too unbelievable to be stomached or appreciated","256":" \"tell all the truth but tell it slant \"that quote from emily dickinson is the driving force behind this masterful creative spectacular debut novel from kristopher jansma and he never lets you forget that even for a second it's divided into two halves what was lost and what was found each of which is structured as a sort of collection of interconnected stories while reading the first half i was struck by how realistic it felt i assumed that this was surely an almost true account of jansma's own journey to becoming a writer the first time at age eight he shared his work with someone else competing with his friend julian to see who can write a better short story for a college competition each feeling envious of the other's talent and ashamed of his own meeting evelyn who will never cease to be the one that got away witnessing her marriage to someone else and wishing he'd had the courage to stop it a falling out that sends the three in different directions the details in the stories pop in such a way the emotions resonate so clearly that i was sure that jansma had just changed the names to protect the innocent and we were headed towards another in a series of the increasingly popular genre in which writer and unreliable narrator are one and the same see flimsy little plastic miracles but then you get to the second half and find many small details have changed it's now jeffrey instead of julian luxembourg instead of india charlotte instead of raleigh the story is essentially the same there's still the would be writer whose college roommate was always going to be the more successful if less psychologically stable of the two and there's still the woman that he can't talk himself out of loving despite the fact that she's married to a minor royal and yet things are different they're slanted the narrator having never become a successful writer instead becomes someone else over and over again he assumes the identity of another writer sent abroad on assignment in order to teach a class on new journalism then travels to dubai he travels to sri lanka and meets two young women - one of whom just happens to have been the editor on his old friend jeffrey's wildly successful critically acclaimed novel he then travels with the editor to ghana to impersonate his old friend to trick jeffrey's senile grandfather into providing information for a new biography on the now reclusive literary giant then it's off to iceland to follow jeffrey to a writer's retreat before the story folds over on top of itself and i mean in the most awe inspiring way possible because of all themes of truth and half truth fiction and slanting there are many ways to read this book at first i was convinced that the what was lost half was the \"true\" story and that the second half must be a fantasy about what the narrator imagined for himself after his dreams of being a writer never came to fruition the details of the second half are so fantastic that it can't possibly be what \"really happened\" - there's no way it can be that easy to get a passport in someone else's name the coincidence of meeting the editor on a train on the other side of the world after a while though i began to read the found half as the \"truth \" and the beginning as the narrator's polished studied version of his youth a sort of meta example of the stories based upon his own life with the details slanted just enough that they can be considered fiction there are times when jansma's work shines through a little too much he can be a little adjective happy - a perfectly unblemished arm a nicotine scarred lung - but he also draws incredible verbal pictures - a waterfall of hair a woman too awe inspiring to be contained within four anglo saxon names there are also times when it feels like he's hitting the metaphor and symbolism button a little too hard on the nose repeated references to the titular leopards instances in which the narrator offers up false names in place of the real one we never learn arguments between the two friends about using the details of each other's lives in their own stories - it feels as though there isn't a single image or phrase or symbol that jansma hasn't carefully planted with a very specific purpose in mind approaching some of the stories as individual pieces makes this stand out more the third story in which julian and the narrator have a run in with evelyn's micahel phelpsian boyfriend over sunday brunch felt very studied like jansma was mimicking the style and tropes of another writer but whom i couldn't quite put my finger on he references so many writers throughout the course of this book and i haven't read enough to pinpoint the similarities precisely but approaching the book as a single piece i found it easy to forgive what might be otherwise considered the errors of an unpolished writer jansma is playing around with styles and ideas - at one point we're given an excerpt of a novella written by the character of one of the narrator's short stories all of which reflect events that jansma has woven into the story about the writing of that short story which in turn makes up a piece of jansma's own novel i don't think there's ever going to be a better example of \"meta\" than that it sounds crazy even kind of pretentious but it worked i was blown away this is the kind of book that makes me miss working in a bookstore i got to the end of it and all i wanted to do was find someone to discuss it with someone to recommend it to someone to share it with it's dense twisty and complicated but in a good way i got this as a freebie from netgalley but i want to run out and grab my own copy so i can underline all the wonderful passages as i try to peel back the layers upon layers upon layers and see what other ideas i can find lurking underneath two of my favorite excerpts time passes strangely in africa when we arrived in our safari gear we both thought we'd be like bogey and hepburn she'd be irascible and i'd be thick skinned and we'd play games with each other for a while before falling madly in love during a vulnerable moment on a steamboat ride down the nile instead we're here talking about what i keep trying to forget and\"i considered this but then i noticed my roommate having removed all his clothing running through the bramble and dust the best thing to do-usually-was to let him play these things out who was i to tell a genius it was time to put his clothes back on \"this is one that is gonna stick with me i don't know how long it's going to take me to stop wondering what's real and what's fiction eta i got to meet jansma at an event this weekend at the fantastic politics and prose bookstore he could not possibly have been nicer and listening to him talk about how he approached this book makes me appreciate it all the more i really want to sit down and read it all over again","257":"\"somewhere in this empty space between my lies and fictions is the truth \" with those bold and arresting words kristopher jansma - certainly one of the most inventive and imaginative writers i've read lately - launches his ode to storytelling he starts with a basic template that most of us have read in various iterations an aspiring boy from a not so great background falls under the spell of a far more worldly and insanely talented friend both would be writers identify each other as worthy competitors and to complicate things our narrator begins to develop feelings for a mesmerizing stage actress - a friend of his competitor - who has ambitions of her own so far so good been there done that but now the story begins shifting the talented classmate becomes in turn julian jeffrey or anton the actress in any given part of the novel she may be married to a famous indian geologist whom she exchanges vows with at the rim of the grand canyon a japanese royal or a luxembourg prince in line for the throne the narrator too shifts identities at one point he is a debutante's escort...in another he's a professor of journalism teaching under an assumed name...in still another he's outis - a greek name from the odyssey - who writes false term papers for spoiled dubai scions his personal odyssey follows a path from north carolina to a city college in new york city...from dubai to sri lana and ghana...and finally to an obscure writer's colony in iceland this is a writer's book and a reader's book as well we see the narrator struggling with his creative muse and even peek over his shoulder as he writes stories within stories there's subtle humor one of his earlier rejected stories gives a nod to dorothy allison with the title just another bastard out of carolina as the novel progresses it begins to tilt towards zaniness as it lets loose its moorings the effect is a sort o gimmicky distancing which makes this novel - for me - a 4 5 yet the book is so fresh and original so fascinating as it shines its spotlight on truth and storytelling that i am upping it to a 5 who can not love a book that starts this way \"if you believe you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience \" it's all uphill from there","258":"a novel in stories the format reminded me of a visit to the goon squad the book is centered around a hopelessly unreliable narrator as he weaves together stories some true some not so true of the lives of both himself and his two friends as they all grow up and in and out of love unchangeable spots of leopards is an extremely inventive debut that forces the reader to examine the nature of truth in storytelling","259":"loved this book totally different than anything else i have ever read now that i have finished it i need to read it again enjoy it is a journey you won't forget","260":"russian doll type of construction for a very clever well written novel about writing","261":"i knew nothing about this book or its author going in so it was a really pleasant surprise the book is basically abut a struggling writer trying to write a book and the book becomes the book he writes it is also about finding yourself and growing up it is refreshing somewhat experimental book i am surprised there is not a lot more buzz about this book i would definitely check out mr jansma's next novel","262":"this is such a strange book the prose is lush fluid and skilled but the characters are all deeply flawed and unlikable and the story unpleasant it all seemed sort of hopeless","263":" sometimes when i tell a story from a long time ago it seems like it happened to someone else it didn't but it certainly could have or someone might remind me of something crazy from my past and it'll jolt back into my head but up until that point i might have forgotten about it on numerous occasions i've uttered it was so long ago it feels like it didn't happen to me this story makes you think about truth even if it's fuzzy and how it pertains to your own life's stories and who you are a touch precious at times of course the narrator aspiring writer is best friends with outrageously rich kids yet very engaging overall this seemed to be julian's philosophy on life that no one could ever hope to get the breadth of the whole thing so he would stick to the extremes and assume the middle was thus covered p 39 this muttered confession caused me an unreasonable amount of joy for which i immediately felt the blackest kind of guilt maybe he wasn't really better than me maybe he just had a more sordid history to draw from p 53julian but at least i try to make a point of only ruining my own life p 111 my humble thesis will be that america no longer desires the truth only the reasonable facsimile thereof like battered lovers we're willing to settle our sense of values still holds us to dismiss that which we know outright to be blatant lies but we avoid the truth with equal intensity we wish to remain in the gray interregnum of half belief when at all possible p 121 he really hit the nail on the head with this one but the writing over and over isn't really a sign of madness it's the only thing letting the madness out p 199 later he'll look back at the things that are happening now and he'll think they were almost like something he read about he'll know they happened to him but they may well have happened to another person with another name in some other place where the clocks are on other times in the story of tonight he'll be himself but costumed in the gentle lies of memory and the soft fictions of yesterdays p 240","264":"interesting","265":" this is the the talented mr ripley for the newest generation it's a twisting tale of identity and the search for true companionship each chapter marks another episode in the young protagonist's life the book opens with an \"author's note\" but this is only the first of many kindly deceptions it's not from the author jansma but rather the shifting personality of the narrator in just the first paragraph jansma has already sketched a fascinating and compelling narrator i've lost every book i've ever written i lost the first one here in terminal b where i became a writer twenty eight years ago in the after school hours and on vacations while i waited for my mother to return from doling out honey roasted peanuts at eighteen thousand feet ~pg 1from there on jansma has the reader in his clutches in each chapter the narrator is a bit older and coming in to his own each chapter is a slight of hand that reveals itself to be a reiteration of the same basic story boy loves girl who is too far above him and is already in love with another boy but maddeningly the reader somehow never sees it coming this basic strand is so far buried in the massive complicated tapestry that we forget all about it until it comes back to haunt us -- and the narrator please support independent reviewers and read my full review is here http

then devoured it loving the details the descriptions and the author's humor through the book i wanted to savor each story but was also turning pages wanting to more and more i will give this copy back to my friend but will buy my own","267":"well written especially how he managed pulling it all together at the end good to read about the process of writing fiction","268":"i really liked this one the changing characters and stories kept me interested while it still followed one larger theme story the ending was a little anticlimactic but other than that it was a fun and interesting book","269":"perhaps this novel will appeal most to writers--not only because the narrator is a writer and the novel plays with fact versus fiction and the space between truth --but because the narrator also speaks to the hard work of writing and the angst of not knowing if one's work is \"right \" is \"good enough \" yet i would recommend this novel not only for writers it is thoroughly engaging in characters and story and seamlessly well written","270":" brilliant the last pages had me laughing and crying simultaneously i immediately flipped to the beginning and started again the book's structure and characters made impossible not to do so it is the rare sort of book that resembles nothing else and yet somehow seems intensely familiar from the first line you feel your own heart begin to beat differently once it's over you want it to begin again it is a love letter it is an atom bomb it is literature we'd forgotten could be written p 168","271":"so so good i wanted to read it again immediately but on paper","272":"please note that i received this book for free from goodreads first reads this is quite possibly one of the oddest books i've ever read it's also one of the most elegantly and beautifully written for a first novel jansma does a truly masterful job of creating a world in which the reader has no choice but to become immersed throughout the book i found myself trying to separate the truth from the slant the black pieces from the red pieces the white from the black everything is woven so intricately however that it's like trying to pull on a fine thread and separate it from a garment it just can't be done while the premise of the book is more or less the separation of truth from lies its left me wondering how much of this book is pulled right from the life of the author himself so many stories have endings that leave me feeling flat or lost this one however was delicately crafted and lovely to read a solid 4 stars from an intriguing new literary mind","273":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i loved this book very different and one that i'll probably think about for a while kind of f scott fitzgerald meets john green really told in a very fresh unique way think it would make a fabulous book club book","274":"i found the unreliable narrator to be equal parts annoying stop messing with my head and fascinating for a more detailed review check out my blog http www smilingshelves com 1 post","275":"the book shows much promise early but the second have of the book resembles decent writing in search of a plot","276":"click here for full review this book has been described as f scott fitzgerald meets wes anderson but it felt more fitzgerald meets the secret history maybe some combination of a richard u0026amp a henry francis hybrid leaks from two of the main characters i loved this book way more than i expected to the characters are flawed but lovable the pacing is a page turner i had never even heard of it before u0026amp now i'm going to be championing it so that i see more young people reading it my only complaint was that it was sometimes trying a bit too hard to be clever but most of the time it worked for me so i didn't mind it much it's a book about identity self awareness u0026amp the sometimes fictionalized lifestyle of a \"writer \" i definitely recommend it as a quick u0026amp fun but still thought provoking read","277":"little pieces of life stories wrapped into one big story that comes full circle by the end truth told with a slant clever and enjoyable little read","278":"amazing book first off the title is kickass i wish more writers would pay attention to the title that and the cover art just like first impressions of people that is the first impression of the book and yes it matters so first i fell in love with the title and cover art and the symbolism behind it readers more sophisticated than i can explain each incidence of the leopard popping up leopard skin hat a country where a leopard was mistaken for a tiger the leopard biting him on the leg it was a recurring theme ok so he is a liar who can't change his spots but you just know each one of these leopard incidents symbolized the character's unspoken need to blah blah whatever and i didn't dig that deep anyway i wish i could give a definitive answer about what the book is about but as donkey says on shrek it has layers as we keep reading we fall in love with the characters over and over only to find our unreliable narrator has betrayed us again who is real and who is not each time he introduced new characters plot setting i adored each of them although yes they were basically the same character in different settings only to find out it was a story buried inside another story inside another story each story just as good or better than the last so to further explain let's see well not an explanation but a feeling for those of you who may have seen the show blue man group awesome show had the time of my life smiled the whole time there and after i left when i thought about it i was smiling and convinced i had the time of my life but when i was asked to explain what happened exactly i was at at a loss the show wasn't exactly about anything and it wasn't exactly a musical a variety show a circus magic act mimes it was some weird mix of all of that when you read this book you may have this feeling as i did haven't seen it well what about this kind of like waking up in the morning after a wild night out you're not 100% sure what went on but you know you had an awesome time and you'll remember it always at least the parts you are sure were real and not the result of some sort of pharmaceutical so nope still not getting it well the unchangeable spots of leopards is about fiction writing fiction living fiction loving fiction it's about fiction becoming more real to you than anything else it's the message that to be an excellent writer you have to be a tad unhinged it's the message that writers are inherently jealous and competitive with each other i loved the way everyone was always sneaking around reading everyone else's stuff hilarious it's about how fiction writers cannot interact with people in daily life without taking notes writing stuff down looking for motivation and ideas for new stories everyone a potential character in his book and his life oh and it's chock full of symbolism i'm not astute enough to grasp but i know it's there his technique of the unreliable narrator and the constant change of scenery and circumstance leaves you unbalanced and wary but it's the kind you get on a rollercoaster not from a hangover i am delighted to see kristopher jansma and i have similar taste in books and similar thoughts on books we've read can't wait to read in between days by andrew porter as it's just sitting neglected on my kindle and he gave it five stars anyway the unchangeable spots of leopards is a damn fine book and unlike anything i've ever read before five stars highest recommendation","279":"it was amusing in an odd way we never knew the real name of the primary character or narrator and the way he and his friend were competitive in their writing when they were young but no matter what name or identity the narrator took over his behavior still remained the same","280":" what exactly is truth does it bend with circumstance is a great love really a great love or simply a reflection of a place and time is truth the opposite of lying or simply a state of being upon which the stories of our lives are built kristopher jansma in his novel the unchangeable spots of leopards provides an emotionally charged and inventive literary context for exploring these questions through the eyes of a young narrator whose own identity is as mutable as the clothes he wears and the places he travels narratively engaging and thematically complex jansma establishes himself among the newest generation of literary magicians addressing the nature of our own ever changing spots","281":"wonderfully written and just so fascinating almost like a fun house of mirrors the author creates a story which moves along in various shapes and forms and it keeps you guessing along the way my brain was engaged the entire time so much so that i could only read a chapter or two at a time and then i had to put it down to mull it over for about 24 hours and then the next day i could read another chapter or two really fascinating and unique we all read a lot of books so it is rare for one to really be unique but this one certainly is recommended ps do not get too hung up as i mistakenly did on the foreward which says something along the lines of \"if you think you may be the author of this book please contact so and so publishing company \" my mind latched onto that and so i thought that was part of the mystery so i was looking for clues all along the way but really in the end it becomes apparent why this was written so but you don't need to look for clues like i did in fact this threw me off and got me looking \"in the wrong direction\" and distracted me if you read this i hope you enjoy it as much as i did pps like other reviewers have written i found the main character extremely tom ripley esque","282":"one of the most creative thought provoking and frustrating but in a good way novels i have read in quite awhile i honestly had to question if i was reading a fiction or nonfiction book the story really did play with your head what is the truth what is a lie at certain sections of this novel i felt like i could be reading the next wes anderson film the story was off beat enough with some truly interesting characters that you didn't really think were all the way good or all the way bad","283":" intriguing novel a series of interconnected short stories that build upon each other while at the same time each one twisting the 'realities' of the one before it if you tossed concepts like 'inception' 'cloud atlas' 'talented mr ripley' 'life of pi' 'the time machine' '11 22 63' into a blender and seasoned the blend with a dash of neil gaiman and any novel about a writer or is it writers losing his mind to writer's block you might end up with something like this imaginative inspired a little gimicky in places and reading it is an off balancing experience and fun","284":" a very enjoyable read that winks at the audience from the first lines on a page that reads if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience early on the author states these stories are all true but only somewhere else and indeed in a story with ever changing names locations titles the truth emerges in more ways than one this is a story about all the big things love ambition envy class and the nature of truth itself it tackles the lies perpetuated on us from every corner of power and the power that comes from cheating the system but it's all done with a wry smile and a healthy dose of wit in the end it's a work of fiction that goes a long way toward deciphering reality on a side note i especially liked the last line in the acknowledgements absolutely none of this would have happened if not for mrs inglis my seventh grade writing teacher at oak hill academy who gave me my first c on a paper because she knew i could do better if i tried","285":"speechless a beautiful novel within a novel within gatsby within a fractured fairy tale read now","286":"i won this as an arc through goodreads i had hoped to win it as i fell in love with the cover yes i judge books by the cover sometimes i've had the book for ages and finally picked it up to read what a ride fiction within fiction within fiction and i'm still wondering who was the true narrator don't wait monhs before you pick this gem up it's quirky witty and thoroughly enjoyable","287":"i truly enjoyed this book of doubt deception and discovery","288":"the characters names kept changing and it was hard to follow the story","289":" an unreliable and nameless narrator a narrative that twirls around itself misplacing the beginning and ending and changing the middle every few chapters you don't ever quite get your footing while reading this novel it spins you around and when you get to the end you feel compelled to start again at the beginning looking for the clues that you missed that might reveal its essential truth but that is exactly what this novel doesn't want to give up tell the truth but tell it slant is the advice the young nameless author protagonist gets during his first writing class and for the entire novel the reader is left tottering on a slanted board not knowing where to anchor himself in the story the novel is about the writing life with the main characters being two young writers one successful and one not and their actress friend who marries a prince but exactly who these people are and what the circumstances of their lives may be are never revealed or more properly they are revealed but at a slant in stories within novellas within the novel within the novel what is truth and what is fiction is never clear but the friendships jealousies and insecurities are vividly described despite the narrative uncertainties it is an interesting book funny at times and fun to wrap you head around while climbing through its intricacies it is also a little unbalancing since the author pokes fun at the reader with his narrative structure while simultaneously satirizing writers with his plot it is a hard balance to achieve but successful","290":"maybe the most fun and challenging book i've read this year what is truth and what is fiction how much of the life we live is made up of the stories we tell and the memories we bend to our own purposes therein lies the challenge for one spends most of this book discombobulated tossed about by a shaky narrative but it's a fun tossing and turning indeed i will read this again one day looking for bearing in vain","291":"this book started out so promising the writing is great but the story slowly started losing me and by the second half of the book i only finished because i was hoping it would end as well as it began","292":"i can not quite pinpoint what it was about this book that i just could not get into i found it extremely hard to get through and i had to force myself to read it i always admire a writer for writing and publishing a book even if it is not the type of book that ends up being for me but this one just did not click for me","293":"quite literally the best book i've read in a long time more on that later don't think about it just read it seriously","294":" i happily won this book from goodreads in a first reads contest the book follows the life of a nameless narrator who has always been interested in writing he tells various stories about his life as the son of an airline hostess the poor kid who charmed a southern belle an intelligent college student who attracted the attention of those around him all of his stories are to be taken with a grain of salt since he follows the advice to tell the truth but to tell it slant in writing and possibly in life we follow along on his adventures never quite sure what is truth and what is fiction we never even learn his name yet his story changeable as it is is interesting enough to keep us following along the book is funny self depracating and very clever i'm definitely glad i read this novel and i highly recommend it","295":"from as early as he can remember the hopelessly unreliable--yet hopelessly earnest--narrator of this ambitious debut novel has wanted to become a writer from the jazz clubs of manhattan to the villages of sri lanka kristopher jansma's irresistible narrator will be inspired and haunted by the success of his greatest friend and rival in writing the eccentric and brilliantly talented julian mcgann and endlessly enamored with julian's enchanting friend evelyn the green eyed girl who got away after the trio has a disastrous falling out desperate to tell the truth in his writing and to figure out who he really is jansma's narrator finds himself caught in a never ending web of lies i was really really really looking forward to reading this book and i was not disappointed the writing immediately grabbed me and i couldn't wait to see what would happen next i won't say that i read it in one sitting because i got distracted by the vlogbrothers but it was still a really fascinating novel the kind of novel that doesn't really have a specific genre the unchangeable spots of leopards discusses different types of truths and lies and fictions as well as being really entertaining i notice that i'm using a lot of really's in this review the three main characters in the unchangeable spots of leopards were also really fascinating to me evelyn is fascinating not only to our unnamed narrator but also to me and i'm sure other readers she was such an interesting mix of different parts both julian and the narrator were really interesting too more really's there are also brilliant stories within stories and more stories within those stories this was a bit confusing but also a great technique it creates more layers and characters that are based off of characters who are based off of characters who are based off of real people presumably and that's where the truth and lies and fiction come in i also loved that the reader gets to travel with the narrator all over the globe new york sri lanka dubai india and more there are so many locations that keep the book varied you never know where the narrator is going to be next he only stays in many of the locations for one chapter and then he moves again he encounters multiple reincarnations of julian and evelyn along the way before he finally meets up with them again he also encounters someone who seems to be a doppelganger in ghana as i've said many times before i love books that have multiple narratives woven throughout them and the unchangeable spots of leopards definitely had that not in the sense that the reader follows multiple characters at once but in the sense that there are multiple versions of each story stories within stories and more sometimes it seemed a bit unrealistic to me that the narrator could conceal his name so well there were so many moments when someone would be about to say his name and then the author would distract us or something else would happen and you wouldn't get to find out but then he gets involved with this girl julia and he doesn't even tell her his name what i did like was that throughout the book he goes through different aliases his first at a debutante ball under the name of a wilkie collins character i think that image someone not of that circle at a debutante ball using the name of a wilkie collins character kind of shows what the whole novel is like it's humorous mysterious evocative powerful and interesting literary fiction at its best i'm so so glad that i wasn't disappointed about this one as i sometimes am when i get irrationally excited about a book this is definitely a novel that i would whole heartedly recommend it's well worth reading thanks to viking for sending me a review copy www novareviews blogspot com","296":" so this book got off to a great start a ribald tale of lies told and hearts won it was even entertaining in the poor young aspiring writer at the expensive liberal arts college with the rich talented friend even though i have read that story in a few places before when it goes bad after they grow up so to speak i was a little bored with the unreliable narrator everything is fiction bit but somehow the story fought its way back into my heart i think somewhere on a set of stone stairs in iceland... in the end this was a satisfying story of writing reading life and love","297":" i will be honest i started this book as a last resort i was in hour three of absolutely nothing to do at work and this the only unread book in my bag of library returns i was desperate enough to get used to the odd conceit of the unreliable unknowable narrator every part of this book is carefully constructed as a piece of the author's mystery from the author's note to the terminus the note from the publisher is in line with tim o'brien's dedication in the things they carried and many mentions of book titles are like reading the syllabi for lit class with each chapter opening with a quote it furthers the essential idea of the fantasized narrator dropping names like tolstoy and hemingway connects to the well established tradition of english literature drawing focus to the ways today's literary readers must have some impression some opinion some awareness of these authors even if just from the way today's authors cite these titles as sources there's probably more to be said about the author's attempts to use his book as a commentary on literary fiction or the mindset of authors but i'm done constructing ideas of author based on their fictions at least for now","298":"3 1 2 if i could not a 4 due to a couple factors one read on audiobook making it difficult to backtrack and unconfuse myself about certain facts two while interwoven stories didn't complicate the book the name and venue changes certainly did overall a fine read","299":"i grew to like this book by the end but i struggled with the unreliable narrator a plot device that annoys me lolita had the same issue where you're never sure if what you're being told is true or the narrator's version of the truth but jansma is no nabakov","300":"rich u0026amp enamoring a love hate story between friends and writing the layers upon layers upon layers of the story led to a just satisfaction when at the end of the book the reader was able to distinguish what was truth from fiction around the same point the narrator finally did","301":"this book is a wild ride it's an engaging story and has compelling characters but the attempt to blur truth and reality made for some confusing moments along the way i got a little bored near the end as i didn't think the second half of the book where all the names of the characters were changed worked as well as the first half things are sort of tied up in the end so that it's not completely maddening but there's some overreaching here it's jansma's first novel and i would definitely like to see more of his work","302":" there is only one way to read this book to devour it in one sitting if the reader is unable to do so it will devour them in between readings in any case it will color their thoughts for days after they have finished the dynamic between the three major characters is somewhat reminiscent of early palahniuk namely invisible monsters the storytelling nature of the narrative as well as some degree of nonlinearity also bring an edge of the dangerous or unexpected to the tale it hints at some greater meaning without directing spelling it out the nameless main character tells his story sometimes fantastic almost to the point of unrelatablity and manages to evoke empathy with every step forward no matter how begrudgingly it is torn from the reader","303":"i won a copy of this book from a goodreads giveaway thanks goodreads and that is definitely a contributing factor as to why i'm having such a hard time deciding on a rating for it it's a good book just not great jansma is a good writer and i really enjoyed his style except the recurring mentions of leopards got to be a little heavy handed it's like he picked the title of the book before he wrote it then had to keep remembering to throw in a scene with the rudyard kipling story a guy who looks like a black panther and knows a surprising amount about zoology leopard skin clothing etc the title doesn't need to be such a literal theme the first half was definitely the weakest for me i'm not sure how much of this story is true and based on real life and yes i know that's the whole point toying with your idea of reality and truth but the beginning comes off as a memoir and it's not a very interesting memoir it's a pet peeve of mine when authors are too self indulgent and write about their own boring lives with a faux philosophical sense of nostalgia so i got kind of tired of the multiple stories about the poor sensitive boy lusting after the sophisticated chick who just doesn't see him as boyfriend material seen it before not interesting also was anyone else reminded of the perks of being a wallflower the trio that consists of the shy romantic writer the flamboyantly gay best friend and the unattainable actress kind of formulaic the second half rescued the whole book for me it picked up a lot and went in a different direction with more multi dimensional characters and intriguing plots i guess i will go with 3 stars since goodreads won't let me do half stars worth reading but it just didn't hook me","304":"in the unchangeable spots of leopards a novel jansma builds a story containing fictions upon fictions through an unreliable narrator and somehow ends up with a story about truth the unnamed narrator is the ultimate con artist story teller who is preoccupied with his own story to the detriment of all his relationships but possibly finds some redemption in the end bromance love story adventure meta fiction all wrapped up in the unchangeable spots of a leopard","305":"i enjoyed reading the individual stories that make up this novel but how they all fit or came together was too much for me when two of the characters names suddenly changed that really threw me for a loop i'll be thinking about this book for awhile","306":"funny and enthralling part bright young literary manhattan things part world weary adventures around the world part lifelong love story part lifelong friendship story book within a book within a book in a way reminiscent of emotionally weird absorbing consideration of the author as liar plagiarist theif both the author when creating fiction and any of us as we figure out create ourselves looking forward to sorting it all out on a re read","307":"great i wish i had a gay literary rival first ending was total cheese though","308":"an extremely unorthodox protagonist made this a very refreshing read lots of twists turns and oh moments the kind of book you feel you have to re read to fathom the ingenuity of plot and masterful writing combined","309":"a fiction book about writing living fiction","310":" i've read the unchangeable spots of leopards more times than i can count and though my expectations are high every time i return to the first page it never ceases to surprise me even upon initial reading leopards feels like an old friend you want to begin it again the moment you have turned the final page and this will happen without fail upon every reading i can't give a review worthy of the book it would be a waste of words to try leopards speaks for itself in all of its layers of time and space and perspective full of truth and lies fiction and so called reality the writing is beautiful more beautiful than quite seems fair for a debut novel the narrator is at once charming inviting suspicious and deceptive i can't resist a good liar and jansma's unnamed narrator is a great one all hats off for this book it can and will hold its own with the literary fiction of its day and i believe last far longer perhaps forever a modern classic to be sure","311":"i loved the prose of this text jansma is a beautiful word by word writer i do think the chapters seem disjointed borrowing from the chapters before but at a slant after hearing him speak at a reading and finding that this book originated as a collection of generally unrelated short stories i see how the unevenness happens it is like the underlying plot line was created after the majority of the book much like cole porter constructing entire shows around songs already written that said it was a challenging book and certainly worth the read i can honestly say i did think a whole lot about truth what truth means and how we manipulate our truths","312":"i have zero interest in the sexual angst of men who repeatedly fall in love with cold emotionally unavailable women at least according to them i made it only about 1 3 of the way through the book but seeing how the leopard's spots are unchangeable... i hate wasting my time and money on bad books","313":" surprisingly i really enjoyed this book as i look back on reading it while i was reading i got somewhat tired of the nameless and unreliable anti hero because he was just such an unjustifiable jerk but as the story developed he also grew and seemed to make more sense to me this book deserves 4 stars if not just for the last chapter which was incredibly heart wrenching and probably the most admirable thing the main character did throughout the entire book i think jansma did a wonderful job getting into the characters' minds he showed us that what really matters aren't facts but feelings","314":"around the world with a charmingly unreliable narrator in this coming of age tale for a complete list of winners please visit www ala org rusa awards","315":"what is the difference between fact and fiction where do you draw the lines between lies and truth these are the questions the reader struggles with while listening to the narrator of jansma's beautiful book our unnamed narrator is a writer of fiction but his fiction almost has more of a ring of truth to it than his actual life if you can discern which is which jansma takes us around the globe and back and forth in time periods aways with the same group of 3 friends but you are never sure where jansma's story leaves off and the narrator's begins this is a wonderful book on writing books the story of 3 friends and the love of a beautiful woman","316":"keeps you on your toes with the most untrustworthy narrator","317":"interesting novel the same characters reappear throughout the book but with different names and different details i never knew what was supposed to be truth and what was supposed to be fiction","318":"i liked this book with the most unreliable narrator imaginable i am looking forward to more books from mr jansma","319":"awesome this gets my vote for best novel of 2013 so far layer upon layer upon layer of a story within a story read this one now did i mention i really liked it what is truth is fiction just another name for lies lots to ponder","320":"beautifully written and interesting but a little pretentious i didn't like the narrator he was basically a womanizing unemployed loser living in the shadow of his extremely successful author best friend well on again off again best friend the names of the characters changed half way through the book and i'm not really sure why i get that the narrator had blurry lines between fact and fiction but that just seemed to be trying a little too hard to be unusual and thought provoking","321":"a very interesting tale but yet again one that doesn't give you an ending this drives me crazy i don't want to make up my own ending rather i want the author to do that","322":"an excellent book of meta narrative that asks us to question what is fiction and what is real and isn't fiction more real than fact some of the time while i enjoyed reading the tales of the main character his journey from poor southern boy to friend of a spoiled heir to world traveler and trying to figure out what is real and what is fiction his writing style was not my favorite but i still loved the story and it caused me to think a lot about the fictions we tell about ourselves every day because when we tell the stories of our own lives aren't they all at least partly fiction","323":"this is a quirky and extremely well written book definitely recommend","324":"this is the story of an aspiring writers who falls under the spell of another author and a female actress who is his friend the first few chapters and very strong as is the books conclusion but central section in my opinion drifts a little when the central character meets two girls on a train also he places excerpts from their fiction in the book which was a distraction from the central plot it is still worth four stars just don't get to distracted when the veers off topic from time to time","325":" i didn't like the almost sole focus on the best friend character but aside from that fact was one of the most intriguing books i've ever read i loved how it kept you involved by changing changing names of characters from real life to a story of real life to some half real real life which very cleverly proves its point about how many authors can and do take creative liberties when relating true stories i only wish i could have the pleasure of re reading this book again for the first time because there truly isn't anything like it also i won this book from a giveaway on goodreads","326":"i enjoyed this book immensely even though the characters bordered on somewhat melodramatic on occasion i thoroughly enjoyed the story u0026amp it's depth not many books follow a linear timeline anymore u0026amp this one was no exception however the nonlinear did not leave you lost but carried the story where it needed to go and the different novels dipped into throughout only left me wanting to read those as well jansma is truly a gifted writer u0026amp i look forward to reading more of his work","327":"this book will make you appreciate the art of writing it is a beautiful read and the narrative follows an unexpected path it is not often that i am continually surprised with the direction a book goes and i found myself regularly having to take a step back and checking my assumptions about the way the story would unfold the surprise was a thrill and made me realize how accustomed i was to knowing more or less how things would happen this book forces you to own up to your presumptions and throw them out the window you have no idea where the author is taking you but it's so much fun that you don't care","328":" kristopher jansma's debut is ambitious and delightful a big hearted novel that sweeps the reader from raleigh to new york to sri lanka dubai and lots of places in between it's also pure narrative quicksilver one moment grounding you in an emotionally nuanced story the next sweeping you elsewhere and scrambling your perceptions the story follows an unnamed and unreliable narrator as he pursues his dream of being a writer while facing competition from rival writer julian mcgann who introduces him to evelyn a woman who becomes the object of his affection over many years and many versions of the truth throughout the narrative is sprinkled with passages from the narrator's fiction including stories with names like \"just another bastard out of carolina\" and \"the trouble with ibsen \"the book's first half follows the narrator julian and evelyn as they come of age it's the book's second half that's most nebulous as our narrator takes on new identities and events become less and less reliable if it sounds confusing it's because it's meant to be jansma has created an elaborate and exceedingly clever narrative that will make you think about the nature of truth as well as the many aspects of storytelling it's also very funny whether he's describing luxembourg \"it feels less like a grimm land of trolls and big bad wolves and more like disneyland paris \" or posing a questions like \"so you two have been what eating praying loving \" jansma has a humorous fresh voice that handles both the sublime and the ridiculous with confidence jansma's narrator says \"somewhere in this empty space between lies and fictions is the truth \" the one truth that's impossible to overlook when reading this knock out debut is that jansma is a talented writer from whom we hope to be hearing much more","329":"loved the technique and stories within stories was a little confusing to follow at some points but overall it was a good read","330":" this is one of those books i'm going to have a problem explaining a la philip roth i spent the whole of this book never knowing the narrators name but i knew him so well otherwise it's a story about finding yourself but not in a cliche way a writer the narrator surrounds himself in the best and most interesting life story but he seemingly can't write the truth of life in his fiction told in short stories spanning a few decades you hear stories and read some of his and watch him on a path to somewhere see bad description beautiful book","331":"i must rate it a three because though it was well written and explorative it was also not intriguing enough to not put it down it took me two weeks to get through this book as compared to the 7 hrs it took me to read a much more intriguing book of about the same length","332":"loved this book the writing and stories are fantastic and i didn't want it to end","333":"well written with many moments of genius but i've finally accepted that i'm not the target market for unreliable narrators","334":"i loved this book it was so well written beautiful use of metaphors literary references wow less than 300 pages but every word counts my only complaint if i can even call it that is that it does get a little exhausting keeping track of someone else's invented truths still a must read","335":"this is one of the few that i will read again the narrator's voice was thrilling i had a hard time putting it down i think it was because he seemed like such a sincerely genuine liar i felt bad for him at times mad at him embarrassed for him mostly i felt sad for him i also felt jealous of jeffrey for him","336":" i received an advance copy through goodreads first reads ok maybe i'm missing something here that everyone else got but this book completely missed the mark for me the premise is certainly interesting a series of short stories and even stories within stories centered around three main characters the relationship between the characters is the same but their names and life details change sounds appealing enough plus one star for a unique premise plus one star for somebeautifully told scenes and nice imagery with all of these stories and stories within stories the author forgets that we should actually be interested in these charcters as people or at least as characters i stuggled to connect with any of them for the first third of the book was bored in the next third and completely skimmed the final third just to be done with it already by the end of the book starting another new story wasn't interesting or intriguing it was annoying why would i want to hear more about these people that 200 pages in i still really don't know the sad truth is i didn't want to hear more about them and it was a bit of a slog to get through","337":" tell all the truth but tell it slant emily dickinsonthe unchangeable spots of leopards is a novel about authors writing truth lies and figuring out what matters in life jansma's debut made me want to write he taps into the creative process with so much precision and brings up the questions every writer asks themselves at some point what is truth what is fact fiction why should lies be any less impactful or important than truth i love the ambiguity of the narrator unnamed and unreliable yet the only source of truth the reader has i did feel that the first and second parts were a little disjointed style wise but then that too is part of the novel's uniqueness in this second half the narrator forces the reader to question was it golf or tennis that he played growing up india or luxembourg is is friend's name really julian or jeffery i love how part two bends the these facts the ones the reader once thought were the only true part of the book and makes you wonder was it a prince or simply a rich ceo was it really an airport or was it a train station i very much enjoyed this fictitious on so many levels and witty novel","338":"the story of a writer whose best friend is a writer and who is in love with an actress married to a noblemen the story is told many times over in the book with changes in names and places which can be confusing it was like reading drafts of a novella as the writer edits the story good imagery and skillful writing","339":"absolutely loved it please read it if you like fiction","340":" kristopher jansma has authored an extraordinary debut novel that will hit the shelves in march 2013 depending on how you look at it the book reads as a novel or a beautifully interwoven collection of short stories it is engaging and humorous but honest to a fault and so good you won't want to put it down for the rest of this review please go here http wcplfineprint blogspot com 201 our fine print blog http wcplfineprint blogspot com provides suggestions from our well read library staff the perfect resource for finding your next great read","341":"very metafictional at one point we're reading an excerpt from a book written by the main character of a story that is a thinly veiled account of an event in the life of the narrator of tusol which of course is a book itself jansma is extremely thorough and tusol is highly cohesive but on every level it drips with pretension that i suspect is only partly adopted jansma is just a bit too impressed with himself though not without some reason that metafictional aspect makes it hard to judge the book it's always dangerous to talk about a fictional piece of great fiction because sooner or later you have to reveal it and it has to be great but here we know the main character is a bit of a hack so the stories he writes don't have to be great at the same time he's narrating tusol so that doesn't have to be great either jansma's crafted himself a safety net if tusol is great then it's great if it's not then that's by intention because the narrator is a hack the ending is surprisingly predictable","342":" this novel is beautifully written and i loved everything about it for the first half after that it went south for me morphing into some kind of howard hughes sound alike story i lost the plot or jansma did and wasn't ever able to pick it back up the last 50 pages were a drudgery to slog through and i mourned the absence of the momentum i enjoyed in the first half aspiring writers looking for fine examples of word craft will still enjoy jansma's talent with the written word but beyond that sadly i wouldn't recommend it http bibliofilesbookrating blogspot","343":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i won a copy of the unchangeable spots if leopards from first reads giveaways i changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars because the more i think about this book having finished it yesterday the more i like it it exists in this weird space is it fiction or is it true i'm still thinking about it i can't say exactly why this story is staying with me but maybe i can come back to this review in a few days with a better idea for now i feel a bit like jeffrey when the narrator finds him at the i won a copy of the unchangeable spots if leopards from first reads giveaways i changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars because the more i think about this book having finished it yesterday the more i like it it exists in this weird space is it fiction or is it true i'm still thinking about it i can't say exactly why this story is staying with me but maybe i can come back to this review in a few days with a better idea for now i feel a bit like jeffrey when the narrator finds him at the writer's colony feverishly typing but not really saying anything another reviewer called it twisty and complicated i like that more","344":"jansma's writing style is very fresh and unlike any book i've read before kept me curious through the entire story in a word clever","345":"seems appropriate that a book about a writer should be so very well written i am always blown away by an author's ability to string words together that have such amazing impact and resonate so well in addition the story's various plot lines really hold your interest","346":"a delightful page turner of a first novel leopards is something of a garden of forking paths the borgesian allusion also made at one point in the novel by its wonderfully unreliable narrator of his own notebook to not give too much away suffice it to say that the work is really a series of fictions or possible paths collapsing in on one another in which hide facets of the narrator's truth though not as structurally complex as say mitchell's matryoshka doll cloud atlas leopards is still a considerable feat of narrative design that like mitchell's work offers support to the themes of the piece leopards is truly a masterful writing debut about the symbiotic co creation of writers and their stories of the strangeness of reality and the fictions that construct it and of friends lovers and novels lost then found then lost once more though the book literally ends with the very words with which it began the reader nonetheless is entirely changed and with a deeper appreciation for dickinson's suggestion that writers tell all the truth but tell it slant well that and a desire to lose themselves all over again in the garden jansma has constructed disclaimer i received this book for free from the publisher through a goodreads com first reads giveaway my very sincere thanks to jansma viking goodreads and christina elizabeth edgars boyleston at haslett u0026amp grouse if that is in fact your real name","347":"definitely a good enough read to sail through in two days while stuck at home in bed but still trying to wrap my head around all of the twists and turns","348":"i am not sure how to rate this i'm between a 2 and a 3 one chapter i didn't have a clue what the author was talking about otherwise it was well written will be interested to hear what my book club has to say about it","349":"i wanted to like it more than i actually did what it tries to do is clever but there's such a thing as too unreliable a narrator","350":"a good story with some good plot twists but to compare it to fitzgerald is a bit of a stretch it's not a bad read but i don't think it's an instant classic","351":"i realized about halfway through that this novel seems to be more of a commentary than a story the ever constant blurry line between reality and fiction is constantly leaving the protagonist floundering through his life as a writer meanwhile the reader or maybe i should just say i is am simply jaded and waiting for jansma to actually bring the themes to fruitful action by the end of the book though i really did come to appreciate the characters' relationships and they felt comically real overall i will give this book three stars simply because i require an actual reason to turn the page and i know that jansma is definitely a better writer than this first book suggests and am interested in what he has in store","352":" but without fingers i couldn't hit the keys on the typewriter or grip a pen at first i think this may be some sort of sweet relief a reprieve from writing the same scene over and over but the writing over and over again isn't a sign of madness it's the only thing letting the madness out this is a first time novel about a writer who has yet to be published a treacherous genre filled with many books that i think appeal to people younger than myself and which once appealed to me more than they do now see for example all the sad literary men or indecision even though now that i think of it neither of those might be about being a young writer but it's sort of the same feeling or maybe this song which is maybe sort of what is good and awful all rolled into three minutes and forty two seconds of some chords and words that strikes me as being both pretty amazing and terrible all at once you hear advice to write what you know and people take that to heart and then they write about what they know best and what they think is most interesting in the world themselves i admit it's a fun topic to write about even if it's not necessarily any fun being oneself see i just did it right there and now just did it again it's like crack if i wanted to make it literary then i'd just write he in front of everything that i i mean he would do or just continue to use i but call it a 'novel' and make the setting something really fucking absurd like a disgusting burrito fast food restaurant filled with a collection of people some so far fetched that they couldn't possibly be real but also peopled with some people who might seem to be too stupid to be real but who are actually fairly representative of real people howard jacobson in his vapid novel zoo time writes about a writer trying to write a book while saying witty things about once a writer is writing a book about writing they are washed up he says a lot of things in the book many that make him sound similar to the grumpy old man that philip roth sounds like whenever he launches his newest attack on something like those gosh darned kids and their wikipedia i never got around to writing a review for the jacobson book but it wasn't very good oh well but in light of his remarks what to make of first time novelists writing about young writers what can you say it's not like it's a new genre some fairly respectable authors have gone this route some very shitty books have been written following this route this book wasn't shitty it was actually quite charming something that can be difficult to pull off when dealing with characters who inherently are fairly unlikable and self obsessed wienies this is just an unfair generalization of many twenty something yearolds who were sort of like myself but who were probably just that much less neurotic and armed with even the smallest knowledge of grammar to try their hand at setting the world ablaze with their words and ideas maybe it was the slight touch of precociousness of the supporting characters which gave it that ol' secret history feel without delving full on into donna tartt land maybe it was the the narrator wasn't precocious or a tortured genius just waiting for the world to recognize him and give him what was due to him rather he's somewhat of a phony a liar who is aware of his lies and fiction that he's based his life around but not in the way that one can imagine an eggers like play of this idea to work itself out i'm just chucking names around maybe because i'm not really sure what to say about the book because i don't have anything to say about books anymore i just like or don't like things and leave the thinking to those abler than i see it's like crack laced with meth with maybe some pcp stuck in there someplace so you can act out in some painful self loathing without feeling the consequences or is the reason we sometimes hate books like this is because while they aren't necessarily any good they are stories we think we could tell books we could have written contracts we could have snagged from big publishing houses even if in the end we were just destined to meet our readers in the bargain bins but this book doesn't need to be hated it can be enjoyed because it sidesteps the tripwires that clodding self obsessed feet plod right into when the authors stop starring at their feet long enough for some navel gazing so many words to say i enjoyed the book i haven't enjoy some other writers who have written similarish books thank you natalie for lending me this i wouldn't have read it otherwise and for this imperfect immortality what prices have been paid how many lives lungs and veins shredded polluted shot how many children deserted family secrets betrayed sordid trysts laid for strangers to see how many wives and husbands shoved to the side how many ovens scorched with our hair gun barrels slid between our lips bathtubs slowly reddened by our blood and twisting rivers drowned that drowned us how many flawed pages burned in disgust and reduced to ashes how many flawless moments observed from just a slight distance so that later we might reduce them to words all with an unspoken prayer that these hard won truths might outlast the brief years of our lies","353":"this is not terribly long for a novel which makes it all the more amazing that kristopher jansma is able to weave together so much simultaneous information and mystery i loved it and i will eagerly await any other books he may release in the future my full review appears at glorified love letters","354":"great choice for bookclub this month fascinating writing","355":" i adore this book admittedly it took me a while to figure out exactly what was going on as the story changes completely about halfway through but as is explained in the author's note which is part of the story don't skip it the protagonist has lost 3 books that he's written this book is comprised of two of these volumes very similar in theme and tone though with different characters and settings the way it's written reminds me of nabokov's pale fire with the fictional author and stories within a story it's as much for lovers of good literature as for book geeks who enjoy unconventional structure","356":"the last 10% of this book was so wonderful that i'm giving the whole thing an extra star there was a point when i straight up underlined 3 pages in a row","357":"jansma's first book is an enjoyable read but it doesn't offer anything new the friendship among the three main characters is very reminiscent of chabon's mysteries of pittsburgh the book within a book portions are akin to atwood's blind assassin and even more so to gilbert's less lauded u0026amp sons the structure alludes to joyce's finnegans wake the symbolism is so obvious that even i not always the most alert to representation could recognize the appearance of a leopard in every chapter the title also gives the book's thesis away there is also some of the ennui that sets in when a writer writes fiction about writing it's almost self indulgent all that being said jansma writes well he's created a relatively unique in my experience as a consumer of culture origin story for his protagonist i may recommend it to a few heavy consumers of literary fiction but it won't become a book i suggest or give to anyone in my life who reads","358":"this is a tricky book it starts out innocent enough but as you read further you begin to realize that things are not as they seem you have just been fed a bunch of lies by the unreliable narrator now you are traveling down a slippery slope and start to question everything from the beginning apathy and frustration almost makes you toss the book in the garbage but something keeps pulling you back to find out what happens next the unnamed narrator is an aspiring writer who quickly discovers he does not have the talent or skill to become a famous novelist himself he slips into the void between truth and fiction in an effort to create new identities at his easy disposal he has lied so often that even he has trouble deciphering what is real or not he is essentially a pathological liar he goes on these wild adventures or does he around the world trying to - what - find himself find julian jeffrey write the next great novel what the heck is he doing and do you really care be honest with yourself...clearly this was not the book for me it sat on the floor of my office for almost a month now i could only manage to read a couple chapters a week before i needed another break","359":"i gave this book 3 stars but perhaps if you had the luxury to read it in a couple of sittings it might be better the story line is very unique but with all of the changes between chapters it can lose momentum","360":"kristopher jansma's debut novel the unchangeable spots of leopards explores the angst frustrations anxieties and apprehensions among the many other personal demons two authors battle as they age yet the book is much more than just a study of writers' quirks oddities and insecurities jansma's story also celebrates the complexities of dynamic relationships visits the ways good intentions occasionally spiral dangerously downward and examines the few avenues that sometimes arise by which redemption can be secured while an enjoyable read one that i felt immersed within from the very first few pages i found a few subplots grow increasingly preposterous still i stuck with jasnma and i feel i was decently rewarded he brings the book to a thoughtful if predictable in retrospect close what's that mean is it fair to state \"predictable in retrospect \"i think so here's why although the closing scene's location and players aren't overly surprising and certainly won't win acclaim for demonstrating post postmodern fictional innovation or something similarly silly i found myself invested in the characters and the story i wanted to know what happened i cared in other words and when an author makes you care about the characters the author's done something right","361":"this book was very different from almost any other book i have read at the very end i finally understood the publisher's note at the beginning of the book that states if you believe you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience the writing is clever funny bold and yet always leaves one wondering what is fact and what if fiction the story is basically about a young writer trying to reinvent himself along his journey we met the people closest to him each chapter is set up about a small part of his life that reads like a story this was an original very engaging read i received the book as part of the goodreads giveaway program in exchange for a review","362":" i absolutely loved this book that said it took me a while to review it as it's one of those books that needs digesting by using this nontraditional form of storytelling and narrative unreliability it makes the reader focus more on the message and threads of 'truth' within the lies and how the reader felt while reading it... it's a very fresh postmodern approach to storytelling and one that i completely fell in love with this was a really difficult book for me to review because it is really something that should be experienced it is an innovative intelligent humorous unique read and each reader will take away something different if you are looking for a book that will take everything you know about postmodern lit and turn it on its head than this is the book for you a haunting novel that will make you question everything you think you know as truth see my full review here","363":"i am shocked to have enjoyed this book as much as i did i normally reserve five star reviews for novels that are an unadulterated pleasure to read stories that grab my heart and idyllic characters whose lives an author can't possibly flesh out fast enough to satisfy my curiosity kristopher jansma however demanded my attention by almost flawlessly portraying intensely flawed characters in situations that are simultaneously surreal authentic relatable fantastical and believable here are two of my favorite quotes \"this was why we we were friends this was why i cleaned up the wonton soup bowls and recycled the vodka bottles it wasn't about having a trunk full of two thousand dollar cans of caviar and an apartment with a view of union square it was about having someone who gave it to you straight when you wanted to be lied to \" \"up on the stage all the way across the room a little ghanaian ensemble is playing something all horns and bluesy while a large dark woman moans like she's never seen things so bad in her life \" add in the mind bending literary turducken as in story within a story within a story think inception or matrix only less disorienting and more cohesive and i haven't been able to move on carrying the characters and the mystery of their behavior with me long after returning the library book","364":" i didn't love this book but i really really liked it it is superbly written and constructed as a writer myself i always enjoy books about writers and writing u0026amp the mad desire to write a good book and the oft attendant anxiety and jealousy for me this is enough of a conflict although i realize that it might not be for the non writers who are looking for a good story jansma has an amazing ability to create a sense of place the wildly different locations from ghana to iceland all came alive for me on the page i wasn't really all that invested into figuring out how the puzzle pieces of different stories fit together i read for the separate stories themselves these vignettes were fascinating to me my one qualm was that the character of evelyn and her other alter egos was a little flat and i never felt any chemistry between her and the narrator it was always jarring for me when she threw herself at him i didn't feel his love for her it seemed just stated on the page a bit of a literary device then again i really really like books about literary devices if they are superbly written and constructed it's just this one i didn't love","365":"so very smart reminded me structurally a bit of 'inside llewyn davis' an interesting look at how the stories we tell ourselves become reality even when they're not or are","366":"chose to read this based on recommendations of a couple of friends that read it for a class they took i really enjoyed this book and its characters i could hear some david sedaris and holden caulfield as i read it","367":"actual rating 2 5i'd heard all sorts of things about how clever this novel was but i found myself unfortunately disinterested in jansma's characters what happened to them jansma's prose itself was undeniably beautiful but the story never fully reeled me in i'll chalk it up to the fact that i am probably just not clever enough for this novel","368":"oh i just loved this book","369":" for a debut novel this book is nothing short of amazing i wish i could get inside of this author's mind i will be waiting for more books this is the best book i've read in months it's a long tale of friendship a trio of friends over the course of decades we read through their hopes dreams regrets and follies it's a very smartly written book a masterpiece of connected realities and fiction i appreciated the classic literature references in each chapter for someone who used to dream of being a writer as a young adult this book demonstrates the dangers that go along with aspiring to be a great writer or actually becoming one","370":"i don't have to write a review since somebody named greg the #16 reviewer on goodreads wrote a really really good review basically i don't know what to say about it either but although he said he didn't know what to say about it he proceeded to say what he didn't know quite well i would recommend it to writers or wanna be writers or people who enjoy books about either","371":"read in one gulp i thoroughly enjoyed this story of story and friendship it made me think about writing and about class and about character and the unreliable narrator something i wonder at and adore","372":"didn't follow what was supposed to be happening in places odd book","373":" this was an excellent debut there were only a few instances of a sentence or description pulling me away from the narrative i think that a few tweaks could've made this a 4 star book a more concrete third component to julian jeffrey is the first thing that comes to mind though the ending was a little tidy and predictable the last 50 60 pages is really what took my review from 4 to 3 but i very much hope that the author keeps writing and that we see more polished works from him in the future","374":"i fell deeply in love with this book from the very first paragraph delightful touching sad funny witty a full range of emotions awaited me from the beginning i never wanted this story to end but of course it did and i am left completely satisfied like i just ate my favorite food","375":"i picked it for my book club because it sounded interesting i enjoyed it because it had unusual twists and turns it made me think along several lines one do writers really just keep regurgitating someone else's story with different details two how memories can be rewritten and three how people say the same problems come back to you until you get it right many in my book club were not impressed however","376":"i was ready to give up on this book but i'm so glad i didn't the narrator is so unreliable that you're not even sure whether to believe him when he bold states i'm a liar that's just what i am i lie like i'm breathing the narrator is like an accident he is horrible but you can't look away subtly though the book makes the reader look inward very clever jansma tricks the reader into caring he's as much as a con artist as his narrator and i mean that in the best possible way","377":"this book suffers from excessive male angst while simultaneously suffering from excessive male self congratulation","378":"lovely little novel a quest for love and friendship while being insecure in life and love","379":"i love the imagination that good writers have this story circles around on itself it would be hard to follow if you spread the reading over too many days but it's very creative the lead character struggles with a desire to be the best while feeling that he's second best and he runs so far form his perceived imperfections that he forgets who he is and starts to wonder if he's closer to perfection by not being himself","380":"excellent writing stories that fold back over onto themselves characters who lie and you love the kind of book that you want to discuss with someone minutes after you read the last line audio edition is excellent","381":"i can't decide if this book is more clever than good but it is a great debut a hall of mirrors","382":"the exploration of truth lies and storytelling was fantastic the stories told were engaging i could barely put the book down","383":"the unreliable narrator and writer of kristopher jansma's the unchangeable spots of leopards tells readers upfront that figuring out the reality of his life will mean reading between the lines of his dramatic and imaginatively penned stories the result is a deeply moving exploration of love friendship and the often confounding and counter intuitive nature of truth and storytelling","384":"creative fun book","385":"i didn't like this at first but it pays off well the characters seem cliche and one dimensional at first although the characters are not the strong point of this novel they serve their purpose in the end","386":"i would pay a lot of money to never read another critically acclaimed book by a white dude where the big epiphany is that he actually knows nothing about the girl he thought he was in love with somehow these books keep slipping onto best of lists this one is better paced and more formally inventive than most still it's 250 pages for a guy to realize he never bothered listening to or getting to know women","387":"part novel part a collection of independent stories that combine to form a single narrative this was an absolute delight jansma's style was extremely readable and i couldn't wait to learn more about the characters even though they are really none of them likable","388":"there are a number of entertaining set pieces but overall the scent of mfa in creative writing is overpowering","389":"i really enjoyed this book his writing is quite pleasant and even though the stories are pretty out there there characters were still relatable i will take this over sedaris any day","390":"a peripatetic exploration of identity truth and envy this debut novel pulls a few tricks out of the bag but they don't feel overused unlike the leopard metaphor which was perfect until being hit just a note too hard in the final chapters the set up is similar to the marriage plotbut the characters despite their gaping flaws are infinitely more likeable i recommend the audiobook","391":"a little confusing and braggy at times but very clever and extremely creative the prose was a joy to read laughed out loud at the line in which the narrator muses that if he died he wouldn't have to finish his novel","392":" a welcome drizzle after my brief drought of novels enjoyed pacing its circle it developed my thinking of truth and fiction and all in between in writing mostly invisible the book hoodwinks its reader well to provoke the thinking themes of gold leopards checkers dream girls stuckness turn the narrative towards a believable fantasy maybe too self contained a fun comparison with the writing life anne dillard and most literary references overlap with fun home alison bechdel see also stranger than fiction film","393":"this is a very promising first novel parts of it i absolutely love i can't wait to read his next effort and see where it leads","394":"once i started it was hard to put it down clever writing style the novel is a collection of short stories that tell the overall story and sometimes the short stories have stories within them","395":" another in a recent series of audiobooks that can best be described as exhausting i'm afraid with a plot that careens and lurches like a pinball game eduardo ballerini's excellent audio narration helped with my resolve to get to the end which was sorely tempted around halfway through with the trio dissolved and the self identified unreliable narrator going his own way jeffrey a k a julian was almost endearing reminding me a bit of sebastian in brideshead revisited so my flagging interest revived upon his reappearance around the 3 4 mark the storeyline itself aside i felt i'd been asked to suspend disbelief far too many times things an editor should've caught two crates of caviar in the trunk of a jaguar boxes i might've understood but crate brings up an image of something large enough to need a crane to be moved and a jag trunk isn't exactly roomy jeffrey commandeers a bottle of veuve cliquot champagne on a flight from new york to las vegas i've flown upfront on similar routes and you're lucky they have champagne at all or a decent white actually no flight attendant is going to hand over a bottle to a passenger to serve himself grace kelly and queen nur of jordan married reigning monarchs here we have a glamorous american married to a fifth son which is pretty far removed from all the hoopla moreover said fifth son is hardly likely to go on overseas trips to cement trade relations regularly i don't think finally the snotty rich kids at the beginning would have been at a prep school not the same public high school as our narrator my verdict jansma's a terrific writer with a great sense of place and character but here things got out of hand i'd be quite interested in another offering from him hopefully shorter and tighter meanwhile i'd recommend this book but wouldn't fault folks who couldn't go the distance","396":"a novel about novelists i kind of enjoyed it but it is annoyingly self referential and self conscious if you want a novel with interesting fully developed characters this is not the book for you","397":"i am torn about how to rate this book on the one hand the writing is so so good he makes it look effortless and brilliant and roughly the first half of the book is about as good as anything i've read certainly in recent memory pulitzer material but the book for me really hits a snag in tempo as well as stylistically from the grand canyon story onward what started out as incredibly original and inventive writing and somehow at the same time seems already a classic becomes by the books end stilted and predictable the plots began to seem less natural and flowing and far more forced and constructed in the worst way and the book started to drag and take on the feel of a teenager churning out pages to meet the requirement for a term paper and i hate to say that because i absolutely couldn't love what came before more especially for anyone that ever had thoughts of being a writer his work is so vital and inspiring i don't know what happened and it's interesting because it reflects changes in the narrative of the characters such as they are it's a shame that the flow of the writing could not follow through with what the author was trying to transition through with his protagonist because the second half of this book really was an effort for me to get through with a few minor bright spots as original inspiring and revelatory as the first half of this book was the second half was flat trite and predictable the author is clearly immensely talented and the first half of the book alone is well worth the read any one of those stories is award winning just phenomenally well written magical inspiring stories that make you thankful for the written word","398":"a book within a book within a book very clever and well written laugh out loud funny","399":"this book was captivating from the first pages an exploration on the meaning of fact and fiction it was enjoyable and surprisingly hilarious at times","400":"a fascinating exploration of truth and lies and fiction with an unreliable narrator as an added bonus","401":" told by one of the most enjoyable unreliable narrators i've ever come in contact with sometimes it's difficult to tell which stories are the truth and which ones are really happening but each section of the narrative is a lot of fun if this were any other book i think i would've hated both julian and evelyn they might've seemed a bit flat and cliched to me but jansma's narrator paints the characters in such a lovely way that draws you in to their world yet keeps you from taking these people and events too seriously","402":"fabulous book a must read more on http bookwinked wordpress com","403":"really enjoyed this a little confusing but that's definitely part of the point if you're intrigued by shifting notions of identity this is for you","404":"4 5 stars i loved this book it's very much a writer's book but not in a show offy way i've seen comparisons to cloud atlas u0026amp while that may be true in structure i found leopards more accessible enjoyable maybe because it's a single protagonist's journey rather than a large historical canvas i think the highest praise i can offer here is that i would reread this immediately if my to be read pile wasn't so ginormous","405":"i found myself a little lost in this book as the narrator weaves lies throughout and changes characters' names i appreciated following the friendship of three students from college into adult life and how they separated but came back together","406":"this novel really wasn't for me but i'm giving it the stars because of its clever and complex storyline","407":"by far the best novel i've come across in ages i'm impressed astonished and inspired","408":"this is a really interesting book and i think it is the author's first book while at times it is a bit confusing it is really worth trying to figure out who the narrator is even though his name seems to change throughout the book i would liken this to an early effort from paul auster i look forward to his next book","409":"i enjoyed the first half of the book far more than i enjoyed the second half of the book","410":"i really liked this so much i am always a sucker for a unique narratorial new word i invented voice but even so i was so much more pleased than i ever imagined also envious well done mr jansma well done","411":"sort of like a literary inception the stories within the story are realistic enough to confuse you as to which story you are reading an awesome journey for any wanna be writer","412":"i really liked this book it made me slightly uncomfortable at times in a good way though lots of unexpected things and the ending was well put together","413":"i really enjoyed this book the style is fresh and funny and the changes in style from chapter to chapter kept me on my toes i'm looking forward to his next book","414":"structurally more like related short stories","415":" at the heart of it all jansma's novel is about writing his style is one that draws you in immediately despite many of the descriptions being too perfect and much of the narrative being just a touch less believable than real life this is all excused because the narrator himself is a writer one who is constantly struggling to find the perfect words to create the perfect story at once a collection of short stories and an intricate novel you're often left trying to figure out what is true and what is just another of the narrator's imaginings barring the novel within a novel chapter the whole book is quite fun and easy to get lost in if you're a writer too it's enough to make you want to get in there and just do it","416":"this novel is more focussed on exotic locations and extraordinary events than on the supposed objective to explore a writer's tormented relationship with the creative act the narrator has a too flimsy presence making it hard to empathize with him by the time we got to africa i was wishing that he had stayed in new york and merely regaled us with more interesting thoughts","417":" the unchangeable spots of leopards is a story within a story within a story and all none or just some of it is true you suspect this might be a puzzling mind bending book when before you get to the first page you read this if you believe that you are the author of this book please contact haslett u0026amp grouse publishers new york new york at your first convenience and so it begins this dizzying little excursion it's oh so much fun the novel contains a dozen interconnecting sometimes overlapping stories all but one appears to be from the voice of the author whomever that is i do not believe we learn his real name ever he is a would be writer believing that being a great liar is his key to achieving that goal so he is loose with the truth even in his personal life and throughout the novel undergoes a variety of personas going by a variety of names timothy wallace pinkerton outis walter hartright even his closest friend accuses him of seeing him as nothing more than a character he's created each chapter story is a slight retelling or reworking of the same theme though most times well disguised names change places change events skewed so the reader is left with to wonder how much is real or is it all a lie as the author says at the end of his first bit of notes these stories are all true but only somewhere else 8 the author is jealous of his best friend and sometime roommate's literary ability at times named julian or jeffrey or anton depending on the retelling he is a talented though tortured soul their relationship reminded me somewhat of that between charles ryder and sebastian in evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited there is much more to this novel which i won't go into the coming of age story the author's search for the love of his life the travelogue aspect in dubai ghana luxembourg the quest for literary fame and fortune the demarcation between truth and lies fantasy and reality scattered throughout there is a recurring motif the game of checkers in the game of checkers if one has managed to move a piece all the way across the board to a square on the final row in enemy territory it is kinged and now inherits the abililty to move back to where it began the novel itself is recursive finally seeming to return to the beginning after reading it once skimming back over it again and then giving it much thought i'm still not quite sure i have my head around this novel it is surely one i will want to come back to again in the near future it's wonderful","418":" like a set of boxes within boxes jansma sets up his novel as smaller stories within a whole that you must keep opening to try to see what is within as his characters keep changing their names and even backgrounds it can be slippery reading to hold onto their lives what remains solidly in grasp however is the realization that his narrator comes to no matter how many skins you slip in and out of for others you can never completely slip out of yourself it's not a new concept but interestingly told u0026amp fairly quick read","419":"this book is quite the ride i enjoyed watching the struggles of the writers as they strive to achieve literary immortality as well as their growing self awareness delicious lyrical tale","420":"the first half was 5 stars the second half was interesting 3 5 stars it wove itself a little too deep for my taste wish the momentum of the beginning continued","421":" i thoroughly enjoyed this novel which is the same story told over and over again it teetered on the edge of too clever but never went over some readers may disagree with that assessment then again one critic called this a f scott fitzgerald meets wes anderson and certainly those celebrated artists are not universally loved when deciding whether to read this book i hesitated when i saw this is a novel about a writer i typically dismiss that type of writing as self serving self congratulating or unending whining about the difficulty of the craft i made an exception in this case and am glad i did the one criticism i have isn't anything damning yet i haven't read cloud atlas i hope that the originality of the unchangeable spots of leopards doesn't prove not so original after i do","422":"this is an incredible first novel and it will be great for book discussion groups the narrator is either unnamed or many named as an erstwhile writer who is telling you the story of his life or is it now you know why i want to discuss it jansma's writing is witty and clever and definitely a writer to watch","423":"there were parts of this book that were amazing as good as anything i've ever read there were other parts that were tedious the characters are not the most likeable but then who is if you really get to know them that being said you can't get to know these characters very well because they lie pretend and posture all the way through their lives which is kind of the point of the story i will read more kristopher jansma","424":"complex and literary the unchangeable spots of leopards is one of those special texts one i want to give 6 stars to i wrote this after my first read after rereading last week 7 16 7 18 2013 i still feel this jansma writes a rich and layered story within a story within a story within a story within a story there is so much in this text to think about it demands a close read and a reread","425":"f scott fitzgerald meets wes anderson is accurate and what a dream combination i was so upset when this charming whimsical captivating adventure of a novel finally had to come to an end it is an ode to storytelling that takes you all over the world with an unreliable narrator who keeps you on your toes too much fun","426":"i missed the point if there was one perhaps only a writer or would be writer can grasp the meaning in this work of fiction i probably would not have finished the book if there had been anything else available to read sorry i just did not connect with this tale","427":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the table of contents says the unchangeable spots of leopards is broken into two parts what was lost and what was found but it's really broken into about five the stages of the unnamed narrator's life from hopeful kid to opportunistic teen to eager jealous college student to ruthless adult the longest section and the one that crosses two timelines back to hopeful hopefully wiser adult once again the book is set between the early 1990s up to the mid 2000s but it reads both the prose and the table of contents says the unchangeable spots of leopards is broken into two parts what was lost and what was found but it's really broken into about five the stages of the unnamed narrator's life from hopeful kid to opportunistic teen to eager jealous college student to ruthless adult the longest section and the one that crosses two timelines back to hopeful hopefully wiser adult once again the book is set between the early 1990s up to the mid 2000s but it reads both the prose and the setting like the 1960s up until the final few chapters when smart phones start appearing in people's hands perhaps it's the leopard pillbox hat or the pretension and money dripping off of the main trio that gives me that impression it's a good thing and it's fun to read the trio are kind of the 60s version of trustafarians think old money beatniks i kept picturing dane dehaan as lucien carr in kill your darlings as julian jeffrey he has that decadent predatory look leopards is surrealist leans a lot on the themes--how can a single person run into that many leopard references in the span of ten years or lose that many manuscripts or become intimate with such wealthy wilde ian caricatures as his two best friends i say caricature lovingly imagine eva peron crossed with grace kelly for one and hemingway and fitzgerald squished into a single gay man for the other it's interesting to note that by the end the only one whose name we really know is jeffrey the only member of the trio who never really pretended to be anything else despite the fact that he was a boorish mean spirited addict most of the time not that the others weren't in their way but jeffrey wore it on his sleeve we only know the narrator's love interest as evelyn up until her indian japanese luxembourgian wedding and then it becomes clear that the narrator stole that name even though he did in a way steal it from her admittedly it was a little bit annoying that there was constantly an excuse to obscure the narrator's name but i guess it fits into the surrealist pattern of the thing and in the end it was charming that the book was published anyway with just a little personals ad to the writer to come claim his success leopards could stand to be a little more cohesive but the detached quality is understandable given the themes about \"truth\" after all some might say truth is best observed at a distance and of course the indication that it's an assembled mish mash of potential pieces of novels a book greater than the sum of it's mismatched parts it's melancholy and more than a little frustrating as someone who loves resolution that the narrator chooses to lose yet another book his only completed book but there's a little bit of hope and release that comes with it wherever he may be i hope the narrator is at peace and that he finally called his mother more","428":"this is such a very difficult book to review as to give away too much of the plot or say too much about the characters would ruin the reading experience of those yet to read it each chapter starts with a quote from a famous author about the art of writing the art of creating fiction or just lying the truth is beautiful without doubt and so are lies is the first one in the first section of the book what was lost our unnamed narrator starts telling us about his childhood waiting in terminal b of an unnamed airport for his flight attendant mother to come back from wherever she'd gone to next we're told how the twenty two page adventure story he wrote with illustrations was lost when the man who ran the watch repair suddenly collapsed and the book was thrown away he tells us about going to a debutante ball because the brother of the girl he fancied was injured on a golf course shortly before about going to college and starting to write in earnest striking up a friendship and life long rivalry with the mysterious and charismatic julian at college he also meets the glamorous evelyn a promising actress who may or may not be the love of his life in what was found we may finally have discovered the name of our narrator or have we he's had a disastrous falling out with his two closest friends and is now travelling the globe making a living from spinning clever and believable lies in one way or another this section really spans the globe set in parts in america dubai sri lanka iceland and a wealth of other locations and continues to explore the nature of truth lies and the art of storytelling can we trust our narrator or is he always going to be unreliable is he still telling us the truth but slant as he learned in college does it actually matter this book first came to my attention when joanna robinson one of the staff writers on pajiba raved about it saying it was one of the best books she'd read all year that made me notice it in a number of other places and other cannonballers and online reviewers have rated it very highly as well it made it a natural choice for a book everyone but you has read in my book bingo challenge and it also worked nicely in my a to z challenge i read it pretty much in one sitting while on the plane back from marrakesh after christmas it was one of the only things that took my mind off the churning nausea raging in my belly and for that i am very grateful i may not have loved it as much as joanna but i can highly recommend this clever book to anyone who likes a more unusual read exploring the joys of fiction","429":" literary fiction gets a bad rap it doesn't have to be ponderous inscrutable unreadable literary fiction doesn't have to mean some doorstop of a book that will be earnestly discussed in quiet voices on npr the kind of thousand page novel that everyone buys and no one reads literary fiction can be more than just a marker of elite taste - literary fiction can be fun inventive and playful it can have a plot it can be enjoyed authors like michael chabon tc boyle and gary shteyngart demonstrate that you can write sophisticated fiction that's loved by the public kristopher jansma shows how its done in the unchangeable spots of leopards this debut novel now available in paperback follows the worldwide travels of the ultimate unreliable narrator it's like ten books in one - a southern coming of age story an academic farce a new york excursion and an expat's tall tale - propelled forward by neatly contained chapters which are like stories within stories the unchangeable spots of leopards is compulsively readable filled with oddball characters strange situations and sudden turns of fate all told by a sort of nick carroway looking on enviously at the gatsbys all around him my only criticism the unchangeable spots of leopards switches scenes too quickly plot threads are picked up and dropped sometimes you want to know more about that couple in dubai you want more - a good sign in a novel ultimately the unchangeable spots of leopards is a book about stories the ones that are true and the ones we tell ourselves \"tell all the truth but tell it slant \" emily dickinson says a mantra that runs throughout this novel with their ability to tell it slant novels contain truths that you won't find in the newspaper the unchangeable spots of leopards demonstrates the power of literary fiction to provide enlightenment through entertainment great storytelling is a kind of trick an ancient one that we're programmed to enjoy like listening to some stranger's shaggy dog tale we know that what we're hearing is not technically true but we have to know how it ends great literary fiction is like that wrapping us up in an engaging story that tells it slant","430":" this is a remarkable novel many things in it spoke to me directly treats friendship adulthood writing fiction and reality and puzzles the reader with complex layering of stories recurring images and symbols compares favorably to the novel penelope by rebecca harrington much smarter cleverer though by no means erudite embraces the cosmopolitan and the heteroglossic nature of the present though in a way familiar to the point of cliche a very good novel not excellent worth reading enjoyable","431":"there were stories inside of stories inside of stories and although the characters' names changed the stories were all about the same things and went together remarkably well i really enjoyed this book about writing love competition and the search within life i finished this book wanting to be a writer and not wanting to be a writer i've stumbled upon several first novels this year and this one leads the way","432":"i read it so long ago that i no longer have a review to write perhaps later i will open the book skim around and give it a go at recollecting it was a solid 4 star for me","433":"i love quirky writing styles i crave these authors who can take a story and tell it in a unique way kristopher jansma is such a writer the unchangeable spots of leopards took me on a journey around the world and gently placed me home again it brought its characters full circle and geared them up for more there are no tidy little endings in life and i appreciate this reflection in books can't wait to read more from jansma","434":" a very engaging book with a series of interconnected chapters short stories in the spirit of the imperfectionists and welcome to the goon squad but nabokov and the cloud atlas area also called to mind because as a reader we need to ferret out fact from fiction within the fiction e g was the previous chapter a short story written by the narrator of this chapter if so which part was based on real life events in the character's life nesting dolls are an apt metaphor as well fun smart","435":"this is a weird book but it's brilliant writing and i cared about the characters even though they were decidedly odd it was a nice change of pace","436":" i enjoyed this book i had my eye on it for a while and finally got around to it the main character longs to be a writer he tries to surround himself with writers and more frequently than most writers loses his work he appreciates the power of a well told story that makes him an extremely unreliable narrator he barely even uses his real name if ever this is a book full of odd characters that come in and out of the narrator's life they are well drawn and really entertaining i'm interested to see what kristopher jansma comes up with next","437":"i liked this book but about half way through i found it difficult to keep the characters straight this confusing narrative is what keeps me from giving it more stars very interesting story u0026amp i would recommend to others not sure how i feel about the ending though torn about it","438":"this story teller used a fast and fresh approach loved the theme","439":"this is such a wonderful story about storytelling i really loved this book and recommend it to anyone that enjoys smart coming of age novels","440":"a page turner but a little confusing worth reading","441":"oh yes what a funny and poignant read about a writer who spends his life wanting to be a novelist and the fascinating talented larger than life friends he surrounds himself with","442":" it's late and i just did an impressive bout of speed reading to finish this book before my library loan ended this isn't a book to speed read there are so many nuances the second half of the book turns the first half upside down and the main characters' names change details are tweaked you get the impression that someone is literally editing the book as you're reading along it's all very clever considering the story is a narration of a young writer who struggles to find his voice because he's not really sure who he is please read this review she said everything i wanted to and more","443":"the plot centers around a romance that is doomed to fail and a trip around the world it can be hard to follow at times due to the story ception story within a story within a story structure but the characters are so well developed that you won't care this book reminded me what i love about fiction that feeling of living another person's life for 253 pages and then struggling to move back to your own reality to see my full review visit http bookwormot blogspot com 2015 0","444":"great fun read cleverly written novel told through the narrator's fictional work most likely it's confusing at times but that's half the fun","445":" an audacious book and i forgot if that means i should rate it higher or lower so meta writing about writers and including their stories about writers when i was younger i'd have been really impressed by this book but now i was impressed anyway despite being off put put off by the ambition and envy and narcissism of the writers and their insanity out of touch with fictional reality and the exotic details which were chosen for their exoticness and yet because it's all so meta are remarked upon at the same time i was impressed that the author had the nerve to write this for i certainly wouldn't have had the nerve to even consider it but then i was impressed by the necessary bravery painstakingly researched or at least appearing to be or whatever passes for that in the age of wikipedia i either learned or mislearned or felt like i was learning so much about the fictional world yes i'll read his next book even though i'll feel i was suckered in to doing so","446":"this was more of a 3 5 star book excellent and totally unreliable narrator writing was good and i think jansma has an excellent career ahead of him","447":"maybe 2 1 2 stars story was confusing characters changed names and characteristics there were stories within stories within stories i get that he was an author and wanted to tell it slant but there wasn't enough solid story to

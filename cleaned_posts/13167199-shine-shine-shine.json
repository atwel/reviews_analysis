i wasn't expecting to like this book because the premise sounded so gimmicky but i ended up loving the characters and relating to so much of what they were going through we humans are capable of choosing what we show other people about ourselves and sometimes that allows us to stray too far from what's really true for us sunny's journey is filled with internal experiences of motherhood that ring true and marriage interactions that also felt totally plausible to me netzer's autistic characters are presented with love and appreciation and i felt so privileged to share in maxon's thoughts","2":"quirky beautifully written a celebration of what is odd and awkward in all of us and how we can choose to love those parts of ourselves also a book about how we survive life love parenthood so so good","3":"was good but to nerdy for me","4":"i knew this story would be what some would call quirky the main character sunny was born bald her husband is a genius robot engineer who's going to colonize the moon their son is autistic but i did not know how much i'd empathize with their story how all of us are kind of different or even freaky how maybe this is actually the norm it's also a wonderful love story between sunny and her husband how they love each other unconditionally across great barriers hell even across space anyway i burst into tears at the end because it was just so good","5":"an amazing voice funny insightful fresh almost four stars but the book didn't fully come together for me","6":"this book was filled with great details and interesting characters but seemed to wander off course too much for me","7":"this is a charming book when listened to audiobook because the characters each have a voice that is clear and endearing i'm not sure it would be as endearing if i had been reading it but perhaps it would be the ending seemed a tad ambiguous when everything else wasn't but other than that it's a sweet read about how reality is shaped the autistic characters are well described","8":"i more or less liked this book the first few chapters pulled me in but i struggled to stay excited about the novel as the pages dragged on the big issue for me was the fact that for the first 2 3 of the novel there was basically now conflict driving the plot and as such very little reason to care about the characters","9":"other reviews of this book mention the phrases genre bending and eye openeing the back of the book includes a quote by another author stating that this story has one of the most original main characters i've read in a long time wow what a book this must be shine shine shine follows the story of sunny a suburban housewife married to a brilliant autistic nasa engineer maxon the course of the book takes place over a few weeks during maxon's mission to the moon i suppose this is where the genre bending takes place is it science fiction romance a sly political and ethical commentary the truth is i didn't find this book any of those things i'm pretty sure i was meant to glimpse inside the real world of surburbia if i had to write a paper on this book in high school i would identify the themes of self realization and the fact that we all have secrets to hide none of us are perfect really though reading this book felt a bit like something i would have to read for high school the above mentioned themes are tired i think and pop up in the book so often they quickly lose any subtlety i have no wish to learn a life lesson i've already learned repeatedly every few pages i have nothing in common with a ridiculously rich housewife so maybe that's a problem i found the author's writing to be terse and a little too stylized it felt to me like the book was trying too hard to prove its own literary merit there are plenty of people who clearly picked up this book and liked it but i couldn't find something to connect with","10":"this was definitely a different kind of book for me the story itself was very original and a bit strange but i just didn't fall in love with it i'd really like to give it 2 5 starts because i am somewhere between 'it's ok' and 'i like it' that said joshilyn jackson did a terrific job of narrating the story","11":"this started odd but i liked it ok as i got into it there is a powerful essay by netzer at the very end read it maybe essays are her wheelhouse","12":" shine shine shine is a delightfully quirky story about a bald pregnant woman her dying mother her astronaut husband and their autistic son the story is original and thoroughly engaging and i found it to be a breath of air the book challenges the reader to take a look at how we look at ourselves and others and what we give up in a perceived need for perfection and fitting in it also provides a fresh perspective on our attitude regarding autism and some valuable insights on parenting in general there is so much more i could say about the book but suffice it to say it is a well written book with a unique story about quirky characters and i highly recommend it i hope that netzer's next novel won't be far behind","13":"the characters are offbeat and unrealistic the language a bit stilted at times i really enjoyed some of maxon's musings but sunny was mostly an enigma for me toward the end i really had no clue what was going on her head even when the story was told from her point of view maybe i didn't read closely enough because i felt like there were pieces of the story that were missing interesting but not worth the hype","14":"too bad i can't give negative stars horrible book","15":"so at times i was annoyed by the characters and the author's voice for sure i also kind of hate the author's bio which isn't fair of me at all but ultimately i really liked this book the writing is lovely with lots of musing on past events and choices and how they shape us and i liked the science y bits a lot and the reader was wonderful esp her version of sw pennsylvania accent","16":"this one was a creeper for me at first i found sunny really annoying and just not relatable at all but as i got deeper into this book and especially in the scenes between sunny and her husband maxon or maxon alone i found the characters quite charming i'm glad i stuck it out","17":"this book isn't like most other that you'll read it's quirky and yet poignant emotional and austere normal and totally abnormal all at the same time underneath it all there's a love story told in a very unusual way with some very out of the ordinary characters but they are so out there that it's hard not to fall in love with them yourself when the book started i thought it might be a little too quirky for me the husband is a nerdy nasa scientist who is headed to the moon the wife is a hairless anomaly whose mother is on life support and their autistic son however it's the story of their lives and how it makes perfect sense for them to be together and deal with the events they are facing interesting and inventive first novel that i enjoyed reading","18":"ray bradbury for the 21st century","19":"this was an unusual story but the characters kept me fascinated in their strangeness i really found myself rooting for their relationship a worthwhile read that takes you into the minds of two unconventional people","20":"loved loved loved shine shine shine","21":"this book took me foooorrrrreeevvveeer to read i don't exactly know why i found the characters really interesting and unique haven't come across them often in literature the story line and what the characters experience was also unique and interesting perhaps it was partially that the characters and their lives were in some sense so different from anything or any experience in my life that it didn't completely resonate although i did found them thoroughly entertaining and likable or it may have been that i was just really busy the last month there were also sections of the story line here and there that digressed or maybe more appropriately progressed into matters of science and mathematics and that's where my eyes begin to glaze over or it may have been that i was just really busy the last month anyway as i said i found the story interesting the characters likable netzer spins a story of the mann family a perfect say and do all the right things southern nasa family but almost immediately as is the case with most perfect families we find out that is not the case at all but the issues revealed are very different from what i had expected they might be and the trajectory the story takes equally surprising i found it very original and refreshing netzer also weaves a robot theme throughout her narrative that i found very creative there are some things though that are not so unique such as the emotions aned insecurities that the characters experience which are really very common among the whole human experience netzer taps into the insecurities and fears in a way that reader will be able to relate and resonate with connecting the reader with these odd characters even the handsome news anchor down the street but netzer doesn't leave them in their insecurities each of the four main characters sunny maxom their son bubber and the mother i love that all have an important transformative moment each event very different for each character but for all four they experience a completely liberating event as difficult as it was for me to finish it was a thoroughly enjoyable albeit odd read","22":"this was quite a magical reading experience for me lydia netzer is just a damn fine writer","23":"delightfully quirky love the portrayals of autism and aspergers","24":"one of the weirdest books i have ever read but also very good it was a breath of fresh air compared to not only how many books are written but also the story line this had deep wonderful and interesting characters with flaws and crazy ideas and were completely human i take the book as representing a lot about life meaning and what we are all supposed to do to survive","25":"this is an original book both in content and writing style i did not want it to end the characters are interesting and well developed the husband and son are both brilliant autistic types the wife is struggling with many things but is growing through the process i thought the emotional insight in the book was very interesting definitely worth reading","26":"i really had to fight to stay involved in this book it was over done in parts and confusing in others too bad as it really had a good story behind it all i really disliked the ending i felt like everything was left hanging","27":"i like offbeat fiction but i did not connect with this book i had interest in the first half but it just ebbed away the last half it just didn't shine for me","28":"interesting characters and story that had me hooked but the ending is a little lackluster","29":"i loved this book i was so ready to immerse myself in something i was totally unprepared for and i got it in shine shine shine","30":"as a special education teacher i think i am drawn to the different people who are different my favorite students are my autistic students i think because so many of them lack that filter that is instilled in us at an early age they say and do what they feel when they feel it so i was especially drawn to the characters in shine shine shine when maxon met sunny he was seven years four months and eighteen days old or he was 2693 rotations of the earth old maxon was different sunny was different they were different together that line pretty much sums up the book two wonderfully different people meet and fall in love maxon is a genius at robots not so much so at social interactions sunny different in her own way helps maxon with social niceties and raising their autistic son bubber at his father's funeral she showed him how to shake hands with the minister what part of his mouth to show when smiling even the first time he told sunny he loved her sunny herself had all but written the words in the air in front of him and led him to the spot and pointed to each syllable and yet that day he made up his own words i really enjoyed this book my only complaint is with the ending i'm not sure if i wanted the book to go on longer or wrap things up in a different way but i just felt let down at the end still though everything else in the book more than makes up for the slight let down at the end","31":"boring as my son says it was like watching a tan wall i did not like the story line of the two main characters at all","32":"very quirky and imaginative gives you lots to think about very well written","33":"if i could i'd give the first half a 2 and second half a 3 5 rating not a fan of the writing style but it was an interesting premise can't say i would recommend it though having said that there were gems 'as an orphan you are alone there is no one on the earth watching when you say look at me there is no one standing in the gap between you and oblivion putting up her hands and saying stop '","34":"hated the writing hated the characters hated the story","35":"shine shine shine hmmm just like with memoirs of an imaginary friend this book sounded great awesome job synopsis writers this book as you can see was a 2 star for me god i hate sucky books i really really really do i so wanted to get into these characters and into the story you know connect with them and whatnot but i couldn't do it to save my goddamn life i couldn't do it the main girl annoyed the life out of me the main guy seemed like the kind of guy i would run away from if he approached me in the supermarket i have had enough of this review don't read this book","36":"quirky original engaging until it runs out of steam she's bald she's bald okay we got that it wore thin do i dare to wear a wig ultimately i became exasperated by our terminally unique protagonist","37":"an unusual and engrossing book the writing style is strange and sometimes distracting the characters are all quirky but ultimately i found this a very poignant story","38":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here well i must be showing my age i just don't see this as a 4 5 star book since i finished it i gave it 2 stars but it was close it is full of the most quirky not to say damaged characters i have ever read no one in the book mother s fathers daughters sons babies neighbors you name it are just average people it is one thing to read a book with a few characters that stand out as unique and captivating but for every single person to be their own soap opera come on the baldness well i must be showing my age i just don't see this as a 4 5 star book since i finished it i gave it 2 stars but it was close it is full of the most quirky not to say damaged characters i have ever read no one in the book mother s fathers daughters sons babies neighbors you name it are just average people it is one thing to read a book with a few characters that stand out as unique and captivating but for every single person to be their own soap opera come on the baldness ok i thought that was an interesting hook something everyone could relate to but didn't have to endure beware spoilers ahead but sunny isn't just bald she is strange her mother is dying in a hospital and after she pulls the plug can't bring herself to get out of the car and go see her her son is autistic and of course he isn't responding to standard treatment that would be too simple her husband is a brilliant millionaire astronaut sure who has something like aspergers he only relates to sunny unless sunny gives him social clues so he can survive in their upscale neighborhood several murders happen in the past every chapter is full of one bizarre stunt after another and to just top it all off when she goes into labor instead of calling a taxi i assume she owned a cell phone she waddles to a neighbor's house he is nuts of course and then waddles back to deliver the baby on the floor of her own house have you had enough yet because there is a lot more more","39":"loved this book from start to finished","40":"sure hopped around a lot but featured a cast of characters who were all individuals and who did not remind me of anyone else i had read about in a book very interesting","41":"this book is written totally different than most which is one of the things that i really liked about that being said at different times i was really confused","42":" what do you write in a review of a book that you don't care for but that is written by a friend i don't know and i don't need to know shine shine shine is one of the best books i've read in a long long time and i couldn't be happier for my friend and author lydia netzer this book is going to go places i'm not good at writing quick summaries so i'll leave prospective readers to check out the book blurbs here and elsewhere for the basics at its heart the book is about love connection family and owning our own flawed but true selves netzer tells the story primarily through the voices of sunny mann and her husband maxon with sunny's mother emma adding important layers to the narrative all three characters are uniquely imagined strange on the surface but immediately recognizable as real although you may not know anyone who was born bald as sunny was or who won a nobel prize as maxon has you do know people like them you are probably like them yourself this is just one of the amazing things netzer accomplishes in this book in addition to the characters themselves i love the way netzer tells her story her narration flows effortlessly between points of view between past and present and between interior monologue and action one result for me at least was that i lived each moment with each character rather than viewing events and characters from the outside finally netzer's prose style is wonderful her writing is very accessible her imagery vivid and creative and her comedic timing spot on one thing i love about electronic books is that i can highlight phrases sentences and paragraphs that are particularly beautiful meaningful or otherwise just cool i've highlighted more parts of this book than any other i've read i can't recommend this book highly enough in fact i can't wait to re read it myself","43":"$18 000 dollar rug in the dining room a possibility even if his job is destined to take him out of their sphere literally sunny's shine shine shine is the kind of love story that can get under the skin of even an ultra cynic like myself sunny is the ultimate suburban housewife well coifed drives a mini van consoles her friends leads neighborhood craft shows and always makes sure that her autistic son is wearing his helmet and gets his medicine on time her genius husband maxon makes the $18 000 dollar rug in the dining room a possibility even if his job is destined to take him out of their sphere literally sunny's perfect life begins to unravel when maxon's spaceship to the moon malfunctions and her minivan is t boned by a fellow suburbanite in the melee sunny's wig flies off sunny has never had hair in her life even her eyebrows are pasted on she's spent the last decade pretending to be a perfect person she isn't and it's driven a wedge between herself and her husband as she's begun to resent exactly what makes him a genius in the first place his own autism sunny leaves the wig behind skips her son's meds that evening and hopes for one last chance to tell the man she loves that she's sorry shine shine shine is narrated by sunny and maxon their two voices blending to encompass their childhood together their unique differences that brought them to each other and the present that has altered their relationship it's a stunning debut that questions who we really are under our veneer and whether that person might be the better option of the two","44":" i wanted to like this the premise of a woman living her normal life taking care of her young autistic son while her husband rockets to the moon was original and i liked that it was set in norfolk va the first chapter was good but after that it morphed into something weird there was a lot of flashback and i struggled to find the plot beyond the plot of sunny losing her wig in a car accident and endless pages about her bald head and her husband maxon obsessing about robots this writer is talented as evidenced by essays on her blog i waited a long time to buy this even though she's a local author the book has yet to show up at our library and i wish i hadn't","45":"stopped reading it after a while","46":"4 5 review to come at editorialeyes book reviews","47":" i'd heard great things about this book but hadn't gotten around to reading it for some reason maybe i was just being ornery or maybe i was having one of those phases where i smile and nod when people say something is amazing and think it's all just standard internet hyperbole best thing ever etc whatever it was i bought this book shortly before moving house a reward in anticipation of successfully sourcing and wearing my big girl pants and behaving like an adult when the situation called for it bribing myself in advance so i wouldn't just clamber into a packing box close the lid over myself and wait passively for the move to magically happen without me the above preamble is required so that it's clear that this book of all books was the best possible choice to read at the end of an upheaval i'm pretty sure maxon could whip up an equation to cover it maybe with some help from sunny to explain the strange alchemy of escape into immersion recognition and relief tears and catharsis the message of the book is one that we know deep in our secret selves everyone is a little bit broken inside some people are more externally obviously damaged some paper over the cracks and hold themselves together with super glue and spackle however not every broken thing needs to be fixed not every problem needs to be solved instead just maybe the supposedly broken part in all of us is what makes the impossible possible and helps us to find a way to love and forgive to make peace with our regrets and live on with hope and wonder and keep striving for the moon whatever your own personal moon might be and if you're lucky enough to have the right people in your life that moon may not be as far out of reach as it seems any book that affirms all of that is a marvel and one that does it with such elegance and heart and humor is a wonder tl dr this book is a wondrous marvellous thing and i loved it","48":"i don't generally like adult novels but i actually liked this one i don't really know what made me enjoy it but the characters were realistic and authentic i liked the nerdiness between the couple and the real life thoughts she had i recommend it but i can't really explain why","49":"fell just shy of my best books ever shelf really i just wanted more i highly recommend","50":" it is early in the year but this may end up being my favorite book of 2013 i know i said call home the wolves was the weirdest book i have ever read but this book may supplant it but whereas with chtw i continued to read because it was so weird with sss i couldn't stop listening audiobook because i loved the story so much fantastic voice part sci fi mystical realism and character driven plot with robots astronauts and a bald stepford wife one of the first quotes that grabbed me was when the perfect mothers are talking one asks the main character how her mother is doing she replies great the friend says i thought she was on life support the main character replies yes it is working perfectly had i read a book description i probably would have never read this book but because i am a nyt booklist groupie and this book showed up on the top 100 list i chose it so glad i did","51":"http www goodbookfairy com 2012 09","52":"i could only find this on audio at my regional library i'm not sure if it was due to the narrator's voice but i found it wordy and painful to listen to at points i kept trying to imagine if i was reading the words rather than hearing them if i would have liked it better i don't usually listen to audio books and that may have been the problem i might try to find a paper version and give it another chance it came highly recommended","53":"this is an extremely unusual debut novel while not my usual genre i am glad i was given the opportunity to read and review it maxon and sunny are a young couple raising a family in the suburbs however they are not your typical couple he is a genius on a space mission his goal is to colonize the moon with robots back at home on earth pregnant sunny is raising their autistic son she is also caring for her terminally ill mother she wants maxon home where he is needed stress is pushing their marriage to the edge suddenly the powers of the universe shift maxon is stranded in space everything is different nothing will ever be the same being raised in the developing space travel era i watched neil armstrong's legendary first steps on the moon even at age ten i worried about the astronauts being stranded in space i couldn't help but think of david bowie's song \"space oddity\" and the fictitious major tom in the song wildly imaginative and creative this story is still intelligent lydia netzer has written an emotionally charged very unique first novel","54":"this book was a little weird a bald seems to be the biggest point of the book woman married to an autistic savant astronaut lost in space with an autistic son 9 months pregnant with a dying mother and unanswered questions about her father's death of course she comes unglued i didn't care for it but i know others who really liked this book","55":"i didn't hate it but i wouldn't recommend it either the story was just too bizarre however i did find the portrayal of the characters and their various differences fascinating","56":"3 5 really liked it but not quite a 4","57":"i tried to like this but it was just too all over the place for me the last 20% or so felt incredibly rushed and the entire thing felt like a waste of my time","58":" this is such an unusual love story nerd love if you will i thought that the writing was beautiful and the people felt like people i know although granted at least one of my close friends is a nasa scientist anywho sunny and maxon are having problems with their relationship and their communication he communicates in math and she communicates in english he seems to be somewhere on the autistic spectrum and their son bubbers is a diagnosed autistic view spoiler sunny is very pregnant with their second child when maxon is scheduled to leave for the moon the book opens after the launch has already taken place sunny has to struggle through being her own person and realizing how much she really loves and relies on maxon both sunny and maxon have regrets about how they have left their relationship with the uncertainties of space travel i admit that the story never does wrap up in a satisfying way more than most books i was left with enduring questions about max and sunny does he ever get back do they live happily ever after what happens to her and the baby and bubbers hide spoiler still i think that this book was a worthy first for a new novelist i quite enjoyed it and wanted just a bit more","59":"perhaps it is true each of us has an aspect of ourselves that we are irrationally ashamed of when enough bravery is found to live that truth and truly own it one may truly shine shine shine","60":"this book raised interesting points about people from children to adults who do not fit the mold i liked that part of the story more than i actually liked how it was written i felt the writing was a bit too dumbed down but the points made about individuals with aspergers and on the autism spectrum were thought provoking","61":"this book was a strangely gripping read i say strange because if i had described the plot to myself it wouldn't have interested me particularly but the easy going way this was written and the thought provoking issues of motherhood and identity love and society had me hooked it's kept me thinking a long time after i'd finished reading the sign of a good book","62":" well this sure was an interesting book i think it is so cool when authors present characters or storylines that i never read or even imagined before this is the story of sunny a bald woman who is married to maxon an aspergersy nobel prize winner who is an astronaut headed out to colonize the moon with robots and their son bubber an autistic four year old already an interesting cast of characters at first it is difficult to imagine identifying with any of these odd characters but the author manages to make them seem normal quite an accomplishment the story goes back and forth and sideways from present time to both sunny's and maxon's childhoods to their parents' lives but it was easy to follow thank goodness everything changes for this little family when sunny is in a car accident and the beautifully coiffed wig she has chosen to wear falls off she believed that the wig falling off was a kind of sign that she shouldn't be wearing it to be someone else it was actually hiding the real sunny after that experience she kind of rejoiced in her baldness and as a consequence she found that other people that she had assumed had normal lives actually had their own sets of problems they were covering up maxon's disability was asperger's he had difficulty understanding and expressing emotions and had to follow scripts to know what to say in particular circumstances this made him almost robotic in nature similar to the robots he envisioned and created as he said there are three things that robots cannot do show preference without reason love and then doubt rational decisions regret and finally trust data from a previously unreliable source forgive i thought the author did a great job showing that there really is no normal to which we need to aspire everyone has little secrets they try to hide or control many decisions are not easy to make pulling life support medicating an autistic or adhd child being married having children going to the moon and there is no one way to fix things and not everything should be fixed the book was definitely interesting and different not exactly fun but thought provoking maybe the reason i didn't give it five stars was that it had a bit too much symbolism for me and i just didn't want to think that hard","63":"i started out annoyed by the characters but was also so intrigued that i zipped right through the book i still can't figure out how much is frustrating rather than compelling but maybe that's a good thing","64":"i couldn't get into this i read half way and still felt zero attachment to any character i really wanted to like this one based on the reviews and the storyline but just couldn't","65":"5 stars for uniqueness and amazing characters","66":"i'd give this 3 5 stars it is definitely an odd book and started out slow but it grew on on me and i came to really like and root for the quirky characters","67":"i don't remember how i found this book i work at a library and am in charge of the new book shelf so i probably just picked it up at random what i discovered was a beautifully written love life story about two flawed people and the life they made together this book is a sweet touching coming of age story so unique i couldn't wait to see what happened next","68":"what a wonderful read netzer is a writer to watch for i could not put the book down i loved the character development and the story","69":"as other reviewers are saying this book is really different and contains many oddities including several characters on the autism spectrum i definitely liked reading it but cannot explain or rate this novel since it is so unusual","70":"this book is filled with unique one dimensional characters many of them commit crimes without consequences it reminds me of stories dictated by my children's classmates before they could write well enough to record their stories by themselves could be a parable but i didn't get much of a message it was easy reading","71":"a quirky novel about i'm not quite sure sunny is bald super pregnant and married to maxon who is methodical and almost robotical maxon is going to the moon to start a lunar colony sunny is here on earth preparing to deliver child number two bubber is there son autistic and medicated to hide all of his foibles until sunny decides to love him the ay he is","72":"a layered and poetic character study more than a plot driven story and beautifully done this story of sunny and maxon's intertwined lives builds piece by piece to an almost fairy tale ending maxon's strictly rational black and white perception of reality so characteristic of asperger's is folded in with sunny's emotional intensity and imagination to create an almost mathematical portait of one relationship and two individuals finding their own means of control within it","73":"the only reason i read shine shine shine was because it was chosen by some misguided soul in my book club my mother always said if i couldn't say something nice don't say anything i'll be quiet now","74":"i am always looking for the something different browsing the shelves of my local library i keep finding copy cat books the couple with the child murdered or kidnapped the fantasy trying to emulate hunger games or worse twilight and vampires the terror threat novels with their stereotypes bless lydia netzer for writing her poignant book with new worlds to explore to feel to be a part of and ti find similar places or events in my own life","75":"i listened to this via audible and bought it entirely because of the narrator joshilyn jackson joshilyn is also an author and her books are all five stars in my opinion and her narration is fantastic i don't know if i would have enjoyed this book as much if i'd read it but i know that the format i chose certainly hooked me immediately and made me sad when it ended such a quirky sounding story but it deals with things we all deal with marriage mortality sense of self etc i look forward to more from this author and highly encourage everyone to give this book a try","76":"i got a copy of this audiobook to review from macmillan audio in exchange for an honest review this was an excellent read that is more contemporary fiction than science fiction it's a book about life in general and how people try to force themselves into a \"normal\" mold sunny's life is perfect she has the perfect house a successful husband and good friends everything is just right except that her husband just left on a trip to the moon her 4 year old son is autistic her mother is dying she is very pregnant and she has no hair her husband maxon loves robots and he loves his family and is brilliant but he's up in space as sunny's world begins to fall apart she starts to realize that there is no normal everyone is just as flawed as everyone else the audiobook was very well done the voices for different characters were easy to differentiate and the narrator was pleasant to listen to the book does jump around in time some this was denoted by pauses in the audiobook or by the start of a new chapter the time changes were a bit hard to follow but after listening a few seconds i was usually able to figure out who was talking and what time frame we were in the book explores sunny and maxon and their past and present we learn how they got to be where they are and how sunny tried to force normality on them when she got pregnant sunny and maxon are both incredibly unique people with an interesting relationship but sunny has an idea of what a mother and family should be and tries to force them into that mold the deeper sunny digs into the lives of those around her the more she finds that normal isn't really all that normal this is a really great book that encompasses a number of issues really well this book deals with space travel robots autism motherhood womanhood what it means to be normal and just so many things it is written in a piece meal way you hear from the wife mother sunny and you hear from her husband maxon you listen to what is currently happening in their lives and what has happened in the past despite the way the plot jumps around it all comes together to make an interesting and cohesive story the characters are all very real people and the story in very engaging you keep wondering if maxon will make it to the moon if sunny will have her baby before he gets back and if their son will do okay off of his meds this is definitely more contemporary fiction and just a story about life in general this is really not a sci fi fantasy read yeah there is a bit about space travel and robots but that takes a backseat to reading about sunny and how she deals with her life still i enjoyed it overall and enjoyed how it makes you think the one thing i did not enjoy at all was the ending absolutely nothing is resolved although this is in keeping with the story it's about life and life doesn't have any clean cut answers and endings i hate endings that are that unresolved and open so just a warning to those who dislike open ended stories without any resolution overall this was a wonderfully written book that was creative and engaging the characters are completely believable and the plot was engaging this is more of a contemporary fiction than science fiction so keep that in mind there is some space travel but that takes a back seat to watching sunny deal with her every day life this book is about realizing that everyone is different and that there is no normal instead there are many different ways to lead a fulfilling life it is a book that will definitely make you think about the way you live your life recommended to those interested in contemporary literature quirky characters and autism","77":"this is a strangely compelling story sunny mann is a 39 year old married to a 41 year old nobel prize winning scientist astronaut specializing in robotics maxon mann together they have a four year old son bubber these three have problems galore sunny's missionary father was murdered in burma where she was born and sunny is completely bald from birth maxon has a nobel prize but he is socially inept and robotic in his behavior bubber is autistic and his behavior has been so disruptive in school that they want him put on haldol the heavy duty antipsychotic drug the book opens with maxon on a flight to the moon sunny's mother dying bubber acting up and a car accident in which sunny loses her wig and is revealed to her neighbors this is a bad hair day but wait there's more while things are going awry for sunny on earth they are not supercalifragilistic for maxon in space things happen as they will on a spacecraft and the drama becomes interplanetary maxon is an ultrarationalist who is predictable because he follows the rules of his programming he believes that humans and robots are simply electrical processes that differ in only three respects the ability to experience love to feel regret and to forgive sunny is a spontaneous humanist almost overcome with love regret and forgiveness bubber is the fragile and evolutionary human robot blend lydia netzer has created an incredible recipe for a unique novel about the human condition and she takes full advantage of all the ingredients","78":"just not my cup of tea interesting themes creatively developed but in the end more odd to me than anything else","79":"i was so hoping more from this book i felt it could have been 100 pages left because the story was not engaging and i felt it kept grappling with the same issues continuously i would not recommend the book","80":"it took quite a while for me to settle into the somewhat odd mechanical sentence structure used throughout the book but i get that the author likely did that on purpose i haven't read anything else by this author but it doesn't necessarily seem like she's an unskilled writer as much as it seems that she made a conscious decision to write that way found the characters likable fresh and inspiring","81":"languishing half read in my kindle it's probably me no phantasmagoria threshold am officially declaring it kindle chum sorry it is me","82":"this was one of the most original books i have ever read","83":"good read quirky love story my biggest complaint is the ending i wish it more conclusive it felt almost unfinished","84":"i won this book as a goodreads first read i absolutely loved it the story was great i fell in love with sunny and maxon i look forward to hearing more from this author in the future","85":"interesting characters","86":"shine shine shine is not a book that can be easily tucked into a neat category in fact when my husband asked what's it about i told him that my description would fall short and also sound slightly crazy but that is exactly what makes this book remarkable and unforgettable it is a story of marriage of motherhood of self image and selfishness but also a tale of humor family and loss i'm not even going to bother to write the plot synopsis other to say again that it fails mere works to write into a neat little box so why should you read this book then you ask well because you won't have read anything like it before and once you are past the first page you won't want to stop until you have gotten to the very end and as one who is a stickler for a good ending you will not be disappointed if you are looking for an absorbing story beautifully told and something that speaks to your mind and heart then look no further than this book i simply cannot say enough good things about it","87":"a bit unusual and a lot beautiful torn between a 4 and a 5 on this captivating tale","88":" before picking up lydia netzer's debut novel i'd read several reviews the content of the reviews never stuck with me i had no idea what the book was about but i was left with an overall feeling there was something intangible and perhaps magical here after thousands of years of literature its hard to write something truly unique but netzer comes close with shine shine shine the sci fi elements are beside the point the novel's defining character is its voice the third person narrator at first sounds a bit like rod serling introducing an episode of the twilight zone but its not quite that simple to the last page shine shine shine feels like it's scratching at the surface of something big perhaps something as significant as the meaning of life although the book never breaks through the outer crust of this idea the light radiating from its core is enough to bring the reader satisfaction","89":" this is a fantastic book with wonderfully drawn characters sunny suffering from alipescia married to maxon a brilliant nobel prize winning scientist with asbergers and their son bubber a four year old with autism all trying to find a place in the world the themes of motherhood and accepting who you are and how people hide their true selves in order to be accepted by society are interwoven throughout the novel by a deft hand and some beautiful writing sunny realizes one day after her wig flies off in a car accident that all this time she's been hiding from who she really is and decides to show the world her true self and that of her family the story of this family unfolds thru flashbacks and present day narrative and you begin to see them for who they are not what they appear to be this is a spectacular debut novel that had my book club talking for hours uncovering more and more symbolism meaning and nuance with every page turn read this book","90":"i enjoyed the book i may need to read it again or discuss it with my reading group i think it can be read on more than one level","91":"thoroughly enjoyed this book","92":"i loved this book because it was a little quirky and different with characters i could relate to i liked the writing style so it was easy to read it wrapped up well for most characters except maxon that one seemed to be left hanging a bit but not enough to ruin the story overall i love this book and look forward to more from this author","93":"loved this book there were many layers which dealt with love relationships communication family and work netzer even incorporates spiritual energy within the universe and mixes humor to provide a can't put down offering i gave it to my girlfriend and she sent it west to her parents pass the word","94":"this is a first novel by the author it is written in a unique style that some will find off putting but others enjoy i think it helps if you have a mathematical or scientific bent it follows a highly functioning autistic boy named maxon and a girl born without any hair named sunny from childhood to adulthood it offers a different way of viewing ones life relationships and role in society i look forward to more from this author","95":"4 5 stars and this only because maybe i am jealous of the savant ness that runs amok in this book in the beginning i didn't understand why sunny became so darn uptight and it kept me from just reading and enjoying it took about 100 pages to get over that and start believing in the character which allowed me to become engrossed in the love story which was not dopey or too sappy but felt just right growing up with your love i'm a sucker","96":"this book was wonderfully written and a pure page turner i hope lydia decides to write more of these types of books","97":"somewhere between 2 5 and 3 starts it was kind of hard to get into but i rounded up because i did enjoy the ending","98":"sunny and maxon's lives have been intertwined since they met when maxon was seven and sunny was six both were different and their relationship always allowed them to be different together but 20 years later the two are married and living in norfolk virginia--maxon is a nobel prize winning scientist working on programming robots to colonize the moon while sunny has the perfect housewife role down pat they've always been able to deal with any troubles that have come their way although their relationship has been strained of late by the stresses of raising an autistic son bubber the terminal illness of sunny's mother maxon's preparing to travel to the moon to start his robots on their work and the rapidly arriving delivery of their second child but on the same day that maxon leaves for the moon things start to go awry and the perfectly placed world sunny has always had control over starts shifting a random car accident reveals sunny's baldness which she has hidden from her friends since moving to virginia and causes her to re examine many of the decisions she has made with her life including keeping bubber medicated to try and help control his autism without even knowing what is happening with the other both sunny and maxon are reflecting on their tumultuous passionate and interconnected lives together in an effort to decide what to do next in the end it's amazing how much can change in just one split second this is a beautifully written book about a dynamic slightly dysfunctional relationship that grows into a life and a life that is more chaotic and moves in directions different than one would like i thought lydia netzer did a terrific job in telling sunny and maxon's story and she created some absolutely fantastic dynamic characters that i'm still thinking about the narrative structure tends to shift back and forth in time and perspective which can be a little confusing but i found myself tremendously invested in this book very quickly don't be misled by the description of this book found on most sites because it makes the book seem much more abstract and weird than it is definitely a story worth getting into","99":"holy collection of quirky characters batman it almost seems as though there is too much weirdness contained in this book that being said i think society as a whole is a lot more weird than it appears on the surface that is kind of an underlying message of this book what is more important appearances and what society thinks of us or one's true naked self the story revolves around sunny and maxon and their history together they have a fully autistic son and sunny is pregnant with their second child maxon who is definitely on the autism spectrum himself is a nobel prize winning designer of robots who is has been sent to space by nasa to set up a robot colony on the moon the rocket gets hit by a meteorite though which makes for some serious drama sunny is home dealing with her pregancy her dying mother and the fact that she has been unmasked in an unexpected way sunny and maxon rely heavily on each other in many different ways but now with maxon lost in space what does that mean for the two of them for their son bubber and for their unborn child the story jumps around a lot through flashbacks and doesn't fully answer some of the questions forming in my brain it's still an interesting and fresh story though and i enjoyed it i probably would've enjoyed it more if i hadn't managed to soak the bottom third of the book in diet coke but it was good","100":"what a wonderful wonderful book that ms netzer has written i loved it beyond reason such a beautiful and captivating tale of marriage motherhood robots and about trying to be someone you aren't because you think that's how you need to be then realizing what nonsense that is and going back to your true self i found myself laughing and crying while reading shine shine shine i didn't want it to end i loved the characters i enjoyed the flowing of time in the book ms netzer goes back and forth through time to fill you in on different things that happened to sunny and maxon at various points in their lives i really can't describe how much i didn't want the book to end i wanted it to keep going to hear about the little girl and the things that bubber did later in life i love it when the characters in books begin to feel like old friends letting you in on secrets they are telling lydia netzer sucked me into this book and i didn't want to leave it i dearly hope that shine shine shine knocks that drivel fifty shades of grey right out of the top spot of the nyt best sellers list ms netzer's book is incredibly well written and the story is one that i will read again and again","101":"in a word beautiful","102":"i loved the quirky flawed characters","103":"loved this book weird in all the best ways","104":"a beautiful story of love loss space the mind childhood marriage birth and the american dream a pre utopia that ends on a beautiful note thrusting us all at once far into the future is it all in the mind or is it what really happens lydia netzer is too good a writer to let us know instead the whole thing hovers like a constellation gorgeous all of it","105":"seemed odd at first but ultimately that oddness became its charm quirky unusual characters reminded me of anne tyler john irving","106":"i'm didn't love the ending i feel like there should be more details to the final outcomes of maxon and sunny complete cliff hanger","107":"i was kind of on the fence about this book it took me a long time to get into it the characters were so unique at first i had a hard time relating and understanding their points of view but one of the last scenes in les weathers house was truly wonderful and pulled it all together for me a great picture of humanity we are all weird and we all have secrets some just hide it better than others","108":"what do i say about this book that others have not i can't still the insights into the lives of others no matter who and no matter how damaged their lives might have been is clearly the forte of lydia netzer i've become a fan and now i want to read more of her work i found her blog and i've no doubt she well earned the listing from the new york times as a notable book for 2012 keep on writing lydia","109":"this was a really interesting book i enjoyed the characters easily can see this as a movie","110":"unique really interesting characters","111":"well this novel had promise i liked sunny i really liked sunny after she stopped wearing her stepford wife wig but overall the story just flopped i came away with a and what was the plot line feeling i really wanted to like it i liked sunny she had such promise","112":" as i was reading this book i had a conversation with my nephew joseph about it so it's science fiction you think it might be since it's 1 2 about populating the moon with robots who will someday host our vacations there it's hard to assign this book a genre romance tragedy unless there's one we are all messed up and we all mess each other up but life's pretty miraculous anyway there were some really lovely parts and it reads a lot like a version of real life funny touching true for human situation and for writing i'd give it 4 5 stars but since i think it deserves more than the 3 59 it's got now i'm going to do 5","113":"sunny is different maxon is different they are different together the childhood best friends marry but when sunny becomes pregnant she decides it's time to be normal though she was born hairless and has been bald all her life she puts on a wig and fake eyebrows and eyelashes and they move to norfolk va everything was going normally but now sunny is pregnant a second time and maxon is in a rocket on the way to colonize the moon with robots when a car accident knocks sunny's wig off she decides it's time the for the normal facade to end she regrets trying to change herself to fit in and especially regrets trying to change maxon but then maxon's rocket is hit by a meteor throwing the mission into danger meanwhile sunny is alone at home with her mother emma on life support and her autistic son bubber off his medication unique doesn't begin to describe this book which tells the story of sunny and maxon's lives and their life together sad and lovely and real","114":"the one thing that kept this from being a 5 star book for me at least was the lack of resolution in the end this book is a gorgeous quirky heart wrenching love story a book about what it means to be true to one's self however the ambiguous ending left me wanting more","115":"i read the first third of the book and then thought to myself this is pretty terrible what is the point of any of this so i skipped to the end and read the last few chapters and i still thought it was pretty terrible the book just did not pull me in to the story and really with characters like a bald pregnant wife a socially awkward engineer husband up in space and an autistic child things should have been fairly interesting","116":"boring couldn't finish","117":"kevin's suggestion for my review i gave shine shine shine a star star star i liked this book but i didn't love it the characters were complex and interesting but i never understood any of them not sure if i'd recommend","118":"i started out liking it but it just didn't carry me through to the end not sure where it lost me","119":"fun book very original","120":"sunny is the perfect example of a person trying to be as perfect as she believes that the people around her to be the problem sunny and her family are anything but she suffers from alopecia universalis a condition which has left her completely hairless since birth her son bubber is autistic her husband maxon an ai specialist with nasa appears to suffer form a mild form of asperger's syndrome her mother is dying of cancer and she's pregnant again sunny is a woman who is living her life in hiding she uses wigs to hide the fact that she is bald she medicates her son to keep his autism under control she denys the fact that she resents her husband for pushing her into motherhood and that she thinks that her son inherited his autism from him this beautiful story is all about the transformative moments in the life of every person those moments in which we are truly able to see ourselves not as we think we should be but as we are imperfections and all it is these moments which free us from our self imposed prison sentences of unfulfilled lives and unrealized dreams and allow us to find our place in the world this is a book that any person who has ever felt in any way less than should read within its pages you will find hard evidence that though there is no such thing as perfect there is happiness in self acceptance this review and others can be found on my blog at wtf are you reading adult contemporary review shine shine shine an","121":" i won this book on goodreads this was just a so so read for me there were parts i really liked and parts that just dragged on and were kind of blah i would have liked to hear more about sunny's condition and what exactly made her bald and certainly i would have liked to hear more about the mother i think if the author would have cut a few pages about maxon and his robots or even the pages about the mother dying they could have used those pages to describe the main characters back story a bit better and make you feel more connected","122":"it was tough to hang with it but came together at the end not my preferred writing style","123":"this one took a while to get going and i'd probably give it a 3 5 if i could once the main character started to show more depth than suburban mommy with perfection anxiety and as her husband gained more narrative ground in the story i found it hard not to laugh aloud at his mannerisms and literal language ultimately liked the story also the premise of automated robots sent to the moon is great listened on audible","124":"interesting and captivating i wasn't too sure at first but it sucked me in quickly such a unique writing style","125":"this is not my genre and i read it only because i knew the author to my surprise and delight i loved it it's quirky it's not your average chic lit i would recommend it to just about anyone who can laugh and cry even guys","126":"i seem to be stumbling across a lot of books that have characters with asperger syndrome and this one includes a robotics expert with as who is en route to the moon to set up a colony of robots he and his wife are quirky and interesting characters and i liked the way their stories entwined but the ending was disappointing","127":"i'm about 60 pages from the end and i think this is the best book i've read in ages it both embraces and defies every genre the writing style is quirky and hard to define almost like technical writing in the matter of fact way it portrays events no nonsense just the facts and yet i fell in love with the characters almost immediately especially bubber i cannot wait to finish it and find out what happens does maxon live shh don't tell me but at the same time i don't want it to end update i finally found time to finish it the ending seemed a bit sudden but in retrospect i think it was just about right still unlike anything i've read before just the right amount of quirkiness so it never became annoying another reviewer said it reminded her of the world according to garp by john irving and i think she's totally right i loved that book for many of the same reasons i loved this one highly recommended","128":" interesting story about a bald woman and her astronaut husband the woman loses her wig in an auto accident others see her without hair and that changes her perspective on everything while i enjoyed the book i didn't really grasp the profundity of the changes to the main character once she stopped wearing her wig since that was a huge part of the story's theme i felt like i was missing something the entire time i was reading the book still a good read but i at least didn't get the deepter meaning the book seemed to want to have","129":" if there is something that makes me crazy it is a poor understanding of one's topic i figure hello you lydia netzer were immersed in this book for however long it took you to write it and you still had one extra person you said was dead but who was really alive and do enough research to use proper titles your reader will recognize errors especially glaring ones i also hated how the author wanted to pull in six hundred million symbolic elements one would have been plenty i got it the bald head robots right super smart people check lunar landings yep ask me to suspend even more disbelief and i might think this was a sci fi book","130":" i am not sure what to make of this novel while the author has some interesting ideas and the story is quite unique i found it to be a tad odd in the unique way and there was also a lot of unnecessary rambling and unnecessary descriptions a bit too much in some cases which made me drop my rating of this novel the uniqueness of it is what kept me drawn to finishing the entire book written in 3rd person it's the story of sunny a bald woman who is married to maxon a robotical type man everything is equation and even though it's never clearly stated i got the sense that he is either high functioning autistic or has aspergers maxon is a nasa scientist and whom went into space on a mission to the moon sunny wants nothing more than to be normal they have an autistic son bubber and sunny is pregnant with their second child throughout the entire story sunny gets into a car accident which exposes her baldness on the way home from visiting her dying mother in the hospital and maxon's rocket is hit by an asteroid and they lose communication with nasa all at the same time the flying off of sunny's wig makes her wake up and realize that she's been living like a robot for years like her husband had planned out it would recommend this book to the right audience but it's not for everyone so i would selectively recommend it","131":" everyone is wierd there's something wrong with everyone so says shine shine shine a good read not a great one you could say that some parts are great because they're imaginative and unlike what you've read before and dialog between characters is funny but all the characters and scenery including home scenery seem sketchy almost comic bookish this sketchiness seems deliberate a device but it doesn't work for me not enough for me to agree with the majority of reviews that insist this book is great","132":"why did i read this book it was on sale at target the fact that it was on some top 100 list for the ny times book review or something to that effect is really what brought me in i'm usually one to be sucked in by cover art but this book cover is on the cheesy side in my humble opinion pros this is a fairly long book but i was able to read it quickly because it isn't very heavy it has some heavy topics but the writing remains light and extremely readable the love story is beautiful and strange i like how the author portrayed the main characters i like the sciency stuff one of the pivotal moments in this book is when sunny's wig comes off during a car wreck and she decides to stop faking her life she was born bald and never grew any hair but decided to wear a wig once her son was born so that she could be a respectable mom once her neighbors see her with her wig off a green light is activated and she starts questioning her suburban wealthy life that her and her autistic husband have made for themselves the author deals with autism in a very interesting way i don't want to 1 share too much as to ruin the story u0026amp 2 bore you with details but a lot of the story deals with autism and how we perceive it in society cons sunny's suburban friends seem hollow while they do stand by her side during her transformation there isn't much depth to their friendship why do they not shun her if appearances seem to be the mainstay of their relationship with her there are also a few corny cheesy parts in the book where i did a few eye rolls overall i really enjoyed this book and would recommend it the writing is good and the story is unique","133":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i powered through this book reading it in a few days i read the last third or so in a few hours which may have contributed to the intensity i felt at first i wasn't sure how much i liked it though i was def compelled by it but as i read more i started to really feel for sunny and maxon and even sunny's mom emma though the part about emma having sunny's dad killed seemed not the most well developed i like it if only b c it brought a twist about the part about colonizing the moon with r i powered through this book reading it in a few days i read the last third or so in a few hours which may have contributed to the intensity i felt at first i wasn't sure how much i liked it though i was def compelled by it but as i read more i started to really feel for sunny and maxon and even sunny's mom emma though the part about emma having sunny's dad killed seemed not the most well developed i like it if only b c it brought a twist about the part about colonizing the moon with robots was awesome and i seriously loved the part where maxon described first meeting sunny and falling in love with her i know i'm always a sucker for a happy ending but i was especially glad this time the part about les weathers and his disgusting house was a little confusing but i guess it showed that everyone is kind of messed up on the inside idk why exactly but i def cried a little at the end all in all i loved it though more","134":"this is a quirky piece that makes one wonder is the world just a series of electronic impulses or do humans have something else sunny was born hairless but raised to believe she was destined for great things maxon was born an asperger savant to an illiterate family in rural pennsylvania the two meet as children and despite warnings to the contrary marry and have an autistic son maxon is on his way to the moon to colonize it with his robots again pregnant sunny is left to tend to their child and decide what to do about her comatose mother an accident forces sunny to look beyond the day to day routines that she has established to create normalcy and in doing so begins to realize most of us hide behind something so that we can be called normal","135":"i enjoyed it it was a good read and different","136":" i loved this book the characters are fascinating and they are unlike any collection i have met in other literature sunny is a hairless woman hiding under wigs married to a nobel prized winning scientist maxon who was her best friend through most of her life and was rehabilitated from a horrible and abusive family by sunny's mother their son bubber has an undefined illness or maybe not as the plot moves along it seems he is very much like his father maxon rockets off towards the moon where the ship will dock with a container ship containing robots he has designed and built from there the robots will be transferred to the moon where they will ready it for human habitation meanwhile back on earth sunny is very pregnant dealing with bubber and a dying mother family secrets are disclosed there is a car accident there is a space accident there is finally wonderful resolution with glimpses of what the future will hold this is a great love story a fun sci fi adventure and a description of the maturing of a remarkable woman the writing is wonderful with lots of math formulas thrown in for color another great first novel","137":"the moral of this story let your freak flag fly","138":"finished shine shine shine by lydia netzer this morning this was an impulse daily deal purchase on amazon and i have to say i'm really glad that i read it i don't normally seek out books that will make me sad but i'm glad this one got through the story revolves around sunny a young woman with full body alopecia although never mentioned by name she's always just described as bald everywhere and her roles as daughter mother and wife i wasn't expecting this story to hit me so hard but i actually had to stop reading one morning and get a hug from the boo while i choked back tears because i felt so much for sunny the entire story revolves around the pressures and obligations of sunny's roles to her family there was so much depth to this story and i truly enjoyed the way netzer laid out the story to give a full understanding of maxon and sunny's relationship i can't promise you'll be thrilled with the ending but i would definitely recommend this especially if you have a book club to read it with so you can talk about all the emotions you'll feel with others","139":"love autism and space","140":" the story opens in the upscale suburbs of virginia but flashes back to rural pennsylvania and post ww ii burma the characters include a pregnant bold as in no hair housewife sunny her husband maxon who is possibly literally lost in space and their autistic and selectively brilliant son bubber in spite of this colorful set up the story is really a straightforward and beautiful meditation on the idea of love and the feeling of otherness the language is simple and honest and the story is firmly set in the reality but there is also a slight feeling of surreal that comes from looking at the earth from space or from peeking at the world from under the safety of a wig or whatever else hides our freakishness i loved this book and i could not stop myself from underlining in pencil of course a few passages here is maxon's attempts at translating human feelings into an artificial intelligence language of a robot show preference without reason love and then doubt rational decisions regret and finally trust data from a previously unreliable source forgive p 50 or a poignant observation a child playing with its father screams louder laughs harder jumps more eagerly puts more faith in everything a child playing by himself is hearing an internal dialogue and has a listening look even when shrieking p 88 three words that best describe this book elegant quirky introspective if you like this book i would recommend the age of miracles by karen thompson walker the world according to garp by john irving the time traveler's wife by audrey niffenegger","141":"the ending is open to interpretation well developed characters pulled me right into the story","142":"i gave up on this one but after reading some reviews i might try again","143":"\"rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone\" elton johnsunny is a young housewife struggling to keep up appearances while her life is sliding out of control her son bubber is autistic and she is pregnant with her second child she wears a variety of wigs to disguise the fact she was born bald and remains so her mother is dying from cancer and her brilliant scientist husband is currently heading to space on a rocket to assist colonizing the moon with robots the marriage was on shaky ground before his departure and it looks like sunny is left to handle it all alone this is a beautifully written story about helplessness identity and making tough choices it also contains a razor sharp wit causing this reader to break into a smile on a few occasions think of a cross between anne tyler and the film directors tim burton and david lynch with a warmer more optimistic under coating netzer is a fresh engaging new talent and this turned out to be one of the most pleasant literary surprises i've experienced this year","144":" i can not imagine anyone giving this book less than 5 stars lydia netzer i could imagine a movie starring marcia cross as sunny i loved the that this story did not gloss over what it is like to have a child with autism i do not speak of issues with the child i speak of society itself and how cruel people can be i remember when my grandson was but a toddler and have meltdowns in public people either looked at us as though we had done something horrible or they shot us looks as though to say do something with that child then there was the medication to deal with while one medication did allow our grandson to focus the others had the potential to be very harmful one doctor even made a mistake and prescribed an adult dose luckily we were able to act quickly and get to the hospital fast enough so when little bigger in this story was being constantly tested and more medications thrown at the parents to give him i was reminded of what our daughter and grandson went through colonizing the moon using robots to build and work being woven into this storyline was brilliant maxon husband to sunny and father to bubber was the genius behind the moon expedition having created the robots necessary to begin the martian colony maxon himself gave hints of possibly being autistic as a boy he had to be told reminded how to interact socially actually this carried over into adulthood his brilliance more than made up for any social awkwardness i loved the line of his in the book reminding sunny during a social gathering at his home to be sure and put the 30 thousand dollar mont blanc pen back into the curio cabinet since it had belonged to an uncle who had used it to sign the magna carta all the while sunny had been discussing how it was her dad had been killed by the communists in burma she changed this story each time she shared it w ith someone maxon of course knew that sunny once more was embellishing the truth sunny was born in burma during an eclipse she was born without hair no eye brows or eye lashes she remained bald with the exception of when she found out she was going to be a mother she began wearing wigs and false eye lashes and eye brows sunny as a young girl lived in burma until the communists discovered that her dad was a missionary this is when sunny's mother emma and their nanny nu moved to the u s a emma purchased the farm that had belonged to her in laws and she and nu began making a comfortable home for little sunny it was in this time frame and near the farm that emma bought from the butcher family that sunny met maxon maxon and sunny were inseparable until they went off to college they reunited when their beloved nu passed away i am leaving so many important parts of the book out of this review but then i don't want to spoil the book for anyone i feel as though i have given out too much information as it is i will end by saying that i really love this book and i would love to see a movie based on this storyline well done lydia netzer","145":" 4 5 i loved this book with all its quirky and flawed characters sunny the narrator just wants to be considered as normal as her neighbors as she prepares to be the perfect mother her husband is an autistic savant and their son ends up taking after dad what sunny learns eventually is that everyone strives to fit into the norm but in reality no one is normal how boring would that be anyway so in the last few weeks before her second child is born she throws off her super normalcy cloak wigs in her case and lets her true self shine shine shine of course it is not that easy there is sadness regret worry and joy but the road back to the real sunny is never dull","146":"an unconventional love story but the books keeps you at arm's length replicating the distance between the asperger's husband and wife i like a love story felt deeply","147":"this book was not an easy read but it was worth the effort there are parts that are hard to follow but the characters are so interesting and love able mostly so you feel compelled to keep reading to hear their whole story","148":" recently i read a bit of what ann curry shared with the lhj she stated that at 55 she still does not understand her worth and that she feels it is a chronic condition for women in general she went on to state that we punish ourselves with degrading thoughts and maybe even hang around people that treat us poorly after reading that bit i was instantly brought back to this gem sunny is indeed punishing herself and has accepted things she never would have as soon as she started covering her head there was so much to love in this book the differences in her her husband and bubber the unusual love each one shares for the other the honesty in her relationship with her husband and child i will definitely recommend this book to my daughter as she finds her way in the world i could never explain that we can defeat our encumbrances with love and honesty as well as netzer has","149":" i don't remember exactly when i added shine shine shine to my to read list but i do remember being intrigued by the title at the time when i finally decided to read it i saw that the average rating for this book wasn't so hot i try not to let that deter me and form my own opinion however in this case i think i tend to side with the majority shine shine shine is the quirky story of married couple sunny and maxon and their son bubber on the surface they seem like any other suburban middle class family only like many others they have their share of secrets but the secrets lurking in shine shine shine are not of the typical sort for starters sunny was born bald and hairless in an effort to keep up appearances upon moving to suburbia sunny began wearing wigs never to be seen without them then there is her and maxon's son bubber who sunny struggles so desperately to make normal despite a diagnosis of autism rounding out the family is her husband maxon a reclusive scientist who is clearly also on the autistic spectrum when the story begins maxon has journeyed to the moon on a scientific mission leaving sunny to tend to their delicately perfect life their challenging son her dying mother and the impending birth of their newborn daughter if all of the above sounds crazy to you that's because it kind of is but that's the interesting thing about shine shine shine in this case one can't say the story lacked for material and yet with all the potential it still never really went anywhere it reminded me of one of those beautifully artistic indie films that look so perfect on the surface but leave you saying is that the end","150":"terrible flat out just a strange book with a very strange ending i finished this book because it was all i had to read on the airplane","151":"decent read took me a few chapters to get into it and found the ending kind of lacking but enjoyed it overall","152":" so annoyed with this book that i don't know where to start i admit i like books with unlikeable characters and strange medical conditions and implausible situations but all the disparate parts didn't seem to add up to whatever the author was reaching for the characters felt wandering and half drawn and treating alopecia and asperbergers like mystical elements did the conditions and the book a disservice this was a nanowrimo novel originally and i could hear the word count ticking away with all the repetitive description","153":"geez some moms have it tough she is bald her son is austic she is 9 months pregnant her mom is dying and her hubby is up in space good character development but the ending was a bit abrupt for me but it was a nice distraction","154":"great debut novel unique plot with quirky characters fairly flawlessly executed really enjoyed it and found it refreshing","155":"quirky epic love story between 2 misfits who accept each other and in doing so bring out each other's unique and formidable strengths this one will stick with me for some time and i look forward to more from the author","156":" from the description i couldn't wait to start this book however it took me about a third of the way in to really start enjoying it once i figured out where the story was going i really loved it and had a hard time putting it down i loved how it focused on their relationship how it started and how they got to where they are i also loved finding out why they were the way they were it was a book that really made you think about yourself how you get to where you are and why we try to be normal","157":"liked this more as the story unfolded it still wasn't enchanted with it i liked the quirky characters and the odd twists the plot took but thought there was too much left for the reader to surmise","158":"quirky characters i really enjoyed the book","159":"this book doesn't fit into a neat and tidy category it'll stick to my ribs for awhile i believe","160":"2013 off to a great start with this fascinating book about a bald from birth wife of an autistic asperger scientist husband who goes to the moon","161":"bald sunny married to genius but autistic millionaire maxon have an autistic son a child on the way and sunny's mom dying while maxon is in space on his way to the moon to set up a colony of robots all characters are flawed and fighting their own demons i loved that nobody was the way others saw them this novel is unique and an interesting read i would give it 3 1 2 stars i liked it but had a hard time relating to these characters original writing and this story will stay with me","162":"i may not have been in the mood it may have been because i was listening to an audio book rather than reading from the page but whatever it was i could not stick with this book it is clever sometimes it felt too clever by half but shine shine shine seemed just to wander on through the bizarre characters lives with no particular purpose or end in sight","163":"only read this book if you have the desire to drive yourself batty this is one the worst books i've ever read the only reason i finished it was because it's my book club pick and i couldn't just not read it bits and pieces were tolerable but overall it made my eyes bleed and my mind scream stop stop","164":"a week ago i would have said that there are no truly unique books anymore that is until i read shine shine shine what really make this book so unusual are the main characters sunny was always a bald nonconformist until she becomes pregnant with her son and then she starts wearing wigs and becomes a stepford wife maxon sunny's husband is a genius who is currently on his way to the moon with his beloved robots he wasn't able to perform the task of being the husband of a stepford wife as he isn't comfortable relating to people without his formulas shine shine shine is a fresh take on love and what we has humans will do to ourselves to fit into society i loved the author's voice and how she makes me sit and think about things that i have always just taken for granted and about the parts of myself that i have suppressed in order to fit into today's world i was impressed by this book as you can tell and novel that remains with me after the reading and causes me to reexamine myself to determine what is real and what is part of the 'wig' that i put on to hide in plain sight is a great book i do highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for a fresh take on life and love i rate this book a 4 25","165":"i loved this one","166":" i checked this book out of the berea public library because it was on the shelf where the best of 2012 books were stored after i got into the book i noticed that it was marked as being in the science fiction category i almost never read sci fi as i have enough trouble keeping up with the plain old life stuff and truly this did not seem to be what i would consider a sci fi read i found this book to be well written with a unique plot that made this a real page turner although i would not categorize it as sci fi there were some dream type segments the three main characters were unexpected but each were endearing all three being brave in their own ways i found myself rooting for each of them in their own quirky ways this was overall a serious story but a very hopeful look at children and how they learn around their challenges whimsical moments and goodness do help the reader make it through to a good resolve this is a first novel for lydia netzer and will watch for other books which i hope she will write","167":"i really enjoyed this book it's been waiting around for me to read it since last year and i wish i hadn't waited so long it was a lovely novel about love of all types mother daughter mother son father son between spouses between friends between lovers i also really like the transformative story line for sunny and how netzer handles what we might label the autistic traits in other characters a beautiful read","168":"this was interesting i don't think i've read anything like it before none of the characters were very likable but the plot kept you reading","169":"book info genre literary science fiction reading level adult disclosure i received a free ebook galley from netgalley in exchange for an honest

wondrous strange relationship formed of dark secrets decades old murders and the urgent desire for connection as children the bald temperamental sunny and the neglected savant maxon found an unlikely friendship no one else could understand she taught him to feel -- helped him translate his intelligence for numbers into a language of emotion he saw her spirit where others saw only a freak as they grew into adults their profound understanding blossomed into love and marriage but with motherhood comes a craving for normalcy that begins to strangle sunny's marriage and family as sunny and maxon are on the brink of destruction at each other's throats with blame and fear of how they've lost their way maxon departs for the moon where he's charged with programming the robots that will build the fledgling colony just as the car accident jars sunny out of her wig and into an awareness of what she really needs an accident involving maxon's rocket threatens everything they've built revealing the things they've kept hidden and nothing will ever be the same my thoughts the initial synopsis i read of this book at netgalley lured me into accepting it the longer synopsis i read above caused me to rethink my decision but an agreement is an agreement so i set out to give this book a read and all i can way is wow i'm so glad i did right away i was surprised at how engaging the book was i was immediately pulled into it into the beautifully flowing writing into the lives of these not so normal people i really can't imagine what it would be like to be completely hairless although i do know that the eyelashes at least serve an evolutionary purpose to help protect the eyes i would have like to have seen a bit of a nod to that in the book but there does not seem to be any sort of repercussion for sunny's condition other than the defiance of societal norms and as it turns out for most people after the initial shock it's really not a big deal i enjoyed the character development - sunny and maxon have very interesting pasts and flashbacks to their past are interspersed among the story the secondary characters are also interesting - the television personality in their neighborhood les weathers i think the other suburban housewives the astronauts - all carefully individuated and created to you can get a feel for them fairly quickly things get a bit rough at points and the ending left me in tears - but good tears happy tears tears of joy so don't let that stop you the overall plot is left unwrapped although there are \"visions\" that i guess are supposed to show the future so things are not left unfinished - just not completely for certain if that makes sense anyway this is a beautiful book wonderfully well written and one i can highly recommend to almost anyone check it out","170":"unique book great fascinating characters i did not love it but it was very readable some of the chapters written from the hubby's point of view were heavy with all the science so i preferred those by about the main character sunny some great things to chew on such as what maxon ponders about what robots cannot do 'show preference without reason love ' and then 'doubt rational decisions regret ' and finally trust data from a previously unreliable source forgive '","171":"good first novel loved the character of maxon particularly his equations i will be thinking about this for a while","172":" not a huge fan of this book mostly because of the style it is written in all over the road in different times and places etc i followed the book fine it was just annoying to me instead of creative which is what i think it was meant to be the main character was likeable enough but she did not win me over it was also a disappointing ending for me almost too ordinary for the way that the story was written flat i did not like the way she portrayed described her autistic child in this book either there was too much focus on what was wrong with everything instead of what was right and how lucky she really was just was not a great read for me and it took me forever because i was not that interested in it","173":"loved this book unique and odd oddly unique","174":"wonderful and strange beautifully written","175":"loved this book at first it seemed a bit off the wall but it was excellent make sure you read the author notes at the back of the book when you are done they are very touching and insightful","176":"this book is about sunny pregnant wife of an astronaut and has an autistic son her mother is dying in a come she wears a wig because she was born without any hair after a wreck she decides she doesn't need to wear the wig she wants her husband home helping and supporting her instead on on a space mission book was interesting but not my favorite","177":"this was really a wonderful book it seems odd with emotionless characters who are nonetheless full of emotion it is funny and the author writes some absolutely beautiful sentences that make one proud to be a reader","178":"i was motivated to read this when i saw the description the premise piqued my interest and the characters seemed worth exploring however i found the plot too bogged down with flashbacks of sunny and maxon's developing relationship instead of adding to the reader's interest in their love story i found the flashbacks to be tiresome and uninteresting also i did not like the ending at all i would not recommend this book","179":"struggled between 1 and 2 stars gave it 2 while reading and the ending just tanked it for me not a book that i'd recommend even though i loved the mathematical equations to explain social relationships interactions ok maybe i would recommend skipping most of the text and just looking for the explanation of the equations","180":"this book was very strangely written the storyline was mostly fascinating but the writing was so odd and off putting that i felt as if it kept me at arms length it didn't allow me to get absorbed in the story or characters but it's certainly something new interesting and different and many smart people disagree with me about the writing","181":"an amazing read the kind of book that makes you realize that true talent is born not made as close to perfect as they come","182":"bad bad bad not sure why i finished it","183":"the premise of this book is kind of all over the place very neurotic feeling sunny and maxon are a suburban couple with an autistic son they call bubber sunny is beautiful and radiant and an alpha sahm until she unravels and it becomes known that she is bald bald bald bald she is not sick she was simply born with no hair on her body and this is presented as if it were a monumentally disfiguring handicap husband maxon is an asperger y astronaut with a nobel prize nasa is collectively autistic sunny and maxon both had entirely strange childhoods and met as teenagers most things are repeated throughout the book everything gets said a second time in a slightly different way ad nauseum i never understood how sunny's mother emma made money after the dad died and i don't get why the dad's death became so convoluted","184":" this random library selection was a dubious pick i almost put back on the shelf after seeing two jacket endorsements from authors i'm not especially fond of sorry to my friends who like them sara gruen water for elephants and joshilyn jackson gods in alabama the only thing that made me give it a shot were the random calculus equations i encountered while flipping through it i'm glad i gave it a shot shine shine shine is a very promising debut for lydia netzer easily one of the best books of its genre and were it not for a rather lackluster final 50 pages where ms netzer stumbles a bit trying to manufacture a suitable ending it would definitely be 5 star worthy the story grabbed me from the opening pages and didn't let me go this is really rare for a dare i say it without sounding trite love story life story ahem chick lit novel though i'm not an astronaut with asperger's like maxon the husband though i was not born in burma with hair growth issues to missionaries like sunny the wife though i don't have an autistic son like their little bubber i found myself identifying with their quirks and idiosyncracies and rooting them on in their navigation of the celestial map of their lives i might be nitpicking a bit with the critcism of the denouement but it's a small gripe though i liked the first 80% so much i almost want to ask her to re write the ending to make it perfect strangely though shine shine shine is like nothing i've read by either sara gruen or joshilyn jackson so their fans might find this story a little strange but give it a try anyway you'll probably be pleasantly surprised like i was","185":"quirky resonant believable really liked it","186":" this book this book i can't write too much about it because i think that reading it and discovering these characters is what makes the book succeed when i first started this novel i thought i was going to hate it i was actually pretty certain that i would for various reasons but that's because i was wrong in my presuppositions i adored this book i've already mentioned it to three people that i'm going to be passing it along to them that's how much i liked it and i think it'll appeal to other lovers of good novels even if the story and the characters don't grab the reader which would surprise me netzer's writing is brilliant just brilliant i'd like to read some passages aloud just to allow them to breathe properly honestly my only issue with this book is the packaging of the trade paperback i'm quite upset by it but i can't reveal why suffice to say that if you read it you will know why it upsets me and you may even feel the same way in short it's a love story but not really the biggest love story will be the one between you and this novel and it'll be a good one","187":"i picked up this book and put it down because i didn't get sunny the main character encouraged to try again by a friend and i'm so glad i did this book is a deep true love story but also heavily about the role of women as mothers who do we become when we become a mother sunny's battles with her view of who she is supposed to be vs who she is as a mother are revealing and fascinating highly recommend","188":"this is the story of an astronaut who was lost in space and the wife he left behind or this is the story of a brave man who survived the wreck of the first rocket sent into space with the intent to colonize the moon this is the story of the human race who pushed one crazy little splinter of metal and a few pulsing cells up into the vast dark reaches of the universe in the hope that the splinter would hit something and stick and that the little pulsing cells could somehow survive this is the story of a bulge a bud the way the human race tried to subdivide the bud it formed out into the universe and what happened to that bud and what happened to the earth too the mother earth after the bud was burst and it was a beautiful story","189":"i read this book quickly kept me very intrigued when i finished it i thougt so so not great buth then i noticed my mind returning to the characters the story to me that is a sign of a good book it's about love marriage choices we make as kids disappointments trying to be perfect or different than we really are friends kids neighbors attractions it is a good read","190":"so wasn't expecting much from this simply because i chose the book for its stars on cover as dog stars and fault in stars were best of 2012 really enjoyed shine story of space travel autism not fitting in etc didn't like the ending but beside that worth a look","191":" absolutely freaking lovely i wasn't sure what to think of sunny at the beginning it's written so different the a lot of books these day i love this and i had to get used to sunny's voice i soon grew to love her and her insecurities most mothers will be able to relate to her the more i learned about her and maxon the more i fell in love with both of them i am going to miss them now that the book is over i need to know more about their life and their children excellent i can't wait to hand sell this to my customers","192":"from its hairless protagonist sunny to her nobel prize winning rocket scientist husband shine shine shine is truly an original the story begins with sunny's unsunny life her husband maxon has just launched with nasa into space with his precious robots her mother is surviving in the icu on life support her son copes with life on different terms and her pregnancy seems sure to become an early delivery after a car accident but the worst happens for sunny when in the car accident her wig flies off and lands in a mud puddle in that revealing moment her whole world sees that she is truly different hairless bald and covering it up through the story we journey with sunny as she comes to terms with her differences with her societal world with her mother and with maxon it is the story of coming back to one's true self after wandering far to become someone we're not it is the heartachingly beautiful story of coming back together with the ones we love shine shine shine is a powerful story that i deeply loved and is one i will not soon forget a wonderful debut by lydia netzer i give shine shine shine my highest recommendation a must read for 2012","193":"i didn't like it to start but kept reading because it was part of a book club i ended up really liking the book as the characters unfolded","194":"interesting characters liked it well enough but not fabulous","195":"what an original and heartfelt story i was so moved by sunny","196":"initially promising but momentum faded quickly into endless flashbacks and tedious navel gazing","197":"off beat and on target witty and real robots suburbs and a news reader loved it","198":"this was four star adjacent for me it just never quite nailed it down i so enjoyed much of the author's storytelling and character development but for me if felt more like half of a really long book i needed more","199":" i nearly walked away from this book after 2 chapters but since i hold the folks who recommended this book in high regard i decided to give it another chance and boy i am glad that i did unlike other reviewers i do not feel the characters are quirky this as in relation to what is typically called normal rather i find the characters to be alarmingly multidimensional and whole in depth of character u0026amp more tangibly real than most real people ever dare to be netzer drives it home u0026amp hits it square on the head in regards to all the dark u0026amp dastardly thought processes we have within ourselves that are never spoken or revealed especially those buried thoughts that lay beneath the surface u0026amp motivate our outward actions this story does a great job of uncovering behind the scene realities and shames us for the everyday hurtful assumptions we inflict on those around us as well as the soul crushing judgments we place on ourselves indeed this was a challenging read but wholly rewarding in a most thought provoking u0026amp heart wrenching way i recommend this to anyone who is willing to question the one dimensionality of an otherwise acceptable normal life","200":" i wasn't sure about this in the beginning but i ended up really enjoying this book born totally hairless in burma sunny spends her married life in wigs false eyelashes and eyebrows her husband maxon a genius working for nasa with few natural social skills is the only person in sunny's life besides her mother emma and son bubber who know through a series of flashbacks we see how sunny lost her father fled burma to come to pennsylvania grew up and fell in love now pregnant for the second time sunny finds herself dealing with a lot while maxon is in outer space her dying mother her secret exposed bubber's issues and maxon's accident in space the plot sounds a little far fetched and almost un relatable but the story is really interesting my only real complaint is that netzer did such a good job leading up to the end i felt like the ending should have been more more what i'm not sure but it wraps up so quickly i'm not sure that the ending does the book total justice","201":"loved it as did my book club many layers wow","202":" you've probably heard by now that the main characters sunny maxon and their son bubber are eccentric in the sense of being smart and weird simultaneously but this story is more about the normal part of eccentricity how people with unusual backgrounds or super charged minds are nevertheless beautifully and painfully human sunny maxon and bubber are not larger than life their emotions and desires are the same size as those of the rest of us and yet their story is a special one made special by the particularity of netzer's observations and by the way the story runs back and forth through time gathering our sympathy and affection with each pass netzler's prose is not poetic it is commanding she can do what she wants with words and sentences and i was delighted to be pulled along at its heart this is a love story not about finding great love and tending it but about holding love at the center of everything where it belongs sunny and maxon's love for each other is a gravitational force indomitable and as real as the earth itself it's a beautiful thing","203":"good read i look forward to more books by this author","204":"i really struggled to finish it just seemed all over the place","205":"this book had some of the most unique characters i have ever read and it was such an interesting premise for a storyline that i couldn't wait to see how this story worked out i'm sad that i didn't connect with this one the way that i had hoped after reading the rave reviews the writing held a lot of promise though and i can't wait to see what the author comes up with next","206":" this was a really good book by a new author i wish i could give it 4 1 2 stars but i don't think it deserves 5 sunny is the perfect mom with a secret that's a secret to no one she's not perfect at all she's bald since birth but hides it with a wig hides her son's autism symptoms with drugs and leaves her socially awkward scientist husband in his study when she hosts parties at home all that comes undone with a car accident the day her husband takes off on a rocket to colonize the moon with robots i liked this book because it was very relatable as mom yet had a unique fresh voice sunny's monologue about how she will always be a mother and can't just take a break like her husband can is one that i think every mom has either delivered or wanted to deliver to her husband i also liked how sunny's idea of what a perfect mom can look like gets turned on it's bald head and does not have the consequences she thought it would it turns out that everyone feels like an outsider in someway and good friends don't judge you by your hair or lack thereof the parts in space were kind of weird but in a good way as was sunny's childhood in burma the unconventional setting and characters dealing with the conventional problems of the world made the book touching and meaningful to the outsider in all of us","207":"my first reaction at the beginning of the book was what is this it was short clipped robot line writing which i found kind of strange as you keep reading though it makes sense i really enjoyed this book not quite like anything i've read before","208":"ack i hated this book i practically recoiled every time i opened it but stuck with it as it was a book club choice finally abandoned after about 100 pages the characters were extremely unbelievable and unlikable hard to put my finger on but something about the autistic son and the mom with no hair struck me as hollow and unrealistic 2 thumbs down","209":"i just wanted to keep reading to see where this went","210":"i received an arc advanced reader copy of this book thanks to the publisher and netgalley let me start off by saying that the first 100 pages or so i was skeptical of this book the story and characters were so odd and unique that i felt that i couldn't figure out if it was trying to be humorous or serious but i stuck with it and boy am i glad that i did this is one of those rare books and stories that just gets under your skin don't try to figure out anything just go with it and let the oddness transport you in it you will find the most delightful and heartbreaking characters i loved this book this author is truly a genius at character development and a masterful way of showing us that we all have our secrets and things are not always as they seem but we have to make a choice whether we will let that bring us down in shame or raise us to a level of love for all people flaws and all","211":"i was completely unsure what to expect with this novel but i was pleasantly surprised it was quirky and the characters were all a little or maybe a lot imperfect but that is why i think i enjoyed it so much i agree with other reviewers about the quick and tidy ending i wish we had a little more details on the resolution probably not something i would have picked up if it wasn't selected for my book club but i am glad i read it","212":"pretty quirky and probably not for everyone but there's something that i really liked about this","213":"considering its acclaim i wanted to like this book it has interesting characters and occasionally for a dozen pages i enjoyed the story but then i'd weary all in all this book didn't capture me","214":"i barely got through a few chapters before i had to stop reading","215":" it started off slow and i couldnt get into the flow of the book then about 30% in something clicked and i couldn't put the book down i loved the flawed characters and the way they didn't see the flaws for what the were until they tried to cover them up with medication or wigs or false understanding of human interaction i think deep down my favorite part was the complete love story that unfolded i went from on the fence to enthralled with the characters so much so that i had dreams about them after i finished the book","216":"the story itself contains humor--almost comic dysfunction guilt friendship and love seinfeld and its cast of political incorrect cast could have conjured up good 3 or 4 episodes out of this book the writing however is somewhat choppy yet easy to read as netzer is very concerned with detail and drawing you back in time it felt to me she rushed the ending as if she was just tired of writing","217":"look i've only got about 20 minutes a night to read so i want the story to be engrossing and more or less straightforward i'm sure that if i put my mind to it i could have figured out all the allegorical and metaphorical imagery in this novel but i'm not in college any more and i don't feel like putting my mind to things i thought this had all the makings of an interesting story with interesting characters but then it started trying to make me think not my jam also i'm cranky","218":"eh just couldn't connect with the characters or story","219":"i almost gave up on this book in the beginning and found it to be somewhat odd but i stuck it out and the characters became endearing as we got to know more about their story i want to give this a 3 5 rating but i was a little disappointed at the end guess i want to know the outcome rather than make up my own ending","220":"interesting contemporary read i would rate it 4 out of 5 stars","221":"i read this book for my book club and i have to say that i didn't really enjoy it it was difficult to get into and to figure out the point i still don't know if i truly understand what the author wasmtryingntomsay so unfortunately i would not recommend this book","222":"woah okay i am a bit confused by this completely unique bizarre at times quirky book it ended as oddly as it began im all over the place emotionally this week a lot has happened that has made chilling with a book too hard though i finally finished this one i gotta say after reading all the 5 star rave reviews on this one i was and am confused oh well i'll chock this one up to my mental state being at odds and dive into my next book i just didn't see this being a 5 star read","223":"i wasn't captured by this novel thought it would be better","224":"got up early to read a few pages and never put this book down a very unique love story involving an astronaut his bald wife and their autistic son a great story","225":"heartbreaking and wonderful","226":"like many of the other reviewers almost gave up on the book in the first 20 pages but glad i didn't an engaging interesting story about relationships it explores how we the challenges of staying true to ourselves while we allow those that we love be their own true selves","227":"enjoyable and thoughtful book by a virginia homeschool mom","228":"this book grabbed me up like a fairy tale it is a quirky story with endearing wonderfully imaginative characters it kept me guessing to the very end were they all aliens or just variously challenged don't care love them all","229":"stayed up until 2 in the morning to finish this amazing and quirky book fascinating read","230":"loved its weirdness loved its wisdom loved its wit virtually from page 1 don't let the premise keep you away","231":" loved this it's also my vote for most under recognized book of 2012 really hoped to see it get some love on year end lists but aside from the times' 100 notable books i haven't seen it turn up anywhere anyways a bald but otherwise beautiful girl born to christian missionaries in burma falls in love with her childhood best friend who has a pretty intense case of asperger's and who spends much of the book hurtling through outer space on a rocket ship that may or may not ever return to earth it's funny and poetic and thoughtful and big hearted all at once definitely recommend","232":"i guess i'm loving the relationship books at the moment glimpse of individual lives beyond the closed door kempt yard and stylish clothing aren't we all a mess in some way talented writer who weaves the story of a struggling wife father and son through their individual and collective colorful and painful histories damaged connected surviving and redeeming i'm cheering for the manns","233":" how do i explain this strange book the author is out there her thought process is way out there the characters thought processes are way the hell out there that's the part i really really enjoyed it was interesting to experience their inner monologues which was a strange and intelligent way of thinking about things i did want more of the story i agree with the other reviewer that i wanted less neighbors and more maxon more bubber and his progress what the hell happened with her awesome mother and the bomb she dropped on her daughter in a letter why i felt the end was a little rushed their futures being thrown into a few pages at the end her birth scene seemed like another way of throwing in a little more crazy as if there wasn't enough even so i still enjoyed the book","234":"watch my review here http www youtube com watch v lxt9ze","235":"usually if i quit reading a book i give it one star this one gets two because it's like i went on a date with a really nice guy but just didn't feel any connection 'it's not you it's me' for whatever reason the author's style just didn't click with me and i gave up i even gave it more time than i normally give books i'm not enjoying on the basis that a lot of other people seem to really like it but it just didn't work","236":"i loved this this is one of the quirkiest families you will ever meet and also one of the most interesting for fear of spoiling any of your pleasure in this witty book i will only say read it and you'll be glad you did","237":"weird took awhile to get into then i was then it ended very strangely still unsure about the whole experience","238":"interestingly strange","239":" ummmmm this book somehow just didn't click for me i get the whole dying on the inside from trying to fit in on the outside thing i mean hell i lived it myself for far too long i also understand the socially awkward husband thing my ex was but not because he was an autistic genius he was just not at all social but somehow i couldn't connect with any of the characters in this book and that ruins a story for me i didn't like anybody enough the style of writing is not something i am accustomed to either and it also did not resonate with me i read to escape or to learn and neither of those things happened for me definitely a 'meh' book","240":"this book is algorithms and spacesuits and a child with autism and an orange shock of hair this book is going to sit with me for several days as i ponder it through my programming perhaps more soon or perhaps i'll just leave this as it is update a few days later ok so i've been pondering this book for the past few days why because the story was not only thought provoking but i miss the characters i just entered a first reads contest to win this book and even if i don't win i'm going to buy this book and share it with others this is rare because there are so few books i care to read again this is one of those i can't quite describe why i love this book so much except to say that i love how sunny and maxon love each other in their imperfections because of their imperfections in spite of their imperfections this to me is real love it's showing each other how to love you and feeling the freedom to love that other person this review is scattered i know and it doesn't adequately explain why i love this book i guess all i can say for now is that this story moved me","241":"this has got to be the most inventive love story ever","242":"this book was very unique and a little all over the place but i enjoyed the different spins on the mid life crisis plot","243":"wow underwhelmed based on the reviews i expected to love this book the story was interesting but the writing was very annoying to me because the author used three times as many words as seemed necessary to impart information throughout the book she hyped how sunny was completely hiding her real self as well as maxon's from everybody yet the only thing she seemed to be hiding was her baldness which was already mentioned in the pr summary of the book really over dramatized the theme","244":" well another author who has a taste for baldness i thought i would never meet another author after haruki murakami who is so enthralled with hair or more precisely the lack of it i thought the book was clever but i am really really really super annoyed that the cover of my version is a good looking guy and girl lying on their backs looking at the heavens and both are fully hair'ed it really bugs me since sunny's baldness is so central in the book in an intimate moment like that she would not be wearing her wig i read 98% of this book on a plane or on a layover to kentucky then it took me another month to finish the last few pages of the book after i got home because to me the ending just got so ridiculous but those hours in flight were great i've never been less bored on a plane this book was certainly much better than any in flight entertainment but the end i just feel that the end was rushed and i was left wanting it reminded me of the end of the hunger games trilogy it's kind of a cop out to be so slow and meticulous a writer and then skip to 20 years later and give a lowdown of the happily ever after in a couple of pages and even before that i was looking for more out of sunny's pregnancy i was looking for more out of sunny and maxon's relationship in the present tense too much time was spend on memories no maybe that's not the problem it was just an uneven work but entertaining nevertheless sunny is a very believable character i like her and i now want to name my son maxon very cool name","245":"it took a bit to get into but this ended up being a really engrossing read the characters were multi layered and the relationships interesting","246":"deep thoughts on baldness autism swimming space dying love and fitting in but deep down it's silly chick lit and i think i liked it even less because i had the audiobook and i couldn't take her voice","247":"i love love loved this book i sat down and read it in a day not because i had nothing better to do i did but because i got sucked in and just could not put it down i will think about this book for a long time","248":"i almost put the book down after getting a few pages in but i am so glad i didn't loved the characters the portrayal of autism and the imperfections the humans had the themes running through the book were very interesting most of all i believed the love between maxon and sunny their relationship was the reason i couldn't put it down it even made me overlook the astronaut storyline","249":" i received an early review copy of shine shine shine from netgalley though i've since purchased the book weeks after turning the last page i'm still thinking about the characters and situations in this remarkable debut from lydia netzer i wondered how i would eventually feel about sunny and maxon as they began telling their stories in their oddly detached voices but by the end of the book i found myself genuinely emotional and desperate to know whether they would be okay as individuals and as a family netzer's style takes the reader all the way to the edge of over the top then draws you gently back to yes and one of my favorite lines near the beginning of the book exemplifies the quirky but spot on social commentary the author makes again and again in shine shine shine norway echoed the one in the lime green cardigan she rolled her eyes what a joke she had a hooked nose and small eyes but from her blowout and makeup her trim figure and expensive shoes people still knew she was attractive i am not sure this book is for everyone i'm not sure every reader will get the message and grasp the genius storytelling behind shine shine shine but i honestly can't wait to see what's next from lydia netzer","250":"and shine is what ms netzer's novel does whenever you pick up a new author who has invented some of the most wonderful and original characters in recent fiction history you get excited knowing that certainly this author will bring more wonderfulness to us in future years my daughter just asked me what was this book about and i told her a bald woman and an autistic man because sunny is bald and beautiful and smart and endearing in her hopes and fears and maxon is a very sexy smart oddball who loves to ride his bike and work his formulas and who is loved by sunny but the story is so much more than that netzer has done a lovely job of telling both sunny and maxon's story and emma's story as well as sunny's mother emma plays a large role not only as sunny's mother but as someone who has known maxon and helped him for much of his life when we meet the characters en media res emma is dying sunny is getting bad news about her husband and the space flight he's on and she is pregnant and expecting their second child and maxon is trying to fix what is broken these characters are so complex and all of their stories are interwoven i think the best way to go into this beautiful novel is without knowing too much about the actual story it is a pleasure to read netzer's wonderful writing and have these characters grow and unfold for you within the pages very human very moving and highly unexpected and delightful this is one of those novels that makes you miss the characters when it is all finished this was an arc provided from amazon vine","251":"shine shine shine started off good got really good had me tweeting the author to ask if maxom lives great loved the whole book the ending was a little weird for me i wanted less of the neighbors and more of the husband but i'm ultimately happy to have discovered lydia netzer thanks to joshlyn jackson i can't wait to see what ms netzer comes up with next","252":" a quirky funny wonderful story about motherhood young love adult love death and motherhood again the story goes in a full circle as does sunny as she is discovering who she really is i loved all of the characters in the book especially netzer's portrayal of maxon who was perhaps the most normal of all i admit i was a little dubious after reading the first few pages my daughter told me i had to read it but it really didn't take long to want to know what happened and was going to happen and by the end of the book i totally understood maxon and sunny and loved them both this would make a fabulous bookclub pick many would probably never choose it on their own but they would be really glad they ended up reading it and there is lots and lots to discuss","253":" i was pleased to find this book lurking on the library bookshelves and took great pleasure delving into its pages i loved the first chapter it seemed almost magical maxon the clever scientist husband who is sent into space in a rocket leaving behind his pregnant wife sunny and their young autistic son destined to be together after growing up in a rural poor background i liked the story of their youth together for me though i just didn't entirely believe their current time together i couldn't quite place if the storyline was sent in the present or was meant to be like the seventies or in the future i guess there weren't too many pop culture references","254":"this book has a crazy premise sunny is the bald wife of a nobel prize winning autistic man who is currently in space delivering a fleet of robots to colonize the moon but i loved it the first chapter was a little choppy but i quickly was swept up in the story biggest complaint p301 a welcome breeze in her hair referring to sunny sunny's baldness is a major focal point of this book and for something like this to slip past the editors is just sloppy","255":"shine shine shine is the love story of sunny and maxon they met as children and knew that they belonged together now married maxon is a very successful nobel prize winning autistic nasa scientist who is on a mission to colonize the moon with self replicating robots sunny is his very pregnant wife left behind on earth with their autistic 4 year old son bubber sunny was born completely hairless bald no eyelashes no eyebrows no hair whatsoever when she became a mother she felt the need to fit in so she started wearing wigs and false eyelashes they live in an expensively furnished suburban home sunny is trying to be the perfect suburban wife and mother but this has put a lot of stress on both sunny and maxon after maxon leaves for the moon sunny has a car accident that sends her wig flying off in her neighborhood this exposure of her secret causes sunny to re examine her life and the choices she has made in order to fit in and seem normal she soon begins to wonder if there is such a thing as normal this author does a great job in teaching us about motherhood accepting who you are and how people hide their true selves in order to be accepted by society we all worry about fitting in but none of us ever really do there is no such thing as perfect and happiness comes with self acceptance there were parts that i had to reread because they were so beautifully written with all that being said i really didn't enjoy reading this book it was so quirky and unusual i never knew really where the story was going there are a lot and i mean a lot of flashbacks that fill in the backstory that were interesting but seemed to interrupt the story maxon seems so much like a robot at first i wasn't totally sure whether he was human or not i'm actually liking the story more now that i have finished and had time to really think about what happened and the messages we take away from it this will definitely not appeal to all readers because it is so odd but i think this author is one to watch somewhere between 2 and 3 stars favorite quite there are three things that robots cannot do wrote maxon then beneath that on the page he wrote three dots indented beside the first dot he wrote show preference without reason love and then doubt rational decisions regret and finally trust data from a previously unreliable source forgive \"","256":"this is truly a unique book from the plot to the writing style to the characters it's all unique sunny is married to maxon and they have a preschool autistic son nicknamed bubber sometimes the only way they know how to communicate with each other is with algebraic equations algebra not my favorite subject but it's definitely in these pages maxon is in a rocket going to the moon while pregnant sunny is home trying to figure out what makes bubber tick and pretending that her mother is not dying in the hospital icu the story jumps from present time to the past and back again it has many completely unexpected and sometimes bizarre happenings sometimes i liked the plot and other times i didn't i did not especially care for the writing style the author sporadically used such simple sentences that i felt like i was way back in first grade reading a dick and jane book example from page 101 the mother was not dying the mother was living the mother was thinking it annoyed me that the author used the words the mother over and over rather than using her name emma there must have been a reason for that but i didn't get it often those simple sentences were followed by very complicated sentences it all just seemed very weird to me but it was interesting enough that i wanted to finish the book i debated between two and three stars","257":"slow start thought i had wandered into a romance novel but then becomes a jewel of a book it is a love story but with very quirky characters at the heart of things i loved it on my short list for christmas presents this year and as an aside i picked it up on a whim at target so not all that glitters is to be found in used bookstores","258":" i really really really loved this book i'd heard some good things about it but at the outset the main character sunny reminded me of a spoiled suburban housewife straight out of desperate housewives and that may not have been too far off the mark because ledia netzer originally began this book under the working title of cul de sac blech i'm so glad that she dug into sunny and maxon a little more the people she came up with as imperfect and damaged as they are were really something original and yet astonishingly familiar the story is enjoyable quirky hysterical sweet disturbing and heartwarming this is one of those books that makes you look at your own life and see all the sweet good things you might be taking for granted because we are all bald mentally handcuffed and self conscious geniuses under everything else our lives and circumstances have coated us in not 5 stars because the end which is supposed to be some kind of filmstrip y epilogue type thing that just doesn't work for me the right things were said but not in the right way lydia i expect good things from you and will definitely read anything else you publish please do not write a book called cul de sac","259":"what an unusual book well written and original sunny is pregnant and her genius husband maxon is on his way to the moon sunny is also bald she and maxon have an autistic son her mother is dying and the marriage is rocky sounds like a soap opera but netzer makes it a powerful story of love and what it means to be human","260":"read it in 3 days couldn't put it down loved it great love story","261":" to be human is a strange fascinating adventure of life and connection shine shine shinesunny bald bubber is autistic maxon is in space define normal in a world filled with so much unusual sunny has felt un normal her whole her bald head being raised in burma in her infancy her connection to maxon a strange boy and as he grows man with a mind who see's life like no other when sunny has her first child bubber who is a reflected refraction of his father she decide's she will fit in she wears a wig glues on her eyebrows and buys a minivan silver cause its the most common color everything about it her fits the suburban mother but her life is not normal shes not normal her husband not normal the news anchor down the street superhuman appearance is just not normal maxon her true love is not normal shine shine shine is a stunning debut from lydia netzer and one of the most captivating books i have read so far this year it symbolically reached me in the outsider connection between sunny and maxon maxons logical formulas for humans sunnys emotional turmoil and bubbers charm the story unravels like an intrigue painting slowly from a picture to an art peice filled with the minuscule details that rattle the heart of humans what is it to be human how do we connect to the world around us but of all what is normal this is what i took away from it and loved about it","262":"full of wonder and simply wonderful","263":"interesting well written story about the moon autism and being different maybe autism is the next step in evolution i certainly sympathize very strongly with the sentiment that medicating children into being normal is twisted good first novel lydia netzer","264":" this was a different kind of story but it was an enjoyable read i loved reading about the life of sunny and maxon learning about sunny's children and mother seeing how they deal with one aspect of being autistic and then tying it all together with a trip to the moon made this a unique plot i loved how each family member had their own physical problems and quirks to deal with but in spite of those issues the love for one another stayed strong even though it took a crises to make them aware of the depths of their feelings i would recommend this as a fun novel and look forward to more stories written by this author","265":"i really gave this book a chance it took me around two months to get through it and i just never got it this book seemed like an alternate universe that i just didn't understand i didn't connect with the main character at all the main story was about a bald woman from burma living in norfolk virginia with an autistic husband who works at nasa and is on a shuttle to the moon they have an autistic son named bubber and she is pregnant again maybe i would have enjoyed this more if it wasn't set in the area i live i don't know i'm just not sure what would have made this better for me i have read the reviews for this book and people seemed to really enjoy it and i'm glad i mostly purchased this book to support a local author i would definitely still check out her next book the writing was great i'm just hoping maybe her next book will be a little more relatable","266":"quirky gifted highly intelligent people who have issues socially","267":"i know don't how this story worked but it did and i loved it rich storytelling incredible characters and quirkiness i'm a big fan of quirkiness liked that it was non linear if i had clever tags then this one would be tagged characters i want to have dinner with","268":"very interesting a first novel for the author she used great language the ending i expected more loose ends tied up but intrigued how she ended it","269":" sunny is your typical suburban housewife perfect home perfect neighbors toddler bubber with a new baby girl on the way but the cracks in that perfect world sunny has constructed for herself quickly make themselves apparent in shine shine shine from bubber's autism and sunny's internal struggle with whether his medicine and treatments are actually helping him to maxon sunny's brilliant but incredibly odd husband to sunny's own secrets that she's so desperate to hide from all of her friends and neighbors to sunny's dying mother while maxon hurtles through space intent on placing his brilliantly constructed ai robots on the moon to help create the first moon colony encountering his own trials and revelations on the journey sunny begins to let light shine through the cracks in her life accepting and even embracing the imperfections sunny and maxon's parallel present day journeys are interspersed with recollections of their love story that started in their childhood lydia netzer the author recently described shine shine shine in a single 140 character tweet as perfect mothers are not perfect strange husbands are not the problem robots keep you alive without asking if you want to live sex death i'd say that's about as apt a description as i could ever come up with it's one of the most unique books i've ever read and i fell in love with it almost instantly","270":" i can't decide whether this book is a 5 star or a 3 star it took me quite a while to think anything other than this book is very weird but the more i read the more intrigued i became i love maxon the autistic brilliant honest and endearing astronaut and the main character sunny is interesting and evolving this book is definitely about being different and how embracing one's differences as opposed to suppressing them is where happiness lies it is a story about love and commitment and it is not only a story about a woman who is bald it is a story about being bald it is a story of death and loss and it is a story of victory and new beginnings there is a lot going on i'm still not sure exactly what i think but i do know i can't stop thinking about shine shine shine","271":"interesting and unique a rather abrupt ending but i did enjoy this book","272":"i thought for some reason that this was going to be a sci fi it was not although there are are elements of sci fi in it it was good read about a young woman sunny who from birth suffers from a complete loss of all body hair as a child she escapes from burma with her mother after the communists kill her missionary father her mother settles in her husband's small us community to bring up sunny and it is there that sunny meets maxon who becomes her best friend lover and husband maxon is a genius but seems to have asperger's syndrome they have a son bubber who seems autistic but may have his father's brilliance also maxon works with nasa as a robotic engineer and is charged with colonizing the moon with robots who can build other robots in the initial effort to start preparing the moon for human habitation maxon's space flight takes place a sunny is to give birth to their second child and her mother is in hospital dying of cancer","273":"three things robots can't be taught to do love since they can't prefer for no reason regret because they can't doubt a decision made based on logical date and forgive because once a source of data isn't correct a robot won't ever use it again this is the way maxin autistic dad has pieced together the world with the help of so ny and emma and then bubber","274":"i looked shine shine shine up cause i thought oh i want to read this and when i read the description i realized that i have red it and loved it why i did not review it i do not know it is such an engaging book with interesting people that you wish you had living in your neighborhood or not i actually listened to it which gave me more chance to hear them do not hesitate","275":"i found this book refreshingly absorbing it was about wearing masks or wigs and struggling to be normal and trying to be a different person when you aren't a socially acceptable one it's about loving nerdy quirky unique broken amazing people just as they are the characters were complex and the story unfolded like origami with something interesting behind every new fold","276":"i loved shine shine shine i love the idea of a pdd astronaut i liked the back story and who is the hero at the end","277":"multilayered sunny wants to be normal but she is bald since birth and pregnant with her second child and is awaiting the slow and agonizing death of her mother from cancer her husband maxon a robotics scientist is rocketing to the moon to help set up the first lunar colony then one day her wig falls off and she is exposed the book is about the flaws and normalcy of everyone a very good book","278":"wonderful love story with sci fi twist give this one time as it takes awhile to like these quirky characters","279":"full review plus blog tour interview with the author coming soon on http www adventureswithwords com","280":"sunny is pregnant and bald she was born bald and never had facial hair and dealing with bubber her 4 year old son who autistic her husband maxon is in space on his way to the moon to set up a colony of robots who can build a moon community for people to visit as bizarre as those facts sound the book is a testament to the power of love in a family and the importance of allowing all persons in the family to be who they are","281":"i liked how this book portrayed aspergers less as a disability and more as a gift yes people on the autism scale are different but so are bald women people with four toes and amputees we don't have to fix them we need to appreciate differences","282":" in a tale of fragility and strength isolation and interconnectedness shine shine shine identifies a thousand little fissures in the human heart with vivid clarity all the while encouraging them to heal and scar over into something stronger and more beautiful if you have ever felt inadequate read this book isolated read this book if you've been in love with a human read this book if you gaze at the stars and wonder what it would be like to drift among them read this book if your feet are planted firmly in the soil read this book if you're a mother read this book if you're a woman read this book if you are an orphan read this book if you're awkward read this book if you're awkward read this book if you're dealing with austism read this book read it read it read it check out more of my reviews on my blog","283":"this one was not for me it had alternately too many words about certain things i didn't really care about and then big gaping holes about what i was actually curious to know i feel wholly unfulfilled","284":" shine shine shine is a beautiful debut novel about the love between sunny and maxon neither sunny or maxon fit the definition of \"normal\" - sunny was born hairless in burma and is currently a lonely pregnant stay at home mom maxon is a genius robotics engineer on a mission to the moon - but their quirks make them all the more relatable after all we all have those moments where we just want to fit in with everyone else when we just want to be \"normal \" as the story progresses we learn of the couple's long history together their struggles and successes and how much they've both worked to make it this is definitely the book for you if you want unique characters fantastic writing and a wonderful love story","285":"i liked the idea of this love story between two odd people more than the actual story i thought maxon's character was appealing a probably autistic man who falls in love and figures out how to translate his abilities into the creation of robots in space however sunny's character seemed overdone in comparison i just couldn't sympathize with the to wear or not to wear the wig decision which seemed to affect everything in her life","286":"ok book but you have to stick with it it gets really good after 200 pages","287":"really enjoyed this unusual book","288":"a strange beautiful and riveting novel about the human condition and the facades we create to hide our flaws from the outside world a novel about the strength challenge and depth of love the scientific and mathematical principles that shape our universe and our place therein and our struggle with naked vulnerability","289":" what a great read the characters are unique the writing is fantastic and the story is beautiful i laughed i cried i related i mean we all have those moments where we just want to fit in i loved the structure of the story the author kept it moving forward but also went back to fill in the gaps not only that i would wonder about a piece of maxon and sunny's story and the next segment would answer the question beautifully i just loved it and for some reason i keep thinking of the time traveler's wife they're very vaguely similar but i enjoyed this one far more mainly because i wasn't lost in anyone's time travels","290":"quirky with math and science","291":"really really good","292":"really a 3 5 this book intrigued me from the beginning but didn't steal my heart until further along truly a book where the language matters its the story of the things we do to protect what we love even when we don't understand the choices http faintingviolet wordpress com 2","293":"i'm sorry i found this book dragged for me i purchased it on audibles so i managed to slog through it the idea was interesting but i never felt connected to the characters","294":"just read it just read it it's so good it's just so good even if you tend not to like books that jump around in time this is an excellent read excellently written playfully written cuttingly endearingly amazingly i don't know what the adverb count is but who cares stephen king is a hyprocrite just read it","295":" 3 5you rise up like 'norcturn number 2 in e flat' but your notes they don't often collide in a clear constellation sometimes they are shaky at other times distorted like i had too much to drink before gazing into the stars you saved yourself properly with wondrous and simple prose examples \"when you are sitting on a three legged stool and you've kicked out all three legs but you're still sitting upright must you assume that you're so good you levitate or must you assume that you were sitting on the ground all along \" sunny imagined the house falling apart with her as the fault line maybe with maxon in space the house had given up on maintaining appearances maybe it would crumble into the earth without him without the person standing in the husband spot everything changes everything falls jenny's husband rockets to the moon the wall containing the pantry but no sound a human grows and fades in the blackness and silence inside its skin sunny had come up bald from the cradle and stayed bald through out her life she had been born at some point and at some point in the future she would die what happened in between was one long hairless episode do you understand this is humanness at its most broken down residual state this is not the flowery courageous fight fight fight that we see all to many times in 'i am difference' themed novels because this really isn't about baldness its about baldness and its effect on lives it still fits the mold though of denying mourning embracing seen in cancer hiv as well as other similarly themed novels however this is the raw emotional swan dive into the core of it the underside of affliction her life which contains a narrative she has created for herself her son her husband her future son that floats in her belly her friends as well as onlookers neighbors etc all these things must slowly collapse or all together rupture in order to recreate sunny sunny with baldness of course as in life all these things are interwoven in a multi systematic and delicate spider web this web is pulled to far apart for sunny and she reacts calmly at first but like a kettle on the stove it boils over and her emotions collide with personal needs both of hers and her husbands of dearest me did i not mention it has a rocket man in the story line more on that later i think to a certain extend this rapid change which people may confuse or may not with pacing issues mimics life when we hide ourselves and this is exposed we tend to run fast to this new formulation of ourselves the one we have been hiding so sacredly under a tight fitted veil this adolescences here and cringe a bit characters interplay off one another like pin balls in a pin ball machine they rocket off one another unpredictably and their response to sunny's physical state are both reactionary and are starkly different compared to her previous persona she is like superman without his cape a bewilderment no one wants to believe that she is like superman without his cape the same person with the same traits the same motivations the same cares the same needs and the same rocket man husband so husband a rocket man or astronaut is brilliant above brilliant and is slightly autistic or that's how the novel wants the reader to conclude he is just super smart super emotionally closed off and lacks the basic tenants of social engineering he is central to this story because as sunny find out he is important to life on earth in some very important specific ways he is also central because he is a key no more than a key he is really really important to her self discovery because after all did maxon ever hide who he was so i rave for who knows how many characters yet a 3 5 jason leathers what is wrong with you well in all its wonderfulness the ending for one gave me that earning that fault in our stars did and this is all i will say this is not a spoiler review kiddos it differentiates itself from any book that i have read in the last err two years in both its intelligence and its unique devices but is that all the baldness serves is it just a replacement for the noun cancer perhaps and this is what troubles me is her rocket husband just another device used to distract us from characters that may not develop to their potential also perhaps but the storyline is so finely tuned that it sort of kind of excuses these things so why the 3 5 well its my own self importance ignorance and hopefulness that pushed me to lower the score from a 4 to a 3 5 i hope lydia netzer that you will produce more work of equal noteworthiness and of equal originality i beg of you plead with you do not fall down the karen russell hole it's lonely down there so get your momentum galvanize your creativity and inner strength and launch another brilliant piece and if you do find yourself falling down that hole unlike with karen i'll offer a hand supporting the idea that you are only stumbling along the way and your next next novel will be as delightful as shine shine shine ie you get a pass but only one oh fuck it what am i talking about you you are a solid four a perfect example of a solid unwavering 4 0","296":" really more like 3 5 stars this book came highly recommended by a friend at first it dragged so much that i never thought i'd get through it if it weren't for the recommendation i probably would gave given up the book definitely moved quickly once it got going but it took almost 1 3 of the book to do that i also had some serious issues with the writing i felt like my middle school english teacher show don't tell the overuse of passive voice was super distracting while the book had a good message to tell i just wasn't a fan of the presentation the ending was fair good enough but overall meh","297":" this is a wonderful book populated by quirky characters who you have oh so much affection for as the story progresses from beginning to end if someone has not bought the film rights to this book that needs to happen immediately it is just perfect for the big screen sunny is a girl who was born bald and she forms a friendship in childhood with maxon a brilliant but autistic boy who is severely physically and mentally abused as a child the only reason to think that maxon's problems with concrete thinking and lack of spontaneity are genetic rather than acquired is that maxon and sunny grow up to get married and their son bubber is also autistic maxon's father beat him mercilessly when he was a boy one might say sadistically even he finds psychological and physical shelter with sunny she is his sun and his moon his stars and his everything then she gives him the ultimate gift she comes upon his father in the woods one cold winter night trapped under a log even knowing that he requires rescuing he is abusive to sunny and she does the unthinkable she leaves him there as a result he freezes to death and maxon is freed sunny and maxon are somewhere between lovers and siblings their whole life but maxon cannot see a life without sunny and so he asks her to marry him and she accepts they both know that they are both damaged in serious ways but they forge a life together the story largely takes place at the end of sunny's second pregnancy maxon is in space and sunny's mother emma is dying the story is equal parts funny wise comtemplative and sad i really loved every minute of it and i can only hope when the author writes her second book that it is this wonderful","298":"this book was not for me there was too much time jumping around and too little resolution of the story for me add in that the primary focus seemed to be about sonnys out of control spiral that all the sudden just resolves itself came across as disingenuine the first chapters were rambling paragraphs that didn't seem to make much sense and with the audio book even though i normally love joshilyn jackson put me to sleep","299":"i had a really hard time getting into this book i gave it about 50 pages it seems like a lot of people loved this book but it wasn't for me","300":" this is one of the more unusual books i have read it was a little all over the place knd of like it had adhd every time one part of the story would get uynderway it would switch to another time and place within the life events of the characters and did i mention characters oh yeah we have some of the most unusual collection of characters i've come across let's start with sunny she was born in burma during a full eclipse as a completely bald snd hairless child of missionary parents her father is arreated and executed we think and she and her mother flee to the usa with their burmeses houskeeper she grows up and meets maxon in high school who is attarcted to her because her bald head reminds him of the dome of the planetarium where he works maxon is a little a lot strange as well he is a spock like savant son of ignorant farm parents who goes to mit and wins a nobel prize they have a son nammed bubber who seems to have autism or aspergers but is probably a more evolved type of savant like his father the action takes off as a once again pregnat sunny is involved in a traffic accident and loses her wig her husband has also just been launched in a rocket to the moon to colonize it with the robots he has developed also bubber is in trouble at school and sunny's mother is in a hospital dying of cancer to make matters worse maxon's space craft has just been hit by a meteorite so everyone is coping with big issues as the story ping pongs back and forth as we lears how everyone got to their present situation the was an entertaining out of the ordinary book","301":" this is a stunning debut part love story part the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime with an outer space twist it is an intense compelling story about what it means to be human and about what it means to be different when sunny's wig went flying into a muddy puddle i cheered when the people at nasa embraced bubber's meltdown i cried i love the idea that autistic people can have happy endings too and nobel prize winning maxon was my favorite character i loved seeing his brain work which is pretty impressive since i'm totally math phobic quirky characters unique voice stellar writing this novel has it all","302":"i'm not really sure what i just read but i think i loved it this was a bizarre story but full of love and hope and weirdness and regret and beauty","303":"such an interesting book part science fiction part family drama this book is full of surprises and lovely writing i would definitely read more books by lydia netzer","304":"what are the chances of reading two amazing books in a row i love this book i had goosebumps while reading the entire last chapter this book is a poignant homage to motherhood and a coming of age story crazy enough to rival garp","305":"overall i liked this book it felt very clumsy but i could appreciate that that was a reflection on the clumsiness of the characters the husband and son were on the autism spectrum can't say reading this book changed my life but it was interesting","306":"shine shine shine by lydia netzer is one of the best and most unique novels i've read in years the characters are quirky unique damaged and compelling it is funny well paced and heartwarming i was sad to see it end in short i highly recommend shine shine shine","307":"wonderfully unusual characters contemporary fiction autism love acceptance of self and others family issues astronauts one of my favorites this year","308":"different interesting quirky smart a little hard to get in to at first but well worth the read in the end","309":"if you are like me you tend to raise an eyebrow when every review of a book mentions code words like offbeat or quirky in this case i'm glad i chose to ignore my inner snobby reader person and just pick it up and read it the offbeat characters are offbeat only on the surface deeper down they are real and finely drawn poignant story lovely read it","310":"this book is brilliant wise funny and a great read it's wholly original and it doesn't surprise me at all that it's ended up on a lot of best of lists i recommend it to friends all the time and everyone who's read it loves it too","311":"i loved this quirky love story sort of reminded me of the curious incident of the dog in the night maxon is aspergers and he is married to his childhood sweetheart who has her own issues now he's an astronaut in a space ship with problems and she is at home dealing with a dying mother an autistic son and her late pregnancy","312":"i'm not sure what exactly i feel about this book it is interesting and some of it is very inspirational but some parts are too drawn out and random","313":"incredibly unique and interesting very hard to put down never wanted it to end really feel for the characters stunning story that everyone can learn something from","314":"although i enjoyed reading this book it was not as focused as i would have liked it the storyline is somewhat dark and i could handle the touch of science fiction but i'm not a big fantasy fan it is primarily a love story and who can argue with a good love story","315":"i really liked the story the characters were odd and funny enough that i remained thoroughly engaged terri approved","316":"at its core this book is about throwing caution to the winds embracing originality and standing apart from the muted pastels of the masses and it does all of those things beautifully it's a perfect book about an imperfect love between imperfect people a stand out book about fitting in utterly original and heartfelt from cover to cover this is a book that will leave you smiling through tears running through a spectrum of thoughts and emotions with every page it's a book about shining and it does","317":"if you are looking for a unique read this is it sunny is bald her husband maxon is an astronaut and her son bubber is autistic their everyday lives are anything but ordinary even though they live in a typical suburb sunny's voice gives laughter and insight to the perils and joys of living life as a neighbor daughter mother and wife ba reference","318":" this is it if i were really returning to the classroom next week this would have been the panic point of the summer when i asked myself why i hadn't been able to find a great book to rave about to my new classes well no new classes and book found shine shine shine is a fresh other worldy tear jerking romance that illuminates the frailty of humanity sunny mann is bald from birth mother of a special needs child named bubber pregnant with her second child and married to maxim a nerdly nasa astronaut launched into space on a robot colonization mission through flashback vignette and symbolic near poetic narration netzer tells how the couple met and fell in love as fragile children and now face the fears of the future as parents there were lovely passages i wanted to copy long hand all life is binary on and off there is no middle setting alive or dead in love or not in love kissing or not kissing speaking or not speaking one choice leads to another with no forks in the road for a first novel it blew my mind made me cry and wish for that classroom of kids that i could shake this book in front of readers will be talking about this one for a while check out this snappy robot song and quirky trailer for this book","319":" i loved this book as a space nerd as a woman as a human i connected to it lydia netzer plays with the theme of what's expected of suburban women of mothers and indeed of people in general and explores it in ways you've never seen before it's a journey of self discovery for the main character sunny and i found myself coming to her realizations about life without even realizing i needed to as i am almost a wife and not yet a mother sunny's story served as almost a cautionary tale for me and a reminder that being brave means all sorts of things plus there are moon robots it's awesome","320":"wow this book is defies categorization at first found the seemingly disparate threads of the story a little jarring but once the book hit its stride i was glad i had kept reading the writing is gorgeous and the characters stayed with me long after i put the book down highly recommend","321":"so amazing what a unique and gripping storyline","322":"what is it that makes us human what is that makes us who we are different from anyone else connected to anyone else and what happens if we change these are the questions that challenge sunny mann sunny and her husband maxon have known each other for most their lives they connect to each other in ways that no one else could does becoming a mother mean that sunny has to become someone else will sunny stop being a daughter if her mother dies lydia netzer explores human bonds and how space and time and addition and subtraction change or don't those bonds don't be put off by the science fiction label this is a story that is universal in its humanity and not really about robots or space","323":"i really liked this book i am typing on an ipad which i don't love so i wont give this book a full write up this is a love story a mother's story and a truly human story about what it means to try and make your way in the world i love books with imperfect characters in this case the characters are less flawed and more quirky where the fact that the author really respects her characters","324":"i like the characters in this book but the story did not really move quickly enough for me","325":" i enjoyed every word of this netzer has a very refreshing style that is present throughout the entire novel which is in and of itself more of an absurdist commentary on the 'normality' of human life than a single sided plot to be taken seriously the characters are distinct but the more you get to know them the more they merge into a single being which is to say none of us are normal in the slightest and only those of us who can embrace that are going to be happy very much recommended a thought provoking but quick read","326":"gave up after 65 pages couldn't get into it at all hated the characters i usually try to read all of books for book club but had to abandon this one","327":"i did not finish this book i got to the point where i just didn't care about the characters and couldn't read anymore of it the book is well written but it just isn't one i could read","328":"interesting i found the book to be about coming of age of sorts and i could relate to the shedding of her wig and just becoming herself and accepting others for who they are","329":"great writing interesting content good summer read","330":"i'm not sure i quite got this book though i loved the characters especially maxon i think the overall gist is that everybody is strange alien or broken in some way and you might as well be open about whatever your particular brokenness is because hiding it doesn't make you normal it makes you even more broken i especially liked the bits about how autistic people don't need to be fixed damn straight","331":"quirky but beautiful would like to give it 3 5 stars if i could","332":"this novel is impossible to classify sci fi love story literary fiction all of the above sunny is bald loses her wig in a wreck and decides to face the world with all her imperfections her husband is a genius astronaut on the way to colonize the moon with robots her son is autistic her mother is in a coma on life support sounds crazy but these characters come together to form an absolutely riveting story of love life and what it means to be human beautiful book","333":"a peculiar type of love story focusing on a family of misfits maxon a brilliant but socially challenged scientist sunny his bald wife bubber their severely autistic son and sunny's mother with such an unusual cast of characters i really expected more it was just kind of a let down","334":"this is my new favorite love story i dog eared so many pages my grandmother would go to her grave if i lent her the book as someone recently awakening from the slumber of motherhood i treasured this story of the transformation that becoming a mother can pull down over us a caul that settles over our skin confining us and becoming our new skin at the same time i love how the narrator of this story rips through the imaginary demands of motherhood to discover its true ones and her own true self again i've never been so impressed with an author's use of the unreliable narrator that very unreliability becomes a deep statement on this strange suburban life we have invented even if we don't ourselves live it the author's revelatory portrayal of a husband and son with autism completely exploded the myth that autistic people do not feel emotion add to all this the mathematical interpretation of love and robots colonizing the moon layers of history and human betrayal and netzer has given us a spine breaking book i finished so quickly it never even made it to my currently reading shelf","335":"good little read weird emotional artistic","336":"great characters","337":"sort of a quirky story it took me a little while to get engaged in the story but i enjoyed it","338":"what a nifty quirky oddball romantic look at humanity at first i didn't like the reader but she grew on me and now i think she fully represented the characters","339":"did not get this book jumped around like crazy did not like the plot still not really sure if i understand what happened to this family in the end very confusing read","340":"very quirky and i like quirky but this was a little too much for me","341":"this really grew on me the characters are wild the writing is great the theme of trying to fit in is universal but the spin in unique jenny was no gifted designer but her husband had a bank account without a bottom with adultery and divorce beating their wings in the air she was not moved to conserve his cash","342":" i really struggled with how to review this book and how many stars to give it netzer writes with such a refreshingly whimsical style like following a beautiful butterfly flit from one gorgeous flower to the next and the story was so imaginative and so human but there were parts that felt a tiny bit off to me dialogue for instance at times felt forced and robotic and yet there were an equal number of times when it read effortlessly and as much as i wanted for all those discordant parts to sum up into one breathtaking conclusion i didn't feel that it quite got there still it came really really close overall i found the book a lovely bit of escape a beautiful story of revealing one's true self a look at how we drape ourselves with our clothes and hair and makeup houses friends and identities that aren't really us they are who we want to be seen to be and the tragedy is that some of the best parts of ourselves are those parts we often keep hidden so i'm giving shine shine shine four stars and saying bravo to netzer for a lovely message wrapped in a truly thoughtful imaginative and deeply poignant book which for a first novel is really a marvelous achievement","343":"this novel is reminiscent of one of my favorite books of all time john irving's world according to garp i fell in love with the flawed and vibrant characters of sonny maxon emma and bubber whose everyday lives are tinged with heartache and whimsy i read once that we are our most beautiful selves when we are most who we are that is one of the big takeaways from this book for me however i think each person will discover something poignant and resonant in shine shine shine","344":"the details of the story and the characters are a little quirky be willing to use your imagination and just go with it if you do you'll be treated to a book full of insights on love parenting friends and just life in general","345":" this book is about a bald woman who has been dearly loved her whole life this book is about being an unusual child and about being a parent of an unusual child this book is about living in normal house in a normal suburb with normal neighbors who are not normal this book is about love this book is about numbers and formulas and robots this book is about stretching out blissfully naked in the sun on a large comfortable rock this book is about loss and about heartbreak and about resilience this book is about a rocket ship to the moon","346":"flawed characters that grow on you inflicted upon the reader with a witty writing style and story that gains momentum didn't like that the story wasn't wrapped up until the last 2 pages and some characters were resolved in one paragraph seemed out of place when the storyline earlier meandered","347":"two outcast children who grow up together fall in love and start a family sounds familiar right trust me it isn't especially not with the addition of an uprising in burma an astronaut lost in space a hairless woman and sentient robots the characters in shine shine shine are all so weirdly wonderful you won't be able to help rooting for them even as things go horribly and hilariously wrong i wanted this book to keep going forever","348":"i'm not loving this it's getting better disappointing ending","349":"having read the synopsis of this book so long ago that i could not remember it i started reading this book with no expectations and no idea where the story was going i met sunny with her wig on and thought gag i don't like her i think i'm going to hate this book then the wig came off and the story got better and better the ending could be better though i wanted sunny's last scene to show a little more change instead she's showing something which i will not name in order not to spoil anything to her stepford friends i think she should have told them off but instead it left me feeling that she just might go back to sunny with the wig on and i don't like that sunny","350":" in shine shine shine lydia netzer's latest cerebral fantasy we become privy to the powerful secrets that lie in the heart of a bustling metropolis and the dark purpose that surges through the very concrete it was poured from our unnamed protagonist the pilot of a network news chopper begins noticing strange obviously intended shapes in the layout of the city while making his daily rounds high above soon he finds himself enveloped in arduous research attempting to unravel the secrets of the city's arcane design one evening while studying the enigmatic constructs via unauthorized chopper flight he spies an esoteric ceremony atop one of the nameless metropolis' crowning structures his following days are riddled with a series of ominous threats and terrifying coincidences he soon takes to the obscure alleys and forgotten corridors of a city seemingly bent on unraveling in search of the answers that could free an entire civilization however he's hounded all the while by a faceless society that will stop at nothing to keep their secrets from his grasp never has a better tale of nocturnal aviation and architectural conspiracy been enscribed than this brave outing from one of contemporary fantasy's brightest rising stars lydia netzer highly recommended","351":"started off great and intriguing but i lost interest","352":"shine x3 is an unusual but ultimately remarkable book the characters are quirky but likable and you find yourself routing for them in the end the descriptions of the autistic son allow us to imagine parenting him his father is no less unusual appearing to be an awkward savant in engineering there are no words to describe this book it allows us to see ourselves differently and challenges our views of others it's a fast and engaging read","353":"i was pleasantly surprised had some substance i didn't think all the oddities would work being born bald in burma father murdered mother dying husand on the moon pregnant saved by creepy les oh autistic son wow she tied it all together nicely","354":" this book is a difficult book to review i think i like it and the more i think about it the more i like it stylistically it is unusual sort of a clipped series of ruminations from the quirky main characters sunny a wealthy suburban housewife who hides her congenital baldness from her very conventional friends and maxon her astronaut aspergers husband who sees human interactions as mathematical equations the plot is unusual way...way out there literally...part of it takes place in outer space the reader is bounced through time and space but basically we confront the themes of love and acceptance also there's a really hot love scene that doesn't involve robots enough said","355":"i would rate this book between 3 u0026amp 4 stars i found the story line to be somewhat confusing at the beginning of the book but it made more sense to me by the time i finished the book it is a touching love story on many levels love of youth love between mother and child and love of adult child and parent the more i contemplate the book the more i like it","356":" lydia netzer weaves a fascinating story in shine shine shine i was hooked throughout most of the book and kept thinking what is she about to do to my emotions the characters were a little odd almost to the point of excess in some parts but i wasn't ready to leave them quite yet when i finished the book i give the book a 3 because i felt like it started a little slow and took me a while to get into it it also ended pretty abruptly and seemed to have been tied too tightly in a nice little bow not everything works out just the way it's supposed or you want it to i found myself built up to some tragic conclusion or romantic for that matter and then not knowing what to do with all that emotion in the end","357":"this is a book that i originally started listening to on my mp3 and i did not like it however reading it was an entirely different experience i loved the sustained metaphors the author used i liked the quirky characters i look forward to netzer's next book","358":"this book was really imaginative and at times i really enjoyed it but other times it left me cold the plot didn't necessarily go anywhere and by the end i just wanted to be done with it","359":"hmm this was my second attempt and i did finish it that said there is a whole chunk of my life that i will never get back i have to say that i had no strong feelings either positive or negative towards the main characters which is fundamental to me if i am going to invest time into a book at times i felt like there was a solid path and then it would disappear lacklustre and one dimensional","360":"i've felt like i need to share with everyone that i've been reading this book it is tremendously uncomfortable and absolutely wonderful every time i've described it everything came out wrong but i'll try once more a socially inept but brilliant astronaut and his socially brilliant misdirected and very bald wife break each other apart and put each other back together also robots are important that's the best i can do","361":"i'm sure this is a good book if it's your kind of thing sadly it wasn't mine i kept going for a bit over 100 pages but wasn't interested enough to carry on sorry","362":"good did not quite reach great for me the ending just kind of snuck up","363":"quirky love story for thinking people tore through it to the end an enjoyable christmas holiday read","364":"i've never read a story quite like this one it is a new narrative that will stay with you","365":" i almost never pick up books on a whim but i was in a bookshop and saw this and just bought it i'm glad i'd never heard of it before had no idea how many stars it had received or whether anyone i knew liked it some books are best jumped into with no warm up it's an odd pickle this novel much like the protagonists it doesn't fit in anywhere it's described as a little bit romance a little bit sci fi but those descriptions really don't work lydia netzer is just writing way outside the box on this one which is fantastic power to her it's not going to work for a lot of readers but worked for me i loved the strangeness -- though on occasion i did feel left behind in the wake struggling to keep up with netzer's crazy brain my husband asked me to describe the book to him and at first i was like burma baldness autism robots space which was not helpful but then i settled on this it's a book about identity and isolation it's about fitting in and how none of us ever quite do and it's about how our weirdness does double duty isolates and identifies we can't be individuals without it but our quirks will always prevent us from sinking into the sea of unanimity we're not supposed to want to be like everyone else but even the most hardened individualist wants just a little bit to be seen as part of a tribe don't they","366":"once when he was in europe during a summer in college he had been following the tour de france running with the riders up the mountains dressed as darth vader shouting \"allez allez allez math space and messy motherhood","367":"thoughtful provoking love story","368":"i wanted to give this book 4 stars but kept coming back to 3 the message of this book is that there is no normal life is messy but still worthwhile and beautiful","369":"this book is a fascinating onion layer upon layer of story i couldn't stop until i finished it highly recommended","370":"i wasn't sure if i liked it but it was very interesting and different and i couldn't put it down so i gave it 4 stars although sunny is a mom i couldn't relate to her or her life in any aspect yes i want to be perfect but like another reviewer said the characters are so extreme that i must be pretty normal also i don't understand why sunny's baldness wasn't identified as it sounds very much like the hereditary condition of alopecia i have a friend with this condition anyway i do recommend this book as an interesting read if you want to give your usual styles break","371":"i really wanted to like this one but found it to be pretty awkward glad i read it but not sure i could recommend it","372":"did not like as much as i expected to 2 75","373":"if there is one book you need to place on your summer reading list shine shine shine by lydia netzer is that book it's a love story it's a math story it's sci fi it's one helluva read on the surface everything in our heroine's life is picture perfect it's smooth and glossy but scratch the surface and you find all the doubts the hidden secrets and the explosions about to happen i was entranced by sunny's life her life and that of her husband maxon drew me in and refused to let me be until i had devoured the book","374":"idiosyncratic heartfelt with fascinating characters great work","375":"what a beautiful and very distinctive story","376":"i loved shine shine shine in fact it is possibly the best book i've read in 2013 having said that it's not for everyone definitely quirky but it's a beautiful funny love story intelligently written i would read it again just to have my heart feel full","377":"i love this book","378":"weirdly wonderful to borrow a phrase thanks lauren the story ricochets around and never gets stagnate i started it because of the location norfolk va my hometown but got completely hooked in netzer's amazing narrative and couldn't put it down til the very end can't wait to read more of this new author's work","379":"this book was just okay i did care about the characters but something was missing i thought it was interesting how she subtly kept comparing humans to robots i wasn't very entertained though","380":"shine shine shine is written in a peculiar way it was written in a different style than i am used to so that kept me reading there are brilliant pages of for lack of a better word description i got a bit tired of reading through those and wanted something to happen the end came so suddenly i was left with all these questions","381":"i wasn't sure about this book at first it is set in my current town written by a local author so i pressed on and am glad i did the characters are eccentric to be sure but if you can get over the outlandishness of their personal struggles or view them as more glaring representatives of each of our own personal quirks the story has a lot to offer it asks questions about being yourself and conforming about parenthood love and friendship the answers aren't tidy and it leaves a bit of room for digging for meaning and discussion","382":"3 7 good book very unique story line well written i think there were a lot of analogies that were deeper than i thought would be interesting to read a commentary on","383":"quirky and ultimately touching","384":"i listened to this book on cd after i won it from the author i liked it a lot and enjoyed the quirky story i found it difficult to follow at times and am not sure if that is because i listened to it every time i got in my car even for a 5 minute drive it made me love listening to books on cd but i wanted to feel more engaged in the story","385":"the book was interesting filled with quirky characters and thought provoking ideas it should be a good book club discussion but i can only give the book three stars at it just didn't grab me and pull me in to the story","386":"great offbeat book","387":"this seemed to be a book that was forced into a sci fi category the whole thing could have been much more meaningful if the husband was doing any other kind of inaccessible engineering type occupation rather than being part of a mission to mars it just seemed to detract from the story not a bad book the audiobook narrator uses an immature girl voice for this character i really think that the character would be better served with another voice","388":"very interesting insight into genius autism being different i found this first novel quite thought provoking","389":"in the beginning it took me a while to identify with the characters but once the story got going i did not want to put it down women's fiction family drama love story and a little sci fi wonderfully unique intense compelling characters","390":"i didn't understand this book at all it made no sense and didn't even have an ending","391":"at the opening of the novel i thought i was going to hate it sunny seemed to be the antithesis of everything that i believe it she seemed snobby and shallow however the unique writing style of the author drew me in and as sunny's layers were peeled back i realized that she was just like me just like me this book is a must read for the suburban misfit mom struggling between being herself and fitting in so that her children can fit in full review at http theinsomniacbibliophile blogsp","392":" not an ordinary tale this story lets us in on the inside lives of very different people trying to live their lives the best they can it approaches autism and its various disorders and shows it to be just another facet of the human character integrating one's quirks into society is difficult for many the characters in shine shine shine do it each in their own way allowing us to watch the tragedies and triumphs that they go through in dealing with their disabilities and achievements the conclusion is uplifting and i cheered to know that all ends well in its own way","393":"on the surface i would not expect to be engaged with this book it's got some weird premise stuff going on but looking at the deeper meanings and the joy and understanding and appreciation of the autistic spectrum brings depth and a reality that might not exert itself in a more predictable story line","394":" a strange story with some glaring gaps but captivating despite all that a genius with a troubled childhood maxon mann is headed to the moon in a rocket leaving his bald pregnant wife sunny butcher behind on earth together with their autistic son as family histories are excavated and relived maxon and sunny find themselves reaffirming their love for each other through a series of both hyper logical and deliberately non logical acts and what a funny impersonal kind of love it is kind of like when you step out of your own skin and find that your chosen other half is an alien but you can't help but be moved by him anyway","395":" i got this book from the library because joshilyn jackson author of \"a grown up kind of pretty\" recommended it highly on her website after hearing so many good things about it i really wanted to like this book in the end i thought it was ok but i'm glad i borrowed a copy instead of shelling out my money for the hardback version the main character of the book is sunny at the start of the story sunny is pregnant with her second child and her big secret is that she was born with a condition that made her completely hairless - she is bald but she also has no eyelashes eyebrows or hair anywhere else on her body when sunny had her first baby she began wearing wigs because she decided she could not be bald and be a mother wearing the wig became part of her \"mom\" persona but sunny realizes that the mom wearing a wig is not who she really is sunny spends the rest of the novel trying to figure out if she can be her true self mom and maxon's wife all at the same time maxon sunny's husband either has autism or asperger's it's never stated clearly and he is a mathematical and engineering genius nasa has chosen him to go on a mission to the moon i liked maxon's character and i thought netzer's way of describing his thinking in code if teacher nagging then head nodding loop until teacher quiet was interesting maxon is on the rocket for the mission for the entire story - we only see him interact with sunny through flashbacks the main theme that netzer emphasized throughout the story is that no one is really \"normal \" we all have our secrets the problem i had with this message isn't that i don't agree with her the problem was that the secrets sunny finds out about other people her mother maxon's parents a neighbor were so bizarre that i just didn't buy it i know that lots of people live with extraordinary circumstances but i don't believe that everyone i know is sitting on a bombshell like these characters were another issue i had was how this book jumped around in time in flashbacks the characters are newly weds toddlers new parents high school kids etc i've read books where authors used this technique to gradually bring you into an awesome conclusion in this book it felt disjointed and clunky and half the time i wasn't sure what netzer was trying to tell me or prepare me for maybe i'll reread this in a few years and see something in it that i didn't this time around but for now this book was not my favorite","396":"this wonderful short novel about a boy and girl who grow up together each nourishing the unlikely other the boy and eventual man is a brilliant scientist with serious interpersonal difficulties due to his strange nature those of us in the helping professions might call it aspergers syndrome the girl woman is different in her own special way having alopecia a wonderful portrayal of her accepting her condition and even glorifying in it until she hits middleclass america the ending moved in a little too quickly and neatly but this is the author's first novel i'll be watching for more from her","397":" difficult to sum up but let's give it go a love story the horror and joy of trying not to be like one's parents then realizing you are exactly like them but not the wonderful state of being the weirdo and the perils of trying to pretend to be normal false fronts and conditions like autism that won't allow you to be who you aren't colonizing the moon with robots a space mission that goes awry buried secrets already forgiven losing one's identity to motherhood the fears of being a bad parent warping yourself for someone else or an ideal wrapping yourself around another person's needs because of love and well a half dozen other things quirky makes it sound light simply written makes it sound boring my library even put a science fiction sticker on the spine which shows you how hard this novel is to classify check it out","398":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here hm i know i'm not the first to say i'm not real sure what to say about this book nor am i the first to say that it is very unique and of course like so many others that is something i really like about this book however the synopsis i originally read did not do me any justice because the book i read didn't follow through as interesting in terms of pace sure the characters are very interesting and i love the overall story of their nerd love i'm a bit of a nerd myself so i liked her incl hm i know i'm not the first to say i'm not real sure what to say about this book nor am i the first to say that it is very unique and of course like so many others that is something i really like about this book however the synopsis i originally read did not do me any justice because the book i read didn't follow through as interesting in terms of pace sure the characters are very interesting and i love the overall story of their nerd love i'm a bit of a nerd myself so i liked her inclusion of equations and descriptions of their strange interactions with each other this book was great in the sense that it highlighted a relationship that you don't see all the time if ever and is not one you're going to get to see behind the curtain so to speak in real life that said to say the book is sci fi and about astronauts and space is very misleading this may give the reader the sense that this is really a book about going into space in a more active sense than what really occurs maxxon the husband who may be autistic is a genius who goes into space but those scenes are very muted and not very interesting instead you end up feeling like the story is more about sunny and more about their relationship than anything to do with maxon colonizing the moon using his super robots it's kind of like those previews you see for movies with a lot of crazy cgi then when you watch the movie you find out that all the good parts were in those previews and there was little more to witness to cut my review short i think this book would have been better served being a novella rather than a 336 page novel although i read the kindle edition i don't ever consciously quit a book otherwise i would have given up reading this for me seemed to take forever and i couldn't wait to stop to be honest then when the book did come to an end there was really no conclusion and certainly not a climax i don't know if she plans a sequel to this but no offense i wasn't interested enough to read another installment like this way too drawn out there were many many scenes that held my attention and i did like sunny quite a bit and lydia is a good writer but the story rambles on a lot to where those scenes and moments that got my attention quickly get worn out and this happens a lot what happened to me as well was that there's so much going on in this story with the characters' personal lives which is really well developed and the flashbacks to their childhood together that you wind up waiting and waiting to reach a peak or for the story to turn and twist and do something more than just be interesting and unique you wait for something to happen and it never really does so i loved the ingredients of this book but the overall recipe was very watered down without much punch or kick even though we get teased into thinking their will be even from a romantic sense nothing is delivered what does sunny's new baby really look like is she bald like sunny does maxxon ever make it home is bubber their autistic son better off his medication overall does he improve now that sunny has gone on to stop wearing her wig will she stop trying to be the cliche perfect housewife will she and maxon's relationship grow and blossom now do these characters grow what happens with les weathers now that we see he was losing his mind a bit does maxon give up his dream to colonize the moon i ask these but unless a sequel was written very differently i couldn't bear this again to want to find out took too long when i have so many other things to do the flashbacks are insightful but also drawn out and there isn't really too much extra to gain from them other than the couple's backstory which is well put together touching unique sometimes i liked reading this a lot of times it felt super slow and not worth the time unique story for sure too long interesting original characters too much time in their head great idea i don't think it was executed as well as it could be but from a technical stand point it was written pretty good thanks elpy more","399":"sunny maxon and bubber make up a family that is anything but ordinary with a science fiction element this first novel explores family relationships both the parts within our control and those without sunny's epiphany makes the remainder of the story an adventure in compassion and personal strength i was completely overwhelmed by her resilience to painful truths it is truly a shining debut from a gifted new writer i look forward to lydia netzer's next book","400":"annoyingly weird but also intriguing","401":"pretty intense and moving stuff despite what at first seems a distancing style a sort of mix of barbara kingsolver and philip k dick at one point it looks like it might be about teaching a robot to cry but don't worry that doesn't actually happen","402":" one of the previews used the word funny in it's description it's not it's touching story about characters who don't fit in and how they manage their lives what do we have to do or give up to be true to ourselves sunny and maxon are both eccentric in their own way with a child who is autistic maxon is an astronaut and in space sunny is pregnant with child number 2 her mother is dying we learn about their complicated backgrounds and why they are who they are today the writing is wonderful you'll want to reread many paragraphs to take in the beautiful language and emotion it's a great read","403":" color me unimpressed for the most part this seemed right up my alley geeks galore thinking in code and quirky as all hell there are parts which are truly great but overall it doesn't hang very well maxon and sunny are the ultimate misfit couple he's a nobel prize winner but a complete loser socially he connects only with sunny whose main quirk is that she was born bald they have a child bubber who is autistic now sunny is pregnant again maxon is in a rocket going toward the moon bubber is acting up and sunny's mother emma is in the hospital with cancer in the middle of this mess sunny gets into an accident and loses her wig quirky plot yes endearing in a way cookie characters check sad back story oh yes so what's wrong the language for one thing it's fun and cutesy for the first two chapters but it gets very irritating very fast the mother did not die the mother lived the mother breathed in and out but first she did not die so on and so forth it's like netzer had verbal diarrhea all over the page she takes way too many words to explain a single simple thing it sort of works when she's with maxon maxon is weird that way but with sunny and with her mother the language feels beyond awkward the over emphasis on the hair sunny's bald good lord yes we get it she starts wearing a wig when she gets pregnant for the first time because she thinks it's something she has to do to be a mom after that it's like she's worn blinkers on her damn self she doesn't even believe her mother is dying even when she's repeatedly told that the decent thing to do would be to get her off life support similarly with her son she keeps putting him on various drugs even though maxon is firmly against it she wants normal for her son and then she loses her wig and the blinkers magically come off the very next day she takes her son out of his school takes him off his meds and takes her mother off life support i don't believe that a wig could be the cause for so much life altering decisions and there is no paragraph that goes without mention being made of her being bald or of her wig your mother is dying your son has issues your husband is in space what do you talk of the rejections you might face because of your recent hairlessness and this does not stop aaargh get over it already lady i did not like sunny she wasn't consistent she was one thing in all her flash backs with maxon but an entirely different thing in present time we're supposed to believe the change is the wig tough to swallow but i did love maxon he was such a gem although it's a bad thing that he has this switch in his head called love sunny he has it at on and he has it duct taped and marked do not touch pity this means we have to sadly sit through sunny's bullshit about her fucking hair","404":"i didn't really get this book i expected to like it more than i did i did come to love the character of maxon but not as much his wife sunny there were a few good surprises in the story but it still just didn't quite do it for me and of course i hated the ambiguous ending","405":" sunny butcher was born in burma during a total solar eclipse and she was born with no hair anywhere on her body she grows up in the u s with maxon mann as her best friend they end up getting married maxon is a robotics specialist and an astronaut maxon is on a mission to colonize the moon with robots leaving sunny at home with her mother on life support her autistic son bubber being a challenge to manage all while being pregnant with her second child this information is given within the first 2 pages so i don't feel like i'm giving anything away shine shine shine is sunny's story and it ended up being quite interesting my first reaction was that sunny's situation was a bit unbelievable but as the story progressed i changed my mind this is a well written book with great characters and i ended up liking it quite a bit","406":"i really liked this weird book i liked the protagonist's otherness her mixed feelings about wanting to fit in and not fitting in and not wanting to afterall her feelings of tenderness and annoyance towards her asperger's characterized robot inventing husband made sense too the whole book is focused on a short period of time a couple of weeks i think that are an intensely emotional time bringing up past events and ranging from the suburban home turf to burma where sunny was born not your typical novel","407":"i was on the 3 4 star fence with this one i settled on 3 because the ending was a little 'meh' for me otherwise it was a fun interesting read","408":"read a hard copy and listened to the audio book which features a few of lydia netzer's rock n roll songs at the end","409":"i would give this book 3 5 stars if i could moments of beauty certainly but i had a very difficult time getting into the characters i wanted to like it much more than i did","410":"this book finished ok but it took me soooo long to get there that ok means 2 stars","411":"i'm only giving this a 2 because i finished it i did not like this book i did not hate this book i did hate the main character sunny i have to admit that at the end of the book i was really pulling for her to die i will not be seeking out any other books by this author nor would i recommend this book to anyone i found it over the top weird","412":"so imaginative and well written","413":"this book continually sprinkles its story with memories and anecdotes from the characters' pasts eventually this gave me enough background to empathize with their modern plight but getting there took a long time a completely bald pregnant and lovely young mother awakens to the masquerade she's been making of her life this happens while her genius millionaire socially awkward husband is on a rocket bound for the moon he's going to start a robot colony there simultaneously her mother is dying of cancer and her young autistic son has been declared too difficult for his school terrific themes of being true to one's self strength in the face of adversity and embracing our differences colorful and sometimes funny but slow to develop","414":"so many people gave this book stellar reviews that i feel pressured to do the same however sometimes i just felt lost with this book like i wasn't smart enough to read it but in the end the story was charming sad and eye opening into what it is like to be different i would recommend this to anyone who wants a different kind of love story","415":"this was an ok book the beginning really hooks the reader but as the story goes along it did not keep me hooked","416":" a great book u0026amp even more impressive for being this author's debut what really impressed me u0026amp kept me completely interested was the unique story it's not a story you've read dozens of times before u0026amp the characters are not characters you've read elsewhere it took me a while to warm up to sunny because i found her a little bit selfish at first but warm up i did u0026amp maxon was even more to my liking there was such an innocence to this character u0026amp as the story unfolds i grew to like him u0026amp sunny together there was a sense that no one belonged together more than these two u0026amp that is how it should be for a book that boasts a strong love story at its core i especially liked the back stories u0026amp the tale of how sunny u0026amp maxon came into each other's lives u0026amp became integral to each other space being the backdrop of the story was a nice touch as well the book had a bit of science a bit of sadness family secrets u0026amp love love love","417":"humoan comedy love story autistic savant astronaut engineer falls in love with bald girl childhood friend","418":"this book genuinely took me by surprise both with its plot turns and this unexplainable sense of newness beyond that this book was emotionally in touch in a real way and made me think about being human in a closer way than my comfort level allows i can't wait to read more books from this new author and see what else she has to offer netzer sneaks up on you and steals your robot heart","419":"i got so bored with this book i just returned it to the library and never even finished","420":"i get it no one is really normal but i just didn't like the style of writing","421":"new and different and i love the characters could have used more robots though","422":"the book was interesting characters well developed story line dealt with unique individuals of today and visualized a future world different from most sci fi wish the last chapter had been developed more","423":"this is such a strange book it's incredibly ambitious one that has been well reviewed and one that i didn't connect with at all i love the idea behind it the way that everyone is trying their best to be normal even though they all have their very obvious impediments against normalcy maxon and bubber are both autistic although maxon wasn't diagnosed and sunny is bald from the moment sunny and maxon decided to have a baby sunny begins a huge campaign for normalcy she starts wearing a wig she teaches maxon how to interact with people or more accurately continues to teach him and even makes sure that they have the right house and the right car but i didn't connect with any of the characters and even when there were plot twists or danger i didn't quite care about any of it again though everyone else seems to love this book so it's highly possible the fault is mine","424":"i totally did not like this book it's not written poorly but the plot is just boring i keep reading and hoping that it would get better and it didn't i felt not connection to any of the main characters and in fact really found them unlikeable just not a good read glad a friend let me borrow their advance copy so i could save my money","425":"beautifully written with much wisdom poignant but still misses at points reminds me of conversations with women who keep up appearances covering dark depths a bit too odd at points though","426":"listened to this as an audiobook i enjoyed it so much with all the dimensions of each of the characters and while i didn't love the narrators voice she handled all the characters so well the order in which the events were retold were compelling and added greatly to the book in my opinion","427":"i loved that this novel takes place in my backyard literally the author created characters who make you care what happens to them and a plot that doesn't quit","428":"the underlying theme of this unique book is to be true to yourself you will never be happy trying to live your life based on the expectations of others","429":"this was a weird and wonderful book i'm looking forward to the author's next effort","430":" i adored netzer before i ever read her one of my friends e mailed me her blog post 10 best marriage vows you never hear at weddings shortly before i wrote mine my husband and i without having seen each others prior to the ceremony both promised to clarify our expectations and make sure i ate well and often to avoid fights in light of that article this book wasn't what i expected but that's what i enjoyed most about it there is a sweet spirit of whimsy to the story without it being too fantastical to appreciate i adored sunny and max's love story and the way in which birth math and space were connected","431":"this really not my typical type of book the characters are weird and the setting is strange but i really enjoyed it it pulls you in with its uniqueness and makes you wonder about what going on and you find as you keep reading and learn a little more that you start to care just little by little it is a great lesson of learn to be yourself and forget what others call normal","432":" touted as a modern love story i really enjoyed this story about a modern relationship and the questions raised about what is considered normal human interaction maxon is a savant a genius working for nasa that has built robots to mine moon rock and create a self sustaining colony on his way to the moon he's trying to work out why other people think robots and humans are so different he has created robots that can laugh a complete loss of control as their senses are heightened he can create robots that dream just a string of random data created in off mode he has even created robots who can create new robots without human assistance meanwhile on earth his wife sunny is trying to cope with their son's autism and what the right course or action to take is as well as her own identity and the future of their unborn child the majority of the story is told in flashback how sunny and maxon ended up together and i was moved by maxon's complete dedication to sunny even though he may interact with humans differently than what is considered normal sunny's motivation in the relationship is more of dependence on maxon's consistency than what someone would consider traditional love it left me with a lot of things to ponder and i enjoyed the story so well i finished it in one day a rare feat for me","433":"this book was weirdly wonderful the storytelling and characters are so different from anything i've read recently that it was a breath of fresh air i fell in love with maxon and could certainly relate to sunny's strive for perfection it was also interesting to read a book that takes place in norfolk written by a local author one of the best of 2012 no question","434":" i thought i would love love love this based on the blurb but it fell a little short of awesome for me i enjoyed the author's fluid prose and found the characters to be well developed i loved bubber what i didn't love pacing and plotting the back stories were so jumbled to me i wanted them to be in order i think i could have made better sense of everything if they were maybe that is just my personal downfall as a reader also i was really tired on a 12 hr plane ride and trying to read this if i was sitting on my couch by a fire i might have appreciated it more","435":"enjoyed reading about maxon an unusual character and his hought processes as well as his relationship with sunny since they were first children called to mind w heights in some ways","436":"to be honest i had a little trouble getting into the book when i read the first chapter so i gave up on it for a while then i heard the audible com version read by one of my faroritest authors joshilyn jackson and i absolutely fell in love with it this book is better than relationship therapy for any women lucky enough to be coupled with a man who is more like maxon than mr darcy","437":"very interesting messy characters who make big mistakes but then repent i like sunny very much","438":" it's been weeks since i finished lydia netzer's shine shine shine i'm usually someone who sets fingers to keys immediately after finishing a novel wanting to capture my thoughts before they escape but something about this one felt different i had to process i just couldn't talk about it immediately and i'm still not sure i can this novel is memorable complicated engrossing at times it's very bizarre and frustrating at other moments it feels transcendent and incredibly lovely during the audio experience narrated by joshilyn jackson -- woo there were boring points at which i wanted to abandon the novel especially when maxon was the focus but then we'd come back to earth back to sunny and i couldn't believe i'd ever wanted to leave these characters so what is shine shine shine about family first and foremost the one we create for ourselves maxon and sunny mann share many of the same struggles as other couples with an autistic son and complicated intertwined past their lives are far from perfect -- though sunny desperately wishes it were so born with a condition that prevents her from growing any hair bald and beautiful mrs mann has worked to hide her \"real\" identity behind gorgeous flowing wigs in adulthood but as maxon an astronaut also on the autistic spectrum heads into space being left alone with bubber -- and the accompanying crash from her perfect bubble world -- is eye opening the story is about so much more than that of course but that's the jist netzer has created two vivid faceted and difficult characters in sunny and maxon at times hard to like but often easy to love i was drawn into the pair's love story -- which stretches back to childhood -- and entranced by the white picket fence sunny worked to construct she's crippled with anxiety about her baldness forced by a loving mother to embrace this \"flaw\" in her youth but she can't stand the thought of being an outcast in virginia where the manns move with bubber or of being his strange bald mother with maxon's brilliance but social difficulties and sunny's own sense of \"otherness \" the pair could be an easy target for their neighbors in norfolk but sunny works hard to let few get a peek inside their family the wig stays intact until it doesn't did i like this story yes i think i did i didn't love it because somehow i could never completely engage with the scientific side of maxon's story as a noted scientist and head of a robotics unit planning to colonize the moon he's just so clinical this is to be expected of course -- and i appreciated the points netzer makes about life humanity and death maxon's character is the opposite of sunny who lives up to her name she's bright effusive active i loved when she was the focus of the story but maxon in space bleh so boring but that's just me if you're a fan of offbeat contemporary fiction stories of modern families or someone interested in space and human dynamics and the frailty of it all and who isn't eh shine shine shine is an entertaining quirky read i'd recommend to those looking for something a little bit different","439":"i really enjoyed this book sunny butcher is a character that doesn't come around too often she is flawed and smart and damaged and clear i didn't know anything about this novel before i started so glad i found it","440":" shine shine shine lydia netzer music by the virginia janes on the last cd \"it's hard to describe what shine shine shine is about the story itself is fairly simple protagonist sunny bald since birth and pregnant with her second child is awaiting the slow and agonizing death of her mother from cancer while her husband maxon a robotics scientist is rocketing to the moon to help set up the first lunar colony sunny is struggling with her responsibilities as a mother and daughter in the absence of her husband and having a hard time figuring out where things in her life went wrong netzer gives us various perspectives the narrative shifts from sunny in virginia to maxom in space to their 4 year old autistic son bubber who inhabits a world of his own these are quirky original characters who quickly get under your skin sunny is at once self conscious about her baldness and ecstatically proud of it maxom recognizes himself in bubber and fights against his wife and the doctors who are medicating the boy to make him more normal and bubber himself is lost and found at the same time a confusing mix of brilliance and social ineptness these are real people i loved them all ultimately netzer's message is two fold first things happen as netzer writes other people's cars are like meteors sometimes they smash into you and there's nothing you can do about it this is life it's hard but it's true second we are all flawed we let each other down we do the wrong things and we fail again and again this too is life and the only thing to do is keep on living shine shine shine is a beautifully written story about what it means to be human with all our craziness all our inconsistencies and all of our helplessness against a world over which we have no control what sunny learns is that living isn't about overcoming those things but about embracing them owning them and making them a part of who we are \"","441":" i truly struggled with this book it was well written with full detail and quite honestly maybe above my pay grade as a reader i sought out this book due to the son having autism and the reviews from previous readers i was not equipped to handle the robotic lingo equations and depth of understanding needed to finish this book at the end i was left with endless questions of what had happened and why it ended with no true ending in sight the author did a splendid job allowing the reader to see through the eyes of an adult with autism i enjoyed her rendering of the true human spirit of wanting to belong and placating ourselves to fit in among others when maxon met sunny he was seven years four months and eighteen days old or he was 2693 rotations of the earth old maxon was different sunny was different they were different together","442":"it took me about 50 pages to get the hang of this book and then i fell in love with it","443":"this book left me very confused the chapters jump back and forth between different narrators it's not hard to follow since they all have distinct voices and it was a great story but at the end i found myself asking so how does that all tie together i felt like the ending just sort of dropped off","444":" an interesting premise the hero of our story is maxon a young millionaire genius robot builder who has minimally aspberger's syndrome but who may fairly be placed on the autism spectrum and who is as the book opens in a spacecraft trying to land his latest generation of robots on the moon where they will build themselves a home his bald and pregnant wife sunny is having a chat and a glass of wine with her two closest girlfriends while max approaches the moon sunny and maxon's young son bubber is autistic he is in special school wears a helmet and takes lots of medication as part of sunny's desperate program to make him normal sunny starts to wear a wig and dictate social goings on in her expensive neighborhood she and maxon begin to grow apart and before he leaves for space sunny berates him for not being normal and preventing their family from being normal in flashbacks we follow sunny in burma with her mother emma and her missionary scientist father when sunny's father is rounded up and killed by the despotic regime his widow emma returns to magical western pennsylvania to raise sunny there she first meets maxon and decides to rescue him from his depraved family in the process the hairless but otherwise intact sunny becomes permanently attached to maxon emma belatedly realizes that they are a couple and wants better for sunny so she makes sure that they attend colleges as far apart as possible maxon at mit becomes a nobel prize winner and sunny in california a very successful artist making wigs that are not intended to be worn of course they reconnect and marry as the book opens it's years later and sunny maxon and their son bubber live in a perfect home in a perfect neighborhood in virginia emma is dying in a nearby hospital and maxon has left her to go to the moon so that his robots can build a colony for themselves and for humans there and as sunny worries about her last angry words to maxon endures her mother's final days and prepares for a new baby she reevaluates what her life has become although the plot is threadbare when you remove the setting and special circumstances of the characters the book is fresh and funny the dialogue between sunny and maxon is worth the price of admission and then there's the deadly description of the local news anchorman there are lots of larger issues raised for book club discussion and interesting asides about say western pennsylvania i loved it but i'm a sucker for books about people who march to a different drummer as it were","445":"loved it makes me want to start reading sic fi again more regularly","446":"such a sweet book i enjoyed every moment rare is there such a book that is modern and fun and makes you think but not in a sad way after reading the age of miracles this book works well with a hopefulness needed today","447":"interesting and at times beautiful style great character development for the husband maxon clever chronology but none of these things can save this novel from a boring protagonist sunny's baldness was not an effective metaphor nor did it endow her character with any interesting traits other than a constant irritating self consciousness maybe i'd understand her character better if i was a mother i don't know disappointing overall considering the hype around it","448":" extremely interesting concept and great different writing style i have only one complaint about the book the main character is a woman who is bald and remains bald not the problem the author says that no one knows why or how but alopecia is a known rare disorder the problem for me is i know about it so i spent the whole book thinking in my head it's alopecia didn't she do research ok but good things the characters are real and interesting the story line is not a mixture of what is going on in the moment and flashbacks and the writing style is unique and great","449":"kind of an odd book i didn't really get it plus i hated the ending it really bothers me when there are loose ends at the end of a novel i'm the type of person who needs closure i didn't get that with this book the characters were all strange","450":"very different than i expected not relatable and yet very relatable i really enjoyed it","451":"lydia netzer does something brave with the beginning of shine shine shine she opens the book with a man in a spaceship a spaceship says science fiction but this isn't a science fictional story at all it's a story about a family trying to live a normal earthbound life when none of the members are quite suited to the world they've found themselves in the jacket copy and various descriptions i've read for this novel give too much away in my opinion so here's a spoiler free version the man in the spaceship is maxon a robotics expert on a nasa mission to the moon where he's going to set up robots that will construct a colony where humans can eventually live back on earth is maxon's pregnant wife sunny and their four year old autistic son sunny has worked hard to build a perfect life for their family in their ritzy virginia suburb but while maxon is away the careful facade of normalcy begins to crack i loved this book the characters are wonderful complex and deeply individual much of the story is about not fitting in and the various ways people either try to fit in or try not to care another significant part of the plot is the history of sunny and maxon's relationship and i found their geek love story very appealing and romantic shine shine shine is a little on the weird side which i consider a plus but i think it will appeal to anyone who likes reading about family relationships","452":"book club pick overall consensus including mine is that was a weird book weird characters weird story some disturbing scenes some creepy sex and a lot of overall weirdness we get the deeper meaning about being yourself and bald in front of people rather than showing a facade and we get that motherhood requires sacrifices but we were unmoved","453":"the staccato writing style fit the story but grated a bit also i felt like the huge revelations about each of the characters emma's secret the meaning behind sunny's fake burma story were rushed as was the ending","454":"a novel with odd and sometimes grotesque characters that are broken in ways that we all are the main character sunny is a woman born with a medical condition that makes her hairless and her baldness is used to great effect as a metaphor as her wig is something like a fig leaf in eden covering her real self it serves as a buffer to the real world of her autistic son's problems her husband's cold logic and distance her mom's impending death her fear surrounding her pregnancy at one point she says she knows her house is in ruin but i don't know that she ever quite confronts her idol respectability in a poignant scene a neighbor confesses a sin to her and describes it as her baldness and says that all her other neighbors have it too in that moment she confirms for sunny our shared fallen humanity lydia netzer's novel is thoughtful and realistic and her empathy for these people is evident","455":"highly recommend this book i fell in love with sunny her husband and bubber even emma wanted to finish the book but hated for it to end what brave people","456":"an odd love story peopled with odd characters it took me a while to warm up to it","457":" i loved this book it was a five star book all the way to the last couple of chapters when it jumped the shark and lost me it should have ended at the scene when they hold up the paper but then she went on and added a whole bunch of crazy her flawed redemptive characters became monsters and horrific and a new unnecessary plot element was dumped in that added nothing to the book but let's pretend it ended differently or that it ended earlier under that pretense this would be my review this book was creative and so very original i lived all the metaphors of the wig and the struggle to be a perfect mother and especially the questions raised and the hope regarding aspergers and loving someone who is different but then you know she jumps the shark so you've been warned","458":"this is a hard book to categorize love story science fiction about robots going to populate the moon maxon and sunny are long time friends spouses each an unusual wounded child intertwined in a fascinating and believable relationship maxon goes on a space mission and leaves sunny alone to face the end of her second pregnancy and her mother's dying netzer writes beautifully and creates a world that is very much our own and also uniquely sunny and maxon's","459":" this was a little slow going at first but i really got into it after about the first quarter sunny u0026amp maxon have been in love since they were kids and are now married he is an astronaut going to colonize the moon and she stays at home with their son bubber sunny feels like she needs to act like the perfect wife u0026amp mom and loses her sense of self in the process as the book progresses you get a lot of glimpses into sunny u0026amp maxon's past including stories from their childhood and when they fell in love and also stories about their families i thought it was a nice love story with really unique and interesting characters my library labeled this book as 'science fiction' but i wouldn't categorize it like that it's probably because of the whole colonizing the moon thing i would just say it's a contemporary love family drama","460":"there's an awful lot going on for such a short little book but it's so charming and quirky and the characters so endearing for the most part that i very much liked it in spite of its sort of flaws too bad the copy i read from the library is labeled science fiction that label will keep a lot of people from checking it out","461":"the writing is wonderful the characters so unique i just found it a little too unrelatable","462":"to enjoy this book i think it's one you have to realize that the story goes beyond the story it's about how it makes you reflect on your own relationships with those you love and with those in general at face value it's an imaginative tale that reveals the flaws we all contain deeper it unravels the complexities that every relationship faces mother daughter husband wife friends","463":" quite a brilliant debut novel i was slow to warm to the truly original characters of sunny and maxon but once they got hold of me they wouldn't let me go sunny was a woman without any hair she was born in burma to a couple of secret missionaries and is currently in a phase of her life where she has altered her very being to be what she considers a proper mother robot like himself her husband maxon is in the midst of a mission to colonize the moon with robots he and sunny share many childhood memories many of which include the mother maxon and sunny have a son called bubber who needs to be medicated to get through his days and sunny is due to have a second child while maxon is in space the exploration of what motherhood means is one of the highlights of this novel it is looked at from many perspectives the evolution theory is also remarkable a memorable read","464":"another good reader's choice book for those with a quirky turn of mind this is netzer's first novel and it's one of those books that you keep thinking about after you've put it down it's a bit strange and unsettling the story is about two misfits who just might have a better perspective of living than normal people","465":"nearly half way through this book i was ready to chuck it but something about the genuine nature of sunny and my real curiosity about maxim and bubber how would they all turn out kept me reading i am so glad i did the ending was not as satisfying as i wanted but the backstory kept me coming back aspergers autistic savant and a completely bald women wife mother who could resist","466":" after my second reading i had to bump this book up to five stars i just love it and i take back what i said about the abrupt ending it really wasn't a cliff hanger at all i'm not sure what i was thinking after my first time i love the characters and feel so much for them first read 4 stars this book was an easier read for me i was quickly absorbed into one of the epic loves of our generation as sunny calls it even if it is an odd love it was a little strange to read some of the thought processes in the beginning and i found myself wondering if sunny was off her rocker the ending left me hanging a little too much i normally don't mind cliff hangers but this wasn't even that it just stopped","467":"just couldn't get into it","468":"good plot quirky characters a very different love story","469":"1 2this was one zany book did not know where it was going or why i was so compelled to keep reading at time except to say the writing was wonderful but by the middle i was in love","470":"this would be great for a book club discussion so much to talk about autism motherhood marriage baldness great book","471":"i liked this book there were parts i loved there were parts i was bored through and there were parts that i really hated it seemed like there was a lot of information in this book i could have easily read and enjoyed a book on sunny and maxon and their childhood and coming of age and then another book on their falling in love and marriage","472":"i enjoyed this book except the end my questions about maxon are unanswered and i don't like that the development of the characters and all of the flashbacks were done quite well","473":" i wasn't sure i'd like this at first and i still think knowing the character sunny as well as you do by the end of the novel that she wouldn't have been as hung up on her baldness as she is the story of hers and her husband maxon's relationship takes a bit too long to get started and the revelations begin a bit too far in but it was an enjoyable read nonetheless the novel may not have much of a male readership though i think were some of the flaws mentioned above absent and were the focus just a bit different it would be more universally appealing","474":"what a different kind of story loved the quirky characters loved the science her writing is lovely and funny","475":"eccentric thoughtful i liked this one a great deal","476":"i wish i could add another star for this book i loved it","477":"i read a review in people magazine recommending this book i struggled all the way through i typically like to find one thing positive to say about a book after aolmthe effort and heart i assume an author puts into it but for this book i have nothing it was just plain terrible","478":"i'm not sure but i think serendipitous forces were at work as i read lydia netzer's debut it's no secret that robots play a huge role in this novel - and it just so happened that as i was wrapping up shine shine shine i also was wrapping up the last story in a freelance writing project that involved an interview with an engineer who ... yes ... is researching human robot teaming which leads me to one of the most outstanding things about this book the mathematical metaphors netzer convinces the reader that the world is indeed made up of a series of electrical properties propelled by science numbers vectors examples of the perfect fusion of math and words he had a bulky torso heavy on top like a trapezoid with big arms or every house was a perfect rectangle it was an exercise in mathematics or the city was a love letter to planar geometry everything can be explained by science - except of course one thing led by the heart the book even includes hand drawn equations and formulas from the husband maxon a great personal touch don't stop reading my review if you hate math science ... i love words more than numbers as well but the layer of science laid upon this book is completely engrossing and enriching the science the math the focus on maxon's robot research with nasa the son bubber's struggles with austism - they all serve as metaphors for the mechanical lives lived by so many in today's society i would even say the book is an examination of the increasingly homogenized communities we see in the u s wrought with materialism and one upmanship cookie cutter facades and lack of character but the final message - from the bald protagonist sunny - is ultimately one about truth about embracing individuality 'owning' our differences and 'being' present it's a love story a tribute to the trials and rewards of motherhood and a glimpse into the future it's the story of sunny born during an eclipse a hairless 'oddity' and her adult life spinning out of orbit while her husband's moon mission mimics the same path","479":"i liked the double view of the lives of the two main characters who are separated by space literally and figuratively throughout the novel except in flashbacks and the treatment by the author of the theme of otherness and also the play on the title shine on many levels a very fast and enjoyable read for me and i think this novel may even delight those who think they have no use for sci fi","480":"this was a very sweet book with an unconventional love story i didn't agree with all of the main character's actions but i found the story very enjoyable","481":"this is a very unusual love story i don't want the book to end and i will finish it today i highly recommend this book","482":" netzer has a strange clipped style which lures you into assuming it's very precise and terse yet the more i read the more disappointing it is it actually hardly ever hits the mark always just a bit off till you're not really sure what she's saying her imagery is similarly often more weird than clear more often than not you're not at all sure what that imagery is supposed to mean to my mind there is enough ambiguity in the world without the author adding to it more importantly i can stomach the love of 2 outcast oddballs even identify but when all this gets mixed up with the utterly offbeat burmese story it becomes too subjective and irrelevant to the average reader on top when we find out who gave the father away to the communists it makes no sense there is no explanation for it so why insert it at all the author has a very annoying habit of constantly stopping the story to go back with memories which actually end up making the bulk of the book oft times i just skipped these in order to proceed with the story and sometimes there are gross mistakes such as in one of those lengthy reminiscence sunny is riding her pony as a child and the breeze flutters through her hair when it was made amply clear she did not have a single hair and did not wear a wig until she became pregnant at adulthood i also assume she took great liberty in her descriptions of nasa and its missions as for instance doesn't make sense they wouldn't take into account a meteor hit perhaps the author wouldn't but top world scientists you would assume would also it's putative that the moon is uninhabitable so what's this nutty idea of creating a colony of robots there i also didn't care for bubber suddenly appearing in maxon's imagination on the moon and telling him what to do then there is the terrible exaggeration of what sunny finds underneath the shiny facade of les weathers everyone has dark secrets underneath the smooth veneer but these are mainly less than kind thoughts and feelings she didn't have to go to such extremes of a trashed house of a successful tv anchor simply not believable","483":"ok i never give books 1 star ever but i just didn't get this book i didn't enjoy it and i don't even feel compelled to write a review simply because i don't know what to say it was choppy and weird","484":"charmingly quirky this proved to be a novel i couldn't put down others may find the characters to be far fetched but i found them to be imminently relatable but i am a scientist i thought that sunny as a woman trapped by the role of motherhood to be especially powerful","485":" reason for reading i was attracted to this book because of the autistic son both my own son and myself are autistic me asperger's so i am often drawn to books that depict these characters the book also sounded like it would be quirky something i really enjoy all i can really say about this book is wow what a beautiful story sunny and maxon share the ultimate love story this book is about love the pure and simple kind and how complicated we can make it out to be what is experienced between sunny and maxon is that something kind of wonderful that one can only hope they will get to experience in some small way in one's own life this is a romance for people who don't read romances the book also explores autism and asperger's in all its awesome reality both its drawbacks and its benefits we see this way of being from all possible angles theories and thoughts i was truly swept away with these characters and in love with both autistics bubber and maxon as i saw myself and my son in them to certain degrees while totally relating to them and yet i also related to sunny who has her own difference she must live with who only wants to be normal and have her family fit in and be normal like everyone else but as she learns no one is really normal and the most normal of us all usually are faking it on the outside just trying to fit in like everybody else an extremely powerful book with characters who hit your heart and won't easily be forgotten i rarely read a book and imagine re reading it but this is one i know i will be rereading a few years down the line","486":"recommended by joshilynjackson","487":" the advanced reading copy of shine shine shine has a quote on the front of the book from sara gruen the author of water of elephants that says a funny compelling love story from the freshest voice i've heard in years this intrigued me to want to read the book the book grew on me at first it started slow and i had trouble getting into it but as i continued to read the story and the characters pulled me in it is a true love story sunny and maxon met as kids and in time their friendship blossomed into their own a unique love sunny is born without hair her son bubber has autism and although it is never said straight out in the book i'm guessing maxon has asbergers sunny tries to keep up appearances she wears a wig and participates in all the neighbourhood social events but when sunny gets in a car accident and her wig flies off she suddenly starts to realize that no one is normal and to be truly happy we have to accept ourselves at the same time her astronaut husband is in space and he too comes to the realization that he is only human a heartwarming story of sunny maxon and bubber who have their own unique life that is only theirs to live","488":"i tried for a mighty 80 pages but could not get into this book","489":"abandoned 1 2 way through too contemporary for my liking","490":"this was a very strange story but it really grew on me as i kept reading it if you enjoy a book with interesting characters this is one for you","491":"the suspended disbelief demanded by the book paradoxically enables some brilliant insights into the landscape of ordinary human emotion","492":"actually 3 5","493":"i had such high aspirations for this book what i found was clearly the story of asbergers autism in space along with a woman who lives with many lies i think the author could have done so much more with this book disappointed","494":"boring boring boring i could not get into this book at all","495":"i listened to this literally because joshilyn jackson read the audiobook but holy cow it knocked my socks off sunny and maxon are lovely and what a fascinating weird story it was reminiscent of joshilyn jackson's books as well with the jumping through timelines way of storytelling also robot music at the end of the audiobook","496":"there was a lot that i liked about this unusual book that definitely had moments that shined this is a book about a unique family pregnant and bald sunny her eccentric astronaut husband and autistic son a non threatening car accident strips sunny of her wig exposing her real self to the world after that action sonny sees that what is unusual or not exactly socially acceptable things and people in her life are not only beautiful but important to her in a way she never saw before","497":" when i started thinking about how to review shine shine shine by lydia netzer i was sort of stumped because in many ways it defies description this is a love story about a woman whose husband goes into space but it is also a story about unlikely childhood friends who develop a love based on the fact that they are the only one the other could imagine letting into their difficult lives it is also the story of the differences between the expectations that mothers have of what will make their children happy and the reality of what does make them happy and it is also a science fiction story about the first steps towards colonization of the moon and a social commentary on the false fronts that many people feel they need to put up to interact with society and still i feel like i must be leaving out some important theme although it took me a little while to become emotionally involved in this story of sunny a girl who is born bald and maxon a boy who is a genius but has difficulty interacting with humans once i got hooked into the story i felt both emotionally involved in the characters lives as well as intellectually engaged with some of the larger themes the author was seeking to bring into her story the only criticism i would have of this book is that the last couple of chapters feel a bit rushed after the rest of the book has taken time to slowly create detailed portraits of the characters the conclusion lacked some authenticity that made it seem a bit disconnected from the rest of the story i would recommend this book to people who like unconventional romances people who are interested in issues surrounding the treatment and experience of autism spectrum disorders and people who are interested in stories about the connections between mother's and daughters","498":"eady to read but i didn't like all parts if the book i'm not really sure if i liked the main character of sunny or not","499":"robots in space a love story\"shine shine shine\" deftly explores the dichotomy between fulfilling your own destiny vs living to please others it also explores the nature of illness what constitutes individuality vs the pressure of conformity and the need to be part of the group when does uniqueness spill into mental illness as i read i kept trying to define the tone of this book quirky somewhat but the tone is beyond that whimsical yes it is that but not in a childlike way fanciful a little but the action feels grounded in reality at least emotional honesty in the end i have to conclude there is no exact word that will precisely define \"shine\" it's too unique netzer writes in a genre all her own there are times that the book threatens to spill syrup but she always skirts that stickiness there isn't a misstep anywhere she's not hitting you over the head with beliefs she's exploring with you as an equal she affirms that everyone has something that makes them feel odd sets them apart some of these traits are superficial some more profound we can either change are differences if possible or we can embrace them and attempt to use them to our advantage netzer's characters grow into themselves their love and regard for one another strengthens almost best of all nothing feels inevitable in \"shine\" the reader is always left guessing where we're heading netzer's is one of the freshest voices of 2012 in my opinion we're not robots uniqueness is grand i want to stay on her spaceship","500":"wow she knows how to write our thoughts brilliant","501":"i don't know if i am fairly judging any books these days when i'm this exhausted and reading in little 5 minute spurts this book had some truly really interesting moments then had some rather slow and repetitive sections that just weighed the whole book down and then the book just stopped no ending","502":"i am not sure how to rate this one i just finished this book it was a struggle to finish the beginning and end both kept me wanting to put the book down and walk away but in between was good and in others i cried with emotion it made me stop and think about the autistic brain and how society treats those with autisim very different from anything i have ever read the main character trying to figure out who she really is or who she has been all a long let just leave it as you know who you are so stick to that","503":"very quirky and different engaging story","504":"i really enjoyed this book the unique love story kept me intrigued all the way to the very end this book's protagonist was a very interesting character i felt though that they didn't close the loop on who sunny's father was or maybe i missed it the love story between maxon and sunny was sweet and although they both had very unusual upbringings their lives together albeit he was trying to colonize the moon seemed relevant to what families go through","505":"i wish i wrote review after i read it it was a book club pick it was okay but not amazing","506":"a story about the powerful gorgeous quiet love between maxon who has asperger's and sunny who has alopecia odd unique but ultimately entirely human","507":"this is the summer novel of the year for anyone who believes the suburban angst genre would benefit from baldness moon landings robots autism and burmese childhoods in other words this is for everyone longing for a large dose of imagination and creativity in their reading it's a story about being different and embracing it whether that means looking different or thinking different sunny and maxon are strangers to normal but motherhood inspires sunny to strive for this unattainable goal and she's just about got the suburban housewife thing down but then maxon goes to the moon sunny's wig comes off her mother is dying she's pregnant and something on maxon's mission goes very very wrong as we learn about sunny and maxon's relationship we can't help but fall in love with their story as the pretensions of normalcy and perfection are stripped away to reveal something far more human and far more beautiful in all of its messy glory as maxon points out robots cannot love regret or forgive and shine shine shine shows that they are worse off for it these all too human emotions are what make life worth living and why we continually strive to do better a stunningly unique and human tale e galley from netgalley","508":" this book starts out well interesting characters but once sunny loses her wig good grief the whole bald metaphor becomes very tiring the flash backs are tedious and cliche at one point sunny thinks about her bald head and sad balloons going up in the air really sad balloons i think this might have made a good novella editing out 90% of the flashbacks netzer explores the concept that autistic asperger's disorder people may be more highly evolved than those not afflicted or enhanced with that condition and it is interesting interesting if humans are intended to be utilitarian only without need for messy emotions complicating the ability to land damaged space ships and build robots in times of crisis i guess there would be no crises by about 1 2 or 2 3 of the way through the book i didn't care much for sunny or her bald head","509":"netzer gets a math phobes like me to transcribe logical equations into love letters through sheer writing genius","510":" quirky characters a very unusual book who could ever forget sunny with her bald head her blonde wigs collection and the tumultuous few days we spend with her we are privileged to toddle behind her as she questions just about everything in her somewhat stepford wife existence then there is maxon her husband a robot scientist astronaut who is well robotic at times but who has always loved sunny since they met when he was an abused child they have one offspring bubber who is autistic and another baby on the way the action takes place during the few days maxon is gone on a space mission to the moon sunny's mother is dying in the hospital and she is about to give birth with flashbacks to the stories of all these lives and how they evolved meteors communists and secrets unfettered are also involved i would give his 5 stars but found the ending somewhat confusing and unstatisfying","511":"certainly one of the best books i've read this year it's not the best take ever on the great american suburban novel but one that is unique due to the scale of it the elements that make it stand out the autism the space the pregnancy the baldness aren't cheesy by any amount but add to the texture of the story and you will fall in love with sunny and maxon","512":"i enjoyed the first half of the book but wondered how netzer was going to bring all the story lines together she didn't the first causality was maxon his actions and supposed autistic thoughts no longer rang true for me then i felt i was being repeatedly thumped on the head about sunny's baldness and decision to wear or not wear a wig just in case i hadn't picked up on the behind the beautiful facade lurks the truth message les weathers was there to drum it into my head i trudged on to the wholly unsatisfying end very forgettable","513":"such a weird and interesting book more later","514":"amazing i've never read anything like this and that is so refreshing while reading this book nothing reminded me of anything else i'd ever read before i absolutely loved this book everything about it i appreciated the effortless way in which the author switched from present day to the past without disrupting my pace or the tone so many authors feel the need to interrupt the flow to remind us whether we're present day or in the past i loved the characters i loved that they were rich and unique and so beautifully flawed it is so refreshing to read a novel in which none of the characters are similar to anything you've read before each character had depth and breadth it helps the reader to immerse herself in the story and genuinely care about the outcome for these characters the tone and pacing were excellent the whole novel just beautifully written it is an amazing love story i loved the theme we're all flawed and that's ok i related so much to this story especially to sunny as a young mother myself i identified with her desire to fit in amongst her friends and appear that everything was perfect so often i think we put on a face for the world instead of just letting our friends see that real life is hard and we sometimes get banged up along the way i also could empathize with her baldness as i have struggled with trichotillomania most of my life and wear a scarf i just could put myself right where sunny was and feel inadequate and unfit when comparing myself to everyone else but i think sunny is learning as am i that people love us in spite of our flaws our flaws make us real excellent novel loved it","515":" really 2 5 stars well let's start with the good first the author has some interesting things to say about the transition into motherhood the idealized role and the gritty reality of it which i appreciated i rather liked maxon and it was his storyline that drew me in i found myself interested in his outcome which leads me to the bad the main character sunny was too weird to be likeable doing inexplicable pointless things the plot was implausible and disjointed the writing clunky and uneven the ending felt pretty rushed and inexplicably strange with the characters behaving in ways that i thought were pretty unbelievable overall i don't think this would be a book i'd recommend and all the 4 and 5 star ratings are a little baffling to me","516":"it was just okay","517":"while the start is glacier slow and the ending is a tad unresolved the journey is fascinating and intriguing","518":"as a champion of the underdog and former special ed teacher i really liked the characters with autism that make their way in the world and the discovery and acceptance of various quirks and idiosyncrasies in all of us but i grew impatient with the plot and the pedestrian language and read it very fast","519":"netzer's debut was brilliant her characters become richer with every chapter that goes by and her prose is stunning and thought provoking shine shine shine brings to light the fragility of humanity from a man running out of oxygen free floating in space to a woman's simple wish to be flawless an empowering call to arms for mothers and a reminder of the idiosyncrasies of each of us big or small this was a powerful read","520":"this novel is based on an extended metaphor the protagonists are likened to aliens robots to show that they are and feel different from others unfortunately this palls and descends into gimmick and the author does not know how to get out if it there is also a fake profundity here but the novel never leaves the realm of 'women's fiction' by which i don't mean fiction by or about women but fiction that never extends its meaning beyond the concerns of specific characters and their lives for example jonathan franzen writes women's fiction on top of this there is some undigested bad karma relating to parents all of the older parents portrayed are monsters in one way or another","521":" shine shine shine by lydia netzer is so many things all at once that it is impossible to know where to begin it is a science fiction novel it is a romance of epic proportions it is a master work of literary fiction hell i'm sure in some circles it may even be called chick lit one thing it certainly is not is boring netzer's first novel is an astounding achievement made by a homeric story teller who is also a master wordsmith the novel itself is about a man maxon mann who is on a nasa mission to colonize the moon with robots and his wife sunny mann who lives a false life as a normal mom it is their love story their story of redemption and their commentary on what is normal and what is not the ultimate compliment i feel that you can give a writer is for their work to be included in those freshman anthologies english departments make students buy in order to graduate from college netzer's novel is one that surely will be taught and read for many years to come","522":" i found it harder to initially feel involved in the characters for the start of shine shine shine maxon is not your average relatable character and sunny is well different none of the characters are normal but each in their own way is special in an unforgettable way shine shine shine is much like sunny and maxon it takes a bit of time to feel like you really know them can relate to their life and struggles but while this is not your normal average family they are indeed loveable and memorable","523":" this is one of the most original novels i have read in a very long time and with the amount that i read that is really saying something strange but brilliant this novel and sunny just grabbed me and didn't let go trying to be perfect and fit in is her goal when she becomes a mother for the first time her son bubber is autistic and her family is so very different loved all the angles the writing and the details of the backgrounds that formed each of these characters they are all so very flawed but each is endearing in a different way each struggling to grasp something just out of reach this is a novel one has to actually read because it is extremely difficult to accurately describe all the variances in this novel wonderfully interesting debut novel can't wait to see what this author comes up with next arc from netgalley","524":"it took me just a little bit to get into this one but then i fell in love with its quirky true lovely self i love this book","525":"i'm basing my rating on uniqueness of storyline and overall message no such thing as normal everyone has something to hide yet i am not so enthralled that i would want to read everything by this author but i can't quite put my finger on it somehow the main character does not seem likable even though characters seen through her eyes are","526":"this story unraveled like a twisted ball of yarn at first disorganized and unsettling and by the end smooth and simple at the heart a love story masked by the complications of ordinary and extraordinary lives absolutely loved it","527":"this was a quirky compelling book that i couldn't stop reading and yet i didn't completely connect to it i loved how different it was there was nothing i could compare this to but something was missing for me but i could see where others would rave about this","528":"shine shine shine was an easy fun rollercoaster of a book to read but it's a tricky book to review overall it's a strong book solid in its literary chops with a good story interesting characters and a very delicate masterful hand that knows how to swing back and forth between light and heavy but it's also full of contradictions it's well paced but sometimes i wish it would stay longer on a particular story thread it has a couple good well drawn characters but everyone else in the book is self evidently a caricature and flat a lot of reviewers like to draw attention to how it's a constellation of ideas or stories or both that somehow hangs together but honestly i'm not convinced it does hang together i'm also not convinced it needs to sometimes the narration sounds like it's being done by maxon the main male aspergery super genius character other times not so much and there's no clear distinction drawn between these changes in direction there's all these hairs that stick out all over the place and it's hard to write a review because overall the work is great and i don't want to talk about the hairs too much because that will make it sound like i'm being critical but it's the hairs that are interesting why isn't a satisfactory resolution provided at the ending what's the significance of the mirrored birth at the end why does sunny take an axe to the desk why did sunny's mother do what she did and then tell maxon about it in a letter what happened to maxon's mother was there really an incident at the bridge is this science fiction or not what was the deal with les weathers why include such a caricature and then expose him for not just a real person but a completely insane person but then i write that and i think none of that matters because what really matters when you finish a book is how it made you feel and this book makes me feel hopeful and optimistic and happy about people i don't think that's because of what happens in the bouncing jumpily plotted story though i think it's because of what happens in the voice of the narrator this is a really unique voice and i am excited to see more of what netzer winds up writing she is very funny heartbreaking and thinks around and through things in a way that will leave you holding your breath and wondering where you're going to wind up she's got a bit to learn about dialogue still but she seems to know that as this book doesn't have much dialogue in it that's ok everything else just sings when i write a review of a book i like to try and come right out and say whether i recommend a book or at the very least say who i think might like it this is a really tricky book to do that with though because i personally fell so in love with the way the story was told that i stopped caring so much about what the story was or who was involved so i could wholeheartedly recommend this if you like the writer's voice but it's such a singular voice there's not much out there to compare it to it's also a little complicated because there's so much reference in here to rockets math and robots that a lot of people are going to call it science fiction and be turned off by that but it also has chick lit elements that are going to turn other people off wait i know do you want to read a love story because this is definitely that a very sweet one a smart one a brilliant one a shining one it's got something of the tone of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but none of the bleakness yes i definitely think you should read it no i'm not making any promises","529":"refreshingly original and stunningly beautiful highly recommended","530":"awwwwww loved it","531":"i don't often rate books but i wanted to warn people considering reading this book what a total waste of my time just good enough to finish in case it had a last minute redemption with a great ending did not happen if i could rate this less than one star i would don't waste your time","532":"i really enjoyed this book it was one of those books you can't put down a bit odd but very enjoyable and easy read","533":"what a beautiful and unique book i loved the slow but not boring complicated narration the unwinding of a raw love story filled with extraordinary people u0026amp complex connections that finished in a powerful ride to truth and heart","534":"i really enjoyed this i loved the back story the mishaps the real ness of the characters i would actually say this was more of 4 5 starts the only reason i didn't give it 5 was that it took me a bit to read it i could put it down become involved in other books and usually a 5 star book for me is one i devour","535":"i really enjoyed this quirky book the story is a little far fetched and silly at points but i really liked the writing it's about a woman that reinvents herself when she becomes a mom has a bit of a breakdown and goes back to being her true self the story of her life is revealed along the way","536":"this started off a little strange and ended a little abruptly but this is a sweet book with a universal message her metaphors are a little heavy handed but they work","537":"i really really hated the first third of this book just when i was about to stop reading it though it changed and i very much enjoyed the remainder of he book and i'm very glad i didn't give up on it","538":" sunny and maxon met as children she had a disorder that meant she had no hair on her body he had some form of autism they were both different and they became friends then lovers now married they live in the perfect virginia suburb and sunny wants to have the perfect suburban life their son has autism her mother is dying and maxon is scheduled to go to the moon to set up a droid colony that he designed their marriage is in trouble but when something goes wrong with maxon's mission sunny is forced to reevaluate what she has valued in their lives","539":" whatokay no this was really a beautiful book and i loved it and all buttttttttt it ended so abruptly that i was like hmm wait what i don't have twenty more pages to finish this up other than literally two throwaway sentences in the last couple of pages it leaves things very open ended however with all that said this really was a beautiful book and the story was original and engaging and enthralling but seriously what one of the most beautiful sentences i've ever read this is what it means to die you do not finish this sentence alone bumped it up to four stars for me hurts so good","540":"just could not get into this book because i didn't like the characters","541":"sunny is facing lots of challenges in her life and they all pull this refreshing novel forward see my full review here http cliffordgarstang com p 3646","542":"not terrible but not great it felt very affected and stilted in many places and for the life of me i couldn't see why the characters loved each other i think my main issue is i really didn't buy it the love story that is and i'm sorry but the author's bio irritated the hell out of me in the same way mommy blogs irritate me and that started me off on a really bad footing with this book if she writes something else i'll give it a shot but honestly i don't see what all the fuss was about","543":"i thought netzer was most successful in the memory flashbacks with maxon and sunny their relationship their interactions and maxon's story especially was the most intriguing to me the nasa part of the book was what initially attracted me to this book and i thought it was also well done still this book misses the mark with me somehow i didn't really care for the burmese side story or emma's slow death off life support i felt those were unnecessary additions to what could have been a more successful poignant novella","544":" this is a very sweet book a love story about two very unusual people who are extremely successful and happy with being together but that is not the end of the story it is where it begins despite the successes life gets complicated and sunny the wife wants to be normal she is utterly hairless from head to toe and when she becomes pregnant with her firstborn she is gripped with the desire to wear wigs when her son is born she becomes a stepford wife by choice her husband maxon cannot understand this he is very unusual too he appears to have asperger's but he now is a famous nobel prize winner and a scientist scheduled to land on the moon in order to plant his inventions robots that will start building a colony for human habitation now sunny is pregnant again her mother is dying her husband is orbiting the moon and when driving her autistic little boy home from school she has a car accident the wig flies out the car window and in that instance sunny is disgusted with who she has become what follows is sort of a coming of age story only the person who wakes up to her life is the adult sunny and she actually realizes she has been a robot for the last five years similar to those maxon designs the beginning of her rebirth as a real human being again she marks by no longer wearing her wigs however she had told her husband not to come back from the moon her son is overmedicated and in trouble in school her mother's doctor wants sunny to pull the plug on the hospital equipment keeping her mother alive and she is having contractions in her second pregnancy sunny is a little stressed although i enjoyed reading this book it was not as focused as it should have been in my opinion however the characters are darling the flashbacks revealing that both sunny and maxon mann grew up together in troubled childhoods are very interesting and i really wanted everything to turn out ok which was not certain it is more than a little dark and it is a touch science fiction but it is primarily a love story between a man with aspergers and a woman who can never be unnoticed due to her baldness there is no question that they need each other but it is possible that sunny's confusions and maxon's very dangerous job might finish what could be a very happy life together","545":"shine shine shine is a beautifully written story about what it means to be human with all our craziness all our inconsistencies and all of our helplessness against a world over which we have no control what sunny learns is that living isn't about overcoming those things but about embracing them owning them and making them a part of who we are i wanted to wrap my arms around sunny maxon and bubber as if with my very will i could keep them safe it's a wonderful novel","546":"excellent provocative could not put down for a first time author she is compelling original and really takes you into a world of thesefantastic characters her canvas is huge realistic and other worldly a must read","547":"a sweet and sometimes sad novel that i found to be a very worthwhile read the characters are all very real and endearing the story melds together to make a very engrossing thought provoking and solid story i really enjoyed it and will look forward to this authors next novel","548":"this was a step away from my comfort reading i try to find something that i normally would not turn to to read this was a welcome read though i loved the ending and do suggest people read it and try something new","549":"if this is her debut novel then i congratulate her in her future successful career in writing what a family a collection of walking weirdos i lousy live this book read it in a breeze","550":"i know this book had high ratings but not for me the book jumped from the present to the past frequently which wasn't confusing just irritating i found myself becoming frustrated with the main character sunny stop whining and make up your mind already at least the end was satisfying especially because i'm a home birth midwife","551":"loved this fascinating on autism aspergers humanity","552":"i'm not sure how to describe this book but i guess weird weird weird might be appropriate i read it all the way to the end and i'm sure i'll never forget this book but i can't say i liked it","553":"i couldn't get through this one","554":"i wasn't too sure about it at the beginning but by the middle i liked it there was a lot of symbolism that my tired brain couldn't or didn't want to figure out","555":"this book is pretty amazing","556":" the short of it a story about a weird modern family wading through love as they know it the rest of it maxon is a nobel prize winning scientist on a mission to colonize the moon the robots he's created for the purpose are lifelike in that they can talk and interact just like humans back on earth his wife sunny raises their 4 year old autistic son robert bubber and awaits the birth of their second child when communication with the capsule is lost due to a meteor hit both are left to ponder the lives they've lived and the mistakes they've made along the way sometimes you read a book and then sometimes you experience one this book is full of moments and experiences so unlike my own that it's a hard book to describe the characters are quirky but in an odd way not a fun way for example sunny was born hairless no eyebrows no eyelashes at first she covers it up with wigs and custom hair pieces but when she loses communication with maxon she decides to leave herself unadorned for the world to see during all of this sunny's mother is also on her deathbed connected to tubing and not able to breathe on her own the tethers of life in both her mother's situation and maxon's are failing in a big way and sunny is slowly coming unglued maxon on the other hand is the more stable of the two or so he appears to be his ability to become detached or distant is a plus when his mission is jeopardized his ability to think clearly in times of crisis is admirable yet also a bit disturbing given that he has so much to lose hyper focused or positive attitude you never really know with maxon it's almost as if he's one of his robots calculated precise dependable reliable as most of you may have guessed this also equals boring it's clear from the beginning that sunny is resentful of the life she's lived with maxon although maxon is a very successful scientist sunny's mother begged her not to get involved with him when he fell for her as a child the two as children seemed to be connected and although they went about their lives with school and college that connection was never lost however in the real world of raising an autistic child struggling with the day to day \"hassle\" that has become her life sunny finds herself frustrated and worried that her next child will also be autistic and where is maxon in all of this in space i did not enjoy this book while reading it but in hindsight there are things that i appreciated about it afterward the feeling of loss and isolation for both maxon and sunny is really quite well done and necessary since both characters are not terribly verbal in expressing their thoughts in summary the book left me a bit cold the characters all of them lacked warmth and understanding and the second half was rather difficult to get through i don't need warm likable characters to like a book but i need to feel a pulse and the characters were a little too \"out there\" for me i never really understood where they were coming from and in turn didn't really care where they were headed i will say this there are some beautiful lines lines in which i read two three and four times for their beauty this is netzer's debut novel and although ultimately it didn't work for me i'd absolutely give her writing another try for more reviews visit my blog book chatter","557":"unique smart compassionate and interesting all while allowing the reader to walk a mile in someone else's shoes it was an enjoyable mile for me","558":"i have no idea why people like this book so much it was incredibly boring","559":"i liked this book but i thought it was strange i think the point was that everyone is weird so don't feel so weird about being weird but it was sort of over the top and i didn't care a lot about the characters","560":"this is a startlingly intimate look into the world of characters who are refreshingly different from ordinary people yet we connect with them because of our own quirks hidden from the world by our own disguises","561":"a light and humorous delivery of some dark and deep secrets hidden by tidy facades a delight for me after some dark novels but still poignant and insightful a mother's love and inner dialogue agonising over medicating her child loving her husband despite his short falls forgiving herself for her own imperfections i related to it all","562":"add this one to your must read list a woman protagonist who is bald living in a town freakishly like hinsdale is married to an asperger syndrome mit grad who is up in space trying to man the moon with robots her son has autism and her mom is dying of cancer oh and she's also pregnant the author shows how people's perfect looking lives are generally not so perfect","563":"this book was just interesting enough to get me to finish it but i managed to read another book in the middle and struggled to get it done what was frustrating was there were sections that were very interesting and prose that was striking in its perspective but overall i rarely stopped being aware i was reading a book it was just too quirky in its characters and its plot to work for me","564":"i read this because of the robot concept to me this book was a lot of different pieces that didn't fit that well together and then once in a while the author would insert something that she thought was quotable but it didn't really go with the rest also it seemed almost offensive to autistic kids the idea that with enough love and patience something with autism can cast away medicine they just need good enough parents","565":"i cannot think of a more appropriate title for lydia netzer's extraordinary novel than shine shine shine that is exactly what this book does on each and every page the writing is bright and insightful the characters fabulously flawed and the observations on the human condition are winsome and wise netzer offers raw glimpses onto the quirks idiosyncrasies and secrets we all have and hide as husbands wives mothers fathers neighbors and friends but are desperate to reveal it is one of those special stories that seems to speak directly to you and one that you are compelled to share it is truly out of this world","566":"i really enjoyed this strange sad beautiful book for some reason it took me a really long time to read though","567":"very different could be a good book club discussion","568":" when i first started reading this book i was overwhelmed by it's over the top odd ness for lack of a better word but then reading this love story about these two very strange yet relatable characters became almost hypnotic i can't say it was a page turner but it made me think and was written in a very original voice i even found myself marking passages especially the many regarding motherhood a very central theme in this book she rose up from that bed a mother and ready to fight for the rest of her days when the woman becomes a mother she can no longer participate in the slow rot because no one's going to rot the child and anyone who tries will suffer the mother's consequences p 15 16 i am mom twenty four seven it doesn't end because i am not physically with you and your child i am always mom it's right here with me inside me this makes me mom i just want a little break to try and be someone else but i can't have it it's impossible p 241it'd be a great book for a really serious book club that likes to explore themes and symbolism","569":"very interesting good character development without being very obvious recommend","570":"if only the ending hadn't been so sudden i'd have given it four stars i assume that everyone who survives lives happily ever after a weird girl marries a weird guy and they have a weird kid and while the weird girl learns to act normal and stepford ish she finds out that everyone else around them has secrets and masks and wigs and pasts they like to keep hidden too","571":"this was a unique story it's a difficult sell to others because it is quite strange when you hear yourself describing the book that said it is an interesting story about a couple with a lot working against them and in they end love and acceptance prevail there is an asperger's syndrome piece which interested me especially","572":"beautiful writing i personally just struggled through the character development and the general plot i trudged through it glad i read it as it is quirky but wouldn't recommend it the ending also seemed rushed and didn't quite fit but maybe that's the whole point nothing in this story especially the relationship between the two central characters quite fits again maybe that's the whole point","573":"the first half was odd and somewhat confusing but i ended up loving the story and for me it all started making sense good for bookclub discussion if anyone else will finish it","574":"overall pretty good lots of interesting themes but none seemed fully developed finished interesting characters who are also likable","575":" interesting read when i began this novel i knew it had a strange premise but i plunged in intrigued by the main characters' challenges sunny was born hairless from head to toe and her astronaut husband maxom has asperger's or some form of high functioning autism maxom is headed toward the moon to colonize it with robots and sunny's left at home pregnant raising an autistic child and caring for a dying mother you don't see many book summaries like that honestly in the first five chapters or so i wasn't sure i'd enjoy this at first i found the characters strangely distant but as sunny's story and the stories of her loved ones' unfolded i had to read on the ending is odd but i kind of expected an odd ending to the story of such an odd cast of characters many themes are at work here don't want to spoil anything but my favorite is that love anchors in sometimes hostile environments blossoms and somehow thrives in a world of individuals who are far from perfect and are somehow tethered together in this spiraling universe like constellations of stars i'd definitely recommend to literature reading friends","576":"different yet still a good book to get lost in","577":" reminiscent of the best of anne tyler and john irving 'shine shine shine' is a brilliant debut novel quirky and strange throughout with situations that keep you off balance and wondering at the beginning of the sunny would seem to be a typical housewife her husband maxon is an astronaut carrying robots to the moon bubber is their autistic son and sunny's mother is dying of cancer all would seem to be the normal course of things until an accident or two forces an abrupt change in the arc of things at that point each character chooses or is forced to give something up but in the process becomes more fully who they actually are the story is told in a somewhat non linear fashion and it works very well to chronicle sunny's relationship with her socially awkward husband her relationship with her dying mother and the choices that got her where she currently is quirky and unusual the book is filled with the struggle and whimsy of why we choose to love another and what it truly means to finally let go and be ourselves","578":"i think this is a book that people either love or don't so much and i didn't love it booksellers raved but i just didn't connect with the book the plot was original","579":"a nice surprise didn't know what to expect","580":" shine shine shine is a strange and beautiful book it's about a family of three special people who each has a quality that puts them outside the mainstream the reader learns to care about these people and cheer them on as they struggle to find their own destinies math metaphors abound and are lovingly handled even people like this reader who are not mathematically inclined will find them beautiful i recommend this book to people who want to be swept along with maxon sunny and bubber who are at first a little hard to love","581":"after the glowing review in the ny times i was surprised that this bordered on serious chick lit but omg i don't care because i ate it up and it was just lovely","582":"it started off poorly for me but once i abandoned my expectations the story became compelling enough that i considered bumping my rating up to 2 or 3 i genuinely enjoyed the flashbacks to sunny to maxon growing up and thought they lent themselves well to the pace and progression of the story but i didn't feel as though much came together at the end sure it was implied but i was left thinking uhh okay she tried to do too much with the book and never hit the mark on any of it","583":"i loved loved loved this book and you will too quirky premise geeky characters and lots of love love love","584":"this is an odd little book that will leave a stamp on your heart the situations are true to life and as a mother and woman sunny makes an impression we should all wish we could throw away our wigs and be our true selves","585":"lovely quirky book made even better by jocelyn jackson's narration on the audio book","586":"interesting read took a while to get into","587":"quirky book with very endearing characters","588":"very unique story but one that i really connected to this is likely one of those books that people will either love or hate i loved it","589":" shine shine shine tells the story of a woman with alopecia and her autistic husband and son sunny hides her baldness with beautiful blonde wigs attempting to thus create a facade of normalcy sweater sets and bake sales in a life filled with the turmoil of a burgeoning pregnancy a dying mother treating her son's autism and accepting her husband's absence during a nasa mission when she finally casts off her wig and embraces the baldness she had once treasured instead of everything falling apart her priorities come together with almost alarming clarity the romance and deep emotional bond of sunny's relationship with her husband is revealed beneath the turmoil of their current separation she takes her small son off his medication and he laughs genuinely one life exits the world and another enters netzer writes very real characters whose motivations and emotions feel within reach of the reader their connections to one another are tangible additionally the perspective she gives of non normative psychology is refreshingly accepting instead of trying to cure or erase the autism of either maxon or bubber they are accepted as they are as human beings that are not defective as members of society as a family with worth and meaning the rejection of consumerist perfection for emotions and human bonds in all their imperfection as exhibited by characters both major and minor does not feel contrived or moralistic but as organically developed as the characters themselves","590":"what an amazingly odd perfect book one i will read again and certainly pass on to my friends as a must read wow","591":"a very interesting read lots of little twists and turns in the plot which kept it interesting told from the perspective of two polar opposite characters who happen to be married on two completely different journeys you never quite know what will happen next it was amazing to see how such strong characters persevered through unthinkable hardships and overwhelming stress definitely a good read check it out","592":"i'm giving this 3 stars because the story held my interest but the characters just kind of annoyed me maxon was like a much less endearing version of sheldon on the big bang theory sunny in her perfect housewife phase made me think of betty draper on mad men and i pictured les weathers as a deranged ted baxter from the mary tyler moore show i can't think of a tv character to compare emma to but i had trouble relating to most of her behavior too in spite of that i still wanted to follow the story of these quirky people to the end","593":"i found this book to strange for my tastes i was trying to complete it not because it was a page turner but just so it would be finished and i could start a different book","594":"this is a weird book beautifully written but a little cold and too full of events i didn't quite enjoy it and probably wouldn't have finished if i hadn't been at the laundromat there was too much going on husband in space baby coming autistic son dying mother missionary childhood in burma growing up on the farm with the feral neighbor boy just too much going on in one plot for the story to grow around the characters and make them lovable they are real enough but flat and did not engage me also sunny's meltdown is written as the small slow existential burden of trying to look right in the suburbs tired of this in every book rather than an obvious response to the unusual crisis in her life i found this off putting","595":"not sure i'm going to finish this book i was so excited to read it given it won so many awards and i thought the plot sounded interesting but i'm more than halfway through the book and i still don't care about the characters","596":"difficult to get into but i made it the characters are all really unique but i think that makes them a little unapproachable tough to understand","597":"i don't always think it is fair for me to rate a book i can not finish but i had to with this one the writing was awful i do not know why this book is getting so many rave reviews i stopped at page 41 and wished i had stopped sooner the writing went something like this she was born she lived but first she was born she was glad she was born and that is why i can't finish this book","598":" well the fact that i couldn't finish this says it all just weird and didn't flow well didn't like the characters either a bald woman whose husband is traveling in space with an autistic child basic jist the lady has a car accident and she suddenly gives up the wig and false eyelashes as well as pull her son out of school she is tired of the little boy always being the problem at school and takes him off all his meds the story never got my attention and i read more than half but just couldn't finish just a dumb book","599":"parts were interesting and the characters themselves were original but i enjoyed the back story more than the present and had to force myself through it i wouldn't argue with anyone that said they loved it it just wasn't for me","600":"this book took a while for me to get into i wish there had been a little more action to get the plot moving sadly just about everything that actually happens in the book is revealed on the inside cover however i really loved the relationship between sunny and maxon and looking at it from many perspectives from various points in their lives the overall message or whatever was really good","601":"this novel was well written had a great plot and great characters maybe because i am an engineer but i could really relate to the characters and the math blurbs loved it and recommend it","602":"this story is not very well written could not enjoy the story and all the main character did was complain and worry about giving birth","603":"i went into this with average expectations the plot summary i read left me with the impression that this was another mediocre novel packaged into a slick marketing machine that will eventually result in a movie starring rachel mcadams shine shine shine is the story of sunny a stay at home mother who was born completely hairless to missionary parents the book is also about her husband maxon a brilliant and slightly socially awkward nasa scientist leading a project that will send robots to the moon their preschool aged son bubber is autistic and they have another baby on the way there's a lot going on i included the note about sunny's hairlessness because it features as a major plot point the well off pretty suburban wife is hiding a lot of things but most of all she's hiding her lifelong baldness under a wig she wears adhesive eyebrows too sunny's wig comes to represent forced normalcy and life under a veil of upper middle class compliance it's a game of let's pretend and the rest of her family has to play along too but when sunny is in a car accident and the wig flies off and out the window she starts to remember who she was before it and how the old sunny felt about her husband maxon and their son sunny's childhood memories of maxon begin to emerge they grew up together and a portrait of how they fell in love starts to fall into place the characterization in this book is amazing the plot seems weird and outlandish but don't be turned off by it or by the fact that some people are calling this a sci fi book it's not--at least not in the traditional sense yes it talks occasionally about space robots but it's really not about space robots this book is really about expectations and normalcy when does \"realness\" become sacrificed for the sake of blending into surroundings when you live your life trying to meet society's expectations can you forget to bring your spouse along for the ride i admit that i wasn't exactly loving the book as i read through it but it's becoming one of the rare books that i like more and more after the fact i hesitate to recommend it wholeheartedly because i don't think it's a book everyone will enjoy there are great things about it it's a very original plot and an interesting love story but i just have a feeling that shine shine shine is one of those books people will either love tolerate or hate altogether if you do read it and dislike it at first give it a few days 48 hours later i feel far more fond of it than i did when i turned the last page","604":"over the moon","605":"the book itself was very good but i had difficulty really getting into the voice of narration something about it was off to me","606":"couldn't get into it did not finish","607":"i enjoyed this book very much interesting how we sometimes try to fit in but when in reality we really are already fitting in why is it that we always are so hard on ourselves after reading this book i think i'm doing okay thank you lydia netzer","608":" i was uncomfortable and unsure of the story at the start and struggled to understand the characters and what they were saying and feeling but i realize now possibly that is one of the stories strengths as this discomfort is how most people perceive them the more you know sunny maxon and bubber the more you begin to understand they are extraordinary people not in their perfection in the usual superficial sense but in their ability to love and understand each other stand by each other despite the world judging and misunderstanding them you begin to see their perfection lies in their imperfections and once they fully embrace them they really do shine i also must mention netzers beautiful writing there are a few incredible scenes she paints with her words that are unforgettable such as maxon and bubbers first earthrise they gazed at the earth so very small the swirls and spirals of clouds twisted over the surface of blue and gold location 3190 i know it's a good book when i am sad it is over","609":"although appropriate i wasn't thrilled with the writing style but did enjoy the story and war pitching sunnys transformation interesting topics to think about individualism self worth forgiveness live good read","610":"i started this book shortly after i bought it several months ago and it didn't grab me then i met the author and attended a couple of panels she was on at the james river writers conference i re started the book and couldn't put it down this is a remarkable book and totally honest about motherhood and that took a tremendous amount of bravery","611":"debated the category guess might be considered science fiction takes interesting characters with strong dominate aspect and plays them off each other to build a story worth following","612":"i'm so tired of pretentious books with diagrams in them i'm bamboozled as to why this book beautiful ruins and the goon squad get great reviews the writing is fine but there is no character development or plot","613":"parts of the book fall in the three category so that i almost gave up enough of the wig stuff already but then i'd hit upon a page that was brilliant even better than 5 s i kept on and was glad i did now i'm even hoping for a sequel","614":" at first i was put off by sunny's character netzer portrays her so thoroughly as a bland blonde millionaire's wife that when she ditches her wig and we start to learn about her past i felt like i had to reorient myself to make everything make sense i'm guessing this was netzer's intention but everything about it felt off confusing instead of intriguing however the book won me over in the end i don't know a lot about autism but netzer's portrayal of maxon felt authentic and moving and bubber while an enigma throughout the novel never took on the sentimentalism that so often accompanies portrayals of autistic children the backstory was always engrossing and the ending is wonderfully bizarre and the theme of humans robots and personhood was interesting if heavy handed at times","615":"honestly took me awhile to get into this story and pull all of the themes together one of those books i really really lived when i was finished then sad there wasn't more","616":"this is not a book i would typically read but i did enjoy i feel like it suddenly ended netzer leads us up to this exact point throughout the last half of the book then it's over i would have liked a more clear ending i did like it and i will reccommend it to people looking for a different read","617":"i feel like i'm missing something with this book i really wanted to love it but there is something lacking in the telling of maxon and sunny's life enjoyed the characters but i think they could have been so much more the ending was abrupt and disappointing","618":"the story was very unusual i love love to hear joshilyn jackson narrate she does a wonderful job on this book as always","619":"too weird for me a bald woman an autistic son a brilliant but strange father who ends upon the moon","620":"i'm not quite sure what to say about this book normally i give a book 50 pages and if i hate it by then i give up while i really hated it at 50 pages i didn't have anything else handy so i trudged on while i warmed to it slightly because there were moments of loveliness in it i thought the format of the book was discombobulated and it was hard to really like the characters","621":"not quite sure why this got such good ratings i only finished it because i wanted to know why i still don't know and the ending was","622":"i could not stop reading this book about sunny and maxon shine shine shine is a beautiful story about love societal pressures and norms and the conflicting journey of motherhood and marriage my favorite scene takes place in the planetarium where maxon expresses such pure and simple love for sunny","623":"i just couldn't get into this i may have liked it better in a different mood but i actually put it down without finishing it","624":" i'm only giving this book 2 stars because of the pain i endured listening to it on audiobooks which i think really took away from the book's draw this book has a good plot and anyone who is a mother most likely can connect to the main character's life struggles thoughts feelings etc but do not listen to it on audiobooks the narrator was awful to listen to i'm not sure where she drew her character's voice inspirations from but i would equate her voices to listening to someone clawing their fingernails down a chalkboard","625":"i absolutely loved this book science fiction wrapped in a love story rolled in coming of age served on a wealthy suburbia satire must read","626":"a good read i wanted more","627":"enjoyed the dark humor and the peeling back of sunny and maxon's personalities as the novel unfolded a lovely look too at life with autism and a clever use of math and logic as it relates to the completely illogical way that we live and love really looking forward to hearing ms netzer at the james river writers conference in richmond virginia october 2013 registration will open in june i think http jamesriverwriters org","628":"something about this book didn't quite resonate right with me bits of it were captivating but for me it didn't hang together as a whole that made sense","629":"i must admit this was a book that i struggled with","630":"one of the best books i have ever read about love that most illusive and fascinating of subjects","631":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book unlike any other book i've read fascinating unique characters played upon the facades that people keep when trying to fit in the challenges of motherhood space travel family secrets and on and on","632":"i think the book was about a relationship between a husband and wife didn't like the ending it left too many questions for me","633":"definitely a tearjerker maxon reminded me of sheldon cooper from the big bang theory","634":"an unusual quirky story that may have been better read than listened to the reader had a strange high pitch voice i liked the message that we all have stuff and must carry on","635":"i really enjoyed this book because it is so different from what i normally read it covers autism and space exploration female baldness and the lies we tell ourselves it covers relationships acceptance and forgiveness and it shows just how far we are willing to go to save someone we love it's one of those stories for which it is impossible to do justice with a synopsis you just have to read it","636":"terrific book the kind of thick multi layered plot that can't be summarized easily and beautifully written","637":"nearly 4 5 stars i liked it","638":" although i liked how the author showed the day to day life of sunny a woman and mother who has a son and husband with autism i felt as though the main character had so much time on her hands to dwell on her problems her husband had risen from poverty to become a millionaire genius who won the nobel prize although she cared about bubber her son she was able to leave him with a nanny when it was inconvenient for her to have him around the same was true for her mother she left her mother alone for years because she feared her mother would be critical of her life and i did not understand the role of the local newsman i was never sure if sunny wanted to have an affair with him or not","639":"very strange i'd give it a 2 1 2 it was readable listenable but the plot didn't make a lot of sense and the characters weren't particularly likable","640":"this has to be one of my favorite books of the summer it you like creative plots with quirky characters you will love this you have sunny born in burma to a missionary father and with absolutely no hair her husband maxon is a genius and designs robots to colonize the moon because he is rather like a robot himself their son bubber is a savant but severally autistic this is really a love story but unlike any love story you have ever read fun and creative and not to be missed","641":"one of the freshest unconventional love stories out there loved it","642":"loved the characters give this 3 5 stars bald since birth the pregnant sunny tries to make her family seem normal husband maxon is a nobel prize winning genius and preschool son bubber is autistic already showing genius intellect when maxon heads out on a space mission to start a robot colony on the moon sunny begins to understand that no family is normal wanted this very different story to continue","643":"quirky great concept great characters and storyline thoroughly enjoyed it","644":"really enjoyed the beginning thought it would be a 5 star book lost it for me somewhere around the last third of the book and i didn't care for the way it ended","645":"there were some beautifully written passages in this novel but at times i thought the story line was slow or disjointed i also thought the ending was rather abrupt","646":" this book was truly amazing a unique story about so many unique and strong characters a mother with a very young autistic boy and a baby on the way her husband a genius out in space to set up a robot colony on the moon and a mother dying of cancer you find out that everybody has a secret that don't think the world would understand and yet they are who they are in the end they have to be true to themselves to feel like they are really living i would love to give it more stars but although the story was great i would not be able to read it again there was a lot of offensive language and sex was described in great detail i don't think either added to the story and at points it was distracting","647":"i didn't like this one couldn't connect to the characters or the story","648":" maxon's autistic mind parses the world through formula infused thoughts he's married to sunny his lifelong love a born hairless free spirit whose artistic acumen has allowed her to construct the facade of suburban normality she thinks is best for their young son but as the novel opens things aren't going so well maxon is flying to the moon on a nasa mission with robots he designed to build a lunar colony but his now meteor damaged rocket is drifting lost in space and cut off from all earth communication sunny is on an hurried errand in her minivan but her car is hit by a land rover sending her wig out the window and into a muddy puddle exposing her bald secret to the world plus her mother is dying slowly in the local hospital her son is medicated with an ever changing pill regime to quash his autistic behaviors and her uterus is holding a new baby who's threatening to come out too early flashback scenes in the rugged rural pennsylvania town where sunny and maxon grew up and burma where sunny was born to a missionary father and a determined mother fill out the story which reads like science flecked poetry shine shine shine captivated and charmed me completely i love its celebration of neurodiversity and as someone who has been temporarily hairless through chemotherapy i'm thrilled to read a book featuring a bald woman","649":"did not like the book at first but am glad that i stuck with it i grew to love the relationship between sunny and maxon their love was so unique and incredibly powerful and in the end i found the book to be similar","650":"everything is relative how we perceive ourselves our interaction with others and the world i feel this book explored that theme","651":"very different and remarkably beautiful characters that didn't come from central casting a delightful voice in writing and a fantastic weaving together of storylines i really don't know how to describe this book it simply did not come from a formula it would be a great book club choice and i know i will return to it again someday because i couldn't have gotten everything from it that is there really terrific book","652":"to be honest i'm not really sure what to say about this book there were times when i thought ah something exciting or brilliant is about to happen but it never quite came off the characters are curiously interesting but they did but come alive for me did not extend beyond two dimensional beings the concept plot idea was an intriguing one however","653":"hardcover book was a good weight for comfortable reading typesetting was pleasant and easy to read most interesting aspect of book was that the story followed character development instead of the other way around recommended for disaffected college students people who like when books end before their stories do and people who view males as a lesser gender","654":"i enjoyed this unique love story about the human condition and parenthood there are heartbreaking scenes with the mother who is coping with an autistic son and husband and her journey of self re discovery i think it could have been more of a 4 star book but it really loses cohesion at the end and it read as if the last part of the book was hurried and possibly had the meaning edited out","655":" the saying goes \"a lid for every pot\" and after completing shine shine shine the debut novel by lydia netzer readers will most likely heartily agree maxon and sunny mann seem like the ideal young and upcoming couple maxon is a genius engineer who has been tapped by nasa to complete a mission to the moon where the robots he has developed will establish a lunar colony sunny is the perfect suburban wife and mother she is pregnant with their second child and while their first son bubber is autistic and her mother lies dying of cancer in a nearby hospital sunny manages to ensure that things run smoothly yet things are not as perfect as they seem before maxon's departure the couple's marriage had experienced some turbulence while after a minor car accident throws sunny into a life altering reflective period meanwhile maxon's rocket is hit by a meteor and with his return to earth in question he too begins to look back on his life and his relationship with his wife each must confront their own quirks and decide if the future they desire can encompass their true selves and not the images they have been portraying netzer tackles the daunting themes of motherhood normalcy and what it means to be human flaws and all with grace and intelligence shine shine shine is a beautiful if not unconventional love story one that deserves wide readership","656":"loved this line she wanted to install a brightly colored button on the inside of the kiln if you are alive and being wrongfully cremated press here i found sunny's mom to be an increasingly creepy character and felt less sorry for her towards the end of the book #crazy manipulator","657":"really enjoyed this quirky book very different characters i will remember for a long time","658":" i am a fast reader the way other people are fast eaters if it's good i read it as fast as possible thankfully i found myself slowing down and savoring shine shine shine by lydia netzer i not only didn't want to finish it i wanted to hold it in my mouth for as long as i could - every word every sentence and when i was finished i felt full satisfied shine shine shine is the story of a husband and wife maxon and sunny who are both notably 'different' sunny because she is and always has been completely hairless and maxon because he likely has some form of asperger's they have modified themselves as best they can for each other and the world at large in order to fit in the story explores what happens after maxon leaves on a rocket to colonize the moon with robots that he has invented while sunny remains on earth with their four year old son and another baby on the way tthis is lydia netzer's first novel and she totally commits to it she nails the tone the characters the pace and the story she doesn't shy away from the awkward or unusual besides space exploration and baldness the book is littered with unexpected moments that are as bizarre as life itself what might seem like a manipulated plot twist in the hands of a less gifted author just become another oddity in the small odd little world she has created in shine shine shine the story is told in a series of reveals each one a little jewel set in a beautifully written box i especially loved the moments when the book seemed to veer off in a completely new direction forcing me to let go of any sort of cause and effect expectations and just let the story happen reading shine shine shine is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle without the picture on the top of the box to guide you it takes a lot of trust in an author to go along with this type of writing but netzer never falters and the portrait of maxon and sunny that is revealed by the end of the work is exquisite by then netzer's characters are no longer flawed and different they are intensely and perfectly human but be careful while you are busy falling in love with maxon and sunny you might also inadvertently fall in love with your own inner geek so pull up a seat at netzer's table and savor this fine novel you won't go away hungry bon appetite","659":" expectations are everything this book was described to me sight unseen as a sci fi fantasy and that description colored my entire reading every time maxon was called a robot or sunny treated as an alien i thought it was true or at least that it could be true or that robots and or aliens would make an appearance at any moment spoiler alert maxon is not a robot and sunny is not an alien _shine_ should be studied as a case for how narrative voice shapes a story i didn't always like appreciate engage with the voices but it sure did establish character and move the plot along maxon clearly has asperger's but isn't labeled as such so his analytical language and methodical approach comes across as robotic and the fact that he builds robots well you can see why i kept expecting this book to veer off into sci fi land but it doesn't it's real i loved that tension between the real and the fantastic because often real life feels fantastic and those on the spectrum can seem robotic alien generically fantastic to those not on the spectrum and vice versa i'd assume but the book begs the question what if what we relegate to a diagnosis is actually the next step in the evolutionary process the stepford wife issue was also interesting sunny's manic obsession with being not just normal but perfectly trendsettingly normal had me almost convinced that she was an alien masquerading as a human think _coneheads_ with better fashion sense and less consumption of mass quantities i appreciated sunny's searingly cynical descriptions of her neighbors and neighborhood though it felt a bit like an authorial soapbox rant against suburban sprawl and her opinions on motherhood the good the bad the inescapable rang true for me hmm i just spent 3 paragraphs waxing literary on the merits of _shine_ and yet only gave it 2 stars there is so much to dissect and deconstruct so much to say so many societal issues and narrative techniques to consider and yet it wasn't a fun read it wasn't enjoyable for me i couldn't ever close the distance between my reviewer book club brain and my reader escapist brain","660":"well written very strange story i don't know if i really understood the ending but have no desire to re read anything","661":"i loved this book told with flashbacks and present day and from different characters the story is both awkward and heartwarming","662":"this review originally posted at more than just magici remember last year when shine shine shine came out it received rave reviews from publications and fellow bloggers and i knew i had to check it out i was also incredibly intrigued by the myriad of genres that were attached to it science fiction contemporary literary fiction romance magical realism i've seen it described as all of the above having now read the book i still don't know if i can agree with any all of those but i digress on to the content of the book itself shine shine shine is a challenging novel there's a lot at play here i like novels like this books that require me to take some time and really think about what i'm reading listening to and to question what's really being said below the surface of the story i don't claim to understand everything that's going on in this book - or even most of it but there were two elements i found especially interesting shine shine shine focuses on two central figures - sunny and maxon it switches back and forth between two times in their lives their present life as a married couple and their time growing up together from childhood to adolescence to young adults i loved this juxtaposition of their lives growing up together and their lives post marriage i found it interesting to watch them grow together and grow apart and and see how their previous decisions influenced their present life in addition to their relationship i found that a central focus of shine shine shine is motherhood sunny being a mother to bubber she's now pregnant for the second time she's forced to make a decision regarding the prolonged car of her mother or pulling the plug and maxon's very complicated relationship with his even more complicated mother it gives you a lot to think about looking at motherhood through all these different angles as you can see shine shine shine was a book that sat heavy in my mind both while i was listening to this audiobook and after it was over though i felt the the ending was quite abrupt and i definitely wanted more to the story i can't help but admit that this is an incredibly well written narrative recommendation if you like books that are constantly eating away at your thoughts and leave you asking questions you had never considered before shine shine shine is for you notes of the audiojoshilyn jackson is a good narrator i really felt like she was sunny her personality came through loud and clear but in addition she also able to affect other unique characteristics in bubber maxon maxon's mother... the list goes on everyone feels incredibly unique and i never once got one character confused for another however despite the quality of the narrator i wouldn't recommend shine shine shine as an audiobook since it shifts from past to present so frequently i found it a little disjointed time shifting would've been easier to keep straight in print maybe it's just me but i find the little headers with the date year extremely helpful","663":"i couldn't get into it i didn't like the characters or the writing i don't think i even made it halfway so maybe it gets better but it wasn't worth it to me to find out","664":"it was a little weird ok but weird","665":"tedious disjointed and weird slugged through to the end just to see what the point was but i couldn't wait to move on to something else just wasn't for me i guess","666":"i love giving new authors a chance to impress me thank you ms netzer for doing just that shine shine shine absolutely dazzled me this is a story told mostly from the perspective of sunny mann sunny lives in the perfect community she has perfect hair she has the right clothes and is pregnant with her second child not everything is as perfect as it would seem that perfect hair is a wig sunny is bald sunny is married to maxon who is a socially awkward genius who has invented robots that will colonize the moon they have a son bubber who is autistic sunny's mother emma is dying they have secrets but they also have love this book could not be more unconventional and strange and that made it even more glowing for me","667":"very original story and unique characters the ending could have been a bit less ambiguous but overall very good","668":"gave up on it early on and then tried it again ended up liking it definitely different but interesting","669":"definitely different but a good read","670":"so i had some issue with the character development in this book especially the character of sunny perhaps i was equating her too closely with alice in what alice forgot but i had a really hard time identifying with either sunny or maxon that said the plot is unlike anything i have read before so it still gets four stars","671":"took a few chapters to get into but after that it was hard to put down loved the unique characters great message in this story","672":"i am less and less of a fiction fan as i get older but this quirky book really appealed to me","673":"i grappled somewhat with what rating to give this book but i have to go with my gut and stick to three stars it just didn't feel complete enough to get four i was immediately endeared to this novel because it's set in a neighborhood i used to live in and loved but unfortunately that was the only thing that truly felt real to me the story was very interesting but not enthralling i didn't have the compulsion to keep reading keep reading turn another page but it was there when i had the time and kept me entertained the main problem i had is that the protagonist sunny just didn't make sense to me the girl in her and maxon's memories didn't mesh at all with the wig wearing woman in the present while i got why she felt the need to change everything in order to be a mother it just never seemed true to the character that was actually written there was a complete disconnect for me she wasn't likeable which is okay but there just wasn't enough there to redeem her by becoming this other person so she could be a fit mother she actually turned into a completely self centered liar and when she suddenly decided no more wig there wasn't enough depth to really make me care about her journey she was just flat the climax of the story was so rushed and the les weathers revelation felt so odd in ways and then sunny was back home on a rug and it just didn't work for me the ending left something to be desired i don't need everything to be tied up neatly but it was too abrupt maxon was incredibly interesting to me but his absence was the most present thing about him so it was hard to care for him either emma the mother gave me one of the few emotional responses i had during the entire novel when she died when she was caught in a memory and just didn't finish the hello goodbye at langley made me tear up but it still lacked the depth of emotion that should've been present reading through other reviews of this story i feel like i missed something but i'm not sure that i did it was a good effort a unique story and writing style but it just fell short for me","674":" this amazon review summarizes my viewpoint quite well shine shine shine is a hard book to describe when i've recommended it to friends i've told them just read it it's a love story some of it's science fiction it's a drama a mystery and a story about people who aren't perfect and are complicated it's about a very unique and unusual family who for much of the story seem pretty normal to their friends and neighbors although they're anything but that these characters have such depth and it's so easy to empathize with them especially the wife and mother sunny lydia netzer has a way of getting the reader's attention from the first few pages and then involving you deeply in the lives of these characters i couldn't put the book down it's difficult to describe the story to someone because there are so many things happening and i discovered so much about the characters as more and more was revealed as i turned the pages","675":"unique storyline it may grow on me more with time","676":"4 5 stars there are a lot of things to love about this book it's a great story and the imagery the author is able pen is nothing short of beautiful i shorted what could easily be a 5 star rating due to some parts of the story that became too scientific for me it made complete sense for the character but i feel it took me away from the story whereas otherwise i could have been totally swept away","677":"wow just beautifultotally carried away by the charactersso glad i read itso moving a truly unique love story","678":"amazing novel doing an exceptional job of representing autistic characters without the author herself being autistic easily makes my top 5 books of 2012","679":"this is a weird book the player in my car kept the cd jumping around plus that the story line kept jumping around in time i thought the book would be interesting with a character who was autistic and that part of the story was interesting i kept fast forwarding at the parts where his girl friend kept forcing him to do sexual things when he didn't want to do them in an interview with the author she said the character of the girl was based on two college friends and on herself that was strange i wasn't that thrilled with this book","680":"enjoyed this book if you're at all a fan of the big bang theory think sheldon's life as an astronaut husband and father to an autistic child makes you think about how we all view normal i'm a big believer that if you have to chose between normal and weird normal is always the more boring choice","681":"meh the synopsis has been covered i'll say this i enjoyed the characters i enjoyed getting the back story as the book went on the ending left me so flat though it felt like netzer decided the book was long enough and just quit i needed more conclusion happy tragic something i felt like my precious reading time was a waste sigh","682":"parts of this book were really enjoyable but overall i found it rather weird and the ending a bit disappointing","683":" from all the positive reviews about this debut novel i was expecting a lot more from it unfortunately i found the characters hard to connect to plasticy to borrow the phrase from our bookclub discussion but that may have been the author's point to have empathy for those suffering from disorders such as autism which make it difficult to relate socially to connect to others nonetheless i struggled through this book and while there were some lines of prose i appreciated i doubt that i will read another by ms netzer","684":"i loved this book fascinating characters and unique plot it was an easy read i read it in a day but definitely worth it leaves you with a lot of questions and a lot to think about are we still evolving what separates us from the robots","685":"this book had great passages that i would fly through but then it would screech to a halt for me in spots i did appreciate the details about autism a different read","686":"there are three things that robots cannot do wrote maxon then beneath that on the page he wrote three dots indented beside the first dot he wrote show preference without reason love and then doubt rational decisions regret and finally trust data from a previously unreliable source forgive","687":"yep i liked this one and i used it for a work review http carnegiestout blogspot com 201","688":"i liked the quirky characters and the unconventional love story an interesting read but i didn't really connect emotionally to the story not sure why but i still think it deserves 3 stars","689":"some of the moments were surprising and triggered a strong emotional response i started reading on a short flight and cried while reading some of the passages describing sunny's experience at her mother's bedside this book wasn't on my 'to read' list but i was interested in the idea of including mathematical equations so wanted to see how the writer had done that and that i enjoyed the story and the writer's voice was a nice surprise","690":" i liked this book very quickly and realized it was going to be hard to review trying to describe the plot is either going to simplify it and not do it justice or will cause people to make a confused face and back away slowly it is so good instead of plot i'm going to talk about characters and a little bit of plot sunny was born bald and stayed bald no eyebrows no eyelashes no hair on her arms or legs she seemed to be just a big head that needed to be protected from the sun she had a mother who did protect her from the sun and from people in life who would be cruel maxon was born into the wrong family an appalachian family poor and abusive they couldn't comprehend his intelligence his inability to take orders or follow directions and why he doesn't want to spend time in a run down house where sheep live in rusted out cars and where fists and belts make pleasant conversation maxon and sunny met when they were children sunny's mother quickly saw that maxon was different and needed guidance perhaps she knew what asperger's was or she just saw that he needed an understanding mother figure she began to teach him social skills - how to react to people's voices and body language what phrases to memorize so he could respond to people in an acceptable way sunny helps with this letting him know when he's doing things right as they grow older maxon falls in love it is logical and complete and he waits for sunny to come to him he deals in absolutes and when they are both still young he recognizes that she is his mate his logic also recognizes that she will do other things but eventually will return to him simply because they are supposed to be together it's mathematical logical quantifiable and beautiful years later maxon takes his assigned place as sunny's husband and sunny decides it's time to take on the role of perfect wife perfect neighbor and perfect mother a wig appears false eyelashes glued on eyebrows she has assigned herself this task and applies herself to it just as maxon applies himself to his job at nasa he is confused by sunny's role but she continues to train him in what she needs and how he should react he is in love and happy but confused at the new formulas that are introduced and everything changes when a rock hits a rocket and a car hits a car this book works because of how carefully and thoroughly netzer created sunny and maxon again trying to explain the plot feels impossible because it's both complex logic and pure love emotion and logic don't often mix well but here it is perfect netzer created something amazing and her formulas throughout the book applying human emotion and reactions into math for maxon to access are brilliant and way above my basic grasp of math i wanted everything to work the story is told with many flashbacks and even though i knew they were married i still worried and wanted to be sure the pieces all fit when things began to change in present time i worried that it was too late to fix misunderstandings and anger there is so much happening in this book that it could have easily fallen apart with sunny on earth dealing with her own crisis and loss of self and maxon in space with a crisis of mechanics and possible destruction i had to stay up way past my bedtime on a work night to find out how it all ends i love when a book is so satisfying netzer really nailed it the plot the characters the love the logic the emotions... it's beautiful and wonderful and i have no clue how she made it work","691":"audio version a great first novel fun literary science fiction looking forward to see what she does next","692":"love the book and the complexity of the characters however i don't like cliffhangers so the end of the novel was a big letdown for me","693":"quitting at page 109 maybe it is just bad timing but just not feeling it for this one i've decided i'd rather spend my reading time elsewhere","694":"this was an odd book reminded me somewhat of john irving's odd collection of characters in his books like the world according to garp wasn't my favorite book but i did appreciate the message that there's no such thing as perfect family and the sooner you realize that the better imperfections are what make us who we are sunny and maxon has an especially unusual family their imperfections are what make them unique i wasnt a big fan of the ending but overall this was an okay book","695":"this book is fantastic it's smart beautiful and looks at people who don't fit into the mainstream in an interesting way it also questions whether we view autism correctly in our society is it a condition or evolution compelling and wonderful reading i enjoyed every word","696":"poor bald sunny with her awful baldness it would be interesting to see how often the word bald appears in this book i really grew tired of hearing about sunny's self consciousness and how she transformed into conventional suburban mom with her blonde wig really sunny had much larger issues to deal with but the author didn't develop them nearly enough can't recommend this at all to read or to listen to","697":"this was different than anything i've read in a long time part love story part sci fi part comedy it was odd and quirky and totally great","698":" shine shine shinebylydia netzermy in a nutshell summary sunny and her husband maxon and son bubber live in virginia maxon is in space bubber is autistic sunny is pregnant and her mother is dying my thoughts after reading this book whew my thoughts are all over the place while i am quite certain that this book is probably close to brilliant it was not a book i enjoyed reading sunny is bald and no one knows it until her wig flies off bubber is sad maxon is lost in space there were tons of little stories within the big story that explained the personalities of sunny and maxon being born bald no hair no eyebrows no eyelashes living in burma the death of her father meeting maxon sounds reasonably normal but it was far from normal again pretty much everything in this book was out of the norm i think i read this with a sort of weird fascination for everything that happened even a parent teacher meeting at bubber's school turns into a life changing event for sunny and bubber things that happened were funny but i could only see them as sort of odd and sad while i prayed that none of this stuff would ever happen in real life to anyone what i loved about this book i loved the author's words i appreciated the characters that she invented it was genius putting bald sunny with weird scientist maxon resulting in a child who is probably a genius too although problematic what i did not love i do not think i much loved sunny's mother and to be honest i am not really even sure why well perhaps for a few obvious reasons i hated the pony story you will know why when you read the book final thoughts i found this book to be strange yet interesting quirky weird characters and settings that were at times funny and at times sad i think it's the sort of book that people are going to love or not love","699":"have you ever seen the tv series six feet under if you force yourself to watch until the very end through all the weird character twists and frustrating plot lines the end is possibly the best 5 minutes of tv i have ever seen this book is a lot like that it took me a long time to get into the story in part because the characters were almost is it possible too quirky sunny a bald stay at home mom to her autistic son and her husband maxon a robot engineer headed to the moon met at the age of 7 this book follows their love story at a time when things seem to be falling apart once their history is revealed more their relationship begins to make more sense and i started to relate to their characters more but it takes a while to get there and i left with the sense that while i understand that everyone has quirks and makes mistakes there is no way that one street could harbor that many strange people","700":" i would have given this five stars if the ending didn't feel so abrupt however i loved it i thought it was strange and confusing but so were the characters and that made it feel really real it was a smart love story and painted an accurate picture of what it would be like to fall in love with someone on the spectrum i was so sad when i got to the end i was reading it on the kindle and so didn't realize that i was on the last page and literally reading the last words of the book i felt so sad when it was over","701":"oh i just don't see the attraction to this story it was sad and depressing characters and situations could happen but i just couldn't be bothered with liking any of them it awas predictable and boring although she does have a nice sense of writing style words made images i would attempt to read another book if it didn't involve a man out in space and his family home i was not as impressed as other critics","702":"shine shine shine is one of the most creative original love stories i've ever experienced actually it is the most creative intelligent character driven intoxicating love story i've ever read the whole concept and story telling was wholly unexpected and weirdly wrought like nothing i've experienced i loved it i highly recommend it","703":"i was really drawn in by the opening but this book never took off completely for me this book suffered from a little too much going on dying mom husband lost in space autistic son about to have another baby bald come on not quite as good as i wanted but i still enjoyed the read the two letters from the mom were pointless though should have been edited out by someone","704":"i wasn't sure about this to start with but was really worth the read in the end a beautiful tale","705":"billed as scifi which it is most definitely not even though the husband in the story is on a flight to the moon to plant a robot colony the writing style of this debut is absolutely compelling and a truly unusual approach to story telling it's really the tale of two unique people the husband falls into the category of a person with multiple mental and emotional disabilities although to all accounts he's a success sonny his wife bears an external symbol of her individuality then hides it along with her own psychological challenges the writing style with jumps in time back and forth over several decades is a refreshing answer to the multitude of questions that build in the reader's mind","706":"i am captivated form the first page","707":" this book came highly recommended so i think my high expectations for the book may have lowered the rating a bit i also wonder if the main characters struggles just didn't resonate with me all that much which may have lowered my enjoyment of it perhaps when i am a mother i may be able to relate more but for now i thought she was a bit over dramatic about her difficulties with her changing identity and i didn't really connect with her all that said it was entertaining and i enjoyed the story definitely not mad i read it","708":"couldn't finish it i wanted to like this book but it just got too strange i couldn't relate to any of the characters and it was ended up being more of a train wreck that i couldn't turn away from than anything i actually wanted to read blah","709":"i'm so glad to finally be done with this book i liked the oddness of maxon and bubber but sunny the main character was unbearably whiny the whole book was kind of a disorganized mess a chore to get through with only a few moments of touching realness but not nearly enough to make the read worth it","710":"most unusual characters and yet they represent the essence of what it means to be human i finished the book last wednesday and i'm still thinking about them","711":" sunny's life is about to change in a matter of days she sends off her astronaut husband maxon she gets into a car accident that exposes her baldness she takes her son bubber off his medicine which is meant to curb his autism her mother lies in a coma about to die and she is pregnant and about to deliver yet the whole time and for much of her life sunny just wants to be normal but as lydia netzer's debut novel shine shine shine makes most clear normalcy of all things in the universe is virtually nonexistent the world netzer has created is one of seemingly contradictory peculiarities like a charming quirky indie movie these peculiarities aren't ever explained rather they're washed over us and it's expected that we simply accept them for example maxon whose mission is to help create a robot colony on the moon is very mechanical like a child he must be instructed on how to act how to respond in certain social situations he works out equations to help understand human emotions yet he is capable of feeling an intense love and attachment for sunny and sunny for him speaking of sunny her baldness is the epitome of peculiarities in the novel it is a mystery to even her just a medical anomaly but sunny hadn't always worn a wig to hide it at one time she was happily and proudly bald but when she grows up gets married and starts a family this changes suddenly she is never without one of her blonde wigs so much so that almost no one not even her best friends know about her baldness and it is when this security blanket her wig is thrown off in a car accident for all to see and her universe is turned upside down that the bulk of the story begins and a series of life changing events the biggest being an accident that threatens to strand maxon in space tests her patience her will and her humanity shine shine shine is simultaneously compressed and full as it chronicles the few days after maxon's launch as well as sunny and maxon's respective pasts apart sunny's childhood in burma and the disappearance of her father maxon's wild child loneliness and abusive father and together so that by the time the rocket is damaged we're fully invested and through these out of this world experiences we're able to gain insight not into what it means to be normal or abnormal but instead what it means to be human head to www everydayebook com for more ebook reviews","712":"a handful of pages in i wasn't sure about this book but by the end i was absolutely enamored by the intricate and perfectly flawed characters a story about love made stronger by our imperfections and by accepting the flaws of everyone including ourselves we only deepen our connections to each other and how this relates to evolution and society and robots","713":"it's like family based scifi","714":"i received shine shine shine by lydia netzer for christmas and i don't know why i let it sit on my shelf for so long this book was so fresh and vibrant and imperfect and beautiful i loved the characters i loved all their quirks i loved everything about this book that might be considered weird there were times when i would wonder where netzer was going with a description of something that came out of left field but then it all made sense i loved this book","715":"this is a weird weird book i thought i was going to hate the ending but the last chapter redeemed the ending still very strange very strange","716":"one of the most brilliant and original books i have ever read it is the author's first novel but is the work of a seasoned novelist i don't want to say anything about the plot or characters a reader should come at it with no preconceived ideas","717":"what started out as a good premise and engaged me quickly slowly disapted while trying to follow sunny's thought pattern i kept thinking to my self what and where is this going by mid book i was hoping for it to be over i only give it two stars because i have read worse at points it reminded me of the curious dog at midnight which was also a big waste of time","718":"i'm not sure i can summarize this book any better than goodreads does on the official page so go read that what i can say is that this book didn't have a single moment i can point to and say yep this is a first time author this book is seamlessly beautiful i loved sunny i loved maxon even more i think the best thing i can say about this book is that it reminded me very much of mary morrissy's mother of pearl which i believe to be the perfect book about motherhood the tone the themes and the characters were all in some way reminiscent i can't wait until lydia netzer writes another book","719":"can't really articulate what impressed me so much with this book but i loved it an awesome read","720":"i loved that it was a pretty original story but there were a few sections i could have done without overall it was difficult to put down","721":"recommended by staffer melissa read her review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","722":"really weird book but i ended up loving it talk about looking at things from a completely different point of view from a main character who is bald with an autistic child to her husband who is a genius and appears to have asperger's syndrome i was constantly forced to see the connections between the humanity in each of us and the lack of humanity in things very cool reminded me of a guy from work","723":"nice writing interesting characters had a little problem getting into it the beginning seemed superficial but once i got going really enjoyed one image has stuck with me that of the astronaut husband's long legs floating away from him at this remove i don't remember the ending which isn't such a good sign but the theme of becoming yourself was presented in a different way","724":"sometimes incredibly quirky characters kind of bug me and this started this way too anne tyler ish but as the book progressed i really liked it i loved the overall message that really we are all bald you will know exactly what i mean when you read it which i do recommend this is a book club book and i think it will make for a good discussion","725":"it was wonderfully written but not well plotted while my brain can jump subjects as easily as the characters in this novel the disjointedness was consistently jarring it had the short story feel of not getting truly inside anything just describing issues i will read whatever else she writes as i do believe she has talent and skill a very good beginning for a new author with a wonderful voice","726":"i read this book because a friend recommended it it was quite good","727":"i gave up in this book about 100 pages in it did not hold my interest","728":"delightful story written with depth purpose and creativity the characters were unique but relate able took me awhile to get into the story but couldn't put it down during the 2nd half dealt with love and death and living without normalcy recommend","729":"a love story told in quite a distinct style and language i devoured this book","730":"4 5 stars wonderful one of the main characters is now one of my all time favorites formal review can be found here http wp me p1eh9u uk","731":"i cannot rate this book highly or recommend it enough netzer's language is a stunning contemporary weave of lyrical and modern captivating and accessible her characters are layered and unconventional and haunting i wasn't sure about the math aspects of the book but again netzer opens the pathways to the mind of a brilliant autistic man and his developing son her characters and exploration of their minds and hearts made me reexamine my own outlook and consideration of others and made me feel both grateful for and guilty of how easily i understand basic human interaction this is a book to be not only read but savored","732":"quirky book but i enjoyed it","733":"disclaimer part of my difficulty getting into this novel was a bias toward the chapters set in space that is an area of great interest for me however i think author lydia netzer does a good job of thematically linking the sci fi subplot to the main earthbound storyline robotic colonization of the moon notwithstanding this book is ultimately about exploring a woman's haunted soul shine shine shine is something of an interdisciplinary novel which is what drew me to it via the moon mission element at times this multi faceted approach enriches the story at other times it causes the plot to lag and wander regardless there are some great lines from chapter 5 here is one that masterfully sums up the protagonist's journey \"sunny sat like a rip in one of the landscape paintings on the wall a little hub of disbelief in the center of a perfectly good hallucination \"netzer mines her share of prose gems by infusing housewife fretting with galactic conceit here is great example from chapter 19 \"but the wig sat on her head doing its job keeping the roof up keeping the stars up keeping the planets aligned \" still there are times when shine shine shine feels stylistically overindulgent there is something excessively rehearsed about the prose like a magician waving a coin one too many times in front of your face before making it disappear already i sometimes grow tired of intentional use of fragments of ritual choppiness of trending stream of consciousness so you can score big with otherwise pedestrian cadences it's almost as if the novel wants to be a prose poem netzer plays incessantly with chronology as well and throws in a major spoiler or two in case you were thinking of losing interest would the novel seem as compelling if it ever took a chance on being straightforward i don't know in any case it is a good novel at times incredibly good as the portrait of a troubled woman and the planet sized forces pulling at her family shine shine shine is a worthy piece of fiction the characters are interesting and believable the plot is an assortment of conventional developments artfully arranged to amplify effect for me the book's greatest attribute is exploring real life dynamics against the backdrop of a post einstein universe netzer displays a keen understanding of how physics and math can generate existential crises every bit as tormenting as the age old question \"why does god allow suffering \"","734":"this was really 3 5 stars for me this book is a bit of forrest gump meets a beautiful mind meets the new movie gravity a super quirky read but i liked it","735":"this was an interesting novel with unusual characters a mother with alopecia univeralis no less a father with asperger's and a son with autism plus the plot was quirky involving the father as an astronaut who may be lost in space ultimately a novel about a family with unique and not so unique issues","736":"a debut novel that tells what is really means to be a family sunny must come to grips with being bald since birth her husband being on a rocket ship to the moon an autistic son about to give birth to her second child and her mother dying all within the same week i found this book to be refreshing and original beautifully written sunny and maxon could be your next door neighbors again reminding us that things aren't always as they seem","737":"i wasn't too sure about this book at first but it proved itself to be a beautiful unconventional love story left on earth literally by a space traveling husband sunny is pregnant with her 2nd child and caring for her young autistic son sunny was born with a condition that left her bald but since becoming a wife and mother she has put on a wig and the misplaced face of an enthusiastic suburban housewife and mother when her husband leaves for a space mission she is lost and discontented with this life she has created for herself through a series of events and encounters she ditches the wig and starts to find herself again and rediscover the intense love she has for her husband there are some beautiful painful passages in this book that really reflect the intensity of their love for each other carefully and yet effortlessly crafted this novel is unique and well worth the read","738":"this was an interesting story i really liked the characters they were so odd it took way too long to read as life kept getting in the way i found the ending incredibly disappointing like i spent all this time getting to know all of the eccentricities of everyone just to be dropped off u0026amp not allowed to finish hanging out with them","739":"stop reading the reviews just grab a hold of the book and start reading","740":"this was a very different book there are many stories weaved together as told by sunny the main character and her husband lots of flashbacks into their childhood a well not one of my favorite books but was worth the read","741":"i was impressed beyond measured a totally original read i never heard read nor have seen anything like it it the story of the two extraordinary people but so much more a truly stunning debut","742":"maybe it was because i had read so many glowing reviews of this book before i read it but it just didn't live up to my expectations on one hand it was an interesting well written book on the other hand i didn't finish it and think it was anything special","743":" what a quirky book the story is about sunny a young mother who not only has a full plate it is over flowing sunny has alopecia areata born with no hair anywhere on her body the family lived in burma and sunny's mother decided not to let her wear wigs sunny's father was a missionary all of this served to make sunny a little different from the average kid sunny's husband maxon had a difficult family he appears to have a significant autism but no label was ever put on him he is an astronaut and for most of the book is in a rocket on his way to the moon how could you leave your pregnant wife about to deliver to go to the moon suny and maxon are parents of a 5 year old who definately does have autism and is having issues at school sunny's mother is in the last stages of dying from cancer sunny is trying to be a great mom and wife but everything is trying to come unraveled the book goes deeply into each person's story and there is much more than might be apparent","744":"this is a very good story for anyone who is different knows someone different or wants to be someone different the story line is quite unique and well written","745":"beautiful story that touched the core of humanity it's the kind of book i want to write someday except maybe without the robots not that the robots are bad but rather that i don't tend to think in robotic terms nor do i observe social interactions as mathematical equations code but i love that this book goes there","746":"i did give this book five chapters and couldn't get into the story i find these days if i don't like the characters enough to want to spend time with them that i go on to some that i do i may come back to it someday but at the moment i have several other books waiting for me that have priority so back to the library it goes","747":"vivid characters living in a world that seems close to the one we live in sunny represents some part of all of us the one we like to pretend is hidden or non existent we struggle right along with her i loved the book and her way with words","748":"i loved this book it delighted me totally","749":"light read with interesting characters","750":" a most curious story at one level the out of this world elements make it hard to relate to if you want to get into character that is but at another level we can all relate to sunny's struggle with identity our complicated lives with demands in all directions challenge identity in each and every one of us at heart this is a charming character study of what it's like to be an insightful ambitious and caring adult in this modern age where rocket and computer science by far out pace medical science","751":"loved the voice and the themes of this book laughing out loud on one page crying on the next read almost the whole thing in one day of travel hell an incredibly touching story of how flawed we all are yet how worthy of love","752":"i liked the way the present and the back story were woven together i did feel like i wanted more in many cases especially the ending","753":" beware unimaginative use of the f word is excessive especially in the last third of the book other than that surprisingly beautiful sunny is born without hair her genius autistic nobel prise winnning husband is on a scientific space mission to populate the moon with robots and has no or limited contact in their million dollar home neighborhood sunny combats their autistic son her due any time baby her mother on life support while juggling her own identity crisis pretty much alone i like a plot with more than one thing happening and there is a lot going on in this book sometimes it's a little confusing when it does a flashback but after a couple paragraphs i'm back in i absolutely love the simplicity of the love between maxon and sunny pg 194 195 so beautifully stated i get so annoyed with the over exaggeration of emotion in books recently almost like the authors don't know love themselves so they have to use every possible phrase they can think of to convince the reader that its the real deal i recommend this to those who don't mind constant profanity bombs there is also a pretty descriptive sex scene that may wide eye the twilight readers","754":"this is like no other book i've ever read really enjoyed the story the characters especially sunny and how the book ended","755":"this was a book i was unsure about when i started reading it but it really grew on me like many others have noted the characters become more real the further you get in the book the full extent of their relationship is given beautiful poignancy as we watch maxon trying to get back home and his wife and children needing him to come home an unexpectedly joyful book for me","756":"i loved this book it's part sci fi part literary fiction but mostly a love story her descriptions of the acts of birth and death are really powerful the characters are so full and flawed and you completely root for them such an enjoyable read","757":" for the second time this year i have read a debut novel with a story at once inventive and familiar populated with characters whose wealth of peculiarites only enhance their humanity and believability put forth in writing that is direct yet wonderfully expansive the first was karen thompson walker's the age of miracles the second is this first offering from lydia netzer it's the story of sunny mann housewife mother keeper of secrets and her nobel winning scientist and fledgling astronaut husband maxon caring for her autistic son awaiting the imminent birth of her daughter and dealing with the slow death of her mother sunny takes stock of her life and the choices she's made as well as the ones that seem to have been made for her when the moon mission on which maxon is serving is rocked by an accident sunny must contemplate a world without him while thousands of miles away in space maxon struggles to stay alive and to come home netzer handles sunny's and maxon's interior monologues and flights of memory beautifully maxon's time in space in particular is rendered with a combination of cold logic and wonderment and the flashback portions of the book particularly those that deal with the pair's childhood play and nascent adolescent love affair are warm and inviting a joy to read the whole book is impressive the characters will stay with you long after you're done with the last page","758":"i really liked this book i liked how flawed strange and quirky the characters were outside the box and i loved it","759":"i really struggled to review this book mainly because it is so unique but i think cynthia's review below just a great job of reviewing it","760":"i didn't think i would like this book and it was hard to get into at first but wow what an interesting tale we had one of the longest discussions about this book in book club","761":"raw emotional and ultimately uplifting love story about two very unique individuals who find their way in the world when they no longer conform to the world","762":"can't decide between a 3 or a 4 for this book so 3 5 stars very unique story that i was unsure about in the beginning but ended up really enjoying","763":" this is one of those unique novels where the protagonist isn't particularly likeable but is quite easy to relate to sunny mann like each and every one of us is flawed she spends every waking moment trying to cover up those flaws pretending that her life is perfect from the hair on her head to her quirky husband underneath it all sunny struggles to deal with her past and present the love of her life is autistic and currently in space attempting to colonize the moon her son also autistic is seemingly unreachable her mother is dying throughout all of this sunny is pregnant with her second child a child which she hopes will be the saving grace the perfection in her imperfect world netzer is heavy on the melodrama but it works in a way that makes shine shine shine a very special novel we can all relate to sunny's plight for perfection in one way or another her need to insist that everything is okay and to play it cool on the outside while floundering on the inside is indeed part of the human experience the appeal of sunny as a protagonist doesn't come from her good nature for she is far from an admirable woman sunny's faults fears and selfish motivations reflect the dark parts of our own psyche the parts that say we are not good enough our life isn't good enough and we must right what is wrong repair what is defective there are many times throughout the course of this novel when sunny's thoughts are detestable making her a seemingly uncaring cold human being it's netzer's superior ability to convey the honesty in those thoughts that validates sunny's feelings saving both her and us from our failings any lover of literature will feast upon the layers and complexities of netzer's debut this is great story telling that should not be missed","764":"at times interesting at other times a bit forced i like the idea of asd being natural evolution i can kind of see it","765":"i tried i really tried but i finally gave it up about half way through i just lost interest in the characters and the writing","766":"this book was an odd duck and was really a 3 5 stars for some reason i was under the impression that this was going to be a science fiction novel but it is not that at all... it is a contemporary novel this worked out for me because i tend to like the latter genre more anyway this story is about sunny and maxon they are a unique married couple who were also close childhood friends so they have had a long history together maxon is a scientist going to the moon to start a robot colony there... he also seems to be maybe have asperger's or some other type of autism sunny is pregnant at this time and they have a toddler called bubber who also has autistic tendencies the story goes back and forth between their present life and their past i enjoyed the story when sunny narrated more than when maxon did maxon is a bit too robotic and scientific for me i found myself losing my attention span when it was the maxon parts sunny's parts were much more interesting and spontaneous to listen to i felt that this story was about how we hide behind who we really are how humans put up barriers and facades to fit in to what they think is normal society this book is also about breaking down those barriers and being who we really are in the midst of all this normalcy i have to say that the book got better as it went on and i did really enjoy the story but it took time to grow on me joshilyn jackson was only an ok narrator and this took away from the overall listening experience thus the 3 5 star rating this is the review i posted at audible","767":" this didn't tell me anything i already knew like we all feel out of place make mistakes fight with those we love most and hope to be forgiven for it all but it is told so beautifully netzer really touched me and i enjoyed every page so much if you are or know u0026amp love an eccentric i think you will appreciate this all the more i'm amazed at how engrossing u0026amp engaging this was even though it's not very long how did she manage to describe things so beautifully yet concisely there's plenty going on the characters are richly developed but there are no wasted words","768":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2012 06","769":"between a 3 and 4 but better than average","770":"i grabbed this book off the library shelf thinking it would be an easy distraction i was so wrong a beautifully written novel populated by characters so familiar to me that they seem like family i loved every minute i spent with this book and never wanted it to end","771":"it would be hard to convince a person that people and robots are very similar in their functions well maybe it would depend on who you asked but this text does a great job of drawing out those similarities by cutting into and flaying open the realities of the human experience also it's an entertaining read and it kept me up two hours past my bedtime to finish it a structured narrative similar in my opinion to the curious incident of the dog in the night time this story reminds the reader that it's okay to be who you are and that being yourself is enough in the larger landscape of what i've been consuming lately this story seems to fit the theme you've got multiple characters living multiple lives relatively close to one another and you see how they affect each other as they each pursue their own goals the fun part is seeing how their decisions affect each other and how ultimately they can't do it alone lots of kids need to read this and connect with it","772":"meh couldn't get into this one read 131 pages of 312 but it was all just to weird and rambly just had to put it down","773":" shine shine shine is the story of sunny and maxon and their unusual families a quirky wonderful story with unique well developed and likeable characters there is joy sadness and occasional laugh out loud humor much of the story is told from sunny's point of view and every so often switches to maxom we jump back and forth in time between the present and flashing back to the past to learn about sunny's birth in burma her mom moving them back to the us growing up 'very different' and eventually marrying maxom this is a difficult book to classify i have seen it called science fiction but it's not scifi the setting may be a few years in the future but the story is contemporary fiction it's about relationships family being different and makes us ask the question \"what is normal anyway \" if this all sounds a bit unconventional well it is but it works the audio was beautifully done and a pleasure to listen to joshilyn jackson skillful narration made it easy to follow the different characters and the flashbacks in time her vocalization for bubber who is described as sounding like a duck if a duck talked like a robot is not to be missed the audio is excellent the ending was a little abrupt or maybe i wanted more and wasn't ready for the book to end in spite of that it is a wonderfully charming read that reaches across multiple genres and should appeal to a wide audience entire review on blog http wp me p2ond 5rd","774":" ti've been meaning to get to this one for a while the description sounded too odd to ignore and the reviews have been great it's the story of sunny a bald pregnant woman her autistic son and her autistic husband who is on a space shuttle on a mission to deliver robots to the moon for colonization shine shine shine is actually a pretty great book sunny has always been bald and after the conception of her son bubber she started wearing a wig while living in suburban virginia sunny attempts to fit in with the perfect housewives but after maxon leaves for the moon everything begins to change the characters are unforgettable and though quirky they are three dimensional the love story between sunny and maxon feels believable as does their desire to have normal lives despite their very real differences i wouldn't recommend this to just anyone but those that are willing to get past the strange plot will find a very good story","775":" shine shine shine is a portrait of a marriage that may or may not be crumbling maxon and sunny have known each other since they were 7 and 6 years old respectively and maxon has loved sunny all that time sunny loves maxon too fiercely but beyond their love their marriage is based on their status as outsiders maxon is an autistic genius sunny has a rare condition in which she was born completely bald maxon and sunny were different together and that other ness bound them until the day when maxon decided it was time to have a baby and sunny decided that she couldn't be anyone's mother without hair now their son bubber is in grade school sunny has an expensive set of wigs and they've moved to an exclusive neighborhood in norfolk virginia where nobody knows the secret of sunny's bald head sunny tries desperately to fit in with the neighborhood forcing normality on maxon and bubber then everything changes maxon goes to space on a nasa mission to establish a robot colony on the moon while he's gone sunny is juggling her autistic son her second pregnancy and her dying mother things come to a head literally when sunny and bubber are in a car accident and sunny's blonde wig flies out the window in full view of the entire neighborhood with her secret out sunny begins to re examine her life choices but then maxon's rocket suffers an accident and jeopardizes the lives of the crew is sunny's awakening too late to save her marriage and will her husband come home at all shine shine shine was an incredibly creative book i suppose it's to be expected that when you have two protagonists who are so very different and other the book itself is going to be different i loved it i loved the flashbacks and insights into sunny and maxon's relationship the discoveries sunny makes about herself and her neighbors and maxon's musings on life through a series of mathematical formulas shine shine shine is an intense book not for the faint of heart but it's a rewarding book a book that lets the reader into the minds and hearts of two unique characters lets you watch sunny and maxon's love grow lets you root for sunny to get her head on straight and maxon to get his rocket fixed it's not an easy read but it's one that will stay with you long after you finish the last page","776":" it was hard to get through this book i just could not get into it and usually like books with autistic characters it seemed like such a good story husband in space wife trying to make ends meet on earth sunny was such a strong woman pregnant with an autistic son and mother dying she was also dealing with her own issues i like the underlining message that sunny learns everyone is dealing with something covering it up so no one knows about it she is not alone in hiding things about herself","777":"i loved this book it was a quirky heartfelt story and a gorgeous character study both the writing and the narration were really excellent","778":"more like 3 5 stars i enjoyed reading it but i don't know that i like the authors writing style she's obviously very smart and it's a unique story with a great message but some of the descriptions were just a little out there for my taste a quick interesting read though","779":"i couldn't really get into it i wanted to like it the writing was ok but the characters story just didn't capture my attention","780":"such a unique book after having met the author i can say that she is just as warm and funny as sunny loved it","781":"can't decide between 3 or 4 stars slow at first almost gave up on it glad i didn't very different than anything i've read","782":"i read this on a whim but am so glad that i did told in a non linear style it's the story of sunny a hairless burma born woman and her asperger ish husband maxon who is currently on a nasa mission to the moon woven throughout are stories from their childhood together through the present each revealing their essentially lifelong love for one another as well as pieces from sunny's mother's story it's a story of great depth breadth and growth and i really enjoyed it","783":"great story of a woman who recognizes how she's been living a life of appearances and slowly begins to shed the appearance for the real and begins to see how many others have been doing the same thing great characters who skim the line of caricatures but the reader still connects to them audio is read very well","784":"this book is interesting making it more of a 3 than a two but since a lot of it passed over my head i'll give it a 2 this is definitely a thinking person's book and while i enjoy them time for time i really missed the train on this one","785":"a very quirky book for all my friends you know who you are who have wondered if you are the only human and everyone else is a robot or vice versa sunny is having a bad day her mother is dying her autistic son is acting up she's pregnant her husband is lost in space and oh yeah she's bald can this really all be happening to one woman unique characters and a highly improbably yet somehow believeable plot all make for a tale with a variety of messages we can all benefit from hearing","786":"i absolutely loved this book and will most likely choose it for my bookclub it was oh so quirky and imaginative and engrossing if i were to tell you the plot bald woman autistic son genius astronaut husband dying mother it would not begin to convey the experience of reading it if you have to stop at every sentence and figure out exactly what it means this book is so not for you if you can dive into a book and just go along for the ride then do read it you will enjoy meeting sunny maxon bubber and a few other eccentrics along the way","787":"this was a great book it is smartly written and offers fascinating perspectives on relationships robotics and lunar colonization there are frequent insights about life that make you step back and appreciate a new angle on how people think and interact","788":"i really wanted to like this book it was nowhere near as good as i had hoped it would be and i had to force myself to finish it the end redeemed it a little but my overall reaction is still meh","789":"i would probably give this a 3 5 stars on the scale of strange premises however it would get 5 i saw a review in our local paper about this book first time local author lots of buzz etc thought it looked good and it is the story centers around sonny a follicly challenged bald suburban housewife with a dying mother a husband and son who fall somewhere on the autistic scale asperbergers and the sacrifices she makes to appear normal it all unravels during her second pregnancy when her husband is in space attempting to colonize the moon with robots yes that's right what makes this book good is sonny's self discovery as she realizes she is not alone in her quest and is able to affirm who she and her family really are at the core it is also a moving love story","790":"there is a deep rich and compelling set of themes in shine shine shine which might be best described as a collection of don't judge a book by its cover messages netzer uses these themes though in an incredibly original manner that escapes any characterization of being simply trite a fate that is pretty easy to avoid when your main characters are an aspergers stricken nobel laureate who's heading to the moon to establish a robot colony and his bald wife struggling to maintain a suburban normalcy while the threads of these themes are drawn together nicely there are several other things i quite liked about this debut novel sunny is a richly developed character and one for whom is easy to develop empathy she embodies all that netzer is trying to accomplish and portray she's well drawn and feels very real i also liked the lack of a true ending leaving questions about the plot unanswered was a pretty brilliant way to stay focused on the principal message and not just what in and of itself was a pretty sappy love story that in fact was what i really didn't like about this novel netzer built a lot of potential with a great protagonist an original plot and a classic theme but the story too often felt like a harlequin romance while beautiful observations are studded throughout this work the prose itself lacked consistency and was just simple and quite facile the ending was too abrupt and incongruent with the rest of the novel's pace and netzer's failure to build maxon the same way she developed sunny was a giant missed opportunity","791":"i tried to like this book it was too much work","792":"shine shine shine is sheer genius from beginning to end the characters are wonderfully drawn and the writing is beautiful i have never read a book quite like it and i enjoyed it tremendously","793":"this book was so different i loved it even though i was not sure if i would since it is just as i said so different and took a while for me to get used to if i was hosting book club next i would have picked it just because of the conversation it would generate","794":"i liked some of the characters in this book especially maxon and bubber other characters didn't make sense to me the writing was just ok the arc of the story seemed accidental as if the author was undecided about how to tell her story the result is a storyline that bounces awkwardly between past present and future lukewarm recommendation","795":"i rated shine shine shine by lydia netzer a 3 5 star read shine shine shine is a unique and quirky look at the lives of a married couple who are not normal the story examines the human desire to be normal and like everyone else and the oddball way we can fall in love sunny was born with no hair no eyebrows arm hair lashes etc she meets maxon when they are young he also doesn't fit in he has aspergers and is extremely brilliant emma sunny's mother teaches maxon how to act like a normal human with basic communication pleasantries it's nice to meet you and facial emotions maxon and sunny bond because they both feel like outsiders their love is weird and doesn't seem great from the outside but they fit together the story is set five years after the birth of their first son when maxon is in space to help colonize the moon with his robots and sunny is pregnant with her second child for the past five years sunny has worn a blond wig and taken on the stepford wife persona she puts on a facade of perfection to hide her dysfunction including her autistic son it changes when maxon is in space and sunny starts to realize her facade is not real and not making her happy she looses the wig and stops giving her son all his medicine it is a testament to not fitting in the normal mold and embracing your differences sunny learns that people love her just as much bald or with hair and in many ways people relate to her baldness because they all have things to hide netzer has a unique writing style that was not my favorite but it grew on me as i read it i thought the ending was a little rushed and it fell a little flat compared to the rest of the story endings are always the hardest part in my opinion to write and i think this could have been better however i still recommend the novel it is a very interesting quirky and sweet love story between man and wife and mother and son daughter","796":"a different read for me but so many relevant themes i wasn't sure about the math part of this book at first but it totally gives you insight into maxon we all wear different wigs at times","797":"wow this book blew me away it was an amazing story that was a little bit of everything mystery love story science fiction coming of age motherhood issues i loved it i'm going to miss sunny and her family","798":"a unique but rather unbelievable story was it meant to be a spoof i don't think so making it hard to know how to take it","799":" this book is amazing when it started it seemed a little depressing but both the characters and i got over that it's a beautiful life affirming story plot summary main character pregnant sunny is married to an autistic brilliant astronaut and has an autistic brilliant little son and it turns out she's been going about her life in maybe the wrong way fantastic heart rending characters the author uses language in seriously strange but mind bogglingly gorgeous ways reading this book was like looking at a beautiful stained glass scene from the wrong perspective so the harsh angular lines don't make sense to the eye but then you move and the picture makes sense and it's lovely with bright colors and lots of light i'm very enthusiastic about this book read it now","800":"i wasn't sure about this one at first but i am happy i stuck with it unique and quirky characters","801":" what a book interesting weird in a totally good way not your average set of characters they are very full and real they just make up an unusual family if you think you have it all figured out you only have to turn the page to find you were wrong the plot takes turns you never saw coming sunny's genius husband maxon has just headed off to colonize the moon with his robots her very bright 4 year old son bubber may not be able to continue at his preschool due to behavior problems sunny is fairly certain her mother is getting much better since she was put on life support and just to top things off sunny is very pregnant and very bald sunny born without a single hair on her body is forced by her mother to just deal with it wigless while still children she meets maxon brilliant at math clueless at people they understand each other as different people often do eventually marrying when maxon decides it is time to have a child sunny makes some decisions of her own she wants a normal family she has trained maxon to read people's expressions she scripts conversations for him she buys wigs eyebrows and eyelashes and morphs into a martha stewart y dynamo she sets every stage organizes every event has she fooled everyone has she fooled herself i had no idea what this book was about other than 'family' and after reading it i think it's a great way to go into it it is so different it's almost nuts how easy it is to relate to understand to hope thank you goodreads for the opportunity to read this novel i almost did not write a review it is not required in exchange for the book i'm certain i did not do this novel justice i do hope i've peaked your curiosity this book is too good to miss","802":" loved loved loved this book i think i would give it 4 5 stars but in the interest of math which features heavily in this book but in a completely readable way i'll round it up to 5 basically this book is about a family that's not normal and about a wife who is struggling with how she feels about her not normal existence she bald from birth her husband a genius who is flying to the moon an autistic toddler and another baby on the way the book is quirky but not too cutesy i found myself really enjoying the characters and couldn't believe that this was netzer's first novel i'm looking forward to reading more of her stuff","803":"when you read a lot of novels it is difficult for one book to break through shine shine shine is quite memorable the characters are fresh and likeable and the book travels to some very unexpected places from norfolk va to burma to rural pennsylvania to the moon besides the fact that the relationship between sunny and maxon is on the spectrum theirs is a romance for the ages","804":"like this guy in space wife is pregnant son is autistic","805":"this book was strange and fantastical while still being set in suburbia i liked all the characters and thought that despite the fact they were really different from the 'average' person they struggled with the same things i loved sunny u0026amp maxon's relationship and how it evolved thanks to trudy for getting me a copy of this book","806":"i couldn't put this book down i stayed up until 1 30am on a weeknight just to finish the last half of it and i have no regrets this is not a novel that you should just finish and tuck away chew on it a little bit think about it decipher that strange but happy feeling you have the story the characters the narration it's all a little out there but i felt it was worth it at the end","807":"enjoyed this overall but i prefer when books have a more definitive ending it felt like the author wrote herself into a corner and didn't know how to end things","808":" amazon review when maxon met sunny he was seven years four months and eighteen days old or he was 2693 rotations of the earth old maxon was different sunny was different they were different together now twenty years later they are married and sunny wants more than anything to be \"normal \" she's got the housewife thing down perfectly but maxon a genius engineer is on a nasa mission to the moon programming robots for a new colony once they were two outcasts who found unlikely love in each other a wondrous strange relationship formed from urgent desire for connection but now they're parents to an autistic son and sunny is pregnant again and her mother is dying in the hospital their marriage is on the brink of imploding and they're at each other's throats with blame and fear what exactly has gone wrong sunny wishes maxon would turn the rocket around and come straight the hell home when an accident in space puts the mission in peril everything sunny and maxon have built hangs in the balance dark secrets long forgotten murders and a blond wig all come tumbling to the light and nothing will ever be the same ...my review it was really good and well written it was written differently than any other book i've read but was well worth the read maxon reminded me of some people with aspergers that i know","809":"i liked this book in the beginning and loved it in the middle but it lost me toward the end i'm just going to make up my own ending because the rest of the book was great","810":"absolutely loved this title highly recommend it","811":"i did this book as an audio book and i loved it it is filled with quirky people none of them are really normal i've always enjoyed tv that is filled with the same sort of characters examples would be northern exposure about a village of alaskan residents or ballykissangel a bbc tv series again filled with funny quirky people in this book and these series it's celebrated and ok to be different i think that is what i enjoy most there were parts that i found myself just laughing outloud at the brash ridiculous things that sunny and her husband max would do their son too just reminded me of some of the special children that i have known over the years who are different god didn't make us all to be the same i also enjoyed the voice of the person doing the narration i thought she sounded just as i would imagine sunny to sound and also was great as max and bubbert great book definitely worth my time","812":"this is one of the most unique novels i've read in a long while the love story between sunny a bald from birth heroine and maxon her autistic astronaut husband is like none you've ever read netzer's writing gifts allow us to fully experience sunny's desire to fit in and her grief over her dying mother as well as her strong maternal instincts caring for her autistic 4 year old son and the baby girl she's pregnant with this is a rich rich novel that reminds us what it means to be human","813":" this is a gem of a debut novel i wondered how much i would like a novel about a robotics scientist and his equally brainy wife and their attempts to fit in with normal people but i gave it a chance and found that it contained one of the sweetest love stories i have ever read it also examines what it means to be different and to be hiding your differences in order to fit in only to find out that all of those other normal people are hiding things too the author is sensitive to the nuances of relationships of how people set their goals on certain things then are nudged elsewhere by the people and the world around them and sometimes have to accept the fact that what they wanted to happen isn't always going to happen","814":"ths was a slow read that i never felt totally pulled into","815":" this was right in the middle at 2 5 stars for me but i'll maintain my policy of rounding up this came via my mother who breezed right through it this was surprising because it was very much a 6 week slog for me here's the good about this book it's different nothing i hate more than cookie cutter characters and plots and this is not that it's very creative and unlike a lot of things out there now the author has a very unique and refreshing voice about her high five lydia but the story didn't quite come together for me i got to the end and feel like i still didn't really understand sunny and maxon's relationship at all i never really understood the childhood stuff i didn't understand burma i didn't understand sunny's relationships with her virginia friends i didn't understand the relationship with the mother each of those components i felt were addressed like 35% of the way so it left me really puzzled as to how all of those pieces fit together although look i've inadvertently gone and made an allusion to the international autism symbol so maybe it was in fact intended this way still it left me unable to really form a meaningful connection with the book which was a downer","816":"fantastic novel about a boy genius apparently autistic who grows up to be an astrunaut the woman who loves him and the final journey","817":" shine shine shine by lydia netzer follows the love story of sunny and maxon but it is so much more than just a love story sunny was born completely hairless during an eclipse while her family was in burma her missionary father was executed by the communists and her mother moved back to the states sunny and maxon met as children and knew one thing that they belonged together now married maxon is a very successful nobel winning autistic nasa scientist who is on a mission to colonize the moon with self replicating robots sunny is his very pregnant wife left behind on earth with their autistic 4 year old son bubber in their current suburban life maxon's success has afforded them a model house sunny wears a variety of blond wigs to hide her baldness and keeps an expensively furnished immaculate house it soon becomes clear that sunny has tried very hard to reinvent herself as the perfect suburban mother which has put a great deal of self induced stress on them but after maxon leaves for the moon sunny has a car accident that sends her wig flying off in her neighborhood this exposure of her secret causes sonny to re examine her life and the choices she has made in order to fit in and seem normal then a meteorite hits the space ship maxon is on placing the mission and his life in jeopardy to complicate matters further sonny is now feeling contractions her mother is dying in the hospital and she's re examining bubber's need for medication sunny's on going crisis situation causes her to question if she needs to embrace the idiosyncrasies of her and her family she soon begins to wonder what makes us human and if such a thing as normal exits in shine shine shine lydia netzer has penned a clever imaginative novel full of great descriptive language and unique quirky characters the language flowed beautifully as read by joshilyn jackson on my audio version it has a strong message about accepting the peculiarities and faults of others rather than everyone striving for a stepford like conformity netzer alternates between the points of view of maxon and sunny she also gives us backstory along with current events to help us better understand these characters and their motives sunny is not a perfect character but that was the point she tried to put on the facade and be perfect for others once her cover was blown sunny realizes that she has to accept who she is and who maxon is and who bubber is and that each of them is special and unique very highly recommended one of the bestthis was my first audio book i have to admit that i missed seeing the words in a physical copy of the book i loved listening to jackson read the story however and i'd like to get an audio cd of one of her books just to hear her read it","818":"i wanted to like it more it read like the author was trying too hard","819":"really enjoyed this for a while but then it totally went off the rails by the end i can't remember the last time i was so disappointed in a book's final pages interesting premise lots of good stories in here but in the end the characters fell a bit flat still the parts i liked i like enough to award the book 3 stars","820":"something about this book felt different special a unique sensibility the character of maxon was wonderful i loved when he said he wouldn't have come on the mission if he hadn't known that he could do everyone else's jobs and how emma sunny's mother taught him how to act like a normal person appropriate facial responses and remarks but sunny knew his heart even without those learned responses","821":"loved this book","822":"this was an unexpected delight the love story of a man maxon who uses pseudocode to define his verbal and emotional responses to the world and his wife sunny born with complete alopecia in burma the real heart of the novel is the tension between sunny's desire to fit in with the world as it is and hide her baldness as a metaphor for the things that make us different from others coming to terms with wanting to be the hero of a world of one's own making with those who are different from us being the outsiders the writing is gorgeous the story beneath the story of maxon going to help colonize the moon is interesting and numerous backstories flesh out both characters as full flawed people not just subject to the plot","823":"others have mentioned the quirky characters in this book something i usually enjoy but these characters are just strange also quirkiness needs to be balanced by some normalcy and there was little of that to be found the story intrigued me enough to keep reading to find out how things would turn out but i can't say i enjoyed the journey","824":"interesting but very weird","825":"loved this book very character driven i am in love with sunny and maxon's love","826":"this book took too long to get interesting somewhere after 100 pages in and then once it was getting good it just kind of ended","827":" on the second half of our trip we listened to shine shine shine by lydia netzer and read by joshilyn jackson this was great to also know that the music was composed by lydia too what a talented woman we started this one right after we left white sands new mexico it was perfect coming from a place that made us feel like were on a different planet to a story that takes place on a mission trip to the moon dealing with a genius husband and an autistic son has sunny a lil on edge already now that the trip is dealing with an accident it is getting worse i have to agree that the original music really did transpose us to another worldly experience i loved how the balance of their lives tumbles yet still comes together","828":"good storytelling","829":"the plot line sounded interesting enough to give this book a gander but it was quite a let down sunny is married to her childhood sweetheart maxon who is an genius astronaut with asburgers i don't think they should have married in the first place and her attitude throughout the book is flat out depressing i don't recommend wasting your time on this book","830":"fantastic truly original the main character is a bald woman who is married to a man with asperger's that she met when they were kids and it tells all about their relationship and they turn social situations into mathematical equations to better understand them really cool","831":"great story interesting believable characters to many reviews during the ongoing story sometimes a review in the middle of the review that made main story not as smooth and interesting not sure about the ending","832":"terrible book the only reason i finished it was because it is for book club tons of bad language too much sexual stuff ridiculous story line main character is lame sorry but i really did not enjoy this one","833":"a very good book with a unique plot it's beautifully written by lydia netzer and explores the individuality of the human condition as well as what it means to be alive","834":"a story about trying to fit in which i think everyone can relate to at least a little bit","835":"the book is not a traditional love story but it seemed like a fairly realistic view of relationships and had an important message even though these specific characters are not people i can relate to in my life the ideas are","836":"recognizing that there were some weaknesses in the plot i kinda loved this book especially the part about the robots yes it is weird and i consider myself to have a very high tolerance for weird fiction no it is not about aliens which is what i thought after reading a book review but it's good read it anyway","837":"i didn't enjoy this book at all it took me forever to finish and i was hoping at some point i would get it but i just never did there never seemed to be any real point to the story the characters aren't very likable and the story just never seems to come together","838":"i have a one word review pointless there was absolutely no point to reading this book it started off boring never were there any true revelations and it ended even worse i never cared about a single character in the story not a single one and i don't believe i have ever felt this way before","839":"i enjoyed this but it is super different i read it because an author that i love joshilyn jackson published recommendations for it i'm glad that i picked it up","840":"this is the story of an astronaut who was lost in space and the wife he left behind or this is the story of a brave man who survived the wreck of the first rocket sent into space with the intent to colonize the moon this is the story of a bulge a bud the way the human race tried to subdivide the bud it formed outside the universe and what happened to that bud and what happened to the earth too the mother earth after the bud was burst page 2and with this introduction lydia netzer introduces us to the unique and delightful mann family maxon the genius husband astronaut sunny the slender and many sided and yet clearly focused wife and bubber their autistic child but shine shine shine to be published next month by st martin's press is also about secrets death lying image management and morality in a unique narrative style which reminds me at times of faulkner's stream of consciousness descriptions of his yoknapatawpha county characters netzer peels back the layers of maxon and sunny's souls not just heart but soul as she tells their story of life death re birth through fleeing one country death life re birth and so on through this unique novel the characters are unique maxon is a genus but to this review was borderline mad sunny is wounded but is cold blooded and very measured the support casting of characters especially their mothers add both a veneer of shallow suburban sophistication to a realistic and hard bitten realism that is forged in the pennsylvania woods where maxson and sunny meet in childhood what i liked about this novel is that you never knew where the story was headed as the narrative resides deep within the main character's subconscious thoughts and feelings which are revealed in scenes such as when sunny goes into labor and we read her garbled and pain driven thoughts as she wrestles with this pregnancy while maxon is in space in the pain and the inversion with all her blood a hot bubble in her head she finally knew she was unfit and she was bald i'm sorry said the body to the baby i'm bald i've made terrible mistakes this was a refreshing and surprising novel that will leave you wondering what is going to happen next on my very unscientific scale i rate this novel a great read note i received an advance readers copy of this book via amazon vine review program in exchange for a review i was not required to write a positive review","841":"this is an good first novel a bald pregnant mother is in crisis while her husband is circling the moon and his ship gets hit by a meteorite but the novel is much more much of the novel is told in flashbacks showing how the main characters met fell in love married had kids and also grew apart the main character sunny is a pretty troubled person i liked the book but had trouble with it switching back and forth in flashbacks so much","842":"strange and new","843":"i was surprised to love this book so much it was so unexpected and beautifully written a tender love story told in pieces inbetween a story about marriage family and what exactly is normal","844":"i would give it six stars if i could honestly sometimes a book just comes into your life at the perfect time","845":"interesting look at the world of austism kinda uneventful though","846":"what an interesting story and i am not saying that to be polite an astronaut his pregnant bald wife his son with autism his dying mother in law and a botched space adventure now you see why i say interesting it was a little slow starting but got better the focus of the story was on the wife and how she handled her family i would recommend this book just go into it with an open mind i enjoyed it","847":"weird but interesting","848":"i'd probably give this book 2 5 stars especially since in the first hundred pages i had to pep talk myself to not abandon another book i can't say i like stories written in flashback form but it worked in this the plot was a bit bizarre and the ending felt abrupt and weirdly unfulfilling for the work i felt i put into this book but this book seemed to have something that made me want to keep reading a finish definitely not what i had expected","849":"everyone has been raving about netzer's debut novel but i just didn't connect with it at all i liked maxon better than sunny she puzzled me from beginning to end and i liked any of the passages focused on him more than the ones focused on her the second half picked up but i put this one down at the end almost wondering why i'd stuck with it well i know the answer to that i wanted to find out if maxon survived the accident revealed in the jacket copy","850":"check out http www infinitereads com for other reviews and sundry thoughts through a series of flashbacks interspersed with the present day scenes netzer slowly unravels the history of the imperious bald girl and the abused mathematical prodigy who would grow up to become sunny and maxon forging their bond through a need for human connection as well as their sympathetic gifts free spirited dramatic sunny helps maxon unlock his feelings through his native language of equations while his quiet genius and orderly ways provide a stability sunny returns to time and again their understated yet defining attachment manages to be at once

continue reading -","852":"i finished shine shine shine by lydia netzer and i was surprised to find that it was very very good i don't think i've read such a unique book in a very long time the book only has shades of magical realism to it it is somewhat akin to a prayer for owen meany by irving but without the sad ending i wouldn't say the writing is the best i've seen and that isn't what makes this book it is the story itself and the characters who inhabit it most of all this is a book about finding oneself in a society that tries its best to make cookie cutter humans that are no fuss or bother to anyone it's about finding oneself and breaking out of that to stand tall in your own uniqueness it's about realizing that you have to really accept yourself to accept others and to have them truly accept you once you inhabit these people and their world they will stay with you for a long while","853":"bookclub book ok i finished today and i am so confused about the ending thank goodness we have a meeting coming up wednesday","854":" \"shine shine shine\"--that is what this novel does particularly the language which is deftly and brilliantly manipulated resulting in a book that is \"l\"iterary without ever feeling contrived this triumph of a debut will transfix you if you are the sort of reader willing to be taken out of yourself and away from the life you yourself live don't look for easy identification here--there wasn't a single character who made me say \"that's me\"--instead surrender yourself to an alternate reality that will when you are not looking sneak up on you and cause you to consider the sorts of big picture issues that real literature should raise for example why are we as a society so determined to make everyone fit into the \"normal\" mold even if that means medicating them what is lost what might be gained if we embraced the idea that different isn't bad or scary it's just different \"shine shine shine\" will make you laugh out loud it will make you hope it will make you fear it will make you cry in my case quite publically on an international flight you will remember it long after you put it down because it made you think and that is the point of art isn't it","855":"this book has such a different style in writing and character development that it really doesn't compare to anything else i've read it took me a little bit to warm up to sunny one of the 4 major characters but i fell in love with maxon right away the story was captivating and even suspenseful at times so i really enjoyed the different themes and perspectives of different characters over all this was a really creatively written tale and a beautiful love story so i really enjoyed it","856":"i quit this at 135 pages which i never do that much invested i usually press on but it's dull and it's not going anywhere and i don't care at all today i give myself back the two hours of my life it would take to finish","857":"this book is a mix of improbable circumstances and really authentic characters i thoroughly enjoyed it in part because i really liked the characters the narrative flips back and forth but it's held together well by a compelling main story arc that keeps you turning the page the main point of the book is pretty obvious but the author's style is breezy and in a way self deprecating so it never felt heavy handed","858":"this was ok and kind of odd drug on allot","859":"this book is very different from ones i've read before especially in writing style i particularly enjoyed how raw and real the characters are which allows you time to decide how you feel about them i do wish it was longer but that's more because i wasn't done learning about them this story is about true love in all its forms but not in a gushy way in a robot way","860":"wow i definitely saved the best for last one of my final summer reads and it was wonderful a quirky yet beautiful story about accepting our differences and basking in the glory of them an unconventional love story but one so profound it teaches so much about what true love is all about also an amazingly affirming book for all mothers who wonder if they are doing it right and realize that trusting our instincts is the best we can do","861":"it's hard to imagine anyone picking up this book and not falling for the characters of sunny and maxon thought it was a terrific read definitely recommended","862":"this was a story i hadn't read before beautifully written i had some difficulty at the beginning but after i got to know the characters i cared very much about them maxon is a person we assume is autistic but know is a genius sunny is his hairless wife their son bubber is autistic sunny is pregnant again maxon is on a mission to the moon to set up a colony comprised initially of robots he designed but there's an accident and he may not make it back to earth sunny's mother is dying in the hospital i know it sounds off putting but it really grabbed me it has moments of breathtakingly wonderful writing it has love guilt anger secrets lies and hope it's about identity and parenting and illusion vs reality and love told in a series of flashbacks not necessarily chronological interspersed with maxon in space and sunny on the ground it's extremely well constructed and wonderfully paced obviously i recommend it","863":"if you are left brained this book may be better for you truly up until the last couple of chapters i would have had a hard time deciding whether or not to give this book 1 or 2 stars being a more right brained person myself i found it difficult to follow along at times in several conversations between the main characters breaking free of her insecurities sunny and rocket scientist maxon there are equations to explain thoughts however have no fear if you do not particularly care for equations the thought processes are so drawn out that the reader can still understand the sentiment in them for example one of the easier equations were used to explain their dilemma on how to move from a linear husband wife to a mother father child triangle with maxon being somewhere on the autism spectrum every thought is explained as well as to what is the socially appropriate response there is a vast amount of detail in the training that sunny and her mother emma used with maxon to help him be more socially acceptable there is a lot of detail in sunny's battle between who she is and who she wants to appear to be in order to be socially acceptable due to her genetic inability to grow hair there is quite a hypocrisy with sunny's mother who took maxon in under her wing at a young age in expectations for example she was irate with adult sunny for wearing a wig because she had raised her to appreciate her bald condition yet she was very resistant to the romantic relationship that developed with maxon and sunny because he was different the huge amount of details bulk up the first half of the book which made it hard for me to want to continue to read maybe i'm impatient but i wanted to be able to skim over the for lack of a better word rambling there was a lot of flashbacks which were appreciated in that they built the foundation for the story to come at the end but the flashbacks did not need to be so lengthy the reader doesn't really find out what the story is about until 154 pages in this is the story of an astronaut who was lost in space and the wife he left behind this is the story of a bulge a bud the way the human race tried to subdivide the bud it formed out into the universe and what happened to that bud and what happened to the earth too the mother earth after the bud was burst 154 155 don't balloons get kind of scared floating up through the sky above the grocery store parking lot after all where are they supposed to go now 290 i love these 2 questions but the timing was a bit off these questions were inserted during a flashback where sunny is giving birth to her first child yet another example of bulky filler rambling on the other hand the rambling may have been considered necessary for the author as the reader faces the many conflicts that sunny has to sort through throughout the book all at once although this book was hard to get through at first the last few chapters really bring it all together and make it worth it in my opinion there is not a roller coaster of emotions in this book but that is not to say that you won't feel anything while reading it if you read this book the way that i did it may be confusing at times it may be overwhelming at times but i can promise that in the end it will get better","864":" what a great surprise the first 50 pages in i really wasn't feeling this book i was confused to why there were robots in it and why everything was in the 3rd person 150 pages in i was hooked and didn't want to put it down this book is a love story a bizarre twisted love story about how to love others but most importantly yourself while that may sound ridiculously cheesy in execution it really wasn't the mechanical husband maxom is going to the moon with robots to help prepare for human colonization he's leaving his pregnant bald wife sunny at home with their autistic son bubber nothing is going according to plan sunny is trying to fit in with her wigs and being the perfect mother maxon is unable to express his feelings and lives by science and sunny as the only things in his life that make sense without giving away spoilers this is the story of their past and future and i want more i want to know what happens next i'm invested in this relationship and want to know what goes on next fave quote \"there are three things that robots cannot do wrote maxon then beneath that on the page he wrote three dots indented beside the first dot he wrote show preference without reason love and then doubt rational decisions regret and finally trust data from a previously unreliable source forgive \"","865":"if it was possible for me to give up on a book before the end i definitely would have with this one hate is not too strong of a word for how i felt about the first half however i am always optimistic that the story will get better and it did with this one only marginally better but better nonetheless i eventually ended up caring what happened to these characters as damaged as they were","866":"i am a sucker for books about eccentric characters and space flight","867":" sunny mann is living the perfect suburban life she is married to a genius she's known since childhood she is the organized housewife and mother keeping everyone on track and on time and fits in with her surroundings perfectly except her husband is on a mission to colonize the moon her mother is dying and her son really isn't normal when a crack works its way through her external veneer sunny's perfection shatters and she has to figure out how to get through the chaos and deal with the imperfect a moving story about love family being a mother and being your true self whoever that may be and however different that may look from normal","868":"wow that was a very weird book quirky is the phrase used most by people discussing it and i agree it was all over the place one reviewer said there were no normal people in it and i think she's right just when you think a normal narrative is going to break out it goes flying off into space literally in some cases i appreciated the bond between the two lead characters but it was just too bizarre a tale in it's telling for me to recommend it","869":"highly recommended hard to describe robots to the moon autism alopecia universalis a love story that even guys will like truly a great work of art","870":"odd absorbing story told in many layers of two gifted but completely flawed humans it transports you to two different worlds u0026amp never let's you get comfortable","871":"very impressive particularly the way it deals with autism but then netzer tries to do too much at the end watering down her strongest story arcs","872":"this is the most unusual love story i have read the lifelong relationship between maxon a brilliant but somewhat autistic man and sunny who hides her uniqueness behind the facade of susie housewife is a fascinating struggle to redefine family life this becomes particularly difficult when maxon a scientist astronaut leaves for a moon expedition while his wife is pregnant with their second child and is in despair about raising their son who is perhaps an exaggerated version of his father sunny's way of dealing with family stress is refreshingly different and as i flipped the pages i alternatively teared up or laughed out loud i would recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a tale of unusual folks who battle with the usual family and spousal challenges","873":"one of my favorites the prose is gorgeous i was hooked from the beginning with the stunning description of earth from space i don't know why folks think of this as a love story sure there's love in it but this book is about so much more who fits in and why what guides those who don't fit the mold of expected behavior i found myself repeatedly wanting to read passages aloud this book is worth the read just for the take on robots and the mind bottom line it's dazzling it sings","874":" i don't even know how to begin to review this book so many people seemed to love it and yet i did not my thoughts when i was finished ranged from huh to meh we read it for book club and none of the five people who read it liked it the reason i'm giving it two stars is because i did like the character of maxon and there was a period of time in the middle where it started to grow on me and i thought it was finally going to get rolling but then the last third was a hot mess i cannot understand how more people weren't annoyed and frustrated by all the plot twists that appeared in the last part of the book but were not even remotely addressed or resolved i don't know if that's what the author was going for but the majority of our discussion at book club revolved around all these shocking events that occurred in a very short period of time that were never explored or explained to avoid spoilers but for those who have already read it i'll just say les weathers and emma's revelation and the bridge memory and bubber's reaction within just hours of being taken off of his meds i could go on and on so many holes in the plot i don't need every book to be wrapped up in a tidy little bow but some of these plot twists had the potential to make the book a lot more interesting and yet they were barely explained at all so frustrating i liked the concept of sunny's baldness and how it made her behave both as a child and an adult i really liked maxon i used to teach children with autism and his portrayal was pretty spot on i had moments where i liked sunny but many more where i didn't i didn't like any of the supporting characters and i thought the book was choppy and full of holes there were way too many messed up people living on the same street i get that we're supposed to think about the fact that we're all human and every one of us is hiding something but this was pretty over the top and just bizarre i'm glad so many people enjoyed it it definitely wasn't for me i love a good thought provoking book but i don't understand all the hype for this one","875":"charming but odd","876":"i really liked the whole book but i wasn't thrilled with the ending still worth reading in my opinion","877":"very thought provoking","878":"fantastic book","879":" this elegant story of an autistic astronaut his pregnant hairless wife and their families is the right mix of sad sweet wacky and bizarre the husband and his custom nasa robots are headed up to moon to colonize it when a meteor hits his space ship as he and his fellow astronauts attempt to fix the ship to save the mission and themselves the wife is on earth attempting to decide whether to take her mother off life support she is also being courted by the very handsome and not autistic weatherman has to deal with the problems inherent in raising a child with autism and on top of all this is about to have her second child any moment best book i've read in a long time","880":"reading through the reviews and seeing how many people gave this book 4 or 5 stars makes me feel like i missed something i definitely didn't love this book although there were enjoyable parts i like the author's idea that we are all flawed in some way and her exploration of the transition women go through when they become mothers i also liked parts of sunny and maxon's relationship but it took me forever to get in to the story and then the ending seemed very rushed ultimately this book was just a little too odd for me","881":"truly weird novel a young family dealing with autism baldness and brilliance conceal their 'truths' to fit into society delving into their past love story reveals that conformity isn't worth social confinement","882":"this was a great book very internal and really made me think about the ways i try to fit in","883":"her writing is amazing i was torn between finding this painful and loving it i was definitely drawn in about half way through","884":"imaginative funny odd quirky enjoyed it","885":" here's a point to ponder we're all flawed but the good news is that it's these flaws that make us us indeed that make us human throw in a robot constructed moon colony a burmese born bald woman named sunny and flashbacks i mean a ton of flashbacks to childhoods and adolescence and you have the general framework for lydia netzer's debut novel shine shine shine maxon mann is a socially awkward and way too literal minded robotics engineer he's the genius behind the design of a moon colony completely built by robots and he's on his way to the moon to put his plan in place maxon's flaw is that he wants to be perfectly logical -- to eschew the three things he can't seem to program into his robots show preference without reason love doubt rationale decisions regret trust data from previously unreliable source forgive even as maxon aspires to elevate himself to pure logic robot he still seems to understand the value of being human humans work they are an evolutionary success the more they evolve the more successful they become and he's glad he fell in love with sunny despite all rationale to the contrary his wife sunny who since they were kids has tried to teach him how to act based on feeling instead of logic was born to american missionaries in burma she just wants to have a normal life and her flaw is not being able to resist the temptation to celebrate what makes her unique -- which is the fact that she has been born bald and quirky when she and maxon decide to begin having children she begins wearing a wig -- a maybe way too obvious symbol for normalcy their son bubber is autistic and in her more unguarded moments sunny blames maxon that his too logical too literal genes caused their son to be abnormal as maxon is rocketing off into space a car crash right at the beginning of the novel sends sunny into a existential tailspin but maxon and sunny met when they were kids and so much of the novel is told in flashback it often felt like just as we got going in the present we'd pulse back to the past for more back story that would show something supposedly meaningful about maxon and sunny's relationship perhaps you've noticed by the tone of this post so far that i wasn't exactly a fan and that's tough because a lot of folks whose opinions i trust have loved this novel if there were ever a time to throw out a somewhat meaningless review cliche it's now i really wanted to like this and more when you aren't exactly enamored of a novel everyone and her sister seems to love it's easy to fall into nit picking to defend your opinion for instance the heart throb tv newscaster neighbor who all the neighborhood wives lust over is named les weathers and is a fantastically cliche caricature of a real person but that's not useful really what this came down to for me is that it just seemed so precious -- as if we'd think yeah this is all very precious but it's also quirky and unusual and quite an inventive story so it's okay that's it's precious that and the constant perhaps overdone flashbacks gave the novel such a recursive feel after about page 100 i kept thinking wait hadn't she made that point already please don't throw tomatoes at me i know i'm in the minority on this one but i can definitely see why other readers loved it netzer is a clever funny writer check out this line pigs are earthy their proximity may lead to carnal thoughts and that line's even funnier i realize now loosed of context but so i just couldn't find my way into this one if you're on the fence read other reviews and then decide chances are pretty good you'll like it more than i did how's that for passive aggressive","886":"i really liked the inventive way the author tells the story of sunny and maxon it darts in and out of the timeline and also tries to capture the way that maxon thinks and copes with his wife i'd probably push it down to 3 5 stars but that's a small quibble the social criticism about modern life and the outlandish ways we try to fit in rang a bell","887":"i ended up quite liking the end but it took a good 1 2 of the book before i really got into it and before the neat quirky characters grew on me","888":" there's a lot to like about lydia netzer's first novel a pair of unique protagonists a nuanced treatment of the autism spectrum imaginative ruminations on robots and the minds that make them and the revelation of a truly dark family secret or two but as with many first novels there's that something missing it's hard to pinpoint exactly what maybe it's that the juxtaposition of the light and dark elements of the story didn't quite feel right and making that work isn't an easy feat maybe it's that certain characters and narrative devices didn't quite hit their mark the anchorman character ultimately didn't make much sense and while it's understandable that sunny comfortable in her uniqueness and her love for the eccentric to say the least maxon her whole life would desire to be normal once she decided to have a child it doesn't follow that her normal means devoting herself to shallow materialism that said this novel isn't without its bright spots not by a long shot i loved the depictions of maxon's highly systemic thought process and his robots that laugh cry dream and even make other robots i also liked the book's deceptiveness for example sunny's habit of lying to aggrandize herself seems irritating until the truth behind her fabulizations comes out the description of suburban privilege and conformity seems too heavy on the descriptions of material possessions like clothes and suv's but this turns out to be another kind of novel altogether although hit and miss at times shine shine shine was an enjoyable read","889":"i really didn't like this book in the beginning and it took me forever to get into it but i warmed up to it not a plot driven story but the characters are so detailed and unique that you don't really care there were some moments in the book that were totally shocking and made me like the story so much more unique is the best way i can describe this one","890":"this is the best book i've read in a long time the writing is just beautiful lots of twists to keep you guessing i can't wait to see what else this author does","891":"a nice quick read with several instances of beautiful writing","892":"sunny maxon and bubber may be quirky unique and damaged but they sure as hell are a family i totally fell in love with them and didn't want this book to end pretty fantastic for a debut novel","893":"i really loved this book unusual subject matter robots colonizing the moon a hairless heroine but it was beautifully written and a story i literally couldn't put down would highly recommend","894":" i listened to this one because it was narrated by joshilyn jackson i love her as an author and i especially love her as an audio book narrator this was a strange book it took me a while to get into it and i actually almost gave up on it about halfway through after the halfway point it got better and by the end i ended up liking it i think there were a lot of underlying themes throughout that i missed just because they story itself was a bit bizarre by the end i kind of wanted to start over and listen again so i could appreciate the themes and nuances without being focused on figuring out what was going on","895":"just couldn't connect with this book made no sense to me whatever the more i read the more annoyed i was with myself for persisting it was almost like a mild torture","896":"this book appealed to me on many levels as a mother a wife a daughter and over and above all of the subcategories as a human i love this book i felt smarter and better after i finished it i want to gush and gush over it but i don't want to come off stalker y so i'll just say that 'shine shine shine' was the best thing i've read in a good long time","897":"i guess i like books where the main characters are weird this book seems to be making the point that we're all weird in some way and that difference is ok i felt like the message was a little too explicit as i don't like books that tell me what to take from them but what i found touching was the way sunny and maxon both seemed so odd when they were with other people yet you could see how when they spoke to each other they seemed to make sense it takes a good author to show how characters can come across differently with people who get them and people who don't and i loved thinking that maybe everyone makes sense to the right person","898":"a little strange but interesting took me a little while to get into it but then i really enjoyed it but hated the ending","899":"quirky memorable characters good read","900":"a wonderful book unusual characters totally different plot and a very thoughtful look at the relationship between mother and child","901":"quirky title i which i found myself alternately wanting to quit listening and then getting quite angry with the main character sunny is that a sign of affection for the character or being alienated by her actions","902":" when sunny got pregnant she decided it was time for them to be normal but a few years later pregnant again with an autistic son called bubber and her husband maxon in a rocket on the way to colonize the moon with robots sunny is in a minor car accident that knocks her blong wig off her head and the charade is over jarred back into her real self sunny regrets trying to make herself and maxon into something they aren't but before she can tell him maxon's rocket is hit by a meteor endangering all four aboard earthbound sunny cares for bubber agonizes over the decision to take her mother off life support and wishes maxon would come home shine shine shine starts in the present but sunny and maxon's history is revealed through sections that take place in the past sunny's birth in burma her father's death maxon's childhood their friendship that becomes love and then marriage this is a truly unique book one to mull over and discuss quotes she wanted maxon the old maxon the way it used to be and yet she knew that he had always been the old maxon it was she who had changed yet everything else she had tried to become was stupid and pointless 179 she thought ours is one of the epic loves of our generation possibly of all time who cares if no one sees it walking by this story is a love song who cares if history won't remember 195 if it was possible for him to fail he should never have come in the first place should never have left her there alone wanting him waiting for the way their bodies seared together like two wounds healing 239 this is what it means to die you do not finish 261 it was maxon's baby and sunny's and anything could happen there were no expectations that could be logically brought to bear the baby could be born a miracle 271 you have come this far surrounded and now you must continue without defense 273","903":"see the full review at short u0026amp sweet reviews this was an intriguing but very strange book none of the characters are particularly easy to like and maybe hard to identify with but you still empathize with them especially as the book delves into their backstories it's set against the backdrop of locales as exotic as burma and as every day as a small coal town in pennsylvania as the book jumps between the present day and the past going all the way back to sunny's birth you get a real feel for what has shaped them into the people that they became it's an interesting study of difficult people having difficult relationships and loving each other anyway i wasn't sure how i felt about the book at first the author has an almost stream of consciousness style to her writing and the story jumps around frequently in time but once i got used to it it was easier to follow it works on some levels as social commentary about what people do to fit in and be accepted and what happens when people stop playing by the rules i don't think it's a book for everyone but if you're interested in a story about love death and the moon i'd say to give it a shot","904":"another great pick from nancy pearl always listen to her the funny sad and sometimes shocking story of a very smart talented and bald woman who tries desperately to blend into the suburban mom scene her efforts are contantly hindered by her sheldon cooper like husband and their son who takes after his father the unfortunate synchronicity of her mother's cancer her second pregnancy and her husband's trip to the moon bring everything to the breaking point the writer really gets into the head of these unusal characters and makes them very real i really cared about what would happen to this family and without giving anything away i'll just say that overall the book was more funny and heartwarming than sad i was satisfied at the end","905":"the best thing i have read all year a must read the joy of fiction","906":"i really wanted to like this book but just couldn't get into it parts were very intriguing but something about the sci fi family drama mashup missed the mark for me","907":" i liked this book very much maxon sunny and their son bubber live in a beautiful home in the suburbs maxon is a genius on his way to the moon to colonize it with robots that he programmed sunny has been the love of his life since he was seven years old she is as different as maxon with her bald head and quirky personality bubber is the autistic son that they produced together and that sunny feels is a freak they are such different people trying to fit in as a normal family in the neighborhood","908":"very unique read so far about a bald pregnant woman her autistic child u0026amp austronaut husband i had hopes that this book would eventuallyget better since it was rated so high i made it to 252 pages before i just gave up on this very odd book very odd writing another book where i don't understand what people are raving about 2 5 stars","909":" i've been meaning to get to this one for a while the description sounded too odd to ignore and the reviews have been great it's the story of sunny a bald pregnant woman her autistic son and her autistic husband who is on a space shuttle on a mission to deliver robots to the moon for colonization shine shine shine is actually a pretty great book sunny has always been bald and after the conception of her son bubber she started wearing a wig while living in suburban virginia sunny attempts to fit in with the perfect housewives but after maxon leaves for the moon everything begins to change the characters are unforgettable and though quirky they are three dimensional the love story between sunny and maxon feels believable as does their desire to have normal lives despite their very real differences i wouldn't recommend this to anyone but those that are willing to get past the strange plot will find a very good story","910":"3 5 for this book really interesting a plot unlike anything i've ever read it's also unlike what i thought it would be moon colonies robots suburban housewife angst yessss","911":"i'm not really sure how to sum this one up in my own words let me try this shine shine shine is lydia netzer's ambitious strange genre blending debut novel and while it seems to reflect a wide range of influences the whole of it is strikingly original shine shine shine 's primary narrative thread is propelled by two collisions occurring within days of each other and over a hundred thousand miles apart nine months pregnant sunny mann's minivan is broadsided while she is driving home with her autistic son bubber after visiting her dying mother in the hospital the only casualties are the van and one of sunny's wigs its flight into a puddle exposes her to the neighbors as completely bald the accident occurs on the day her astronaut husband maxon has left on a mission he's with the team charged with delivering the robots he developed to prepare the moon for a human colony but when their ship is hit by an asteroid and they lose communication with nasa their mission and lives depend on maxon's ability to put those robots to work a little earlier than expected the parallel threads of accidents and aftermath are intercut with flashbacks to sunny and maxon and their near lifelong history together as seen from both of their perspectives and by sunny's mother emma butcher maxon and sunny are an odd couple but not in the sense of being a strange match it's because that they're both odd sunny's not just bald headed she's a completely hairless fatherless girl who craves normalcy and maxon is a misfit genius with some resemblance to the robots he'll eventually create these people could have been portrayed as not much more than off putting collections of quirks but for the most part netzer dodges that potential hazard although i found the storytelling in shine shine shine a little overworked in spots i was won over by the richness and humanity of her characters i could identify with them but i didn't feel like i'd met them before and i appreciated that this novel first came to my attention last spring in a shelf awareness \"maximum shelf\" feature and while it seems to have fallen short on the book blogger buzz o meter since then it lodged in a corner of my brain as \"the one about the bald wife and the astronaut\" although at times i did confuse it with the also starry covered the age of miracles but when i learned that the audiobook was narrated by joshilyn jackson i quickly and easily decided that i wouldn't delay in reading shine shine shine by ear jackson beautifully differentiates the three narrative voices and her performance seems to convey a real affection for the material the narrator and the author are long time friends if you also choose to read this as an audio stick around for the conversation between netzer and jackson about the book and two songs from netzer's \"folk punk\" band the virginia janes that close the recording i've seen mixed blogger responses to shine shine shine which really isn't that surprising in its way it's as odd as its protagonists and that won't work for every reader i loved it for the fact it wasn't afraid to be odd but i'm still trying to decide how much i loved it for itself in any case it captivated me and i'll be interested in seeing how lydia netzer follows it up ratings book 3 75 5 audio 4 5","912":"i appreciate the overall message interesting storyline likable characters a completely normal story","913":"was assigned to be faculty mentor on this book for our summer reading program at afs so glad it was quirky sexy unexpected and satisfying the characters are misfits who find family with each other as each struggles with the obstacles life has thrown at them astronauts and artists made for good company in this one","914":"a not quite sprawling family drama condensed to just the essentials this is not the kind of book that i enjoy but i enjoyed it a great deal maybe you will enjoy it too","915":" this is a 2 1 2 star book but i'm rounding down overall this was an odd book the pacing was odd the story u0026amp characters were strange some i liked many i didn't u0026amp in the end i wasn't sure what i was supposed to care about what was the point the most intriguing thing in the book to me was sunny u0026amp her baldness as i knew a girl in college who like sunny was bald u0026amp fierce u0026amp fabulous the book spent too much time in the shallow end never getting deeply into any aspects of the subjects it started to discover it just skimmed the surface u0026amp then oops on toss etching else i could never decide if it was trying to keep me from being uncomfortable or to keep me unsettled either way i didn't enjoy it","916":" this book had it all robots in space creepy suburban housewives missionaries killed by communists relationships explained by algebra equations a strained marriage etc yet it did not grab me for the for the first 150 pages i stuck with it because i kept thinking any book with this crazy of a premis is going to get awesome and it did i'm glad i kept reading sunny and maxon's relationship truly was one for the ages at first i found it frustrating that there were so many miles between them i met my husband in new zealand and we spent a year and a half a world away from each other being as physically far away from a loved one as you can possibly be while still being on earth is a feeling i know i was mad at maxon on sunny's behalf for leaving her behind while she was pregnant her mother was in the hospital and their child was in crisis i found myself saying how could he but the more that i got to know the both of them and their relationship that changed to how could he not i'm not going to give away any spoilers but in the end they forged ahead like they always have sunny and maxon are so perfectly weird and so perfectly weird together the only thing that i couldn't get out of my mind was that it seemed like every single character had a deep dark secret life look i guess we all do but it seemed like everyone had something serious going on behind closed doors like earth shattering shocking serious maybe i live a very normal life or my friends keep their secrets very hidden from me but my reality is downright boring compared to sunny and maxon's world but i guess that was the point right still it felt contrived at times i feel like the fact that everyone was harboring dirty secrets in their closets took away from sunny and maxon because they tended to blend into the complex plot shouldn't they stand out he was on a mission to the moon with robots in cargo and she was a bald rich housewife on the verge of a nervous breakdown but they didn't even seem all that special because everyone in this tale was so unbelievably colorful i feel like the background should have been muted a bit to let them shine","917":"i had a hard time reading it because it jumped around alot and seemed to have a lot of extra stuff unnecessary for the story also it gave discriptions of foreign places and scientific mathamatical stuff that is beyond me","918":"this book was different i had a hard time with it in the beginning trying to figure out if i liked the characters or not i'm happy i stuck with it though because once the back story was explained everything clicked i read the last 60 pages in one sitting because i really had to know how it ended","919":"this book was so strange and yet so good the plot really twisted for me and i thought to myself what is this book about it is about being bald self identity parenting marriage why are they characters so strange this was also the first time i have done an audio book in the car and i was pleasantly surprised by the narrators tone it was a great way to read this book","920":"won a copy from shelf awareness on netgalley cannot decide between 3 and 4 stars 3 5such a creative and unique storyline different than anything else i've ever read i kept asking myself as i was reading is this romance sci fi general fiction it was a little taste of each i admired sunny's strength coming out with her baldness after the accident doing her best for bubby her son who is autistic her dying mother being very pregnant and having her husband's rocket have an accident while in space i have some great quotes i would like to add after the book is published","921":" fantastic tale to be sure a page turner definitely people doesn't lie yo however in the spirit of netzer's manns here is the binary that i think will determine the degree to which you really love this book do you believe in the theory ies of singular genius 0 no and 1 yes as i am a very strong proponent of le zero i definitely almost pitched this volume across the living room yesterday but after i managed to calm myself down i was very glad i hung with it and just decided i could take my fairly major bone to pick over to these parts tgfgr where gr goodreads of course finally i will attempt to reserve judgment on this apparent credo of our author until at least her next work seriously though otherwise stellar and i swear to you i am not normally a pun person i just really like that term","922":"i am so glad i stuck with this amazing story it started slowly and i got stuck about a third of the way through wondering if i cared enough about the characters to keep going but then wow netzer is a gifted writer and once she really delved into her characters and their backstories they reached off the page and grabbed you by the throat","923":"a bit convoluted in places but i enjoyed the read","924":"an amazing story of the ordinary and extraordinary trials of motherhood an enchanting love story that celebrates the oddities in all of us truly a magnificent book one with which i identified greatly with tears and chuckles","925":"i got 154 pages into it and i could not be interested in this book overall i would just say it was boring and there was nothing that piqued my interest","926":"what an odd delightful book the character sunny with her bald head astronaut husband and autistic child begins as a pretty amazing woman and then practically has a spiritual awakening or at least becomes more real really enjoyed this quirky tale of love loss and redemption","927":"frustratingly odd","928":" love love love first off as mother to a high functioning autistic child i think it is fabulous to read a story with an autistic kid where the autism isn't the real focus it's essentially to me a story about connectedness but the attachments are so complex that i couldn't fully appreciate them until the last chapter is read and the night's sleep complete and then days later and weeks later i find myself thinking of sunny or maxon or emma and seeking or appreciating a similar connection the characters are each so exquisitely flawed one can't help but revel in their humanity","929":"this book was not exactly what i expected i have read and enjoyed many quirky books but i found shine shine shine to be odd and a little confusing at times i think this book will have a select group of readers that really enjoy and understand it","930":"i loved this book if you are a mother than you will probably see a little bit or alot of sunny in you it brings out such a range of emotions just an incredibly good book i won this from goodreads and i highly recommend it","931":"unusual characters for a first novel not much informtion about the author and you wonder how whe created her characters enjoyed it","932":"i wanted to like this book so many people have given it glowing reviews but it just left me saying 'huh ' i felt like the author was just trying to go in too many directions and left too many question unanswered without enough information for the reader to come to any definitive conclusions you basically just have to guess","933":"sunny and maxon are unusual characters i grew to really like the two of them together i had a hard time getting into the book but toward the end i liked it better i liked the characters but some of the story is all over the place and grows cumbersome trying to read","934":" i received the book shine shine shine as a surprise in the mail last week it's a pre release book comes out in july from a new author i loved this book what happens behind closed doors of perfect suburban families what happens when we remove the masks we all wear sunny the main character in the story is so much like me the real me the one that's not on display for public view i suspect she's like every wife mother crazy person every one of us out there that feels we have to hide and stuff down and medicate and pretend she bravely strips away all of her masks and finds that she's not so strange after all and she finds out how freeing it is to be herself my favorite passage from the book is i can't just go out maxon and leave it do you not understand this i am mom twenty four seven it doesn't end because i am not physically with you and your child i am always mom it's right here with me inside me this makes me mom whether i'm here or there or passed out drunk in a ditch in the city i'm still the mom it's just then i'm the shitty mom you you leave you're the scientist you're the builder you're the astronaut you're the cyclist i'm none of those things i'm the mom that's it i'm saying i just want a little break to try and be someone else but i can't have it it's impossible i love this and it describes how i feel so many days so accurately well not the astronaut stuff but you get what i'm saying the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because there is a lot of confusing to me at least astronaut jargon in the story i understand why it's there but it was confusing to me this is a fantastic powerful story and i highly recommend it","935":"this is a very peculiar story the characters were awkward and i couldn't really relate to them and the decisions they made there were a lot of flashbacks that messed up the flow and made the story choppy at times i really had to wonder if the character was dreaming or not","936":"very interesting story and metaphors but i feel the author became too attached to the convoluted writing style instead of making it enjoyable for the reader","937":"a really interesting book about a married couple that have known each other since childhood the boy man seems to be on the autism scale but it is never labelled as such he is coached in how to interact and he is a genius who invents robots the girl woman is born without any hair which plays a large part in her life","938":" eh this book did not engage me the characters were odd but only maxon and i hated his name how do you pronounce that like max on max off from karate kid had a reason to be odd he was a scientific savant sunny was completely bald but i never figured out just what caused her to be an outcast her mother seemed to raise her not to be ashamed or embarrassed even when sunny decided to wear the wig i didn't see it as some big decision that she needed to fit in with the moms in the suburbs or that by not wearing the wig she was separating herself from them they still came when her 2nd baby was born and les weathers he was creepy","939":"enjoyed the book and characters wish it was developed more writer shows promise","940":"i finished my advance copy received through netgalley of lydia netzer's shine shine shine days ago and thought having a few days to process it would help me compose a coherent review i'm not sure it will have helped on the surface the book is about sunny and her astronaut husband maxon told through a storyline that moves back and forth between present and past we learn that pregnant sunny is married to civilian astronaut and robot expert maxon a nobel prize winner they are parents to an autistic son bubber sunny was born completely bald and wears a wig and her mother is dying of cancer sunny views these things as somewhat bad she wants to fit in be liked and have a perfect life as per the definition of perfect she has in her head maxon her baldness and bubber don't fit in with that vision maxon is eccentric possibly on the autism spectrum himself and can't seem to please sunny with him in space however sunny is left home and starting with a crack in her kitchen wall everything begins to go wrong at once and she's forced to evaluate what she really wants out of life and whether her ideals are really as perfect as she's made them out to be netzer's voice is unique and i'll be honest in admitting that i was afraid at first that i was going to hate the book and not finish it it's not an easy friend like voice and maxon's social interactions are often boiled down to empirical formulae which all but the true nerds may find confusing i laughed at many of them sunny's initial descriptions of bubber's autism are also off putting and i had to force myself past those sections of the book by reminding myself it was the character and not the author i hoped in the end while i loved the book and what i took away as its ultimate message i was at a loss as to whom i'd recommend it shine shine shine was such an individual experience for me that i wasn't sure how many would get it beyond those of my friends who already had it on the to be read lists i fear it may be one of those books that people either love or hate but have no mediocre responses to","941":"this is one of the best book of our times lydia netzer writes of love between mothers and children of young love grown up and she does it through characters that are not at all normal and must discover that there is no normal each voice is uniquely clear in his journey through owning his own oddness the advanced state of science and technology are not so extreme as to be unattainable in our lifetime making it more palatable and allowing it not to takeover the novel brilliant and joshilyn jackson does a tremendous job narrating the audio version","942":"this was one of the smartest freshest book i've read in a long time shine shine shine takes us out of this world where the past mingles with the future and characters are brave and bold and not the least bit ordinary lydia netzer weaves incredible stories and back stories that are heartbreaking disturbing and ultimately redeeming shine shine shine is one terrific read","943":"i absolutely loved this book and this imperfect family","944":"didn't like this book at all i shouldn't have finished it however i thought if i kept reading it maybe i would figure out what it was about however i never did","945":"this was such a unique and awesome book the story of sunny different but wanting to appear normal and maxon different and not capable of caring about it and their relationship to one another maxon is a nasa scientist who is possibly autistic or has asberger's and sunny is his completely hairless wife when sunny becomes pregnant she decides to wear a wig and try to appear as a normal housewife their first child is autistic which she blames maxon for she gets pregnant again with a girl this time and then their lives begin to go awry sunny gets in a car accident and her wig flies off revealing to her neighbors that she is bald maxon is in space when a meteor hits the spacecraft they must come to terms with their uniqueness as people and get through this with sunny finally realizing that everyone is a bit freaky under their facade i loved this book the author writes so frankly and with such deep understanding of her characters intelligent fiction which has been so rare in recent years in the american publishing scene","946":"wow i just typed out my entire review and then somehow when i clicked save it lost it here goes trying again hopefully i can remember it all first off i read an e galley copy that i won from shelf awareness and received via netgalley comi don't think i can give this book a difinitive 4 stars and since i can't do a 3 5 like i really feel it deserves i'll go ahead and give it a 3 the book was just interesting enough to keep me going i wanted to find out what was going to happen and what had already happened i know that seems a little bit confusing but if you read the book i think i'll make sense more than most this book really shows how everything that is happening or is about to happen comes from what has already happened we get to experience each of the characters at many different points in thier lives as each one remembers or ponders events from their pasts my only criticism here would be that we are taken back seemingly on a whim to a different time and place throughout the story what i mean by this is that in one paragraph we are with a character in the present and in the very next paragraph with no break we are suddenly transported to a time or place maybe 20 years in the past there are even times when we are reading about sunny while she is at home and then suddenly with the next paragraph we are with maxon in space it was a little hard to get used to these jumps and breaks in the flow but over time i got used to them and expected them which made it a little easier to read and as you get to know the characters it almost feels like the story should flow this way i did enjoy the characters they are definitely some of the most unique i've read in a while and since we got to experience them at different stages in thier lives there was a sense of them almost being old friends i felt invested in these characters and thier outcomes and while i wasn't disappointed at the end there was a slight sense of being let down by some of what was left up in the air overall again this was an interesting read one that may take a little more thought that some but definitely worth the

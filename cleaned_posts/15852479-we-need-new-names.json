loved so much about this book the voice was original and cheeky and compelling and accomplished the characters were memorable and original the politics and the ideas the quality of the writing the ambition of the narrative these were all terrific my quarrel is one that i have with so many first novels written by the graduates of american writing programs plot why do our nation's literary factories not teach the elements of plotting and narrative structure why do the literati seem to feel that plot is a base element something only lesser readers crave why do people keep trying to pass off linked short stories as novels and vignettes as stories the lack of narrative drive is what keeps this book from being a great novel it's a terrific book better than most but it's episodic throughout and meandering in places leaving the reader with a sense of a book that trails off resting too much weight on a final image that is disturbing but not particularly enlightening this is a writer who is capable of writing a great book a book that harnesses the engine of story and races it over the finish line i can't wait to read what she writes next","2":"parts of the book were really good and i definitely enjoyed the first half more than the second half the first half takes place in zimbabwe and i found the interaction between the narrator and her friends engaging though at times sad and disturbing in the second half she comes to the us and just feels like a prisoner here unable to go home and unable to fully assimilate here i get that she is stuck in a really tough position but i wanted to see a little bit of pluck and optimism she's super hard working and smart but not joyful at all the book just descends into a bleak pit and ends without any real conclusion in my opinion that said there are some great lines some very funny ones in fact for example inside the car it feels like the devil is grilling sinners","3":"not in my reading zone","4":"very powerful but disturbing the dilemma of being a refugee and not being at home anywhere","5":"furious heartfelt and fast paced i loved this book and the writing style following darling as she lives in post colonical zimbabwe and then in america you are sweeped into her world language emotions and thoughts about finding her place in the world and in both her zimbabwe and her america a great read","6":"i am giving this man booker shortlisted book 4 5 stars out of 5 it probably deserves 5 stars but i didn't love this book only liked it very very much it tells the story of darling a girl living in a shantytown in zimbabwe who immigrates to america and how she adapts to her new life much of the story actually takes place in zimbabwe as we see darling and her friends navigate their shantytown and find ways to have fun we feel sad when she has to leave her friends for the cold but free u s it is beautifully written and i look forward to her future novels","7":"the book is split into 2 equally funny endearing and brutally honest parts the first part describes darling's life in zimbabwe and the second deals with her move to the states in both parts the author's observations are wicked unapologetic and spot on religion fat versus big aids ngos porn homeland food emigrants working hard to send money home africa as a continent heritage and loss of identity a gem","8":"i sponsor a child in zimbabwe through world vision which is why i entered the goodreads giveaway for this arc book i am so glad that i won i'm learning about the culture and the language even if i don't understand it in america that is in the united states and canada even we are a culmination of many cultures and many languages we do what we can to adapt to what immigrants bring to our tables figuratively and literally but in other countries they have their own unique language s cultures songs ways of living things that truly define them i knew that living in the us means that i am fortunate compared to those in zimbabwe and other countries that may not have the full freedom they say they do but i ache for the something more that truly defines me pages 161 162 really show this spoilers under cut because the novel isn't out yet view spoiler while i don't like the lack of quotes it really helps me get into the mindset of a zimbabwean child whose teachers have left her and her area to go to places that will pay better it's sad especially knowing that being in a city like harare would mean something better the contrast between town and city is blatant chupo's situation is very depressing i hope that she was able to talk to someone of what happened since i don't believe darling said anything the poor girl anything like that wrenches my heart the black on the zimbabwe flag stands for black majority i did not know that i don't know what colours on any flag stand for tbh while i hate what happens to the white family ies i am glad that the children heard their protests over being true africans or not it's not about colour but about where you are where you were born and the fact that you are human how they left was a disheartening chapter i like how bulawayo showed the issues with the english language not only with the oddities of tenses but how a non native speaker thinks i always find that interesting i also kind of chuckled with the fact that so many immigrant families want their children to become doctors or lawyers i witness that daily with my students rhinnah is totally dumb i miss borders jane eyre really is irritating i wanted to rush through the how they lived chapter especially because it seemed to be from a rushed point of view it's sad that people often feel like they can't say anything negative because it's 'better' here that 'home' has it worse and because of the naivety of others and the now americans used to have that same ignorance umm that ending hide spoiler","9":" this was an eloquent story of a girl who leaves a disintegrating zimbabwe and adjusts to life in america the first half of the book is her childhood in zimbabwe and it's heartbreaking to see people's hopes disappointed by violence and disease then she comes to detroit to live with her aunt and joins the ranks of the undocumented immigrant this is a novel but the parts in this country felt very true to the experiences of people i know so i would imagine the first half is an accurate portrayal as well i thought it was well written and worth reading","10":"a very good read of a very young and then teenage girl in her country in africa zimbabwe and then in the usa","11":"the writing in this book is so beautiful i wanted to wallow in it to savor it to devour it it is truly extraordinary darling the zimbabwean child protagonist is innocent and jaded kind and cruel and altogether unique she and her oddly named friends have seen changes in their country some for better some for worse some just for hope this is a story like so many others of living with those changes and with the promises that going to america hold what makes this one different is the words pearls and gems it amazes me that this is a debut novel the author's blending of her background and native language with her learned english makes the english language richer interspersed are short chapters not from darling's point of view but generalizations they remind me of those in steinbeck's the grapes of wrath the chapter how they left is poetry \"when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky \"\" we saw more food than we had seen in all our lives and we were so happy we rummaged through the dustbins of our souls to retrieve the stained broken pieces of god \"if you like straightforward action filled writing this might not be the book for you if you appreciate writing of common words that are strung together in a very uncommon fashion and a story that will stay with you i highly recommend this one the author according to the biography is working on her next book i can't wait i received an advance readers copy of this book for review for which i am very grateful","12":"this book makes me feel more close to my country i realized the meaning of leaving new start and new culture","13":"loved parts of it but other parts seemed to drag","14":" and when they asked us where we were from we exchanged glances and smiled with the shyness of child brides they said africa we nodded yes what part of africa we smiled is it that part where vultures wait for famished children to die we smiled where the life expectancy is thirty five years we smiled is it there where dissidents shove ak 47s between women's legs we smiled where people run about naked we smiled that part where they massacred each other we smiled is it where the old president rigged the election and people were tortured and killed and a whole bunch of them put in prison and all there where they are dying of cholera--oh my god yes we've seen your country it's been on the news and when these words tumbled from their lips like crushed bricks we exchanged glances again and the water in our eyes broke our smiles melted like dying shadows and we wept wept for our blessed wretched country fantastic debut novel from noviolet bulawayo shortlisted for the man booker prize 2013","15":" darling spends most of her time playing with her friends they go to richer neighborhoods to steal guavas they invent a lot of games and play them their schools were shut down recently so they don't have to study anymore but darling is not happy about it she desperately wants to go to school and study they don't have any money though their houses are destroyed and the government doesn't care about them but darling has a chance to change it all she could go and stay with her aunt in the united states she could go there and live the life of her dreams and visit home occasionally but it's not as easy as that she learns belatedly we need new names is one of those wonderful books written with such an authentic voice that the reader becomes the narrator we don't have many books like that at least not many english books set outside the english speaking countries we need new names not only expresses darling's zimbabwean english well it also chronicles her language improvement over the course of the book when we begin she had just had a few years of schooling and her english was rusty but definitely better than that of all her friends but later when she moves to the united states and starts studying there her english had improved so much that you could mistake her for a native us citizen i loved this writing and transformation so much it inspired this post language aside darling's character is well felt throughout the novel only ten years old but she had already seen enough tragedy around her that it doesn't horrify or sadden her terribly when she and her friends see a dead woman hanging from a tree they talk about taking her shoes so that they can buy some bread when darling's grandmother's church's self proclaimed priest treats a woman obscenely in order to cure her of something she is initially uneasy but then shrugs it off and spends the rest of the service just having a conversation with her friend when darling's father returns home sick and diagnosed as having aids by her people since that's the only disease they really knew about she feels sick of his presence and wishes him dead occasionally later when they happen to be present at a neighborhood where white people even zimbabwe born were being forcefully evicted from their homes darling and her friends wander through the houses just vacated and stare amazed at all the riches around them not feeling bothered at all by the violence they just saw these are kids who grew up seeing violence around them even their games are based on violent events they'd kill each other as part of the game and cheer or cry as if they were bystanders to the actual death they have not yet known peace and as far as they are concerned it's not something that they will see in their lifetimes they feel heavily when they see too much of violence they just have a huge tolerance level they are resourceful but if they are cornered in a threatening situation they will cry yet they all have dreams they want to go to america and south africa and dubai and other well off countries and live happy lives and when they do this innocence of childhood is what they want to return to these friends are who they yearn to be with we need new names addresses a lot of issues that people from war strewn countries face but from the eyes of kids when the adults wax poetic about the secure lives they had led before war that means nothing to the kids the adults get wasted the kids watch that and get wasted too once they move to a new place where freedom is the order of the day what kind of life will be normal to them do they get used to the new life and forget the violence of the past or do they eye all the freedom with distaste and suspicion this book also reminded me again that illegal immigration is not a black or white matter the people who could get deported are humans who came here for a better life a life that was denied to them just because of the randomness of birth shuttling them away rarely solves anyone's problems one big realization i had for the umpteenth time like many folks i knew i have had days as a kid when i just didn't want to go to school all that studying maintaining grades play time lost sleepy weekdays etc darling just wanted to go to school it's terribly disappointing that there are kids in this world who have no school to go to and kids who can go complaining about it","16":"coming from the united states i am horribly unfamiliar with the tone and writing styles used by writers from varying countries i have read a few works from britain and one from india and i found those books - while certainly different from american novels - provide a clarity that prevent them from being completely alien to readers of different origins this is not one of those books i'm not totally bashing this book - a good portion of it was gripping and there were parts that i felt deeply connected to the characters darling the novel's narrator helped me understand what it is like to be an immigrant in america experiencing conflicting ties with america and their original country i thoroughly enjoyed her interactions with her aunt fostalina and uncle kojo and would have liked to hear more about their backstories but this book was just really unsatisfying despite the deep complex issues that popped up in some sections the characters never seemed to really care about anything making it very difficult for me to care about them all of darling's friends in zimbabwe had the potential to develop into interesting characters each with a unique perspective on the events in zimbabwe however instead they all fade in into the background becoming flat secondary characters with little to no voice to be fair this story does center on darling but even then i couldn't help but think that she didn't feel emotionally attached to anything she witnesses horrible things and yet she talks about them in an offhand manner that was off putting and made the story fall flat one thing that particularly confused me throughout the book was the writing style why did the author choose not to use quotation marks to signify dialogue the novel read like a stream of consciousness and i often found myself spacing out and forgetting there was actual dialogue going on maybe it is a style specific to zimbabwean culture or the author was trying to convey a profound message by omitting the quotation marks overall i wanted to know what happened but in the end i was unsatisfied and irritated","17":"i loved the story perspectives and the characters in this book i thought the end peetered out a little bit","18":"told through the eyes of a young girl this books begins in zimbabwe showing a childhood as experienced through the prism of political uprising and strife i favored this portion of the book it becomes a coming of age story when darling makes a new life in michigan and grows up but in the end questions are left unanswered and perhaps are unanswerable if one leaves one's own country or home how can one justify still calling it one's own if one makes a new home elsewhere how can one make it one's own is that even possible and if not where does that leave one","19":"i agree with the new york times review that the writing that is set in zimbabwe is more compelling than that set in michigan but still a powerful and compelling book particularly around immigration the reasons impacts and realities","20":" i was a little disappointed in this one after hearing so many book people saying that it's a favourite to win the booker prize the writing is okay you get the frustration the children immigrants feel the uselessness of trying to find solace in religion and the sadness of having to leave your home country because life there is too hard and violent but i would like to have had a red thread something in the story to keep me reading it was more a series of events moods in darling's life and chapters about the illegal immigrants' lives and troubles in general than a progressing story","21":" to play the country game we have to choose a country everybody wants to be the usa and britain and canada and australia and switzerland and them nobody wants to be rags of countries like congo like somalia like iraq like sudan like haiti and not even this one we live in who wants to be a terrible place of hunger and things falling apart i enjoyed the first half of the book i could relate partly to it with singapore being a cosmopolitan state yet unreceptive towards migrants and immigrants it gives me a refreshing perspective of minorities and a grim reminder that we are after all human beings yet we are being emplaced into different circumstances just because of where we are from it reminds me the importance of being appreciative that i am living in such a liveable city the second half of the book somehow seemed to be rather deadpan it find myself hoping that the book would come to an end soon this book has a strong meaning the author seemed to wish to bring out unbeknownst go many yet i thought she could have done better","22":"i was fascinated by this account of a childhood in zimbabwe followed by an adolescence in the u s the final chapters flagged a bit as if she didn't know quite how to round off the book it started to sound out of character and too much of the author's voice intruded but a very worthwhile read nevertheless and a poignant picture of uprooted people trying to adjust to new situations both within their country of origin and in their new country","23":" around the world zimbabwea finely crafted story that manages to be simultaneously heartbreaking and funny bulawayo is a master of analogy she creates some of the most powerful and unique similes i have ever seen in print the experience of immigration from africa to america comes alive through the character of darling the narrative is raw sometimes ugly sometimes beautiful the book's core is portrayed in the final image a dog killed by a bread truck on the dusty african road its guts spilling out its blood sprayed everywhere but the carnage mingling with the unbelievably appealing smell of fresh bread definitely recommended","24":"hard to read and hard to believe it isn't memoir the writing is very good sometimes it feels like it's manipulated into good writing and other times it feels completely natural i enjoyed and was sensitized by the perspective it's a deep look at zimbabwe the perils of immigration and the difficulties of being a displaced teenaged girl uncomfortable i think it's wholly acceptable to skip the chapter called this film contains some disturbing images unsettling and mind changing all at once","25":"loved the narrator but the book didn't come together overall for me","26":" noviolet bulawayo writes like a demand listen listen now her debut novel we need new names is unstoppably driven by the clever voice of darling an impoverished zimbabwean girl who turns into an immigrant teenager in america darling's life in zimbabwe is hard and messy but her and her friends' uninhibited poking and prodding of everything in life and death turns all into curiosities this first half of the book so boisterous and unique seems let down by the second half where darling immigrates to michigan to live with her aunt's family that same natural inquisitiveness is now applied to pop culture american food and porn but with a less incisive effect the relative lack of drama in america is perhaps the point but ultimately something was missing not that darling's story needed a pat ending but i felt the novel lost its edge within this overall arc there was the chapter how they lived almost a stand alone story itself and a beautiful paean to the immigrant experience the kind of writing here and in the first half of the book will stay with me and definitely make me want to read more of bulawayo in the future","27":"bought this book in johannesburg airport and finished reading it before the plane landed in london 10 hours later can see why it was shortlisted for a number of prizes last year an interesting read","28":"this is an amazing book about being an immigrant i found it disturbing moving and very sad not an easy read but an important book it gave me a new perspective on america and i suspect the same failings apply to great britain and many first world countries it is impressive that this is no violet bulawayo's first novel she is very talented","29":"a strong debut novel characters are credible engaging on both continents an interesting balanced view of the tragedy but also humour and humanity in both of darling's homes some details especially the end of the chapter dealing with the forays into online porn seemed to have have little point but this is often the case with first novels an easy read but not a simple one","30":"i recommend this book it's an easy read that made me smile laugh and almost cry at different points","31":"bleak a well written but a little too harrowing account of a young migrant refugee's life move to the us","32":"enjoyed the first half of book set in zimbabwe","33":" reading this as an audiobook i was thrown off by the ending in truth i was thrown off by the whole book i never really felt drawn into the story and the character of darling seemed genuine yet a construct although bunwayo tackles major issues like colonialism migration home aids foreign aid and africa as a country i was disappointed with how it was all presented the first person point of view failed to reveal these topics in new ways nor did it offer new ways of understanding them points made like the privilege of being anorexic when others know the true meaning of starvation were strong yet presented in a too obvious manner the one thing the audiobook did well was in its reading region appropriate accents added a lot to the characterization and the setting promising book with an average story","34":"i thought this book was ok not sure what all the buzz around it was for but it was an okay read i struggled through a few parts of it","35":" short listed for this year's booker award used to be a phrase that would turn me from a book i was considering thank goodness a couple days ago laid up and recovering from bronchitis i sampled the first 2 pages of several recently recommended books each was better and drawing me into page 3 and 4 more than the one before the last on my list was this deceptively off turning book you see i don't much care for books set against the backdrop of africa or those that are set in the midst of agony and poverty and hard times there's enough followers in oprah's book club to soak up those mires of misery yet from the first line from the first page of we need new names i was lifted and carried on a journey of a young life darling is somewhere around 10 or 12 and she lives in an un named country of africa which i don't know it wasn't south africa ghanda namimbia or uganda but it was one of those lands where the whites came to take it all away and then the bits that were left were destroyed in the economic drought that followed war to retake the land darling and her friends live in the tin huts that have taken the place of their middle class homes and the only time they feel full is when they leave their village of paradise and head into the nice clean well established white neighborhood to steal guavas they aren't sure if being hungry is worse than eating too many guavas and dealing with the ensuing constipation that follows their days are filled with their round of invented games countries addy over and finding binlada darling who lives with her mother and her grandmother has a dream to go to her us to destroyedmichigan to live with her aunt there is so much in this book that is sad and ugly and dirty and dry and dusty but there is so much that is filled with hope and joy and music even the lyrical rhythm of words that the author uses so beautifully to convey the spirit of the time and the place without bogging down the reader with dialect and at the end of the day it could also perhaps be termed an immigration issues book too don't miss this one turn off facebook lock the door put on one of paul simon's old albums and jump into this wonderful book do it now","36":"lyrical but disjointed at times","37":"very interesting read and reflection about life in zimbabwe and immigration to the us her descriptions struck me bringing me back to walking through my rural area watching the children play all afternoon with a ball made from compressed grocery bags the church scenes the descriptions of the sorrow of illness u0026amp death and senseless destruction of property and lives and ultimately country thankfully i had plane rides finish it on","38":"i enjoyed this very much working with many people with dual homes i see how they struggle with fitting in both countries or neither as situations vary more than that though i loved bulawayo's darling's deep and nuanced perspective on our country horrible and wonderful at once","39":"an amazing book about zimbabwe's lost decade 2000 2009 and those immigrants who came to america noviolet bulawayo is not really the author's name she changed her name to noviolet means with violet who was her mother and bulawayo is the district where she's from in zimbabwe this book is a novel of fragments poetically orchestrated and is about needing new ways of thinking the main character finds lots of humor in horrible situations some critics have called this bleak book africa porn or ruin porn i feel in love with the main character who along with some others in the book goes quietly insane it is the author's first book and she won lots of prizes for it the leader of my book group a former newspaper book section editor said not only would she have counseled the author to let the book 'marinate' more rather than publishing it she also thinks the author should not have been awarded the prizes she won because she believes prizes are for a body of work not meant as encouragement to young authors","40":"many of the chapters would have made excellent short stories as well loved this writing reminded me of flannery o'connor and helen oyeyemi","41":"this book definitely has a fresh voiced narrator though it lacks plot it still kept me intrigued with the african way of life the only thing that disappointed me greatly was the ending it was sudden and it didn't really leave with saying oh this was a great book i want to read it again","42":"my thoughts an enlightening debut that takes the reader to zimbabwe during the mugabe regime the subject matter is a bit grim as the novel opens with darling and her friends leaving their shanty town to roam the finer neighborhoods in search of guava for food we learn of the daily routines of the displaced civilians the adults who neglect children in search for work in the mines and the borders the games the children play to fight boredom and make sense of the dire futures the author covers the political unrest and promise for change in the upcoming election the hope misogyny and hypocrisy of religious doctrine the social ills and financial ruin that befall a country under a corrupt dictatorship the later half of the story explores the cultural nuances language challenges assimilation challenges as darling relocates to america to stay with an aunt the environmental differenced culture shock and disillusionment with an impoverished detroit michigan homesickness plagues both aunt and niece and the realities of their one way journey weighs heavily on the hearts and guilt burdens their sub conscious but the determination to make it in the us is the driving force toward success so they work very hard and long for permanent legal residency the author gave me enough to easily empathize and sympathize with darling her friends and family i enjoyed darling's points of view her voice and her innocence i absolutely loved the cross cultural references nuances similarities differences and challenges interactions with non africans african americans the notion of smiling differences in child rearing the significance of a name and the need for new ones views of education the stigma and impact of aids the dismantling of the family unit etc i'll definitely consider future work from this author","43":" the best thing i've read in a while brilliant evocation of africa darling tell the story of zimbabwe falling apart through a child's eyes innocent and funny but profoundly poignant later she moves to america another experience entirely and where she learns the harsh realities of being an immigrant in a land you can never call your own the last chapter is particularly heart wrenching and the sense of displacement complete no optimistic ending here the author hits you hard but at the same time provides a realistic 'in your face' portrait of the immigrant experience","44":" i chose this book because of the praise it received and lists it ended up on what a disappointment many of the two star reviews on goodreads do a good job of picking apart the novel's weaknesses as does the new york times review i wish i had read reading the novel one thing that i didn't see mentioned is the author's clunkiness at writing funny scenes she loses multiple opportunities to make a sly dig at american culture in the second half of the novel by not delivering on the humor inherent in many of the situations she turns ridiculously funny situations into dull torpid scenes i did drag my way through this novel it isn't long because i kept thinking something interesting would happen it never did also please do not believe any review that says this book is reminiscent of zadie smith not even close","45":"this book made me realize how my reading has lost a lot of it's diversity over the years and reminds me how wonderful it is to read outside my comfort zone i say read but this was an audio book for me and i'm so glad that it was the narrator does an amazing job first she is 10 year old darling in zimbabwe she is innocent in many ways describing her world though the eyes of a child even with horrible things happening around her she has her friends and they play though the harsh realities that surround them then when she moves to the us she has to adjust to a new world and as she grows older her accent changes the narrator does an amazing job reshaping her voice to sound older to soften her accent and you can here darling is becoming a different person as she matures a wonderful debut novel and a powerful look at life for an african at home and as well as in america","46":"the whole time i was reading this book i kept thinking 'this is so weird' but yet i couldn't stop turning the pages so i guess weirdly interesting is the best description i can give it","47":" a unique voice wonderful language vivid stories of life in mugabe's zimbabwe seen through the eyes of darling and the children who are her friends beautiful tragic and terrifying images her experiences once she gets to the states destroyedmichygen and kalamazoo are quintessential immigrant experiences the difference between the imagined america and the reality the growing distance from home and family the conflict between who she was at home and who she needs wants to be in her new place i loved the way darling looked at ebonics the disconnect between the english she speaks and what she is told is american english there are so many terrific things about this book it's a great story and beautifully told","48":"great little story it was easy to read and captures darlings life in zimbabwe and detroit so well the tone is light and playful age appropriate for the narrarator but also tackles real life and coming of age issues especially in a foreign culture interesting writing style and fun and quick to read","49":"we need new names by noviolet bulawayo is a collection of short stories or essays in sequential order that make up a novel the stories are gritty and honest about an african girl named darling who is struggling with her culture and ready to go to america i loved this novel it kind of reminded me of my favorite collection of short stories say you're one of them by uwem akpan which contains stories of struggling african children in some questionable situations plus who can resist a book by an author whose name is noviolet read anything gritty lately thanks for reading rebecca @ love at first book","50":"not as good as americanah","51":"this is a marvelous new voice in african american literature half the book takes place in a crumbling zimbabwe the other half in a spoiled rotten america neither place has much to offer the protagonist darling but she speaks in a clear sometimes angry sometimes wistful voice about the importance of home the experience of the refugee and the plight of the illegal immigrant recommend","52":"a quality book consistent interesting and one that has stuck in my head over the days that i read it nonetheless i wanted to get lost in the characters more instead of getting yanked away when the overarching story history would take over","53":"this is a great depiction of the immigrant experience as 10 year old darling narrates from a shantytown in zimbabwe and then later in destroyedmichygen the cultural gap is apparent in a couple of quotes that really stand out when ngo photographers come across darling and her friend one of them who has holes in his shorts says when they look at my picture over there i want them to see me not my buttocks not my dirty clothes but me and later when the kids are caught reenacting a violent incident by bbc men and asked what kind of game they were playing bastard puts his shirt on and says can't you see this is for real despite the vivid voice and sharp observations the time jumps weren't always fluid there's not enough resolution with any of the characters especially darling what happens to her at the end","54":"life as seen through the eyes of a growing child perhaps the epitome of the bildungsroman in the xxi century","55":"beware don't start reading we need new names if you are already not feeling well it will not make you feel better there will be beautiful flowing language in the best moments of this novel and then there will be moments when you will want to shut your book as if wanting to shut the narrator up enough i can't take any more of this too much pain these are also the best moments i guess in their own way","56":"the story of darling a 10 year old from zimbabwe isn't one of those heartwarming girl who makes it against all odds tales it's better than that a lot better we need new names pulls no punches as darling takes readers on a ride through her devastating difficult poetic and beautiful childhood bulawayo's language and storytelling is fierce and utterly unforgettable but make no mistake about it this book is brutal not everyone wants to read about the daily life of a child in a shanty town in a corrupt war torn country yet you should read this book because the author's voice is so fresh and her perspectives so sharp that you'd be denying yourself the emerging of a major new literary voice if you don't aids violence hunger and extreme poverty are all covered here but don't let that scare you off bulawayo's prose is stunning vivid and at times hilarious which gives this book soul and makes it totally compelling to read from page 1 i do agree that the ending isn't exactly satisfying but it did make me think and i even went back and reread the final chapter just to absorb it all again i'd say read it now before it takes home tons of awards at the end of the year because even if you don't love it you won't soon forget it","57":"because we were not in our country we could not use our own languages and so when we spoke our voices came out bruised having a stamp of approval from junot diaz is not a small deal to me in my mind he is one of the most authentic not to mention best authors working today he tells stories about people mainstream literature has traditionally forgotten about or marginalized it's easy then to see why noviolet bulawayo's work would appeal to him in we need new names she similarly seeks to shine a spotlight on a life lived on the margins of americana each chapter is like a short story that comes together to tell us the story of darling who is a ten year old girl living in a shantytown in zimbabwe when we meet her darling's family lost everything in paramilitary raids during a government takeover but she doesn't remember much about that time now she and her friends including pregnant chipo navigate their neighborhood with the typical exuberance of childhood eventually darling makes her way to suburban america where she struggles to fit in and wrestles with the consequences of assimilating to a culture that may always look at her as an outsider anyway bulawayo has a vibrant way of channeling darling's worldview her affection for the character is palpable even for her mistakes and her character flaws which is something most authors struggle with darling is a fully realized dimensional being again it's easy to see why diaz blurbed this novel so enthusiastically but for me as good as bulawayo is technically i just couldn't get swept away in we need new names the way i have in everything diaz wrote what ends up making all the difference in the world is that diaz's ragtag inner city troop of single mothers bad boys hopeless nerds and more are truly original which makes his work feel revelatory dangerous and urgent in comparison it feels like i've read the story bulawayo is telling before i've read books about growing up and being an adult in politically unstable impoverished africa i've read immigration stories and there are authors who have made entire careers out of writing books about cultural displacement and the difficulties of leaving one's home country behind jhumpa lahiri comes immediately to mind that doesn't discount this book at all mind you not necessarily at least but it does make it harder for bulawayo to build that sense of urgency or relevance and to my mind she spends the entire novel only making it to the cusp of those qualities which she really needed in order to succeed maybe the almost short story format is to blame because just as we're diving into something we're onto the next topic before we've adequately resolved what just happened okay in most circumstances there isn't proper resolution to be had but in most cases the moment hasn't landed before we're onto the next thing there are exceptions where the chapter's subject matter is horrific enough to make you shift uncomfortably in your seat as you turn the pages but in most cases it feels like we're only skimming the surface for example in one chapter early on darling's father turns up unexpectedly after being a gaping absence in her household for years following his departure to do a dangerous job abroad instead of being overjoyed at having her father home again darling is repulsed because he is dying of aids when darling's friends find out her father is sick and demand to see him they talk to him and take care of him showing him the courtesy love and humanity darling herself had been denying him just when you think we're on the brink of an emotional breakthrough the chapter ends and darling's father is barely mentioned again for the rest of the book bulawayo took us right to the edge of a poignant moment then for some reason ran from it and refused to revisit it it seems like a curious omission i spent the rest of the book wondering what happened to darling's father and why it was never mentioned if he died and it was of such little consequence to darling that it never came up again during her adolescence then why would his return home and that moment where darling's friends showed him compassion have been worth showing us at all that's just one example bulawayo has a way of almost parenthetically discussing a lot of the heavier moments in we need new names and while i suppose one could admire her restraint from devolving into theatrics it did have a tendency to make me feel removed from the novel at every turn i never got captivated or swept away which is a shame because her technical prowess as a writer is undeniable as is her skill with tone as i said earlier bulawayo makes darling come to vibrant life i would still recommend we need new names and i confess i am curious to see where bulawayo's talents take her next she has the makings of a terrifically talented writer grade b for more reviews check out my blog supposedly fun","58":"i dont know what all the hype is about very underwhelmed by this book","59":"darling is only 10 years old and yet she must navigate a fragile and violent world in zimbabwe darling and her friends steal guavas try to get the baby out of young chipo's belly and grasp at memories of before before their homes were destroyed by paramilitary policemen before the school closed before the fathers left for dangerous jobs abroad but darling has a chance to escape she has an aunt in america she travels to this new land in search of america's famous abundance only to find that her options as an immigrant are perilously few this was a struggle for me from beginning to end i knew as i was reading it that this book is important and that i should appreciate it but although i did think about it a lot and although i can respect the author's point of view her storytelling style described as raw and harsh left me completely cold aside from three lyrical almost poem like essays on the immigrant experience where the author departs from her primary narrative darling's biting coldness prevented me from truly sympathizing with her let alone rooting for her i felt that bulawayo was keeping me at bay instead of inviting me in reviews have praised her for not trying to create universal truths i e we're all more alike than we realize but without that ability to reach out to her audience the book reads as a rather esoteric invective and one i was ultimately glad to be done with","60":"horrifying and funny and sad and scary and impossible to put down","61":"i really enjoyed this book about a young girl's journey from disintegrating zimbabwe to the u s although i felt the part in zimbabwe was the better half of the book i think anyone could enjoy it but that people with an interest in knowledge of recent events in zimbabwe would get more out of it because the author doesn't explicitly explain what's going on i'm pretty sure she didn't even identify the country by name","62":" this is my first time reading a book set in zimbabwe and i love it i learn so many things honestly southern africa has always been a very distant land in my mind whoever say that africans know their continent well i was born in dakar senegal - west africa - and that is 6055 87 kilometers or 3767 34 miles away from zimbabwe which is why i don't know much about that side of the continent that and also the fact that we speak french and they speak english communication is a problem you can easily find bilingual french speaking africans but the contrary is much more rare full review is here http booksundertheneemtree com 2013","63":"reading this was a bit of a roller coaster at first disorienting with lots of fast ups and downs it took a while to get attached but then i got completely sucked in the author is from zimbabwe where the novel is set it tells the story of darling who is ten years old at the start she and her friends live in a difficult reality desperately poor in a war torn country half way through she manages to achieve her dream of getting out and making to america where she lives with her aunt and enters teenagehood while it may be true that darling and her friends could indeed use new names what they really need is a new reality their safety and stability has been taken away by a reality of powerlessness violence and illness and yet when she arrives in america she is an outsider an observer in a world that is not fully hers this is a novel about that outsider experience of being an immigrant expressing what it is to be an outsider at home where your daily life is at risk and to be at home as an outsider where the risks are of a different sort home and safety are always out of reach and complete integration is not possible not only names but all of language is a hybrid that doesn't properly work and yet is jerry rigged to fit because what other choice is there but to try to make it work","64":"brutal beautiful impossible to put down even when you want nothing more than to distance yourself from what you've just read","65":"read this book i'd write more but i'm off to look for other titles by this author or to start back again at page 1","66":"it is not a must read but still very very good yet another novel starting off in africa this time zimbabwe and then moving on to the states shortlisted for the man booker prize last year noviolet bulawayo is using a funny unusual way of writing in english","67":"this book was written with very vivid metaphors she makes poignant insights like \"...then you don't see anything to show there are real people are living here even the air itself is empty no delicious food cooking no odors no sounds...\" i found the book easy to read at times unsettling but her writing poetic","68":"i enjoyed the sections set in zimbabwe the most i wasn't aware of the conflict that had occurred there and it was interesting to read about it from the mind set of children in the midst of poverty despair aids and violence games were still played the sections set in the u s were interesting but i tire of the depictions of black americans as ignorant and speaking broken english overall i thought the writing and imagery were good","69":"2 5 starsi'm really sad because this book started off with so much promise but it completely lost me in the second half my main issue with this book is that bulawayo didn't leave the reader with any ideas to develop on their own she uses her characters as mouthpieces for her ideologies not that i disagree with any of her statements which makes for a rather pedantic piece of fiction if i had wanted these themes u0026amp messages delivered in the way she delivers them i would've read some non fiction essays about immigration diaspora disappointment etc aside from the those elements the writing is absolutely beautiful there's no doubt bulawayo knows how to craft a sentence she has a magnificent turn of phrase and uses similes in an endearing and remarkable way without being overbearing though the story is less of a novel than vignettes into a girl's life as she grows up in zimbabwe and moves to the u s there's no through line for the plot at all i expected a lot more from this and unfortunately it just didn't deliver","70":"i had no idea what to expect when i started reading we need no names and was consequently very surprised by the way the narrative unfolded the story is told by a young zimbabwean girl darling who is 10 at the beginning of the novel the reader eventually learns that her family was violently displaced by the brutal mugabe government and is now living in poverty in a primitive camp while occasionally confusing this approach to illustrating life in a shantytown and exploring issues including hunger government oppression and aids is quite powerful i found the scenes depicting the interaction with aid workers particularly enlightening as a teenager darling emigrates to the united states to live with her aunt and the second half of the book deals with the issues of immigration assimilation and simple coming of age after i finished i did some reading about zimbabwe which helped put the first half of the book in context i read a review of the book that suggested it was more like a collection of related short stories than a novel while that is true the first chapter was originally published as a short story the book presents a powerful story in a unique but profound manner this voice required the reader pay extra attention especially in the book's first half but was well worth the time it took to read between the lines i am still thinking about what i read and digesting what it means","71":"in the middle of terrible suffering little kids will figure out games to play ways to keep their pack together this is a powerful read the first half set in zimbabwe and the second half in detroit i found some scenes very hard to read violent disturbing and the organization sometimes challenged me to pay attention but the author's writing is incredibly good sentences so perfect that i had to put the book down for a minute and feel lucky that she wrote this","72":"i have laughed i have cried i have seen the country that was the country that is i travelled darling's journey felt her joy bewilderment resignation acceptance a must read bulawayo has surpassed what adichie gave us in half a yellow sun a beautifully written book with characters and happenings so identifiable for any child of the continent a five star rating does not do this book justice it surpasses this rating a truly magical book","73":" this book can be compared in some ways to chimamande ngozi adichie's americanah in that the protagonist spends half her time in africa and the other half in the united states but while americanah mainly was about an adult world this book talks about the children's world of darling a ten year old zimbabwean girl the first half captured in a voice that is very different from the american half of the book brings out the life of somewhat wild poor zimbabwean children living on the edge of a rich urban area i am not sure if it is harare or bulawayo she captures their dialogue and lives with great insights in the second half of the book darling moves to michigan to live with her aunt her american dreams were soon shattered the voice is different but still insightful i was not as pleased with the book's ending and thus i gave it a 4 but i thought it was an exceptionally written book with great insights into african and american life from the perspective of a child","74":"this book was amazing truly must read for everyone","75":"interesting book about an immigrant from zimbabwe","76":"this novel written largely from the perspective of a childlike narrator is an interesting take on transitioning from an african childhood to an american adolescence the author's writing put me into the shoes of the narrator and allows the reader to see american life through the child's eyes","77":"no punctuation makes this a difficult book to read children without parental influence certainly struggle no matter where they live","78":"the book is fictional but i'm sure that the author had first hand knowledge of the characters and events a slow movie book that really was not worth my time","79":" i knew nothing about this book when i purchased it other than it being on sale and seeing the author's photograph and bio on the flap had i known more i probably would have resisted a story about and narrated by a child is almost certainly something i will not enjoy i would have missed out on an extremely vivid depiction of life in paradise a zimbabwean shantytown bulawayo writes with energy and passion about the tumultuous world occupied by her protagonist darling and darling's friends and family in the early part of the century she captures well the uncertainty of political change and the way such change is viewed by children but as the book progresses the story seems to devolve into a survey as if there are certain experiences that first a young zimbabwean girl and then an african immigrant to the us must experience it feels less like a coherent narrative and more like checking certain boxes that isn't to say that the novel isn't enjoyable and quite poignant but very little comes as a surprise the lack of surprise means a lack of tension and ultimately the story peters out no climax no denouement maybe that is as it should be but it is not an entirely fulfilling read","80":"wow what a great book","81":"i really really enjoyed this book partly because i had absolutely no expectations coming into it one of the good things about downloading books to kobo is that you don't get to read the back cover synopsis and if i had i probably wouldn't have chosen to read this book first i liked the format i am not a fan of short stories but this was a book of loosely connected chapters unlike a novel there was no expectation of a story line character arcs or anticipated climax the first 100 pages are about darling's life in zimbabwe and the second 100 pages about her life in detroit and then kalamazoo despite the hardships of growing up in zimbabwe what struck me the most about the stories was how well the imagination of children was captured these kids were no different than any other kids stealing guavas making fun of people drawing penises on walls and carrying on like the little brats all over sure she has no shoes her 11 year old friend is pregnant by her grandfather they are hungry all the time and the leader of the pack is angry and you sense he's going to get into serious trouble when he's no longer seen as a child it is a bulawayo's ability to make you easily imagine these children as any you might know in circumstances that we can't imagine but that to them are perfectly ordinary it's that that grabs you and makes you mutter shit i love how her first story once moving to america is about snow of course it is the mood of the second half of the book changes darling and her friends in zimbabwe know their lives suck but they make the most of it and there's a sense of fun and joy of being in the world in the american chapters she writes about the loss of connection to her family her past and her place in the world as she describes the suburban lives of immigrants she paints a life with no soul these chapters are dark and sad darling has become an observer unable to connect with anything in her new life","82":"this story of a young girl in zimbabwe was more of a collection of experiences exploring childhood in a shanty remembering a time of prosperity emigrating and reflecting back on it all it does not convey judgment or even a narrative to me but an attempt to frame a life and reconcile choices it raises lots of thoughtful questions what is your country what is family friendship and obligation","83":"you can read my full review on my blog http asthecrowefliesandreads blogsp","84":"i really liked this book it is about a girl from zimbabwe who comes to the us at 10 to live with her aunt in michigan","85":"absorbing read about children living in poverty post zimbabwe independence and the games they play i preferred the first half which is set in zim rather than the parts depicting life in america for zim emigrees","86":"most interesting with culture of zimbabwe shanty town and then replanted as illegals in america wow some of us get all the breaks in life a good read","87":" not a book that would necessarily have been on my radar if it hadn't been on the booker short list despite the striking cover that really grabs your attention this book telling a story of dark times in zimbabwe followed by exile in america is told from a teenage perspective it's funny and moving and really makes stories that you catch glimpses off on the bbc news real and vivid i preferred by far the first half of the book which is set in zimbabwe but this book really deserved to be on the short list and i look forward to noviolet bulawayo's future novels","88":"the opening of this semi autobiographical novel set in zimbabwe has scenes that are more filled with life and color than those when darling the narrator moves to the united states to live with an aunt as the structure is linked short stories the content is of varying interest and there seemed to be much cliche especially in the sections set in america the writing however is lively and at times poetic and i look forward to further work by this gifted promising young writer","89":"this novel will make you smile and laugh and ache i found myself suddenly in tears in the chapter about the main character darling her father who returned from the mines in south africa and darling's friends that chapter alone makes this novel worth reading well actually the chapter about the kids going to the rich neighborhood to steal guavas also makes it worth reading the kids' names are brilliant their spirits strong their love and support for each other heart breaking","90":"noviolet bulawayo's first book is about zimbabwe and about girlhood she has a strong narrative voice as a ten year old among a shantytown watching the adults on the periphery the plot is less driven in america but i think that might be the point","91":"a combination of the innocent eye ala room and the telling of the diaspora experience not unlike americanah make this a compelling read even for someone outside these experiences","92":"i admire this book for its honesty but also for its vivid visual style against a background of brutality the author has found great beauty set against historical events the story is timeless","93":"amazing read reminds me why i read to see the world through another's eyes","94":"most of the criticism i've seen for this book is that the author crammed too much into it i get that a lot is covered in this book that could certainly have been covered in more depth than it offers however as i got into the book i was kind of glad that there was so much crammed in because it made me feel like i was reading a book that was written from a child's preteen's teen's perspective just like the language used the imagery the almost visceral reaction to snow etc drew me into the book into the character in different ways i didn't sit back and go wow i'm very well informed about everything in africa and it's countries i sat back from the book and thought about a life i haven't lived what i've experienced that identified with the character or what i couldn't identify with and because i'm very much in love with books that inspire further reading and learning i added things to my list to further explore that i might not have without the help of bulawayo's work so for me this was a really good and interesting read a kid doesn't pop out of zimbabwe knowing everything about the political climate and current state of affairs she knows about stealing guavas with her friends because they are hungry she knows about red dust coating her feet and how to smile for a camera as if that's her payment for the gifts the npo bring even if it's the last thing she wants to do she knows how she's been taught she knows the stories she's grown up on knows that america is supposed to be better she knows people are getting killed getting arrested not because she reads the paper every day or tunes into the bbc but because she witnesses events up close and hangs around in a tree during a funeral where a mother falls apart her world is crammed with every sense and every crisis she is surrounded by so to tell her story we read a book that is crammed in the same way for me that made sense and made it seem genuine i feel like bulawayo captured the essence of being young and experiencing life not for an anonymous girl from zimbabwe but for darling in particular with all that being said i really can't wait to read more from bulawayo i think she's a young writer with enormous potential because she seems to have a rather good grip on the psychology of her characters","95":"a very interesting and well written book fiction but obviously written from the author's experiences in her home country of zimbabwe at a time of great unrest and uncertainty she is sent to live with her aunt in detroit and later moves to kalamazoo to escape the turmoil in her own country interesting to hear the perspective of her friends about what the u s is really like and what her actual experience is amazing to read about what such a transition would be like and how difficult it is to leave your home country","96":"this book got better as it went along in part because its narrator ages and can articulate her experiences more substantively but it took too long to get there i also think i was influenced by all the hype so i had big expectations it just can't compare to a book like adichie's americanah which i saw it compared to frequently","97":"bought this at sherman's my ibs after reading a review in o magazine it is a devastating and beautiful book with several chapters that could stand on their own as short stories or excerpts to use in a class what made the book especially impressive was that it didn't fit the usual narrative arc of an immigrant story i read the chapters set in zimbabwe with anxiety watching as things deteriorated hoping for improvement for darling to get out of there to some place better but then when she gets to the us the better is muted confusing not always better the novel memoir is heartbreaking not in its scenes of brutality or suffering but in its depiction of the fact that home for better or worse leaves marks on our souls that can't ever be erased and leaving home no matter the reason no matter the improvement causes disruption and loss a beautiful and sad book we need new names should be required reading for anyone considering immigration issues","98":"enjoyed this story particularly how it develops the immigrant tension of being caught between two countries and somewhat lost in between","99":"compelling drawn into the life of a young woman who leaves her troubled country in africa to find a better life in the u s a her experiences of her new life leaves her ultimately as one without a home country challenging the dream that instigated her journey an amazing first novel","100":"i did 'really like' this book for the atmosphere it created for it's believable and mostly likeable characters and for the quality of the writing but there are so many different 'issues' raised at times felt like i was being preached at but it did make me think about the nature of home the pressure of family and society's similarities and differences over continents","101":"best book i've read in awhile","102":"4 5 review to come at editorialeyes book blog","103":"great book especially the first half","104":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked the writing but the structure of the book didn't quite work for me it didn't have the arc of a

easily categorize the end of the book came suddenly and abruptly reading on my kindle i lost track of how much i'd read the final image is brutal i can't say it failed because i'm still thinking about it but if you have issues with dogs dying in books as a stand in for human death i often feel we've become so desensitized that unless we kill innocent animals no one cares then consider this a warning there is a lot of violence in the book but this final image just blew me away as i suppose it was meant to more","105":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it

up as the read for may i vowed to read along to make it even more interesting they went ahead and organized their first ever book club meet up discussion based on the book 11th of june 2016 now that meant i had to stop whatever else i had on my list and go for it simply because i needed to prepare adequately for this discussion as it turned out the book didn't disappoint for those that have read it can attest to this noviolet bulawayo has delivered an impressive intriguing publication that keeps you glued to the texts and the drama that unfolds book reviewtitle we need new namesauthor noviolet bulawayocategory fiction 'we need new names' is a story told through the eyes of a ten year old girl named darling with its setting in zimbabwe darling and her friends godknows chipo stina sbho and bustard who are always after something canning live in a slum called paradise which is quite the vice of the name if it's not stealing guavas from the posh estate budapest next to their shanty homes these friends will be playing games new games that they invent from time to time based on circumstances that they witness or learn of i totally related to this particular aspect and in my mind i visualized myself as a part of these children bulawayo paints the picture of the challenges the citizens of zimbabwe face and the economic instability they are subjected to it is through these experiences that some of the country men evade to neighboring countries such as south africa seeking better paying jobs to help them provide for their families darling and her friends also seem to be after the same when they wish and dream of flying out to countries such as usa as fate will have it darling manages to join her aunt in usa detroit michigan but this turn out to be a living nightmare for her she's bullied in school the weather wasn't as favorable and she is forced to take up odd jobs to enable her pay school fees and send some money back home for her mother and grandmother's upkeep see excerpt isn't this what we also think of our loved ones when they are living in countries which have been rated as the most developed ones in the world we never get to know about the hardships they encounter to pay bills send some money back home at times we are quick to judge when favors aren't extended to us yet these people do the oddest jobs to survive in foreign countries another thing that was brought to my attention during the tbc discussion was the fact that we relay too much on international news channels such as the al jazeera bbc and cnn to relay information on what's happening in other countries for instance uncle kojo goes into a depression when tk joins the army and leaves to work in afghanistan and when darling calls back home and chipo answers they end up getting to a disagreement because of what darling gets to watch on bbc regarding her mother country 'but you are not the one suffering you think watching bbc means you know what is going on no you don't my friend it's the wound that knows the textures of the pain what i took as my take home is the fact that indeed there's no country in the world that doesn't have its own share of hardships just because a particular country's struggles are highlighted doesn't mean that everyone in that particular country goes through the same aside from this the book tackles other societal issues such as hiv hypocrisy in religion and infidelity it's full of humor and get's one intrigued from the very first page i chose to emphasize of the misconception we have between developed and developing countries because let's face it isn't that we tend to perceive i'm trying hard to come out of that shell where i judge because of media news other than getting in depth information from people in this regions i hope you do too on the flip side for those who haven't read the book how about adding it in your tbr list i recommend 'we need new names' to anyone looking to gift a friend or a loved one who loves to read or is into african literature trust you me they'll love it have you read the book what's your take home more","106":"a strong in your face debut novel by an author with a most surprising pen name certainly the author is no shrinking violet coming up with a phrase like 'the anus of the needle' and teen girls' obsession with online porn one of my favourite phrases was 'the sun ironed us ironed us ironed us' i enjoyed this no holds barred story by a zimbabwean the country being so close to home and knowing well the hardships suffered by zim illegals but at times the cast of characters especially those set in america play out like a soap opera it is an unsentimental honest and maybe partly autobiographical story in the voice of a young girl who reaches her teens at the same time as attaining her dream to live with her aunt in america the best short review of it is peter godwin's 'feral feisty funny' also not so funny chapter 16 'how they lived' about alienation from the homeland and the mis fit in a new one was very moving containing passages like ' we were so happy we rummaged though the dustbins of our souls to retrieve the stained broken pieces of god' i wanted to re read the whole chapter the closing image is shocking it juxtaposes the violent starving world darling comes from with the material excess of the usa i look forward to more novels by noviolet bulawayo in rating this i couldn't decide between a 3 5 or a 4","107":" i think people will rate this novel highly because of its subject matter it is a classic 'worthy' read noviolet bulawayo deals with uncomfortable truths and it is difficult to read a novel like this without being overwhelmingly grateful for everything one has darling and her friends live in a shanty town called paradise in zimbabwe she and her friends are poverty stricken with a seemingly hopeless future they play a game of choosing countries hoping to find somewhere else to live that is not 'falling apart' darling does leave and ends up in america longing for home unable to sympathise with american culture which is completely understandable i read this book longing for it to end because i found it difficult to like darling bulawayo does not create her as an empathetic character and despite everything she goes through i found her tiresome her friends were more interesting perhaps the story should have been about one of them instead","108":"noviolet bulawayo's debut novel we need new names we need new names a novel provides a new and fresh look at the american immigrant experience the novel told through the eyes of a young zimbabwean darling from her time in her homeland until she moves to michigan with her aunt this is not an easy book to read darling and her band of friends with their improbable names bastard godknows sbho chipo are like children everywhere lovable mischievous carefree while dealing with the realities of mugabe's zimbabwe poverty oppression hunger aids massive emigration depression the thing that keeps you reading and not assuming this is yet another book about poor africa is how ms bulawayo is able to realistically capture life from a child's point of view when the children take their final trip to budapest the nice side of town and witness a violent attack on the white african family the reader both cringes and smiles at the children's reactions when darling leaves zimbabwe and moves to michigan with her aunt fostalina and her common law husband kojo the tone shifts but is no less musical in sections it becomes a story not specific to a zimbabwean immigrant but speaks for all immigrants living under the pressure of illegal immigration darling is in america on a student visa the loss of home the efforts to assimilate the push and pull between home loss and new opportunity the slow descent into a kind of madness that may be particular to those who have lost their home bulawayo's language her poetry her ability to stay in voice make this book worth the investment i have not decided if i loved or hated the ending ms bulawayo refuses to let the readers off easy by providing a nice pat ending instead she leaves us right where darling is with an uncertain future still missing home and still uncertain of her next steps darling's voice will stay with me for a long time","109":"this is a fabulous first novel the author has given us a fresh new voice and at times the story feels almost biographical we follow the story of darling from a 10 year old girl in zimbabwe where she roams a shanty town with her friends to america at the age of about 14 life in darling's shanty town in zimbabwe was tough yet the children face disease hunger rape religious fanatics and political violence and take it in their stride it's the only life they've known and they get on with it almost treating it like a game then darling's aunt moves her to america for a better way of life the author captures america through new eyes and we sense darling's bewilderment and culture shock even as she becomes accustomed to life in the us home is never far from her mind the story deals with several topics including colonialism coming of age aids immigration but they're drawn together well and darling shines at the centre of the story a believable loveable voice who sees the world through innocent eyes i found it a charming if at times harsh read and i really enjoyed the nuances and cross cultural references recommended","110":"i think i'll need to sit on this one before i post any opinions of this book i liked it and i didn't like it i have a feeling this book is going to grow on me the more i think about it","111":"really liked many things about this book the writing was excellent and the story engaging 3 stars for this one falling short of 4 for some unfortunate transphobia otherwise there is much to like about this book","112":"this book was incredible sad funny horrifying eye opening i highly recommend it i won this book in a goodreads giveaway thank you","113":"the novel is split in half the first part taking place in zimbabwe and the second in the us the first half moves at a good pace it's interesting to read about the children's experiences and the politics of the country but the us half dragged for me it took me a while to get through the end the writing was good but the story dwindled","114":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is an unconventionally written book seemingly on the surface about a kid's world yet hitting hard in places while seemingly maintaining an irreverence about the extremely prickly issues it speaks about we're transported to life in a shanty town from the view of a young girl and her friends and how a life which is agonizingly unfair and difficult for an outsider is looked at by those for whom have to live it themselves for those for which this is 'normal' it's not a unique narrative this is an unconventionally written book seemingly on the surface about a kid's world yet hitting hard in places while seemingly maintaining an irreverence about the extremely prickly issues it speaks about we're transported to life in a shanty town from the view of a young girl and her friends and how a life which is agonizingly unfair and difficult for an outsider is looked at by those for whom have to live it themselves for those for which this is 'normal' it's not a unique narrative style i'm sure but an incredibly powerful one one which allows the author to shock and cause us to count our blessings without ever seeming like sermonising the protagonist in the second half moves half way around the world to the united states to become part of that world of immigrants which then helps us look at the first world from the view of the third world and the pains of the immigrant's journey again not unique - but noviolet bulawayo's style her characters and her observations make it seem very fresh this is also one of those books where the moments stay with you longer than the story stealing the shoes of a girl who's just hung herself watching a white family being slammed out of their ivory towers what people at the other side of an ngos camera feel what young kids and non believers would be thinking in the middle of a religious fervour the attempts at home field abortion the aids the rape the political murders the killing of hope - these parts will haunt and stay for sure the second half of the book is more reflective - the immigrant's travails the wtfness of #firstworldproblems and the transition for what once seemed your's suddenly doesn't remain so and how you become what you thought you weren't i loved this part i've read a lot about the indian and subcontinental immigrant experience thanks to jhumpa lahiri sandip ray khaled hosseini et al but this - without the papers the legal status and the complete inability to go home is obviously a different one it all comes up in a magnificent chapter towards the end titled 'and how they lived' which should be worth the price of the book just in itself i note the major criticism of the book online is that it takes a checklist of third world africa issues and ticks them off one by one uhh i think that's absolutely kaka those checklists those lists of horrors exist for a reason - the narrative of the book allows them all to fit in and it is not too difficult to imagine that the protagonist would have had cause to experience them ps i was unable to make up my mind about what i felt about the language i came about this on the author's website which seemed so wonderfully apt \"let no one be fooled by the fact that we may write inenglish for we intend to do unheard of things with it\"chinua achebe more","115":" hard to believe this is a debut novel bulawayo captures beautifully the bittersweet experience of a young girl's coming to america to live with extended family and escape her impoverished war torn homeland in zimbabwe the heartbreaking conditions from which she escapes the hope with which she views america before her arrival the pain of missing her home her family and her friends and the difficult adjustment to a new strange and often less than welcoming country are all conveyed vividly and memorably","116":"i felt that there were a lot of golden spots throughout the book but that the story before and after arrival in the us didn't mesh together very well the middle of the story dragged and didn't catch speed until the grittiness at the end of the novel","117":"i enjoyed this book more than i thought i would having listened to the thoughts of my book club friends i thought the positioning of the struggles that illegal immigrants face in terms of wanting to return home to visit family but knowing this wasn't an option if they wanted to return to their new country quite insightful the two halves of the book were a good contrast however i would have preferred a little more detail around how darling got to the us","118":"tough to stick with a genuine but unflinching and unflattering portrayal of emptiness of emigration to usa for poor african girl","119":"novioket's book started slow for me but i gradually became connected to her characters and their coming of age story set in zimbabwe and beyond the story is bitter sweet anyone that comes from an immigrant background will connect to the themes in this book i will be looking for her next book","120":"i thought this was beautifully written funny and thought provoking","121":"easy to read book that very well describes africa and america as seen through the eyes of an african girl really enjoyed it","122":"roaring laughs continues where hitting budapest stopped inaonekana hiyo book ni smart sana a guy in a bus with me told me similar device to desai's not naming the character till the end gripping tale on the other hand bulawayo tries too hard to encompass numerous themes the result is telling and unsatisfactory not much exploration of anything though much was hinted at and spoken of still enjoyed it greatly for the humour 5 5","123":"better the devil you know than the devil you dont a unique insight into society from the views of an 'outsider' who has her childhood taken due to the demands for money that exists upon her immigration to america and upon her introduction to adult content through the media this book brings to light the threats to young people in this country which juxtaposes the threats to women as seen through chipo's character and adults in africa i'd recomend this book to anyone","124":"great book loved everything about it","125":"disturbing story told mostly from the point of view of an eleven year old girl growing up in the turmoil of zimbabwe beginning in 2008 it begins with darling and her friends stealing guava in a wealthier area than their tin tin homes takes her to kalamazoo michigan in about 2011 12 i cannot imagine her life i especially enjoyed the chapter on the difficulty of learning and using language","126":" look at them leaving in droves the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves those with nothing are crossing borders those with strength are crossing borders those with ambitions are crossing borders those with hopes are crossing borders those with loss are crossing borders those in pain are crossing borders moving running emigrating going deserting walking quitting flying fleeing to all over to countries near and far to countries unheard of to countries whose names they cannot pronounce they are leaving in droves when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords beneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth lest they be mistaken for those who want to claim the lands as theirs look at them leaving in droves arm in arm with loss and lost look at them leaving droves","127":"naive spoken language narrator packs a punch with powerful situational observation i liked this but sadly i felt like i had read it before it is similar to a number of recent tales from african asian latin american writers","128":"i had tried this one a while ago and had to put it down it just hadn't been the right time for this book this time around i listened to it and was engaged right off the bat it's a difficult book describing the struggle of a childhood among poverty and violence while segueing into a story of immigration bulawayo's prose is intense with imagery depicting darling's ragtag bunch of friends and their misadventures thieving guavas in zimbabwe bulawayo juxtaposes darling's african childhood with her adolescence in the u s exploring the disconnect with her newly adopted country the u s for all its shine and attraction fractures under the weight of her expectations it can be a startling and viscerally felt book yet it's told with some emotional distance rather matter of factly i loved it","129":"really beautiful writing though i somewhat felt the novel was more of a collection of scenes than a story with a beginning middle and end still very much worth the read though","130":"in the first section of this book of two halves the writer gives a flavour of the horrors of life in zimbabwe as seen through the eyes of 10 year old darling and her friends the acting out in their games of these atrocities is convincing especially moving is the fruitless attempt to get rid of chipo's baby the presence of which is hampering their games and the beating to death of bornfree in part 2 when darling moves to detroit to live with her aunt she starts to understand the longing for a homeland left behind and that this new dreamt about life in america has it's own problems the second section has too many messages crammed in but is nicely summarised by the writer as if your house was on fire would you run away and leave it or stay and get water to help put the fire out","131":"though provoking and difficult to read at times but i look forward to my bookclub's discussion of this novel set in present day zimbabwe from the point of view of a young girl","132":" i really wanted to love this book but in the end i have to agree with a lot of the other reviews that said it tried to tackle too much i felt like each and every word was designed at driving home a specific point which became a bit too much after a while i would have happily read a longer book if it were to have given more character development and allowed me to really get to know darling or perhaps if it were split into two books one on darling in zimbabwe and then the sequel on her experiences in the us allowing the reader to be truly immersed in each respective experience as the book currently stands it instead felt like every possible problem that could be tackled in both locations was being crammed into far to few pages the book addresses some very serious issues in a very compelling way and it definitely made me teary eyed i think the author shows a lot of promise given that this is her first book i think it just fell a bit short of what it could have been","133":"bulawayo's voice is truly unique sophisticated english with the flavor of zimbabwe darling is an acute and naive observer her take on events is refreshingly different this book gives the reader valuable insights into large and small issues in africa intertribal conflict regime change religion and the influence of the first world darling eventually ends up living in kalamazoo","134":" the author of we need new names chose her own new name for her writing 'noviolet' is a tribute to elizabeth tshele's mother violet who died when elizabeth was only 18 months old she also chose interesting names for some of the characters in this book set in zimbabwe the story is a first person narrative by darling beginning at about age 10 her close friends include bastard chipo godknows her grandma is mother of bones they live in paradise in the first chapter hitting budapest which won the caine african short story contest a couple of years ago darling and her friends are going to the rich area village neighbourhood of budapest they are looking for guavas to steal and eat it reminded me as a kid sneaking into the nearby church yard with a couple of friends to steal crabapples from the trees somehow the tart fruits tasted better when the adrenaline was surging and the heart was palpitating with fear their antics are brought up short by a white woman who calls to them from her house and then comes outside to talk with them and take photos the kids are uncomfortable -- who is this person the peculiar encounter is described with just the right level of unease of a bit of a culture tangle the shocking ending to that chapter sends a warning about what may come later darling is written as a strong dynamic voice she's not a creation she is there existing right there on the page talking to you she's tough she's funny she's opinionated especially powerful are scenes where darling and her friends meet up with westerners usually expats or from ngos and later in america the familiar tv scene of the ngo truck arriving in some african village to dispense aid and goodies to throngs of shouting black kids is turned inside out or flipped around and it is funny as well as unsettling and thought provoking the novel is a collection of discrete events almost linked short stories many of the chapters stand on their own as the character gets a bit older several short chapters become more introspective and serve more as the role of chorus there's a lot here -- coming of age colonialism aids immigration assimilation -- but somehow it knits wells together and darling's voice always stays strong i hope to see this one on the booker shortlist","135":" this is a book that really grew on me it starts off following a group of children in zimbabwe darling stina chipo bastard and godknows seemingly innocent children living in a not so innocent environment as a child darling and friends lived in shanty towns in zimbabwe after mugabe's paramilitary police bulldozed down their homes they spent their days stealing guavas getting into mischief and daydreaming about the typical things african kids do about eating good food and ultimately becoming rich overseas in places such as dubai and the usa this story is a sort of coming of age story of darling what complicates darling's coming of age story is her moving to detroit michigan to live with her aunt as is typical among africans and also non africans of course an escape to the west may not be what it seems added to that the struggles and sacrifices they've had to make \"we hid our real names gave false ones when asked we built mountains between us and them we dug rivers we planted thorns we had paid so much to be in america and we did not want to lose it all \" how is life like for an african immigrant in the usa or elsewhere in the west bulawayo shows that it's definitely not a bed of roses there are so many stressors including listening to misconceptions about one's land and cultures and having to quickly adapt to a new culture adding to the stress is the fact that there are so many illegal immigrants in the states who feel stressed by the threat of deportation looming over them i really liked the book's cross cultural comparisons of africa and the usa the linguistic aspects were the most interesting to me \"because we were not in our country we could not use our own languages and so when we spoke our voices came out bruised when we talked our tongues thrashed madly in our mouths staggered like drunken men \" reading some of the reviews i've noticed that some people felt disconnected from the second half of the story the part where darling is in the states i have to be contrary and say that that was the strongest part to me it resonated with me the most perhaps it is because i have zimbabwean relatives and i know many african immigrants who have experienced hardships after moving to the states and elsewhere i know a lot of immigrants who experience depression mental health issues and alcoholism due to their immigration i know so many of their stories and i feel that bulawayo captured them very well","136":" this is my favourite so far of the booker prize shortlist for this year it is the story of a girl who begins her life in zimbabwe then moves to the us it is beautifully written in the first person and spans perhaps eight years of her life her voice changes at a perfectly balanced rate as she grows up i have not visited zimbabwe and i doubt i ever will but i have seen a tiny bit of it from the zambezi river which i have canoed down when i was staying in zambia five years ago the first half of the book centres on our protagonist darling and her friends they used to live in proper houses with toilets and running water but now thanks to the current political climate they live in tin shacks in a shanty town they go over to the wealthy part of town to steal guavas from the trees there the fruit fills their bellies but makes them sick the title of the book comes from when the kids are playing a game where they are about to do a real life abortion on their friend under a tree with a rusty coat hanger but they are pretending to be doctors from the tv series er there is a two page chapter dead centre in the book which is pure poetry telling of how the people left their country for strange lands after that we hear of darling's life in the us it turns out that not everyone in the us drives a lamborghini as she had expected and there is crime and poverty here too but of course there is so very much food and at least she is not starving and she does very well in school because school is so easy in this country that even a donkey could pass there is humour in this sad story maybe it was my imagination but the phrase \"things fall apart\" or something similar was mentioned at least ten times in this book is bulawayo referencing the archetypal modern african novel of the same name of the poem it references itself for the tile or am i just imagining things darling is pleased to be in this developed country but she is an illegal immigrant so life is far from perfect also she misses home but which home she tells of the many homes in her and her immediate family's heads home before the white people stole the country home during war home after the black people got their country back when they had nice houses and then the current home when they live in the shanty town of course this is over simplifying a hugely complex situation but it is sobering to put it this way and to point out that all this huge change can have happened in one person's lifetime when your country is in such a terrible state that it's people are leaving in droves it does not all become ok just because you as an individual are now living somewhere a bit wealthier and safer and doing a crappy job there bulawayo illustrates this very well in the book i have loved this book i have yet to read the one that won the prize this year but it will have to do very well to beat this one in my mind click here to read the rest of my reviews","137":"really enjoyed this book","138":"a thought provoking novel that examines so many complex issues war belonging political turbulence coming of age the concept of home the shift in voice threw me at first but i eventually settled back in","139":"great writing and very thought provoking by an author from my birth country of zimbabwe read my review at http harrietbicksler wordpress com","140":"this is a powerful insight into the atrocities zimbabwean people have experienced at the hands of various regimes it is the more so as it is told through the eyes of children sadly none if it was surprising or new and the book was a depressing read from start to finish if you want reality without sugar coating or much if a plot this is it","141":"i think what i find really remarkable about this book is that it's funny we often believe books from the 'dark continent' will be dreary and depressing noviolet has written a poignant witty and dry story set in zimbabwe and later in the us she explores the desperation and isolation that diasporic communities feel this truly is a remarkable book that i'd recommend time and time again she well deserved the man booker nomination","142":" this book was really a disappointment after i read so many positive reviews i have read many books about southern africa in particular and this one really lacked direction and a compelling heroine the first half of the book is set in a small village in zimbabwe and while there is evidence of terrible things happening the danger is told about in more of an abstract way i accepted that because darling the main character is only 11 or so and the novel is told exclusively with her voice whether it was angry black mobs the aids epidemic the lack of education among the young or the devastating poverty it was always filtered through the eyes of children so when darling goes to america to live with an aunt very little is said about her actual departure or how she feels about it i did expect more than just 140 pages of disdain for everything america yes disdain darling seems to just feel sorry for herself being subjected to stupid americans their tv pornography ignorance and bad speech while there is evidence of some assimilation mostly she pines away for the endless days she used to spend stealing guavas from wealthy homes back in zimbabwe the ending of this book shows very little growth emotionally for the main character and i completely lost patience with this girl who is not darling in any way","143":"leaving in droves...i admit to being somewhat conflicted about my view of this book worthy of its shortlisting for the 2013 booker i agree but i'm also rather glad it didn't win let me start by getting my criticisms out of the way and then i'll try to explain why i think it's very much worth reading nonetheless this is the story of darling a young girl living in a shanty town in zimbabwe when we first meet her she is ten and spends most of her time with her little group of friends through them we get a child's eye view of the devastation that has been wrought on the country during the mugabe period at the half way point darling is sent to america to live with her aunt in michigan and the second half is taken up with seeing the immigrant experience as darling learns about this society that is so different from anything she has known to play country game...first we have to fight over the names because everybody wants to be certain countries like everybody wants to be the usa and britain and canada and australia and switzerland and france and italy and sweden and germany and russia and greece and them these are the country countries...nobody wants to be rags of countries like congo like somalia like iraq like sudan like haiti like sri lanka and not even this one we live in - who wants to be a terrible place of hunger and things falling apart the problem i have is that it feels a little as if bulawayo has started by writing down a list of all the bad things we associate with zimbabwe and then a similar list of all the downsides of the us the book is episodic with each chapter being a little story on its own and each story has a 'point' so we get the chapter on aids one on female genital mutilation then incest and rape white people being run off their properties the rigging of elections and the violence that goes along with that and so on in america we get out of control kids school shootings porn obsession with looks and weight celebrity culture etc it's a bleak picture of both countries with the over riding feeling being that the grass isn't as much greener for immigrants as they expected it to be it all feels a little contrived and amalgamated and i couldn't help feeling that firstly it wasn't telling me much i didn't know and secondly that there was an almost exploitative and voyeuristic element to the stringing together of all of these horrors however...the writing is fresh and original and darling and her friends are brought vividly to life especially in the zimbabwean section with a less than thorough understanding of what's going on around them they are the observers - the reader is the interpreter although there's never enough food to go round except briefly when the ngos pay their regular visits there is a sense of community - a community that is tottering on the point of collapse yes but still hanging on to old traditions despite all the bad things happening around them the children seem on the surface to be like children anywhere - breaking rules and taking risks full of bravado when in their group dreaming of a better future bulawayo very effectively uses the games they play to show the effect that their experiences have had on them - games based on the relative importance of countries with their own country low on the list games of find bin laden and gradually as they witness more and more violent and irrational behaviour around them the games darken too i found the american portion of the book patchier in its effectiveness but bulawayo gets across very clearly the difficulties of learning to live in a new culture always speaking in a second language and the longing for home she writes very movingly about the people left behind in zimbabwe relying on the dollars that the immigrants send home and she gives a believable and poignant picture of this young girl gradually losing touch with the friends and family back home unable to explain to them what she is experiencing in the reality of this new world they have dreamed about i found bulawayo's writing style hugely skilful in giving an authenticity to darling's voice throughout and allowing her language to grow and change as she moves through adolescence although i had a problem with the tick list of horrors i still found myself moved deeply on several occasions and in particular by the short chapter at the centre of the book - an interlude between the two sections where bulawayo describes the exodus of a generation from her troubled homeland in language so beautiful and evocative it could fairly be described as a prose poem look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay so in the end the quality of the writing and language together with the emotionalism that bulawayo achieves without ever allowing mawkishness to creep in makes this a book that i am glad i have read and highly recommend nb this book was provided for review by the publisher random house www fictionfanblog wordpress com","144":"i can completely understand why this book was shortlisted for the man booker prize and why other readers would rate it higher the writing was original and the character's narrative was quirky and entertaining however i wasn't as encapsulated with the actual storyline than i was with the way it was written i felt like it had so much more to give nevertheless it's a cultural eye opener and an interesting read","145":" a brilliantly beautiful contemplation of what it means to lose one's home repeatedly bulawayo is an amazing artist with words while it is constructed as a novel each chapter has the coherence and individuality of a short story so the reading experience is somewhat like reading a series of vignettes on the one hand this story appears to have the truth of autobiography animating it yet on the other hand bulawayo plays games with the elapsing of time in a way that gives her tale a touch of unreality","146":"i cannot recommend this book highly enough we live in a country of immigrants and this is an unparalleled look into what being a third culture person feels like her voice is a easier to read the story was engaging and i walked away from this book feeling like i had a deeper understanding of the world i live in","147":"didn't engage with this book as i'd expected to after the recommendations it started well but the story lost my interest once the narrative moved to usa","148":" i have always wanted to read myself in contemporary zimbabweanliterature we need new names does

steps up at the right time to produce a novelwritten with so much intimacy and care the characters that people thebook are not mere cardboard cut outs strutting lifelessly through thepages but \"real\" people who though sometimes weighed down by theneglect and insult of the world proclaim insistently theirdetermination to survive to step out of the shadows and be counted every character evolves as the book progresses turning into someonethe reader had not quite expected for instance the actions of theseordinary children darling and her small gang are spontaneous andimpulsive mere

its own the narrative is witty multi layered intricately constructed deeply informed elegantly written we neednew names is a great beginning to noviolet bulawayo's literary careerand a significant contribution to zimbabwean literature","149":" continuing the richmond summer reading game this book was my africa entry on the globe i chose this in large part because i had heard it was good but hadn't heard anything specific about it which meant i could just sort of abstractly look forward to reading it instead of have preconceived notions or overly high expectations and now having read it i can understand why it might be hard to explain what is so good about it sure there is bulawayo's unique voice and gift for language and there is young darling's powerful narration and i do love the way we learn about the intense situation in zimbabwe under the mugabe regime through the eyes of children the assimilation story once darling comes to detroit to live with her family is also nicely handled all of it is really lovely in a way that is hard and complicated and a little difficult to accept but i think what resonated most strongly for me was the way bulawayo has told a story that is both of zimbabwe and of the us it is a story of a girl wanting to get out of zimbabwe to the united states and then the story of a girl in the united states reflecting what it means to be displaced from zimbabwe and these struggles and wishes are not separate from darling's wish to eat all the fruit from a neighbor's tree or her struggle to cope with the other girls at school the large scale global things mix with the ordinary things of childhood and that is what makes it really special well that and the magical way bulawayo uses words and names the language is wonderful if i have one thing i would do differently with this book it is that i might look for it in audio","150":"really enjoyed the unique voice of darling and her friends in zimbabwe but overall this didn't make too much of an impression on me surprised it made it all the way to booker shortlist 2013","151":" whoa the words my god the words how does somebody put them together in such a way so that you can feel so incredibly part of what's going on the chapter called how they lived is the most amazing description of being an african immigrant in the united states or really i imagine being an immigrant from any place this book isn't so much a straight telling of a story yes there's a beginning middle and end yes there are characters but it's really more the telling of an experience it's about the difference between a maize field in zimbabwe and a corn field in indiana for example no matter how green the maize looks in america it is not real they call it corn here and it comes out all wrong like small sweet too soft i don't even bother with it anymore because eating it is really a disappointing thing it feels like i'm just insulting my teeth","152":" the first part of the book is the rawest most physical description of childhood in present day zimbabwe it's honesty is a sharp as a dagger it's much more visceral than tsitsi dangarembga's nervous conditions which recounts childhood during the era of white minority rule despite its in your face descriptions of poverty it also captures childhood in ways few writers can garry trudeau in his introduction to a calvin and hobbes cartoon collection pointed out that most writers who feature children feature them as wise cracking mini adults noviolet bulawayo doesn't do that darling bastard stina and their friends are real kids with the innocence and the latent brutality kids everywhere exhibit if the book had just consisted of this part i would have given it five stars the second part describes darling's journey and life in the us here the narrative falls into the well trodden pathways of other coming to the us novels the most recent example of which is adichie's americanah initially it works better than adichie's which sounds more distant cerebral much of it matches my own experience of coming to live in this strange country but white guys with proper papers don't face the same circumstances the story switches from the adventures of darling in a strange country to a more general mourning of the lost home in zimbabwe the pain of having left behind another world and not being able to go back because of a lack of proper papers is palpable in those pages unfortunately the two pieces don't mesh well the latter interrupts the former's narrative flow","153":"this story begins when darling the narrator is 10 and living in zimbabwe all around her life is in chaos but she and her friends are children so we observe it all with from a child's point of view we follow darling until she is a 15 year old living in michigan with an aunt the story of her transformation to almost american teenager is beautiful and at times heart breaking","154":"engaging even powerfully distressing at times but ultimately too scattered like a collection of short stories that hadn't yet quite coalesced into a novel","155":"i'm going with 3 5 stars i'm not really sure how i feel about this book darling is growing up in zimbabwe with friends and neighbors from before but now it is after after their homes and houses and possessions were bulldozed and they are now living in a shanty town running amok amongst each other innocently playing games like find bin laden and stealing guavas from the rich people in budapest then darling is transplanted to michigan with her aunt and the tone and imagery of the book are completed turned upside down i'm not sure if my american ways are fantasizing the imagery and conditions of the story in zimbabwe but i felt like once darling came to america everything about her was lost in this dreary and cold country that was ugly to look at it's people were ugly her whole life was ugly terrible things were happening in zimbabwe but it was her country and her life with friends and family as hard as it was you could feel the love and joy she had there once she came to the usa i feel like everything turned blah and there wasn't anything good about being here materialism runs rampant though they were greedy with the ngo people in zimbabwe but what a different level this book just gave me all sorts of weird feelings we have book discussion about it the first saturday in april so i am looking forward to seeing what others though and felt","156":"a lot going on in a not too long book i loved the bits that show different ways of coping with difficult situations some very beautiful writing in the book especially the short interlude between zim and us","157":"i received this book through goodreads first reads i wanted to like it but it didn't have a cohesive plot and though there were a few poetic parts i enjoyed and scattered descriptions here and there it overall was lackluster 1 5 of 5","158":"i really liked darling and i love her name","159":" ten year old darling and her friends narrate their days in paradise zimbabwe after they've been evicted from their homes and set up homes in tin shacks in paradise despite the lack of food schooling or material goods the world these kids inhabit is a colorful vibrant one pulsing with life and energy when darling goes to live with her aunt fostalina in destroyedmichigan she has everything she didn't before but now experiences intense longing for her homeland and its people bulawayo writes beautifully with humor and depth of the experience of displacement","160":"i read this story of a girl's life in zimbabwe and her later immigration to america and enjoyed it it's one of those books written in present tense with no quotations but it reads smoothly characters have interesting names and theme about names goes throughout in one or two cases the main character comes up with an alternate name for another character but it's kind of amusing and it's clear who she is talking about two of the chapters were poetic one concerning leaving one's country and the other about immigrants in the us as immigration lawyer it paints a larger picture of people's struggle to get here if they have an unstable country they may go through so much there and so much to get here and then life here can be tough too friendship is a major theme a group of young people are fast friends in the tough life of a shanty town of people who were bulldozed out of their houses in a poor area of a city in zimbabwe they cope with the tragedies that occur on an almost daily basis illness political repression hunger they have their own games they made up and their ways of relating to each other","161":"very rare writing style i loved it the plot itself not so much","162":"almost could have been a 4 book started out so interesting such a great voice but then oh it just lost much of that charm it was good enough but i'd thought it was going to be so much better will happily pass this on to my mom though","163":"interesting refugee novel and quick read about growing up in zimbabwe under mugabe the persecution of white zimbabweans and the trials and tribualations of adjusting to life in the u s and adapting well written though the prose is stream of consciousness is poor english so if that bothers you beware i read it in 24 hours coming back from malawi and it is impressive that the author is just in college definitely has some great metaphors names and creativity strikes me as similar to zadie smith for some reason not high on the list unless you love books on immigrants or zimbabwe or a long plane ride","164":"the story of a southern african girl in a country is not identified i think because it could be any country in the region a description of the book identifies the country as rwanda her story begins in africa and takes her through her adjustments to living in the u s as a teenager the african part of the story is more touching but the other is also interesting in terms of immigrant adjustment","165":" this book is not linear in its story telling it does tell the story of darling and her life and travel from zimbabwe to the united states but interspersed are flashbacks and chapters of beautiful prose that is almost poetry in its rhythm and flow these breaking of chapters and story feels in format only not in writing style like steinback's the grapes of wrath with that in mind i would recommend reading it rather than listening to it in audio i listened to the playaway but felt a little deprived when it came to the chapters of prose because i wanted to see how the words were arranged on the page it felt so much like poetry but i always have to read poetry for myself and interpret the breaks and pauses and their significance which is more difficult when listening to someone else read to you","166":" bulawayo has a true gift with words and her story of a young zimbabwe girl is fast paced and engaging but ultimately the author tries to cover so many themes that the novel feels forced and inauthentic which is a real shame in the first half of the book the first person narrator darling runs free in the slums with a gang of colorful and unruly sidekicks on the one hand the preteens are a delight to read about because they are just so wild on the other hand their adventures which take the reader from aids to land reform poverty to colonialism cover so much ground in zimbabwe's current affairs that the narrative takes on its forced character bulawayo uses the narrator's experiences to highlight every aspect of zimbabwe's struggles rather than develop a coherent story about the girl herself the same tension appears in the second half of the book when darling migrates to michigan to live with her aunt again the language beautifully describes the anxiety dislocation and struggles experienced by migrants and again the moving nature of these passages is tempered by the cram it all in approach the challenges darling and her family confront include language barriers financial hardship paternalism from americans who think africa is one country culture clashes over food sex child discipline and women's weight the war in iraq and more the ending then feels abrupt and abstract since the story never truly focuses on darling as an individual darling is ultimately a cipher for the zimbabwe experience the story never has any resolution","167":"what a final paragraph","168":" a wistful nostalgia for the culture left behind and an exciting and fraught adaptation to a new country by a young immigrant are the themes explored in this novel about the human side of globalization it's a first person account of a girl darling who grows up in an african country then moves to michigan where she experiences her adolescence and young adulthood the world of her youth is conveyed through stories of her childhood games religious services attended and political violence witnessed the scene then switches to michigan where the teenaged darling hangs out at the mall with her friends shops at borders bookstore and discovers the internet her bicultural background affords her a unique perspective and some of the descriptions of america through an exile's eyes are fascinating to behold there's one passage about the snow in michigan coming down and covering everything which describes her bafflement at the fact that something that covers everything can be so quiet that it doesn't even make the smallest sound another passage an account of the fast food offerings in america describes the spiritual reaction mcdonald's and kfc provokes in darling a religious revival that makes her a born again believer in a higher power after witnessing so much plenty darling's state of mind is foremost in this novel and the language she uses is a creative vivid expression of her perspective from the sun \"ironing\" her in the country of her birth to her new home in \"destroyedmichygen \" some of her resentments can seem peevish and she bristles often at the numerous indignities she undergoes and witnesses but this is a rich insightful account of immigration in our time told in an individual and arresting voice","169":" we need new names is a lush language rich narration by a young african girl who gradually becomes an expat in kalamazoo michigan the narrator's voice has a wonderful innocence even as she and her playmates i'd say schoolmates but the teachers have all left the country and the school closed play such games as find bin laden she also has a special gift for capturing expressions on other characters' faces like she was hearing music inside her head and dancing to it is a description of the expression of an aunt who has been complimented by an old flame who is marrying someone else the disintegration of the home country the desperate desire to be somewhere else and the bitterness of those left behind are rendered in muscular lyrical prose studded with native our language which is never identified and childish phrases the description of eating the guavas on which she used to gorge herself as a child for the first time since coming to the u s is worth the price of admission funny tender voracious and yearning the only piece of this novel that hit a sour note for me was a chapter at the end of the book narrated by a we rather than the i in every other chapter it consisted of a lyrical wild description of the labor of largely undocumented newcomers to the us while beautiful in its own right and easily capable of being a brilliant standalone essay it was oddly out of place especially as our narrator herself had barely begun to work it sounded like an angry political squawk in an otherwise equally powerful but more subtle birdsong that is ultimately more personal and persuasive","170":"stopped more times than i can count to discover the deeper meaning","171":"it was lovely funny heart breaking you go through a lot of emotions like the character you relive your childhood and makes you walk through adulthood once more with a much more vivid look must read","172":"part of my conscious effort to read more books about africans african immigration by african authors and not just the latin american stuff i normally read","173":"bulawayo belongs to the long tradition of zimbabwe's masters i doff my cap milady","174":" a few years ago i was listening to one of those from our own correspondent programmes on the bbc a female journalist was on an assignment in mali and had got herself completely lost she drove up to this village the middle of nowhere and a whole crowd of teenagers spotted her and came crowding around she noticed with a jolt that they all had osama bin laden t shirts on with a sinking feeling she figured that she might be in some serious trouble they demanded to know who she was she told them she was from the bbc \"bbc bbc \" they all started yelling and cheering \"we love america america bbc \"this illustrates a certain two way misunderstanding between the west and the developing countries and also that you can't judge a person by the t shirt they're wearing it might be the only one they could find that morning in this novel darling is a 10 or 11 year old girl living in paradise a bitterly named shantytown in zimbabwe round about 2007 and 2008 when the whole country was falling apart we don't see the big picture because we're with a bunch of kids who roam around stealing guava and playing stupid games because they don't go to school any more school closed so you don't get any mention of the scary hyperinflation which was a happening thing at that time wiki over the course of the five year span of hyperinflation the inflation rate fluctuated greatly at one point the us ambassador to zimbabwe predicted that it would reach 1 5 million percent in june 2008 the annual rate of price growth was 11 2 million percent the worst of the inflation occurred in 2008 leading to the abandonment of the currency the peak month of hyperinflation occurred in mid november 2008 with a rate estimated at 79 600 000 000% per month the price of us$1 cost $z2 621 984 228 in october 2008here's a zimbabwean one hundred trillion dollar note - you don't see many of those things highly collectible now anyway long story short darling gets a lucky break - she has an aunt in detroit who gets her into america on a visitor's visa and of course she stays and becomes an illegal so from being a bittersweet celebration of how kids manage to live their own lives amongst adult cruelty and economic catastrophe the story then changes gear very smoothly and becomes about awkwardness - the square peg in a round hole ness of the immigrant experience the intense longing for home yet never wanting to go back the love of family but the dread of them actually phoning all the time asking for money always money that kind of thing i think other readers have mentioned that noviolet bulawayo seems intent on ticking an awful lot of issue boxes as she zips through her story - for instance of course the daughter of the rich guy whose house darling cleans has bulimia and the material riches and moral emptiness of america are laid on with a bit of a trowel it's not unfair to say but still this was good stuff and there's a brilliant stand alone chapter called \"how they lived\" which is a kind of sad survey of the whole immigrant experience and is one of the best things i read all year 3 5 stars","175":"i thought the writing in this book was often lovely and the author did a good job of allowing darling's voice to mature as she grew up i very much enjoyed the insight into darling's childhood in zimbabwe and was glad to be able to gain some understanding of the history of this nation however overall i felt like the book tried to do too much in too few pages touching on as many issues as possible including poverty oppression race relations aids incest illegal immigration assimilation mental illness substance abuse war teen pregnancy pornography etc etc without delving into any of them in sufficient depth for me to really appreciate their impact i wish the author would have chosen to focus on darling's childhood in zimbabwe as i think there was the potential there for a five star book","176":" this was a compelling book with a lot of promise but in the end it completely fizzled out i was caught up by the story of darling a ten year old zimbabwean girl and her oddly named friends chipo stina godknows bastard and sbho they had all lived in fairly stable homes with parents until they were caught in the chaos of i can't exactly explain what because i'm not well informed about zimbabwean politics and darling herself is unable to clearly articulate whether her home was bulldozed and her life turned upside down due to civil war corruption a change in power or something else altogether in any case the maturity reliance and wisdom of these children is astonishing and drew me in eventually darling was able to escape to michigan to live with her aunt and uncle bulawayo does a great job showing us how difficult it is for a poor hungry zimbabwean girl to adjust to the excesses and inconsistencies of life in the u s but the story ends abruptly without darling even being able to form a stable identity much less any clue about whether darling returns to zimbabwe gets to go to college in the us becomes an alcoholic like her uncle or any other possibility the abrupt ending the lack of quotes and the two brief summary chapters not in darling's voice all contributed to my feeling that this could have been but wasn't an amazing novel also to a westerner like me sure maybe they did need new names but i don't feel the novel ever addressed the title the closest was we need new games","177":"my library is considering recent fiction on immigration for a book discussion this is the only reason i picked up this book and the only reason i finished reading it darling a precocious 10 year old living in zimbabwe suffers like her friends and family from severe poverty and government oppression there is no school the teachers left because they weren't being paid the kids roam about steal guavas to eat and play games like killing bin laden portions of this section are sad others funny but others reinforce every negative stereotype about africa then darling is sent to america to live with her aunt in michigan the book here becomes very episodic almost a collection of independent short stories some of bulawayo's writing is absolutely brilliant the almost essay like chapter how we lived about the highs and lows of immigrant life stands out and should be required reading for all adults some is intriguing and thought provoking such as wedding when darling attends the wedding of her aunt's old boyfriend to a white woman and overhears comments by both africans and americans about the situation however we need new names contains endless profanity and particularly when darling and her american friends still in middle school view computer porn extremely graphic sexual descriptions i found this both unpleasant and unnecessary and it sharply limited the book's appeal it would also benefit from a glossary of the many undefined foreign terms not recommended","178":"the novel is well written but the problem is with the protagonist utterly devoid of empathy for anyone around her she is an extremely unlikable character and as a result i didn't care about what happens to her i stopped reading about halfway through","179":"loved it insight into a culture i know almost nothing about loved the immigrant storyline and the way the author writes","180":"a visceral quirky charming poignant experience of what it feels like to live in a country torn apart by political strife and the resulting mixed emotions of being an immigrant fabulous character development narrative and voice","181":"fresh perspective","182":"seen through the eyes of darling a 10 year old girl from zimbabwe who escapes the time of political unrest to go live with her aunt in the states this beautifully written book explores concepts of immigration culture and what it really means to be from a country","183":"so many interesting things in this book definitely more engaged in the second half so stick with it if you struggle in the beginning this is a book i can't wait to discuss with my book club i'm not sure if it was an enjoyable read but it was thought provoking interesting unique and i'm glad i read it","184":"this was an interesting and worthwhile read most impressive was the insight into the us immigrant experience unlike most immigrant stories i grew up reading there was no happy assimilation ending to me this was similar but not as good as adichie's purple hibiscus however the chapter how they lived reads like a beautiful heartrending poem both books deepened my empathy for people who are forced to leave their homes due to violence and poverty i feel so grateful not to have to have had to make that choice yet in this life","185":"my interest wavered in the latter half but bulawayo's language remained sublime and gently lyrical throughout you can see why she's a pen hemingway award winner","186":" a confronting story told through the eyes of a zimbabwean child who manages to be naive and world weary at the same time much of it appears scathingly ironic the kids wear t shirts emblazoned with the logos of american universities courtesy of charities yet their own access to education is minimal the aid workers have their photos taken with the children in a way reminiscent of the orientalism of 18th century colonialism the implication being clear written in a unique voice this is a book i deeply appreciated rather than loved a dark horse contender for the booker prize","187":" the first part of the book which takes place in zimbabwe was very lyrical and beautiful the characters both children and adults were fully developed and interesting to read about the episode where the white ngo volunteers come to the village to pass out donations and take pictures of darling and her friend is poignant and original although much of this part of the story was heartbreaking the poverty the election results the deteriorating conditions the pregnancy of an 11 year old and the spread of aids there was humor and beauty in the telling it all starts to become a bit more cliche and characters become a bit more cardboard when darling moves to the us with her aunt","188":"i enjoyed the writing style overall and the sensitive unique perspective of the narrator there were a couple chapters that exited the narrator's thread that threw me off specifically the one describing how hard the immigrant communities work and how they're trapped the new future narrator was off putting when we returned to the original narrator's story right off the chapter itself was interesting","189":"one of those books you feel like you've read before the whole time you're reading it a paragraph or two of brilliance and then horribly predictable including the shocking ending","190":"we need new names the debut of niovolet bulawayo shortlisted for the man booker prize and for the guardian first book award i think i should stay away from books that have won prizes or have been shortlisted i have bad experiences with those i absolutely loathed the shock of the fall by nathan filer and all the cows in idiopathy of sam bryers couldn't entertain me either and still this book inspired me i was drawn to it in the bookstore and so i decided to give it a go yet again i just don't see what the jury saw i guess i don't know i honestly don't know the book did grow on me as i was reading it the first part being a descriptive couple of chapters on darling's childhood in zimbabwe at war although thumbs up for the way bulawayo manages to capture both the children's innocence and the war's cruelties at the same time i just wasn't sucked into the story the many african names the jumping from one subject to another ... it was just too much it was hard to relate to and i also had the impression bulawayo wanted to touch upon so many different issues in one book it was just too much aids war cruelties teen pregnancies poverty rape racism... all of that in 100 pages i appreciate this must have been the hard reality of people in that country at the time but to get a point across to your readers i think it might be better to pick 2 items and work with these more profoundly than to mention all of them and let them float somewhere the second part i could relate to much better and i actually enjoyed reading it little darling has moved to america to live with her aunt in destroyedmichygen detroit michigan we follow darling as she grows up as a teen and tries to find her way in this new society where everything is present in abundance i think i appreciated this part more because i myself moved to the usa as a teenager and can relate very well to the impressions she has of the country as a foreigner even though my culture shock doesn't even come close to hers and to the feeling she had of not belonging anywhere at all any more like where is your home there are times though that no matter how much food i eat i find the food does nothing to me like i am hungry for my country... because we are not in our country we could not use our own language and so when we spoke our voices came out bruised when we talked our tongues trashed madly in our mouths like drunken man because we were not using our languages we said things we did not mean and what we really wanted to say remained folded inside trapped... some of darling's impressions of the usa just had me smiling even though at times highly exaggerated and too generalising ... i also have my list of american words that i keep under the tongue like talismans in order to fit in ready to use pretty good pain in the ass for real awesome totally skinny dude freaking like psyched allowance yikes ... ... i smile back it's not exactly a smile smile just the brief baring of teeth that's what you do in america you smile at people you don't know and you smile at people you don't even like and you smile at people for no reason... ... and besides i've been getting all a's in everything even maths and science the subject i hate because school is so easy in america even donkeys would pass in america the fatness is not the fatness i was used to at home over there fatness was of bigness just ordinary fatness you could understand because it meant the person ate well fatness you could even envy it was fatness that did not interfere with the body a neck was still a neck a stomach a stomach an arm an arm but this american fatness takes it to a whole other level the body is turned into something else the neck becomes a thigh the stomach becomes an anthill an arm a thing a buttock i don't even know what when i saw that she angelina jolie got that pretty girl from ethiopia i wished she had come to my county too when i was little i could be darling jolie pitt right now and living in a mansion and flying around in jets and everything this second part saved the book for me otherwise i would have left it unread to the end i do praise bulawayo's writing style she has a very distinctive and descriptive use of language that i do appreciate we'll hear more from her i am sure but i hope her next books will be more in depth and less all round because the topics she raises are worth reading about","191":"we need new names written by noviolet bulawayo is a story about a girl darling initially ten years old who starts out in zimbabwe and then moves to kalamazoo michigan via destroyedmichigan in the first half we follow darling in paradise zimbabwe as she hangs out with her friends bastard godknows sbho stina and chipo playing games stealing guavas from the richer budapest neighborhood and hiding from the violence in the second half darling has moved to america and we follow her as she struggles with life as an illegal immigrant in america it took me some time to get used to this book the writing was quite different and the names words distracting at first the first half of the book taking place in zimbabwe provides lots of violence but it is presented in the matter of fact voice of ten year old darling it is a strange mix of child play and adult violence another strange mix is the poverty in the shantytown and references to american pop culture the children knows more about american culture than the political struggles in mugabe's zimbabwe consequently the reader also does not know the reasons behind the violence the second half resonated with me more as someone who left his country and moved to kalamazoo here noviolet explores both cross cultural differences and how an immigrant sees america as well as how america changes how darling thinks about zimbabwe i liked many things here are a few examples the white man who was forcibly removed from his house by a gang of zimbabweans blak power stated i am an african this is my fucking country too my father was born here i was born here just like you i wonder if darling felt the same way at times in america on leaving one's country they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same darling has to reinvent herself when she arrives in detroit and kalamazoo and this change makes her different from her old friends while at the same time not being american suddenly one does not belong anywhere l eaving your country is like dying and when you come back you are like a lost ghost returning to earth roaming around with a missing gaze in your eyes just one more thing whenever he is with someone from his country everything about him is different his laugh his talk his eating it's like something cuts him open to reveal this other person i don't even know this is interesting to me how we adopt different personalities masks in front of people from our own culture compared to people from other cultures in the end a good book that i'm glad to have read","192":"i can't remember who recommended this or where i read about it but i really didn't enjoy it the topic is very sad but i found the writing style difficult to follow and it didn't engage me","193":" i have mixed feelings about this book set in zimbabwe and later in america the author tells the story through the eyes of a 10 year old child a child narrator can be really good or sometimes really annoying in this case it started out fairly well she paints a picture of life in zimbabwe and gradually lets in details of how things got worse and why eventually the child was sent to be with family in the u s the story was compelling and definitely kept my interest though because it was seen from the lens of a child you really don't get many details or explanation or true understanding of what's going on however seeing things through the child's perspective did shed new light on certain things and make me look at things in a new way which was powerful in its own way the second half of the book follows the narrator as she moves to the u s and becomes more of a tale of the immigration experience normally i'm fascinated by these types of stories but i had just recently read a different book about a similar experience americanah which was completely different but had just enough basic similarities telling the story of a character immigrating from an african country to the u s that i couldn't help but compare them in addition there was a chapter of pornographic sexual detail that felt completely random and seemed to make no sense in the context of the story like why did that need to be in there and it was really disturbing to me so unfortunately that threw me off and sort of left a bad taste in my mouth this novel was shortlisted for the booker prize this year which is why i chose to read it in the first place and though i did like it it's not in my top list at the moment","194":"a raw look at life in zimbabwe for a young girl named darling the first half of the book is her life there and the second half is her journey to america beautiful and sad lovely and harsh this book really leaves a stark image in your mind of darling's life and heart and the names lovely characters with names like bastard godknows bornfree nomoreproblems and of course mother of bones not only bring the tale to life they illuminate the meaning behind the title of the book","195":"this is a new book and i saw it on a summer must read list i read it in one night it's powerful and gut wrenching this one will stay with me for a while","196":"the chapter titled how they lived was amazing and could easily work as a stand alone essay","197":" an interesting addition to the leaving africa behind genre pulls no punches and i'm still trying to figure out the disturbing ending but belongs on anyone's shelf who is interested in the muddle that invariably follows when switching cultures i'm not sure it's a complete success it can be disjointed and the parts don't always fit together some stories seem incomplete or just dropped in as if this were separate short stories just crammed together this is not a mellifluous nostalgic memoir but a brutal look at broken nation the people who manage to survive and the cost others have commented on how the story doesn't seem to go anywhere there's not much of a character arc for darling i suspect that is the point she is trapped between two near impossible situations i was more bothered by the novel's sense of checking off all the troubles that are africa reveling in poverty porn childhood malnutrion check childhood pregnancies check civil wars check aids check yet there is no overall purpose for this or sense of catharsis in this in the aristotelian sense having said all that still definitely worth a read but more of a 3 1 2 stars than a solid 4","198":" i think i read this book about a year ago and it still rings in my mind from time to time i think it really provoked some new thoughts and ideas in the back of my mind and certainly opened me up to a better idea of the lives of children and adults in african countries side by side with other novels about nations i have never explored it is another step towards helping western nations understand and empathise with these situations the book was filled with creative and whole characters none of which were weighed down with an inflated ideal or some ridiculous act of heroism i think interesting colourful and realistic characters have more to give than any fanciful idea could it was a simple story told well","199":"an african story told through the lives of cheeky kids who are both pre teens and teens there is some pretty deep stuff in this book but i also like the fact that the writer incorporated some humour in a few chapters i found this book quite engaging","200":"the first half of this book when the narrator is talking about being a kid in zimbabwe is funny and lively and really engaging darling the character is a great narrator and her friends are hilarious but also a little sad but then she moves to detroit and the book gets kind of sad and i can't say i was engaged still worth a read though","201":"interesting style flat character arch not sure what i got out of this wish the author had aged the character from 10 to 17","202":"this was such a sad but well written book it's the story of a young zimbabwean girl and her life in africa and then her new life in the us the book discusses the subject of immigration race and cultural uprooting","203":" 'we need new names' depicts the immigrant experience in painful detail beautifully describing the sense of displacement and alienation of living in a strange country it resonated very strongly with me i think i enjoyed this book maybe more than i should have because it reminded me of my time teaching in zimbabwe especially the kids in my classes i found it a bit patchy though some passages were brilliant poetic even while others were weird and confusing overall an important book highlighting the desperate situation in zimbabwe","204":"a look at africa and zimbabwe which seems very accurate an unflinching realistic look at childhood in africa and as an immigrant in the states says things about africa that i've never seen worthy of the booker short list","205":"a really story of being an immigrant to america","206":"filled with wonderful characters this is a novel of what it means to come of age in a country where things are falling apart the language is beautiful angry full of regret and longing spunky and optimistic funny lilting and rhythmic vital and real it is also a worthy addition to the literature of diaspora the contrast between darlings life in destroyedmichigan and her life in zimbabwe is poignantly portrayed deserves the booker shortlisting","207":"the chapter entitled how they lived is phenomenal","208":"tremendous that is all for now","209":"this book was hard to read but i loved the rhythm of the writing different from mine and there were beautiful passages it hurt my heart though","210":" the guardian review concluded \"what we turn to literature for is its ability to transport us beyond the headlines\" and we need new names does achieve this by painting a picture of zimbabwe that acknowledges the harshness of the times but remind the reader of the humanity of those living day to day within this regime the analogies between the 'great' america and 'kaka' zimbabwe also struck me this said whilst some of the imagery resonated as a novel this story just didn't hold together it seemed to drift with little sense of purpose and about two thirds of the way through the narrative voice changed completely and then bounced back to the lead character darling again the novel lacked cohesion and i had to force myself to finish it was disappointed i can't believe it made the man booker shortlist ahead of five star billionaire","211":"i read this book for my book club and although i enjoyed it it was a tough read bulawayo is an accomplished writer and i agree with the nomination for the man booker prize following the life of darling a young girl in zimbabwe who then moves to america this book deals with the issues of identity and where you belong in life it was extremely sad in places but also laugh out loud in others recommended but certainly not a light read","212":"so many books about the refugee experience are so hard to read constant horror constant violence however a book that ignores those aspects of home country seem inauthentic bulawayo does a masterful job at toeing the line the truth is told but in an almost gentle way you are aware of the horrors but you aren't force fed them she is an amazing storyteller with a message to share highly recommended","213":"bulawayo's characters are as crisp and juicy as the guavas they crave rarely do authors capture children's play so well these children are imitating the adults they see in an effort to make sense of the world their innocence makes them keen observers of religious fervor and political injustices their games reminded me of stomping around the snow in dad's oversized boots thinking i was now equipped to trudge through the deepest snow banks but then the snow clumped up in the gaps thwarting my efforts to seize the mountain and that seems to be the essence of child's play a flirtation with the adult world which becomes dark and disappointing once reality seeps in however remains mystic and wondrous in one's memory elegant intricate simplicity i'd love to get enough copies to use this as a lit circle book during our immigration expedition there also should be a book award for best character names and best characters like the oscars of books how do you come up with a name like prophet revelations bitchington mborro and not get an award for it maybe she did anyways brilliant this is a book i really struggle to quote because there are so many delicious sentences to savor here are a few if you're stealing something it's better if it's small and hideable or something you can eat quickly and be done with like guavas that way people can't see you with the thing to be reminded that you are a shameless thief and that you stole it from them so i don't know what the white people were trying to do in the first place stealing not just a tiny piece but a whole country who can ever forget you stole something like that 22 all of them are on their feet now singing and shuffling and swaying like maybe they have caught the spirit but if they have then it skipped me the spirit always skips me 35 we are quiet because we've never seen them silent not like this we want them to open their mouths and speak to talk about elections and democracy and new country lik they have been doing all along we want them to look over their shoulders and tell us they will know what we are doing while they are gone we want them to say something but they are just silent like they are suddenly unsure like something crept upon them while they slept and cut out their tongues 70 then he lifts his bones and pushes a claw towards me and i don't want to touch it but mother is there looking looking like jesus looks at you from mother of bone's calendar so you don't sin the claw is hard and sweaty in my hand and i withdraw it fast like i've touched fire later i don't want to touch myself with that hand i don't want to eat with it or do nothing with it i even wish i could throw the hand away and get another 92 all of how they left u0026amp how they lives great stand alone excerpts because we were not in our country we could not use our own languages and so when we spoke our voices came out bruised when we talked our tongues thrashed madly in our mouths staggered like drunken men because we were not using our languages we said things we did not mean what we really wanted to say remained folded inside trapped 242","214":"interesting story whose central character darling is a child living in war torn apartheid era south africa she subsequently leaves her parents u0026amp homeland to live with her aunt fostalina in michigan gives an insight into the sense of alienation refugees often experience both from the land of their birth and their adopted country","215":"i could not read this book my star rating is unfair why couldn't i read it because i had just finished beyond the beautiful forevers life death and hope in a mumbai undercity by katherine boo that book about slums in mumbai was so depressing i could follow by reading this book that began in slums in zimbabwe my apologies however i needed to write enough of a review that if i came upon this book again i would know why i had not read it when i had it in hand","216":"3 5 stars maybe four well worth a read i'm sometimes skeptical of child narrators but darling is an effective protagonist her raw matter of fact depiction of her childhood in zimbabwe casually contrasts her innocent curiosity and the games she and her friends play with the violence they encounter - death beatings sexual abuse sickness their own hunger pangs yet bulawayo is clear that zimbabwe is far more than the sum of its present atrocities there is history there is pride there is home i loved both sections of this book my issues were mostly with the writing which is occasionally too on the nose see for example the pretty bulimic daughter in the invisible children t shirt as if bulawayo is making sure she hit a checklist of ironies and brutalities the multiple shifts in pov in the final chapters seemed unnecessary while it's a little unfair the obvious comparison is with americanah and i may have been spoiled a bit by just having read that superior novel adichie is layered and subtle where bulawayo is blunt and at times obvious both styles work though and i look forward to more from bulawayo she's fantastic","217":" a short read that doesn't have much of a plot but simply tries to communicate the first hand experience of leaving a ravaged zimbabwe for america the story is told through a series of vignettes about half in zimbabwe and half in america i really enjoyed the way she captured the spirit of being a child it's told as the narrator would have experienced it so not everything makes sense and the children constantly play games school was cancelled while the brutality of their environment plays out around them it makes for a bit of a surreal experience the second half contrasts her own culture with that of america while she is also jolted by a reality that falls short of her own expectations the outsider view of america is pretty familiar although i'm sure it rings true for many immigrants there was a weird emphasis on hitting children i know americans are slack with their kids but discipline doesn't equate to violence the most interesting parts were her struggles relating to her friends and family back home i was interested in this but it wasn't explored too much overall it's not going down as a favourite but i enjoyed the style and i hope she puts out some more books","218":"it's a great example of the disconnect between zimbabwe and america and there are some funny and poignant moments i found it very moving although a bit jumpy in the storytelling but i guess that's also the point it's a different kind of storytelling mostly sad alarming and a bit horrifying the way the people who were colonised are still treated in the west","219":"this is a powerful bleak beautiful book about belonging about home darling is a ten year old girl in zimbabwe living in a shanty town called paradise and dreaming of america with her friends she joins her aunt in america and predictably it isn't paradise anymore than the shanty town the writing is beautiful at times and she deals so well with the complexities of leaving your broken country and trying to make a new life in a different culture","220":" a timely book of zimbabwe and the struggles of its people adolescents coming of age the pursuit of and struggle for the american dream the reality of displacement and the traps of immigration the story made me appreciate the limbo of immigrants who remember and yearn for their homeland do not completely fit into their new adopted country and their children born in the new land having no affinity for where their parents came from and all are unable to return to the homeland because they lack sufficient documentation to return the book is essentially two stories of darling's life in paradise zimbabwe as a child with her family and friends and her teenage years and new life in michigan with her aunt both present darling with struggles which is a better life is difficult to say sacrifices must be made in both locations i enjoyed the richness of the cultural details about zimbabwe and the melting pot of races coming to america to realize their dream","221":" noviolet bulawyo's debut novel landed her on the short list of finalists for the 2013 man booker prize told in the first person of a young girl named darling whose wonderful assortment of family and friends in her native zimbabwe include bastard chipo godknows and her grandma mother of bones the preacher prophet revelations bitchington mborro proclaims from the top of a steep climb his flock must endure every sabbath before they can enjoy or endure his proselytizing posturing she paints a very realistic picture of life in rhodesia later zimbabwe and the pain the birth pangs of revolution imparted to everyday citizens the hunger the lack of privacy lack of sanitation and education opportunities and the disappearance of male family members who leave to go to work in the gold mines often to return bringing no money but the sickness instead in the second part of the story darling manages to go to america where an aunt has agreed to sponsor her for a student visa in detroit her description of her first experience of snow is just one example of her exquisite descriptive abilities a sample from the chapter destroyedmichygen what you will see if you come here america is the snow snow on the leafless trees snow on the cars snow on the roads snow on the yards snow on the roofs snow just snow covering everything like sand it is as white as clean teeth and is also very very cold it is a greedy monster too the snow because just look how it has swallowed everything where is the ground now where are the flowers the grass the stones the leaves the ants as for the coldness i have never seen it like this i mean coldness that makes like it wants to kill you like it's telling you with its snow that you should go back to where you came from p 150was this one compelling enough merit a booker nomination maybe it is certainly imho a compelling read one that grabbed me and held me ms bulawayo certainly deserved a good hard look i was grabbed repulsed horrified entranced amused and immersed from the beginning to the end did i like the subject matter no did i like the characters not particularly but neither did i dislike them some are actually eccentric enough to be loveable this is a coming of age story that tells us not just the discouragements of her birthplace but her disappointments when expectations of america don't quite fit her mind's picture as such the brutality fits the realism of darling's life","222":"beautiful colorful raw real happy and sad it puts the world into perspective in a tiny scale and grand scale darlings voice is poignant completely believable both mature and immature while she is in both countries as her character develops she also stays the same which is so undeniably real of human nature i loved every moment of this book and each time i had to put it down i wished i could devote one full day to reading it from beginning to end","223":"the parts of the story set in zimbabwe were the best part of the book for me","224":"this book started off good but went downhill about halfway through it was interesting hearing stories about when she was a child but the move to america was so abrupt and barely touched the surface of what a huge change it must have been when i got to the end of the book i felt like it just stopped but had no real ending","225":"i find myself enthusiastic about this novel told almost as a series of short stories but cohesive enough to be a novel in my mind this is the story of 11 year old darling a resident of a zimbabwean slum called paradise darling's voice is fresh playful and wise and although her life intersects with many political topics both in zimbabwe and then later as an american immigrant those issues mainly take a back seat to darling's personal experience the first half of the novel follows darling through her exploits with her preteen friends in zimbabwe darling's life intersects many big picture issues in zimbabwe poverty race revolution aids evangelical christianity etc but we only hear about them as a backdrop to the games and exploits of the gang of friends darling is more focused on the practicalities of her life the intricacies of the rules of the various games invented by her friends where she will find more guavas to eat to stave off hunger interactions with her family members and neighbors and her daydreams of one day joining her aunt in america one thing i loved about this book is the loved the rich vivid metaphor that laces noviolet bulawayo's storytelling then motherlove stands beside this giant poster of jesus and starts singing at first there is this hush as if people don't know what music is for but then they start swaying soon they are gyrating and twisting and writhing and shuffling and rocking motherlove's head is tilted up like she's drinking the stuffy air her eyes closed her mouth is open just a little you'd think she didn't even want to sing but her voice is boiling out of her and steaming up the place i also appreciated the message of the story especially as we follow darling to america darling has much to say about the ranks of illegals working in america and the heartbreaking reality of being without a country to call home i'm not surprised this one didn't ultimately win the booker this year but i'm very grateful to have read it","226":"hard to read at times but also funny and definitely worth it one of the best book club discussions","227":"http maryokekereviews blogspot com","228":"i really liked the first half of the story 4 stars the second half was much weaker 2 stars","229":"excellent insight into the african immigrant experience bulawyo is a brilliant storyteller","230":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers

mishandling and incompetence the children can no longer to school because the teachers have left an election that offers much promise of democracy and freedom comes to nothing and protests are quickly suppressed there are scenes of racial violence one scene in particular depicts ugly nasty violence that is hard to this novel is a series of snapshots of events in the life of darling a young girl born in zimbabwe where the economy and infrastructure is being gradually destroyed by political mishandling and incompetence the children can no longer to school because the teachers have left an election that offers much promise of democracy and freedom comes to nothing and protests are quickly suppressed there are scenes of racial violence one scene in particular depicts ugly nasty violence that is hard to read there is little food and the children are driven to stealing guavas from trees in more affluent white neighbourhoods despite all this darling and her friends with delightful names eg godknows bastard chipo survive darling goes to america but the memories of her country are always just below the surface of her new life with relatives and life in america is not always easy either the ultimate sadness is that darling and other emigrants cannot go home the novel is vivid and well written with a heartbreaking story the characters are well drawn and the novel has an intelligence that brings the appalling situation in africa into sharp focus the book deserves its place on the booker shortlist for 2013 and this is a story that needs to be told but readers may find at least one of the scenes depicted in the book distressing and unpleasant more","231":" this was beautifully written and it was hard to decide whether to give it 4 or 5 stars it deserved 5 stars because of chapters like how they lived which left me speechless this chapter and a few others deviated away from the the main story and it was just the narrator or bulawayo herself speaking to the reader forcing the reader to take a good hard look at how it really is for immigrants but for the actual story of darling the narrator i felt like she refused to let the reader come too close and it kind of lost its powerfulness because of that the first part of the book where darling is living in zimbabwe was a little better but once darling came to america i just felt like i was reading a chain of events in someone's life it lost some of its spark this was just my perception of it however and i definitely recommend this book and can't wait to read anything that bulawayo publishes next i also would have finished this a lot earlier but i misplaced the book for a while just as i was about to request it from the library i found my copy","232":"4 stars is the designated rating for really liked it but for bulawayo's book i have to modify it to really important to have read because i can't say i liked how close to home this brutally frank assessment of the world hits for the first part of the book we are given what seems to be an authentic critique exemplified by the attitudes and actions of 10 year old darling and her friends of the legacy of colonialism and the dubious value of well intentioned ngos many of which i support when the setting shifts along with darling to america the indictment is just as devastating as the exploitation alienation and cultural drifting intrinsic to the immigrant experience are uncomfortably detailed in darling's experiences will we ever learn","233":"darling and her friends live in shantytown in zimbabwe and has many escapades and a rough life she finally flies to detroit to live with an aunt tells her story and trying to fit intothe new lifestyle","234":"tragic funny ironic reads like short stories darling's coming of age story through vignettes of the people and experiences in zimbabwe and kalamazoo what it lacks in plot it makes up for in powerful poetic writing of life in her birth country and her immigrant experience in her new home there are no simple solutions","235":"i came out of this book pretty perfectly indifferent to it no objections the narrator is interesting and things certainly happened but something about the style meant i never quite connected with the narrative","236":"terrific tales of childhood in africa contrasting heavily with immigrant life in the us bulawayo is a vivid writer captures you easily i loved this book read it in two days bulawayo depicts modern africa with wry pointers to achebe with repeated use of 'things a fall apart' i look forward to her next work","237":"this is the story of a young girl in africa who moves to the united states i found that there was a lack of historical and background information without which is was hard to piece the story together","238":"this is a solid moving three and a half star read","239":"guardian reviewhttps www theguardian com books 201 grafitti house review http grafittihouse blogspot com 201","240":"i can't decide i have a feeling the further i get away from this book the more i'll like it and what it has to offer my rating is subject to change","241":" we need new names should have been electrifying it should have made me feel lots of things i don't normally feel taken me very far outside myself the basis of the plot is such a sad story that it should be a tear jerker no matter what but the writing was so flat that i found myself feeling pretty much nothing i was not transported in the least maybe the manuscript was over workshopped because it felt like noviolet bulawayo's voice just got lost the result was that i felt completely distanced from the story it was not vivid or meaningful it's a shame because i think she has interesting things to say","242":"definitely deserving of all of the hype an honest voice unlike anything i've read lyrical sometimes bordering on stream of consciousness but never losing sight of the story being told","243":"initially not very different from a hundred other red earthed african childhood stories this novel did a life saving turnabout halfway through when the protagonist leaves zimbabwe for the united states there's a gentle sadness that seeps through the simple story of darling as an illegal immigrant a heart breaking yearning for home that pervades the last pages of the novel and leaves the reader with a deep sense of empathetic longing the contrast between the childhoods of darling's zimbabwean friends and her american ones is startlingly drawn painting an unhealthy picture of western society while lying bare the injustice and cruel harshness of african life there are lyrical passages between the fact and crude bluster that are beautifully poetic all in all i enjoyed this short novel and consider its nomination for the man booker to be well deserved","244":"i really enjoyed this book i think it drew heavily on the author's reflections about her own experiences so it had the ring of truth i'm glad it's been nominated for a prize","245":" point of view is very important in this book as is the letter and conversation at the back of the book this story is poignant yet there is something sad about it even though immigration saves lives countries around the world where life is hazardous in the extreme have survivors who did not emigrate what do they think about those who did read this book this quote is so likely to tell it all about the ways of grief generally the men always tried to appear strong they walked tall heads upright arms steady at the sides and feet firmly planted like trees solid jericho walls of men but when they went out in the bush to relieve themselves and nobody was looking they fell apart like crumbling towers and wept with the wretched grief of forgotten concubines and when they returned to the presence of their women and children and everybody else they stuck hands deep inside torn pockets until they felt their dry thighs kicked little stones out of the way and erected themselves like walls again but the women who knew all the ways of weeping and all there was to know about falling apart would not be deceived they gently rose from the hearths beat dust off their skirts and planted themselves like rocks in front of their men and children and shacks and only then did all appear almost tolerable","246":"the first chapter blew me away and i'm pleased to say the rest of the book lived up to that strong start with an impeccable use of language bulawayo brings ten year old darling to life in this cross continental coming of age novel each chapter while connected to the larger whole is enjoyable as a fully realized story in its own right as well highly recommend","247":"i'm two books behind on blogging in part because i wasn't sure how to review noviolet bulawayo's we need new names \" not that i wasn't sure whether it was a great book it is but because i wasn't sure how to capture its complexity and subtlety i haven't come any closer to figuring it out but i ought to do my best before my classic e memory loses the details though it's been over a week and the narrative lingers so perhaps that's a telling enough quality the book follows darling as she immigrates from an unnamed african country to america though we might suppose from the details of its political history that the country is zimbabwe except in some senses trying to 'figure out' the country takes away from the message in the book that african countries are imagined by western audiences as uniform and interchangeable the book opens with rich scenes of her childhood at home the bonds among her friends the tensions among her community the ngos that service it and the white inhabitants of the town these scenes are then contrasted with darling's arrival in america where the refuge she seeks and the prosperity she imagines is complicated by the american problems of minimum wage eating disorders porn and alcoholism she arrives in her oft imagined destroyedmichigan or detroit one of the most masterful elements of this book is the way bulawayo plays with and comments on language through the manipulation of words on the page she demonstrates the thematic question she explores through her characters about the power of english the limitations of language to express real affect trauma and dislocation and the ways in which mastering mimicking english is imagined as a parallel to gaining mastery over one's self and world unfolding in her journey are questions for the reader about inequality resource management international relations and concomitant questions about exploitation of the poor the environment other countries but for me the most disturbing questions were around relativism of suffering darling's life in america certainly reveals the many ways in which the \"paradise\" of the west is fraught with its own traumas and suffering not the least of which is the irreconcilable sense of an identity that is neither american nor of zimbabwe but these traumas are diminished by darling for not being as terrible as those experienced at home her hometown in zimbabwe is named paradise a perhaps too obvious irony and invitation to question where the \"true\" paradise might be located no where and if the book argues that the so called traumas of american life are insignificant in comparison to those suffered abroad what does that do to the reader who must on some level identify with and experience the \"injustices\" of western life how can the individual reconcile their specific experience of suffering with the recognition that elsewhere the causes sources experience of suffering is exponentially worse i suppose i perhaps unfairly wanted the book to offer some explanation or solution to the question of the relativism of suffering some way to mitigate guilt or self recrimination maybe or perhaps a way to think about inequality in a way beyond the level of recognition a way too for darling to make sense of her stuck between identity that any emotion she has she must always reimagine in light of what she has been spared she doesn't allow herself to feel lonely because it could be so much worse where does this refusal of suffering leave darling or the reader","248":" i think it's clear this is a first book from a potentially phenomenal writer it felt a lot like the first half of a book rather than a whole i enjoyed it but it's clear that my progress on it somewhat halted for a while the first half was very funny but at a point it stopped all attempts at comedy and placed itself firmly in slow tragedy did i enjoy it yes would i recommend it to others yes but not as a first recommendation i still expect to see many more and many better books from bulawayo someday","249":" this story is told from a young african girl's perspective and follows her from her childhood in africa over to america i have lived in west and east africa and the vivid descriptions brought back the smells and sounds of the villages the characters are all well developed and the dialects are easy to follow there are some very funny moments as well as the book tackling the serious issue of the effects of poverty both in africa and as an illegal immigrant in america a very enjoyable read but a sudden ending","250":" there is little i can say about this book that will not utterly fail to give it the attention and kudos it deserves i hesitated for awhile to pick this up african stories can be harsh unforgiving and make me feel useless and horrible and well white this book however rightly deserves all the attention it has been getting in the press powerful moving uplifting informative cracklingly funny and gaspingly real i wish i could express the longing this built in me not necessarily to have the horror and ability to overcome but really to have the connection to culture family and homeland good or bad to have the ability to see clearly the world as it is accept it change it rail against it love it i need more stars i need more life and i need more hugs","251":"what a great book powerful and yet innocent love the expression of thoughts and the thought process","252":"exceptional writing heart wrenching story a glimpse into the lives of people who've experienced this planet completely differently than i have characters i care about non cis male writer winner","253":" 3 1 2 stars the first part of the book was a revelation for me depicting the difficulties of life in zimbabwe for 10 year old darling and her friends in spite of their hunger and circumstances which leave them without parents for extended periods of time these children manage to survive eating stolen guavas and their imaginations the second half of the book is darling's story after she comes to the united states to live with her aunt this part for me lacked the wonderful language and descriptions of the first half it did though provide a view of what the immigrant experience might be like however you are left wondering what happens to darling as life goes on","254":" noviolet bulawayo's debut novel we need new names seemed like it would be right up my alley book with a fun name let alone the author's name critically well received shortlisted for the booker prize immigrant journey etc but as you have already seen in that shocking rating well for me you can tell something went awry bulawayo tells a very personal and i assume very autobiographical journey of a young girl's youth in a poverty and violence ravished african country before moving to america while it was impossible not to empathize with bulawayo's alter ego darling i just never felt fully engaged i think part of the reason is that work seemed to be more of a series of short stories centering around darling vs a cohesive novel this lack of lack of continuity and never an a ha moment caused me never to make a full connection additionally stylistically and tonally it was all over the place there were chapters that were quite lyrical and beautiful and others that were very straightforward and ordinary and perhaps the title suggested to me that there would be more humor in this and while it is there for the most part this is a quite serious and sad story likewise i found myself annoyed with the bulawayo's decision to never reveal darling's and her own home country i am not sure if this was a statement indictment that readers should know based on the facts stories provided but likely do not or merely that these horrid third world conditions is the story of any most african nations still it was an aspect of the novel that nagged me along the way it's quite rare that i rate a book less than 3 stars but grading on my own curve it just didn't stack up on a literary or personal enjoyment level to books i've rated 3 stars or other similar immigrant centric novels while i never considered abandoning it my overall feeling was what 2 stars means in goodreads land it was okay","255":"zimbabwe author bulawayo has written of her childhood in zimbabwe and the difficult transition to american life in kalamazoo michigan darling prowls paradise zimbabwe with friends--bastard chipo godknows sbho and stina--stealing guava fruit from neighborhood trees to ease their pangs of hunger the villagers secretly mock the oblivious white ngo workers and then there are the chinese shopkeepers who are immigrants seeking to make their fortunes darling loses her father to the aids epidemic contracted while working in south africa darling is sure of her place in this world then her zimbabwean aunt arranges for her to travel to america on a travel visa--which eventually expires darling finds living with her aunt and the common law ghanian husband disjointed she struggles to learn english and to assimilate to an affluent culture but without legal status darling's straight a's in school account for little that is except for being accused of 'acting white' by her fellow black students so--darling is no longer zimbabwean and unable to be fully american recommend","256":"ever since that 5th grade report on zimbabwe i've fallen in love with the notion of africa when this hit the shelves i did not even need to see the reviews to know that i would snatch this up noviolet bulawayo writes of zimbabwe during robert mugabe rule it's a country wobbling from so many threats hunger disease economic instability and the government's torture and violent intimidation of all political opposition amidst this backdrop we watch darling age 10 grow up and emigrate to the us there are so many topics tackled in this novel obviously there are the bits about mugabe but i found the idea of alienation or loss of one's roots haunting and powerful you would think that darling has won the ultimate jackpot when she moves to detroit michigan or \"destroyedmichygen\" as darling thinks of it but as with all choices there is a trade off yes food is so plentiful she can actually choose what she will eat and yes she no longer will run after a humanitarian aid truck for her new threads there are piles and piles of clothes to try on at the local mall but who is she now not quite zimbabwean not quite american as noviolet bulawayo puts it \"they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands \" they leave behind their mothers and fathers and \"the bones of their ancestors in the earth\" -- they leave behind \"everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay \" more lovely words from the author and when they asked us where we were from we exchanged glances and smiled with the shyness of child brides they said africa we nodded yes what part of africa we smiled is it that part where vultures wait for famished children to die we smiled where the life expectancy is thirty five years we smiled is it there where dissidents shove ak 47s between women's legs we smiled where people run about naked we smiled that part where they massacred each other we smiled is it where the old president rigged the election and people were tortured and killed and a whole bunch of them put in prison and all there where they are dying of cholera--oh my god yes we've seen your country it's been on the news because we were not using our languages we said things we did not mean what we really wanted to say remained folded inside trapped in america we did not always have the words","257":"giving this one four stars because it was well done not because it made me feel good following the journey of darling a child in zimbabwe and later in the us this novel uses her straightforward observations to illuminate the grotesque nature of western attitudes toward third world peoples excess in the us and humanity in general it's not pretty but it's pretty honest","258":"the chapter titled how they lived should be read by every american incredibly great read overall","259":"a thoroughly engrossing novel that delves into the life of a young girl growing up under tragic circumstances in economically depressed zimbabwe and who is later forced to immigrate to the usa a tale of abject poverty loss of hope culture shock and inner strength","260":"really quick read great to see the story told from a child's pov","261":"beautiful heartbreaking bulawayo does a great job writing about the children of zimbabwe voices are authentic u0026amp funny very painful to read but i want to learn u0026amp understand bulawayo shows the awful situation of immigrants who flee home u0026amp then are stranded between worlds great writing","262":"really 4 5 starsreview pending","263":"6 5 10 liked writer's style a lot but chapters felt disjointed and didn't like the ending","264":"i hate realistic fiction so much please get me out of this class nothing against noviolet bulawayo really she is a good writer and i'm sure i know people love this book i just cannot bring myself to like any realistic fiction that i read all the flowery language the abstractness the metaphors it's just so pretentious to me and character driven stories just bore me they always have and they always will i need a plot a solid clear plot and great characters and i've only ever found that in genre fiction","265":"no journey comes without a price u0026amp such is true for darling u0026amp her relatives when they sacrifice to immigrate ti america in her u0026amp many other foreigners case the price that they ultimately pay is the sacrifice of their culture u0026amp traditions from their homelands this novel provides an interesting view of someone who immigrated to america to advance in life although i feel like the author could have connected u0026amp or transitioned better throughout the book however i feel like this book provided me with a better picture of the life of illegals u0026amp their everyday struggles between their new u0026amp old home","266":" we need new names is more of an anthological memoir arranged chronologically a collection of stories of darling going through her life a collection of growing up stories in an impoverished and corrupt zimbabwe the innocence of growing up among nothingness the escape and contrast of america the pains of emigration the love the old times the attachment and distance between parents and their children and their land the call of their homeland the innocence and games and love and death and the beautiful beautiful descriptions and likelinesses of bolavayo's writing one sees from the writing how darling changes from innocent black zimbabwean to the proper american female sad but yet so so poignant a must read","267":"it's an interesting story and very well told but i found myself more drawn to the beginning than the end i wonder if some of the story line was just for shock and awe purposes and the ending felt incomplete","268":" i'm torn i loved the writing and the texture of this book seeing the world through different eyes but there was just no story no plot i feel like americanah did a much better job telling a version of this story if buluwayo ever puts out a book of poetry that i'd be interested in some passages in the book read like poetry and those stick with me \"look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same \"","269":"strong book good for course on variety of voices","270":" i really enjoyed this novel once i got used to the youth of the narrator she starts out at 10 years old but a couple of times the point of view of the novel shifts to almost a narrative nonfiction narration while i was caught up in the story and found it fascinating the shifts in narration were jarring to me and reduced my enjoyment but this book is definitely worth a read i learned so much about the world and the story being told from the point of view of a ten to seventeen year old child lends a view of innocence to horrible events the emotional impact was much more immediate and visceral for me than when i learn of world events from a journalist's point of view although choosing a child to tell the story imposes some limitations on what can be told i think it was an excellent choice","271":"this novel was short listed for the man booker prize but instead of being a novel it seemed more like a collection of vignettes that held together a very loose plot the author's use of language was creative and the subject matter was interesting life in a shanty town in zimbabwe immigration to the us but there just wasn't that much to this book","272":" it took me awhile to get into this book and had a lightbulb moment when realised that the book was describing life in zimbawee and things made a lot more sense their was a few lines that made me smirk and a few made me think which is good as like to have a varity of emotions i liked the way the writing style changed when she moved to usa and the dificulties faced their i have no way of knowing how this feels although my mum did move from a tiny village in wales to liverpool apparantly a real culture shock but not to this extent the line that touched me the most was were they decided new names to fit in so so so sad would look out for more books by her","273":"made me think a lot about refugees how they come to be refugees what they lose what they gain and how that whole process has affected history and culture","274":"i finally finished this book i didn't really like it it was so disjointed maybe this was supposed to reflect how darling was feeling she wasn't very happy in america i just didn't really enjoy it not my type of book","275":" this short book reads like a collection of connected short stories bulawayo has an energy in her writing and ability to capture dialogue and experience when she is at her best that said there is an element of covering the standard checklist of africa horrors hunger aids political violence child rape that ultimately feels pointless i am not sure there's a reason for this book to exist beyond that described in my first sentence above i hope bulawayo turns her obvious talents to stories with more of a unique narrative more theme and more developed story lines while leaving aside some of the tried u0026amp true africa themes as it is this book reads like an exercise for a class in fiction writing","276":"i loved this book by choosing to make her narrator a child the author has found a way to relate events that are quite traumatic and heavy with lightness and humour it's not without tension and shock to the contrary some of the events this girl witnesses are quite scary and monumental but seeing it through her eyes with a childish innocence takes the edge off a retelling of a tumultuous time in zimbabwean history it's quite brilliant some parts of the narration i had to read aloud to my partner so that we could have a good laugh at the language she uses that so brilliantly captures the spirit of the characters characters that we feel so familiar with in fact at some point she describes in detail 'the country game' the kids play and it transported me back to my childhood because we played the exact same game in cape town the second part of the book is set in detroit at first i was really disappointed at what seemed to be too drastic a change in the quality of storytelling it was as if the first half was a beautifully woven story you just couldn't put down and then all of a sudden it becomes a disjointed fractured account of various events with no sense of direction it even ends that way i let it ruminate for a day or so and then when i re looked at it i saw how it actually reflected exactly what the character must have been feeling interspersed in the second half she writes two chapters of prose so eloquent and haunting about the exprience of leaving your homeland and losing a part of yourself in the new land again i had to read this out loud to my partner and as africans living abroad it struck a powerful cord so all in all a very well written piece of fiction this full of love and loss and longing exquisitely told it will certainly linger for a while","277":"i didn't care for this book i didn't care for the characters didn't care about the story it was a book club discussion book i read the entire thing so it wasn't horrible i just didn't see the point of the story","278":"we need new names starts all witty and never lets up right up to the end the writing style reads like a broken child all jumbled and disjointed at first glance as is expected of a mindset of a little girl darling i would have to say this is the first ever account albeit fictional of the situation in zimbabwe told in blunt detail without fear or favour the genius of the plot is the characterisation in the usage of pre teen teenage children through which we experience the stark post colonial situation in zimbabwe and the suffering hopelessness desperation indignity at the hands of fellow blacks which is no different from the land grabbing at the hands of the boers if not worse darlings arrival in u s a ushers in new troubles such as nostalgia culture shock and identity loss she neither feels american nor identifies with zimbabweans any more and thus lives in limbo unable to fully integrate into american life nor return to zimbabwe for fear that she will be trapped in the cycle of suffering she fought hard to escape this coming of age novel tackles serious issues with witticism and humour flavoured with a depth in expression that only your local language can avail you we need new names exposes the tokoloshes messing up africa with their kaka but do it with such style we can't help but get drawn to issues at hand brilliant work","279":" great first novel darling the protagonist is marvelous the novel is at its best in the first half where she and her gang of friends run about their shantytown ironically named paradise playing and offering commentary on the political situation in zimbabwe and africa ore generally still engaging but less biting and a bit trying in the second half after she has escaped zimbabwe and landed in detroit michigan with extended family members with this move to the us bulawayo explores the contradictions that are the immigrant experience","280":"a beautifully woven tale of childhood across cultures through the eyes of a young immigrant the narrator's voice is unique and refreshing","281":"the abrupt ending is the reason for my 3 stars","282":" 'you're a bad man' sir robert and it's helpful to put the spotlight back on to the ruin of zimbabwe and the historical context of preceding shameful colonialism this is a first novel that has a lot of rough edges and i echo many other reviewers in finding the second half group of stories disappointing overstretched in its attempt to be clever first half is a cute and colourful life drawing of a zimbabwe shanty seen through the eyes of a young girl called darling but not a patch on ben okri's 1991 masterpiece famished road in my humble","283":"more a series of short stories than a novel there were very disturbing parts to this story mostly in the first part whilst i could sympathise with darling for the awful life she lead in africa i do not feel that she was a very nice person most especially when she got to america the life of an illegal immigrant is portrayed well however hard work not quite belonging family ringing from home wanting money etc","284":"story disjointed and not well developed","285":"could not get into this book at all ended up giving up on it as it did not catch any of my attention","286":"i'm a bit hesitant giving this 4 stars but i'll go with that for now this almost reads like short stories and i really enjoyed most of the vignettes of darling's life but i missed the sense of an overarching story","287":" we need new names is a lyrical vibrant vignette of experiences less a cohesive novel than a keening coming of age observation of loss change loneliness and assimilation it is separated in two parts ten year old darling's before her life in a shantytown in harare and her after an adolescence in michigan where she is sent to live with an aunt after zimbabwe's socioeconomic and political collapse in the early 2000s the writing is lovely and bulawayo's observations are heartbreakingly vivid but the free ranging style left me a bit cold it is a collection of moments narrated by darling with an occasional injection of omniscient they essays to provide thematic structure and social commentary beyond the level of a little girl's understanding once i let go of the expectation of plot and viewed this more as prose ode to a lost childhood and the immigrant experience i appreciated the solemn beauty of bulawayo's craft a poignant melancholy book","288":"devastating portrayal of life in zimbabwe and in destroyed michigan","289":" we need new names tells the story of darling and her friends growing up in what they call paradise in zimbabwe this novel explores the struggles faced growing up in this landlocked country which isn't all bad the kids find ways to manage and even have fun when darling got a little older she was sent to america where a whole new set of mischief and adventures began zimbabwean author noviolet bulawayo real name elizabeth tshele does an interesting job of exploring life growing up in zimbabwe and then learning to live in america a culture clash that is not unlike her own story darling and her friends seem to make their own fun from playing made up games like country game and stealing guavas but zimbabwe is politically unstable and they have suffered because of the white people there are some interesting insights about life in this country and i really enjoyed learning about darling's life then the novel changes drastically and darling starts her life in america this might be an improvement in her life style but this doesn't mean she was not missing her home the culture clash was the most interesting part of this book from stealing guavas to survive and making up games to fast food and spending her afternoons with new friends watching redtube this was a completely different life and story and it was interesting to compare the two and follow darling's journey at times in the novel i got confused especially when darling refers to shanghai and budapest i couldn't work out how she got to these locations but then worked out these are different sections of paradise and named after the ethnic groupings i know i'm a little slow and a little surprised i didn't pick up on this right away but darlings language took me a while to work out and fully understand what she was saying while this book is easy to read once you get to know darling's narrative style this can be hard hitting the novel is confrontational and will give you some insight into an african life and the struggles facing children in places like zimbabwe struggles you might never have thought of and moving them to a place like america might give them a better chance in life but then you have a whole new set of struggles to understand longlisted for the man booker and i was recommend this book by another book blogger jennifer from the relentless reader i am really glad i read we need new names the novel took me on an interesting journey and i feel i learnt from it and that is what makes for a great book i don't think it will win the man booker but i hope it make the shortlist as well i wouldn't call this novel a typical literary prize nomination but a novel that deserves some boost in sales from its nomination this review originally appeared on my blog http literary exploration com 2013","290":"i plowed through this book a tale of a girl's life in zimbabwe and then immigration displacement to michigan while the author's language is vivid and insistent i could not help but feel that she hadn't read binyavanga wainaina's how to write about africa child rape incest check child pregnancy check aids check of course all of those things are realities but their prominence in this narrative made me wonder how if writers can fall into the traps set by foreign audiences","291":"it is rare that i stop and reread sections of books simply to hear again what the author has said yet i did in this novel several times bulawayo's writing stopped me in my tracks if you care for themes of home refugees displacement or america as a newcomer you can't go wrong with this book on top of it all the author tells a good story i suspect i have already read one of my top books of 20 5 with this reading","292":" i had a spirited chat with a fan of this book she naturally stated i was behaving in a sexist manner and implied with dark tones of voice that i was probably a racist too because i don't think this is a particularly good book and certainly don't think it's booker worthy rating 2 75 of fivethe publisher says a remarkable literary debut shortlisted for the 2013 man booker prize the unflinching and powerful story of a young girl's journey out of zimbabwe and to america darling is only ten years old and yet she must navigate a fragile and violent world in zimbabwe darling and her friends steal guavas try to get the baby out of young chipo's belly and grasp at memories of before before their homes were destroyed by paramilitary policemen before the school closed before the fathers left for dangerous jobs abroad but darling has a chance to escape she has an aunt in america she travels to this new land in search of america's famous abundance only to find that her options as an immigrant are perilously few noviolet bulawayo's debut calls to mind the great storytellers of displacement and arrival who have come before her from junot diaz to zadie smith to j m coetzee while she tells a vivid raw story all her own my review okay someone please i implore you please sit down in front of me where i can see your lips and hear your words and in short simple declarative sentences please please oh please explain to me how the booker people could not shortlist transatlantic an amazing novel by an amazing writer but can shortlist a novel with this in it i don't like going to church because i don't really see why i have to sit in the hot sun on that mountain and listen to boring songs and meaningless prayers and strange verses when i could be doing important things with my friends plus last time i went that crazy prophet revelations bitchington mborro shook me and shook me until i vomited pink things i thought i was going to die a real death prophet revelations bitchington mborro was trying to get the spirit inside me out they say i am possessed because they say my grandfather isn't properly buried because the white people killed him during the war for feeding and hiding the terrorists who were trying to get our country back because the white people had stolen it gosh never heard that before never thought of telling a story about an african country's poverty from the pov of a child before why no it's just unique and unprecedented and it's not like it's ever been done before even dave eggers not a favorite of mine did it in what is the what and then there's say you're one of them but what is that objection falling from your lips those are boys telling their stories not girls telling theirs which is it all experience is human or gender creates a special and different relationship to the world both cannot be true think carefully before answering that question because one answer makes a chink in the armor protecting a very very very touchy equality argument but each experience of the world is unique all should be celebrated uh huh so you'll be buying a joyce meyer book about how she survived incestuous sexual abuse by the healing grace of gawd through jeebus oh no too white church lady conservative all because a man helped her find resolution and a measure of peace because a girl can't do it herself what happened to all experiences being celebrated the above roughly encapsulates a call and response session i had with a fan of the book she naturally stated i was behaving in a sexist manner and implied with dark tones of voice that i was probably a racist too because i don't think this is a particularly good book and certainly don't think it's booker worthy this is not a long book and it's not regardless of the cover the title page and the sales bunf a novel it's interlinked short stories that share a background the author has used a rather flat matter of fact tone to deliver her stories and that's just fine for a story in a collection it's wearing as hell when it's the only tone used it does not lend itself easily to a smooth page turning read it required of me that i expend mental effort to stay engaged for the ~10 12pp the story lasted now that is something laddies and gentlewomen in only 12pp an author can make someone who has spent most of his life 48 54 years reading and savoring many many kinds of books by every conceivable terrestrial human phenotype feel the need to force his attention back to their work i certainly didn't hate the book and i don't think the author should be put in the stocks thence to learn the error of her ways i dislike the book yes but i commend the person who struggled to bring it forth and make it as good as she possibly could imagine it being for doing the work making the effort creating an artwork that rings true in her ears i assume many agree with her i am not one i think it's a decent first book i would pick up another book of noviolet bulawayo's to sample if i happened across it contrast this with my response to that purple bruise and yellow sun woman chimamanda what's it how fast can i run how far can i hurl how hard can i stomp the next and the previous books she's written but this isn't a particularly good book simply because it's not horrible if you find my copy on the train pick it up and idly leaf through maybe you'll like it because goodness knows i didn't this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution noncommercial

first half of the book was beautiful to read capturing childhood innocence perfectly and showing serious topics through a child's eyes however the gravity of the situations are still apparent and sometimes quite distressing","294":" when darling visits tshaka zulu in the hospital he explains why he tells everyone the names of his sons daughters and grandchildren in the photos by his hospital bed many of the people he has never met but the power of naming is important he has named all his children and grandchildren given them names like gezephi sisa nukuthula nene nicholas makhosi ophelia douglas sakhile eden davie ian each name carefully thought out and given over the phone it's how i get to touch them tshaka zulu said to me one day when we were going over the names you see every time

work of fiction 8 9 it won the los angeles times book prize art seidenbaum award for first fiction 2013 10","295":"very impressive read this to for once not get the western pov about an african country africa","296":" what a stellar read i've had so few of those this year the book is simply written giving clear direction of the plot in the 1st half of the book one can clearly see that it is written from darling's 10 year old point of view the sentences a quite long giving the impression of someone who wants to put down her thoughts quickly before she forgets her life in zimbabwe although hard by american standards was carefree and surrounded by friends and family the second half of the book concentrates on her life in america living with her aunt fastina and her family on an expired student's visa she is given a chance to live to study to grow to experience abundance but at what cost her leaving zim before it totally disintegrates is a pyrrihc victory things come to a head when she calls home and her best friend chipo picks up her mother's call they get into a heated argument about her abandoning her country at its hour of need it becomes clear that while she is in safe america those she left behind were spewing bile at her perceived perfect life noviolet explores issues which plague displaced people getting assimilated into new cultures new languages new way of life all this while looking over your shoulder for immigration officers since you are simply an illegal alien highly recommend it","297":"getting the world from prospective of one how is living it not the way it is reported is always the best i love her depiction of the ngos","298":"read with my teacher bk club and had some great convos really wonderful bk exploring race and identity","299":"outstanding literature the main character is a 10 year old girl with remarkable insight and empathy for others at times difficult and others hilarious i love a book that teaches me as well as entertains me","300":" this may be the worst man booker shortlisted book i've read i seriously don't know whether it should be regarded as a novel or loosely connected short stories or a long essay this identity crisis makes the whole reading experience somewhat puzzled our main character is not a character at all it's merely a vessel for author's thoughts about her country and america in general thoughts that are not new original or interesting even in its most emotionally moving parts the book manages to turn itself a festive of cliches stereotype breeding boredom analogies and metaphors symbolism and observations are all exhausted and shallow there are some chapters where a disembodied voice lectures the reader from an incredibly high moral ground it's almost impossible to make sense out of these chapters and how they help the story progress instead of merging those chapters into the main plot author for some reason wants to have the stage on her own she almost betrays her own book the last skype conversation alone is the reason why i think this book fails almost everything it promises of doing the first part where we follow the story from multiple points of view of children is relatively better crafted but in that part the disjointed stories couldn't quite manage to create a platform from which the second part can take off","301":"this much praised booker shortlisted debut novel lives up to the hype narrated mainly by a young zimbabwean girl named darling the first half is set in mugabe's disintegrating zimbabwe where darling's family is among those suffering the most from opposing mugabe curiously the words \"zimbabwe\" and \"mugabe\" never appear in the book the second half moves to michigan first detroit but mainly kalamazoo where darling illegally immigrates and lives with her aunt the book spans about ten years in darling's life she is around 8 when the book starts in zimbabwe and about to graduate high school in kalamazoo when it ends some chapters the most poetic are narrated by a collective \"we\" representing the broader context of struggle in both zimbabwe and among zimbabwean immigrants in the us the book works on many levels as a coming of age story for darling as a classic immigrant narrative as a portrait of the desperation of living under mugabe's misrule the prose is beautiful and affecting a triumph","302":"edit 10 09 2013 oh boy this has been included in the shortlist despite my misgivings to the contrary heartiest congratulations to noviolet bulawayo books like this one have me fumbling around for the right approach to review them because they try to cram in too much within the scope of a regular sized novel and consequently just stop short of resonating strongly with the reader it's like bulawayo had a message to give me something potent and fiercely honest enough to burn right through all my prejudices and cherished misconceptions and leave me staring right at all the cold hard facts but then halfway into it her voice went off in various tangential directions in an effort to tackle too many issues at one go and lost most of its intensity as a result the message that she had set out to deliver gave off the impression of poor phrasing and ended up sounding half hearted and rather dubious if i try my absolute best i can only delineate this as a search for identity a raw account of coming to terms with the after effects of displacement or an attempt at summarizing in a few hundred pages the feelings of being neither here nor there but then bulawayo let me know so much more she told me about the experiences of surviving on a few stolen guavas walking barefoot on the burning asphalt of the dusty road and yet enjoying the smug satisfaction of playing 'find bin laden' with equally destitute and miserable kids of your age and what it feels like to flee from and forget the tattered remains of a land you were born in simply because it could not offer you the promise of a fulfilling life ahead anymore a land torn apart by strife ethnic violence and unstable unsympathetic governments the irony of silently selling away your dignity in a foreign country in exchange for a life better than what your own motherland could afford to bestow upon you the feeling of being swept up in the vortex of too many rapidly occurring changes as an illegal immigrant and the utter hopelessness of never really belonging anywhere bulawayo may not be capable of subtlety or stringing beautiful words together into lengthy sentences fraught with imagery but she has a compelling and unique voice of her own nonetheless i will surely look out for her other works in the future a 3 5 stars that could not be rounded off to a 4","303":" this book held my attention barely i enjoy african fiction and was interested in how the story evolved from a ten year old's view of zimbabwe to a teenager's in america the first part of the story and book is quite grim however true darling and her friends live in a shanty town and steal whatever food they can find they play games away from adults who do not provide any supervision at all the political unrest and violence during mugabe's regime again seen through the children's eyes is explained very well the second half of the book is darling in the united states and her assimilation while living with her aunt some stories are heartbreaking some funny to me a poignant moment was when darling was talking to her friends back in africa and was laughed at when she was trying to empathize and categorically talk about her country darling was seen by her home country friends as having abandoned her home culture and had forgotten them ms bulawayo writing ability is well regarded and i look forward to her future works","304":"well written u0026amp certainly interesting to read but it lacked some of the narrative elements that i like in a story short list worthy but not as good as the time being for me","305":"very good book thoroughly enjoyed it it was really interesting to see how this zimbabwaen girl was very poor in her home country but had many friends and then in the us how different it was very interesting to get an insight on her life and the way she thought of things","306":"a story about children and their life in africa the description is very vivid one child darling is able to go to the united states and her comparisons between life in the us and africa are fascinating the language the author uses is gorgeous and wry in its observations from darling's point of view the us is a lot less colorful and vivacious than africa","307":"funny as only the books written from the perspective of a child can be but poignant as well drives it home that when we are young it does not matter how little we have kids have the ability to be happy anywhere and when we grow up well who's truly happy eh now enough of my 'kaka' philosophy enjoyed the book a very quick read","308":"important but didn't enjoy it at all had to force myself to plough on with it","309":"powerful language","310":"disappointing first half of book was interesting second half was not worth the time it took to read","311":"review originally on sparrowsflysouth blogspot co uki read this last month after a long period of wanting it in a word stunning as someone living in britain a country that's not known war on our own soil for 70 years where poverty is as invisible as the beggars that we glide past in our cities the level of want depicted in zimbabwe was shocking the really affecting thing was the juxtaposition of the poverty among darling and her community and the hope that the children still retained it was heartbreaking and hopeful by turn to see these young children understanding little of the adult world playing and loving one another with perfect happiness and at the same time tainted by the frustrated needs of children who have none of the things they deserve obsessed with western culture and products this portrayal of the zimbabwean children's view of western culture was a sharp wake up call to us living in america and europe throughout the novel darling is captivated by the image of america but the america presented by bulawayo is one of dissatisfaction inequalities social divides the sexulisation of children the broken education system the lack of fulfillment of any and all hopes in that way we need new names follows in the tradition of steinbeck's of mice and men and fitzgerald's the great gatsby presenting the reality of an america that cannot deliver the dream it promises the book falls into two sections zimbabwe and america whilst the first was more raw and beautiful and strange to me the second was equally hard hitting because it showed me something of the reality of our western society it also presented interesting questions about the nature of suffering there is a very acidic chapter in which darling condemns a rich american teen who is suicidal after being dumped and that got me thinking about the different types of suffering and the rights we have to complain the most powerful thing for me was the writing it was absolutely beautiful there is something incredible i think about works not written in the author's first language they have a fluidity a freedom with language because the writer is not constrained by the conventions and dead metaphors that entrap a native speaker therefore the writer can express things in striking new ways which bulawayo did perfectly i would recommend this book to everyone it left me deep in thought and the prose was incredible","312":"great read it tells you the story of a girl who travels from the extreme poverty of zimbabwe to relative opulence of detroit michigan","313":"this book swept me away with its originality and authentic insight into life as a child in a zimbabwe refugee camp i loved the forthrightness and black and white opinions of darling the main narrator something only a child can master with charm as heart breaking as it was uplifting i found it significant that the book's pace slowed considerably in the second half once darling arrives in the usa though the description and characters stay just as vivid and accomplished with no conversation quotes and only brief and subtle references to the passing of time this book is for anyone who wants to read new and exciting literature","314":"i don't know if this is the case but to me this book read more like a collection of short stories and less like a novel the book has a lot of outstanding qualities searing upsetting moving funny surprising but also felt disconnected and full of gaps the narrator seemed intent on insulating herself from deep feelings which is a rational response to the situation she was in but it made it hard to emotionally connect with her","315":"i loved almost everything about this book the chapters set in zimbabwe are powerful and real and the protagonist's move to america provides another great glimpse into immigrant life in modern america every chapter is focused and poetic in its narration and the horrific aspects are balanced with the humorous","316":"stunning lyrical emotional beautifully crafted what an amazing book i felt as if i had transported into darling and was feeling and experiencing her essence living her experiences wish i could start again well worth a read","317":"reading this book felt like riding a mild wave at parts i climaxed with feeling over the descriptions of life in zimbabwe a once flourishing country that has created economic refugees the world over the games the children who need new names played including finding bin laden as the modern hide and seek the hypocritical praying it all away the divisions of color the poverty the sickness and then riding that wave on to america where we get splashes of immigrant life and growing up american and snow and losing identity options and watching porn it was a wave that rose and it was a wave that fell but it was always mild i wanted more i think at points i did not fully comprehend with logic but that was perhaps not the author's intent life is at times an incomprehensible wave and what we were before may not be what we are now this is a book of being in the mind of interconnected and blurred thoughts of what it could have been but what it isn't i gave this a four because there are so few gifted stories of this kind in literature awesome to hear the voice of a brilliant zim author and the zim experience and because when the wave of the narrative did climb high it resonated","318":"this is a breath taking and poetic book that grabs your heart and won't let go love it highly highly recommend","319":" remarkable writing often shocking subject matter beautiful tragic full of horror and humour recommended to me by one of the booker panel as his favourite of the year's shortlist it took me a while to get round to reading this i just didn't fancy to somehow but glad i did as it was very different fresh and thought provoking in both subject and style my only criticism was the ending which i found incredibly frustrating but definitely worth reading and persuading some friends to read so you can discuss with them","320":" darling is a tween living in zimbabwe she doesn't attend school and spends her days searching for food with her friends it seems they get a large portion of their nourishment by stealing guavas from wealthy white neighborhoods through darling's eyes we see zimbabwe as it is poverty no school hunger aids but also friendship camaraderie and family and of course she lives in her language and in her own culture view spoiler then darling gets a chance to move to the us albeit illegally there she pursues the american dream with some success this book seems highly autobiographical and the author states as much in the afterward so i would say given that this book was long listed for the booker prize she pursued the american dream with great success perhaps what i enjoyed most about the novel was the way bulawayo captured darling's emigrant experience missing her friends her family her customs her language and so on at one point she has a phone call with her friends and they tell her she is no longer zimbabwean that zimbabwe is no longer her country yet it is clear to the reader that she is not yet american either that is she is stuck in a no man's land hide spoiler","321":"i bought we need new names almost a year ago because it was a book club's pick i couldn't read past first few chapters needless to say i didn't turn up for book discussion that week i picked it up again a couple of days ago and managed to finish it i liked the first half of it second half not so much the book falls short of its purpose the protagonist darling is an interesting character a ten year old girl in an african country called paradise is carefree starved and observant she is also the voice of the novel i e the story is from her perspective the style of 10 year old darling is pleasant and becomes stilted towards the end why 3 stars noviolet's descriptions are powerful again more towards the first half hunger being carefree anticipation also for the laughs watch out for a few knee slappers there","322":"i actually loved it all except the ending the writing was beautiful the voice was great the story was compelling so much love just the ending was abrupt i thought that's it that's all what","323":"i loved the way this book is written it has an amazing simplicity and as a reader who hailed from the same city as the writer i could relate well to her extensive use of informal language i also loved how honest the book is","324":"meh i can see why it was long listed for the man booker prize but i didn't really enjoy it the first half of the novel which takes place in zimbabwe was far more captivating and better written than the second half when the main character darling has move to destroyed michigan to live with her expat aunt from the amazon com description noviolet bulawayo's debut calls to mind the great storytellers of displacement and arrival who have come before her from zadie smith to monica ali to j m coetzee while she tells a vivid raw story all her own","325":"the writing and the depiction of the immigrant experience are extraordinary but i dragged myself through this novel and don't see much teen appeal i think this is a case of personal preference i just didn't feel for the characters even while i could recognize how powerfully the author expressed the state of living away from one's home country","326":"i really loved this book it should definitely be required reading at a certain age the perspective of a refugee from zimbabwe was both inspiring and heartbreaking so many conversation points here i was left wanting to hear more of this story and or hearing this story from the perspective of adults","327":"i enjoyed the story of an emigrant who feels alienated in their new country while simultaneously drifting apart from their country of origin the writing is easy to understand","328":"a literary book that makes you think","329":" this book makes me think about the immigrant experience in america including that of my mother the book's final chapter serves as a touchstone for descendants of immigrants it took me back to when i was 14 and stood at the graves of my great grandfathers in rendsburg germany and i tried to feel rooted in spite of the fact that i understood only some of the conversation around me and the relatives we were visiting were strangers to me i could not feel connected to germany and little connected me to america i contemplated staying in europe to attend high school and learn my mother's language i felt little pulling me back to begin high school in ohio how many americans have fled violence war terrorism famine plague to face the unknown in a new land how many pick american names for their children born here rather than pass along favorite family names so their american children will not stand apart for many readers who have no connections to zimbabwe there will be other visceral connections in we need new names the ache of its narrator darling will resonate with us too we will better understand the courage heartbreak and sacrifice of our parents and ancestors some of the language was raw some was lyrical but so very much was true that i will look forward to reading more from this author","330":"an amazing debut novel which i could barely put down a must read full of life emotion memories doubts struggles darling guides us through paradise and then through the bittersweet purgatory that being away from home represents","331":" some beautifully written excerpts in this text in the contrast between the beginning and the end of the book her childhood in zim and her coming of age in the states lies the real tragedy of the main character darling who whilst settling in her new country discovers how homesickness creates a permanent refugee out of her illegal stranded and stuck with a new accent and no papers she reminds me of adichie's americannah the latter however goes home and closes the circle whilst here we are left with shadows of things to come i was disappointed by the abrupt ending but still find in this work some amazingly touching pages i think the author is at her best where she depicts her childhood days decries the destiny of her country at the hands of corrupt people the spoilt unawareness of western teenagers and their full fridges and ipads the way westerners talk about africa as it were one place only with no borders no separate countries or customs the destiny of all expats living in one place with their hearts somewhere else an author with potential","332":"if you are looking for something interesting and thought provoking some authenticity humor and unique insight noviolet bulawayo serves it best she has this different way of story telling and wraps it all in one beautiful book her fierce story of a traumatized nation only serves to remind you of the bleak reality that many african countries are grappling with she leaves you with this beautiful quote umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu a person is a person because of people \"read learn","333":"i felt conflicted about this book although i liked the first part something about darling's voice does not quite ring true the second part of the book is filled with descriptions that does not add anything to the atmosphere plot or characters","334":"written from the point of view of a child and later a teen this shows a young zimbabwe girl's free impoverished youth and later her emigration to michigan where she misses her family and community and her ties slowly weaken fresh delightfully observed some modern african history as lived by a young girl","335":" i loved this book from the very first page it is incredibly unapologetic about both zimbabwe and america and especially about the experiences of those in diaspora my favorite parts of the novel are the shifts in the narrative from the singular to the collective noviolet bulawayo has an incredible command of her poetic voice i would most certainly recommend reading this out loud it's also a great read for anyone curious about the experiences of those in diaspora unlike adichie's 'americanah' there is no real resolution in this novel no answer to the question of balancing between two worlds which i find very appealing since after four years here i have yet to find that balance either a truly great read","336":" noviolet bulawayo's debut novel is remarkable how it is timely and timeless her writing is eloquent yet straightforward her prose is both lyrical and stark and to top it off there are some very witty passages told through the eyes of darling the reader experiences a child's view of life in zimbabwe and then in the united states the illusion of america and its reality makes the reader cringe the losses which accompany emigration are myriad and profoundly moving this is a marvelous novel","337":"a good one for anyone who has left one homeland for another","338":"gosh i am just on a roll with reading some really good books lately the first half of this one which takes place in zimbabwe is better than the second half after the main character moves to detroit but overall it's really vibrant and compelling and with a fresh narrative voice that drew me in","339":"i enjoyed the first half of this novel life in rural modern day zimbabwe but i found the second half grated often drifting without purpose four stars is generous perhaps but the book is well written and bought back some poignant memories","340":"this coming of age story set in zimbabwe formerly rhodesia focuses on a small group of kids with unusual names bastard darling godknows chipo and stina they suffer under the mugabe regime's policies they are always hungry as food is scarce so spend lots of time stealing guavas they play made up games finding bin laden and country names as they have too much idle time because the schools have been closed their families have been displaced to live in tin roofed shacks with dirt floors but in spite of the deprivations they experience they are a relatively happy bunch of kids who must seal off their memories from the atrocities they witness as blacks exert their power over the whites the country has a huge unemployment rate 80% and the gdp per capita is $200 there is hope that now the people have gained the right to vote change will come and conditions will improve but change never appears things don't improve so there is a mass exodus from zimbabwe which is what the heroine does when her aunt brings her to live in destroyedmichigan where she becomes quickly acclimated to a new culture","341":"without being too analytical or sentimental let me just say that this book is startling and new and well worth the effort it took me a while to get into the protagonist's darling's way of seeing things but when i did i couldn't put the book down now i know why the author was nominated for the man booker prize i wouldn't be surprised if she won it","342":" this coming of age story follows darling a 10 year old in recent zimbabwe as she plays with friends mourns the life she and her family lost as the result of political upheaval and looks to a future in the united states when her aunt brings her to the u s several years later she is eager to assimilate the subtle shift in accent by audiobook narrator robin miles brings home darling's americanization admirably but as she moves into adulthood darling realizes that while her exodus from her country may have benefitted her materially she has paid a higher price than she anticipated lyrical and heartbreaking a story that stays with you long after you finish","343":"there are points at which this book seems bland others at which it is grotesque and terribly sad the title chapter was especially terrible bulawayo tackles many topics perhaps too many in her narrator's naive voice","344":"noviolet bulaweyo is the pen name of elizabeth zandile tshele a zimbabwean author whose book we need new names is her debut novel it was short listed for the 2013 man booker prize and it is easy to see why the writing is wonderful and the story is wild it's like riding the bumper cars at the county fair just when you think you have control of your car something slams into you from behind and turns your car all the way around in one big circle view spoiler the narrator is darling who is nine years old when we first meet her and busy stealing guavas with a group of her friends they have recently been displaced from their comfortable middle class world during what seems to be a para military junta and are all now living in a dirty shanty town where most of their fathers have diappeared to search elsewhere for work these are broken children living in a torn apart culture with all the usual problems that come with it the writing is in turn crude and raw emotional poignant tragic and funny there is a scene where darling's grandmother mother of bones takes her to church and we meet the preacher prophet revelations bitchington mborro anyone who has ever been to church as a young person when they didn't want to be there and remembers mental eyerolls at

manages to achieve just the right balance between authenticity and accessibility making the book both exotic and easy enough to relate to even if you have no connection whatsoever with

still we wept and wept and wept and they gave us soft little thingies and said here is some kleenex here and we took the soft thingies and put them in our pockets to look at later and we wept still wept like widows wept like orphans more","349":"this is a coming of age story about a girl growing up in a shantytown in zimbabwe she immigrates to the us and has to learn new ways of living the book was well written and a quick read it was full of unique and interesting characters i was not fond of how it ended basically the author just stopped writing there was no true ending","350":"noviolet is a great storyteller a sad story zimbabwe beautifully written with a sense of humour made so many connections with life in sa","351":"this book covers the immigrant experience from the point of view of darling who immigrates from zimbabwe to the u s after a regime change her family's and other's houses are bulldozed and they are now living in a tin shanty slum called paradise the fathers have had to leave the country to take jobs elsewhere south africa saudi arabia bahrain shortlisted for the man booker prize the voices of the children their lack of knowledge of the outside world their lack of understanding of the adult world lend a poignancy that is entralling","352":" there are a lot of great aspects to this novel bulawayo doesn't waffle in her protrayal of the difficulties of the migrant who leaves their country for a 'better life' the sense of guilt for leaving people behind the sense of loss for the people and country and way of life that they abandoned and the frustrations in finding that the promises of this new life are not everything you thought they might be i also really liked her portrayal of life in paradise the slum in zimbabwe i am assuming in or near bulawayo since that is her pen name where our narrator lives before leaving for 'destroyedmichigan' to live with her aunt i did find though that bulawayo's first person narrative didn't work so well maybe i am tired of this approach the child's point of view with their weird mix of naivete and hard realism how complex things are simplified through their description of basic aspects of events and reactions of the people around them in a way it is clever but i guess i am getting tired of it as a literary device which is more on me than on the author an interesting read i think something of a complement or counterpart to adichie's americanah","353":" more like 3 5 stars the beginning while raw and realistic was slow for me the second half picked up and was more engaging not sure that i would classify this as a novel as the plot wasn't linear but seemed more like a group of short stories meshed together also the character development wasn't flushed out for some of the characters the pregnant friend the dying father the crazy uncle as soon as their stories began they ended enjoyed reading about the cultural food family childrearing nuances but the storyline also saddened me seems there isn't a country in africa without strife and turmoil and so many africans view america as the promised land but once they're here and spent time they realize that while life might be slightly better the living is hard and they are never assimilated into this country or accepted","354":"when we were little we used to play in the wind whenever it came we would run outside to meet it hands outstretched like wings bodies balanced on tiptoe and reaching toward the sky there is a recurring theme of flying in we need new names the flight of those who would move on to better places the flight that is denied those left behind the dream of flying that gives hope to those still on the ground as i read these vignettes i was filled with the urgent desperation of the need to fly it was a strangely hopeful yet anxious and discomforting sensation we need new names is a series of poignant and poetically written vignettes about a young girl named darling born in zimbabwe as the stories begin she is 10 years old and her family has lost the real toilets and real rooms of her childhood home and has reestablished themselves with other black zimbabweans in a sea of poverty and tin huts ironically yclempt paradise by the residents many of these stories are heartbreaking as we see the many forms of devastation in darling's community but the child narrator and her young friends respond to this with a sense of dark humor and earnest survival this perspective often makes it necessary to read between the lines some things slip silently above the children's heads while at other times the children understand more than the adults suspect despite the horrors around them the children are focused mainly on survival and enjoying themselves as only children with their youthful resiliency can gradually the children gave up and ceased asking questions and just appeared empty almost like their childhood had fled and left only the bones of its shadow behind dates are not specified exactly but an interview with ms bulawayo sets the book's context in zimbabwe's lost decade between 2000 2010 i am a true beginner on zimbabwe history so i took a look on wikipedia and also an larb review of we are all zimbabweans now to find that in 2000 zimbabwe president robert mugabe started his fast track land redistribution program which was an attempt to dispace the white post colonial landowners that still held the majority of zimbabwe land this resulted in much country upheaval spiralling into increased poverty and health crises for much of the population and a mass exodus of residents to neighboring countries notably south africa political challenges to mugabe's leadership have allegedly been suppressed through a combination of violence and election tampering to maintain his political power while knowing this history is not a requirement for reading the book it does help when trying to understand the events in darling's life and i appreciated the fact that the book motivated me to find out more about the history of zimbabwe and when we got to america we took our dreams looked at them tenderly as if they were newly born children and put them away we would not be pursuing them the book takes place in zimbabwe and also america exploring the lives of those surviving in zimbabwe as well as those who have emigrated to the u s for a better life it is a jarring dichotomy and the narration seems to mimic the sense of alienation and dissonance experienced by the immigrants i found the scenes taking place in zimbabwe to have more poignancy and the writing more poetry and perhaps that was intended whereas life in zimbabwe is filled with a loss of opportunity and a loss of faculty there is a sense of community and of cultural identity that is somehow sustaining in america it is the opposite food is plentiful and a living can be made but immigrants must often sacrifice their families their culture and their natural talents in order to assimilate and work the jobs of drudgery that are available to them ms bulawayo observes the loss of community and identity in a way that is palpable leaving your country is like dying and when you come back you are like a lost ghost returning to earth roaming around with a missing gaze in your eyes near the end of the book we return to the theme of flying this time in response to the feelings of alienation caused by immigration in a dramatic scene one character tries to reclaim their sense of identity by embodying the persona of a zulu warrior so desperate are they in their attempts the scene has them lunging skyward like some crazy plane trying to take off the humor in the description seems to be one of the limited ways that we can acknowledge what is happening and stay sane otherwise we are forced to confront the fact that the effort of continual hope contains the seeds of hopelessness that you can only be a survivor so long until it starts to destroy you i was often reminded of the diary of a young girl while reading this book because of the youthfulness of the perspective and because of the untenable situations both main characters are required to occupy although darling is younger than anne frank was her young life has already faced more tragedy and she is more jaded rather than pondering whether people are ultimately good at heart darling takes her plea to a higher authority her perspective is a necessary counterpoint to frank's optimism and an observation darling makes early in the book is in many ways its thesis instead of asking god nicely people should be demanding and questioning and threatening to stop worshipping him maybe that way he would think differently and try to make things right like he is supposed to","355":"i really enjoyed this auto biography of a girl who leaves zimbabew to live with an aunt in america i feel it fell apart a bit at the end though how did she ever get into university and get a master's degree the story ended too soon","356":"fantastic a little slow in the beginning but glad i pushed through the first few pages excellent writing and very vivid descriptions of shanty life in zimbabwe and life in america recommend","357":"another really interesting read from this year's booker shortlist","358":" noviolet does a wonderful job presenting the psychology of darling in her narrative the first half of the book is absolutely brilliant and stunning a beautiful and simple portrait of another world the second half provides a modern comparison of it with american culture although i cringe at the raw honesty of her portrayal america is pretty ugly this immigration story of reinventing one's life away from home is one that transcends not only culture but space and time darling speaks to every reader","359":"there's a distinctive voice in this book the author brings the narrator to life at first this book seemed very fresh and new unfortunately it then lost its way there's a disconnect between the scenes set in the usa and those in zimbabwe the book if brave but didn't ultimately work for me it's neither telling a tale i'm interested or in or portraying a character that captures my imagination","360":" there's much to recommend about this book in some ways it reminded me of _the god of small things_ precocious child narrators vivid scene setting and a whole host of memorable characters but while _the god of small things_ was one of my favorite books of all time _we need new names_ left me feeling a bit lukewarm for one thing although the narrative was cohesive at first by the end it was substantially more disjointed more like a series of vignettes than anything else which while this is a perfectly respectable way to write a book is unsettling if your expectation after the first few chapters is that it will continue to read like a novel as such the book felt jagged where _the god of small things_ felt smooth finally while i mentioned that the characters were memorable there were none that i particularly liked not even darling i realize that to a great extent whether characters are likeable or not is not the point perhaps this even makes me like the terrible ngo photographers in the book wishing that the valid and critically important issues presented in the text were wrapped up in a more photogenic package to that extent my feelings about this book are really bifurcated on the one hand noviolet bulawayo is a talented writer and the book engages thoughtfully with immigration post and neocolonialism poverty and national and international politics and for those reasons i highly recommend it on the other hand i recommend it predominantly for the questions it raises and things it makes you think not for the ways it makes you feel","361":"just started this and so far a remarkable voice of a young girl growing up in zimbabwe hope it stays this good finished beautiful writing especially the first half where darling is running with her gang of friends through paradise definitely insightful at times funny and sad the second half when she moves to detroit is not as strong but still this is an amazing first novel and it will be difficult for ms bulawayo to maintain such a fresh voice","362":"i read this book for an upper level english seminar and it is a captivating read it is thought provoking challenging and bulowayo expertly excludes her audiences from her protagonist's experiences at times which in my opinion is one of the best things an author can do","363":"great debut novel but i wonder if she has any more books in her as this felt very autobiographical in parts like a lot of authors who write in their second language her writing is beautiful and literary the book is in two parts and i preferred the part set in the us which puts me at odds with a lot of reviewers it was good to read a book about experiences completely out of my ken worth reading and would be a good reading group book","364":" 8 20 2013 another entry on the 2013 man booker prize longlist wnnn is a curious mix an evocative stir of memory's detail a disjointed but perhaps for that reason realistic storyline and a wonderful and quirky child protagonist darling who fades slowly as a character as she grows up and the story unfolds lyrical lumpy charming frustrating many passages glow with energy and anger and love but many others clomp along working only as bridges from one section to another or as less successful side stories meant to add to the kaleidoscopic nature of darling's experience darling is 11 years old as the story opens living at a bare subsistence level in a shanty town in zimbabwe known as paradise and spending much of her time roaming with her friends looking for food first and adventure always the local school has closed so they have become practically feral they steal guavas from the rich neighborhood nearby they wait for the ngo truck to bring them toys they argue about how they will escape their poverty one of her friends is pregnant by her own grandfather and none of these pre teens understands how this happened or what it means nor do they understand the unstable and dangerous political situation though it is clear through darling's reporting how as she puts it a number of times things fall apart yup i got it but darling does have a way out it turns out her aunt lives in america and suddenly as one section ends and the next begins she goes from this life in zimbabwe to a small apartment in detroit staring out the window at the mysterious stuff called snow it is quite clear how disorienting and strange this must be and yet that is still only the beginning as a whole the novel is not a seamless success and the last third is especially unconvincing but it is still an important work for a few reasons one it illustrates with breathtaking clarity and pain the terrible loss and sense of unbearable pressure and responsibility experienced by immigrants who have come to america from all over the world to find a better life and instead find loneliness and isolation drudgery and endless envy and requests for money from their families back home two it cleverly made me forget in my focus on that experience the suffering and hardship of what these immigrants have left i forgot just as darling forgets the bad parts of what she left which is an integral part of the immigrant experience as well as part of any growing up experience and for both reasons important to the story and three its two halves with the sharply divided sections of first zimbabwe and then destroyedmichigan are intriguingly balanced it's not clear what the right answer is for any refugee or immigrant and that ambiguity of message makes the novel more forceful for its lack of answers the novel is bleak yet there is a vitality a sense of wry humor and hope even in this comparison of two bad options darling will survive for sure and she will tell her stories and we should listen","365":" i liked this book more than i expected to based on its description but although it purports to be a single narrative we need new names is really two books smashed together one a compelling story about children in a shantytown in zimbabwe and the other a disjointed story about a teenager from zimbabwe living in michigan both stories share the same narrator but there's surprisingly little tying them together and the second half tries to cover far too many topics in the space of only 150 pages to succeed at much of any of them in the first half darling runs around with her friends playing games of their own invention and heading into a nearby town to steal fruit from the guava trees there they remember living in houses and going to school but their houses were razed and now they live in shacks their parents built from whatever materials they could find the book hardly touches on what happened to land them in this situation and focuses almost entirely on the present day this feels entirely accurate for a book narrated by a ten year old but as a reader i would have liked to know a little bit more about what happened to their town we get little inklings of what the parents must be feeling but only ever in passing as glimpsed by a child even in the first half the chapters read almost like standalone stories it's the same characters from one chapter to the next but each chapter feels self contained but in the second half the chapters really start feeling disconnected and it gets hard to follow the passage of time in the first half darling kept referring to her aunt in america and claiming that someday she'd go to live there too suddenly we move into a chapter where darling is living in michigan but there's no real transition from zimbabwe to america and no explanation of why her aunt would have welcomed the responsibility of raising and feeding a teenager the second half spans darling's middle school and high school years in america and it tries to cover so many things the immigrant experience being an illegal alien in america trying to relate not just to americans but to immigrants from other countries getting lumped in together as being from africa no matter the country race relations in america poverty in america there's so much going on here that there's no space to go into any detail about any of these things so the second half is a whirlwind of impressions each chapter a story that has little to do with the previous chapter the book starts trying to cover so many different topics that we get less and less of a sense of darling herself i often spent half a chapter trying to figure out how much time had passed since the previous chapter and how old darling was supposed to be now at one point i honestly thought my kindle had skipped me about 50 pages forward as i couldn't figure out how the chapter i'd just read could possibly flow directly into the one i was reading now overall this gets four stars for the first half and for the ambition of the second half even though the second half really should have been a much longer novel all its own i wish i could have learned a lot more about the political situation that had shaped darling's childhood and i wish there had been better narrative flow in the second half however there's a lot of promise here and i look forward to seeing where noviolet bulawayo goes from here","366":" i found this book both boring and irritating it's about a group of children in africa and one of them eventually ends up getting sent to america to be raised by her aunt in detroit so the book is split roughly halfway between the africa and america sections i found the africa parts completely dull and skimmed most of them it was a lot of stream of consciousness overly self aware precious anecdotes about life in africa and how children there talk behave and interrelate to each other i'm sure it was all realistic since the author is from zimbabwe and this should have been interesting but i just found it incredibly long winded and tedious i found the american part more interesting but then the book started to irritate me it just felt like an indictment of america for not throwing enough money at people for no reason and for taking them from their home countries i mean if you choose to come to america should you blame america for being homesick i should have gone with my gut instinct on this one i read reviews which made me suspect that i wouldn't like it but i'm such a sucker for fish out of water culture clash stories that i read it anyway","367":"written in the voice of a child the story starts with darling and her friends living in a shanty town called paradise in zimbabwe the children run wild are often starving steal guavas from the smart houses people and play imaginative games they are hungry but having fun together with a strange mixture of innocence and knowledge the country is falling apart after independence from british colonial rule each chapter focuses on a different event and gradually we find out that darling was born in a proper house that she used to go to school that her father is off looking for work in south africa and her mother goes to \"sell things\" on the border half way through the book darling as promised arrives in michigan to live with her aunt and go to school in this section we see how she survives and adapts to the us partly autobiographical as the author was born in zim and moved to usa at 18 not sure about another book written in the voice of a child or the slightly disjointed chapters each covering a different theme but it leaves a strong impression of the tragedy that is zimbabwe and the difficulties of adjusting to life as an outsider in the us she is often very funny and astute in her descriptions and observations","368":"i really did not like this book it is the story of a young girl darling growing up in an unnamed african country and then living as a teenager in the united states as other reviewers have said it read more like a book of short stories as major characters and what should have been huge life changing events were described in one chapter never to be mentioned again the descriptions of darling's african childhood seemed like just like a series of stories of her and her friends basically being rambunctious punks none of whom i liked or felt any sort of connection with even though darling was the central character of the book i feel like i never got to know her at all and never really understood her thoughts and feelings about really serious things that happen to her seeing her mia father return with the sickness witnessing a riot moving to the united states from a developing country etc however there were two chapters in this book that were really amazing 5 star worthy these were not written in darling's voice but instead were a more broad description of the immigrant experience i suspect these may have been written as stand alone essays or short stories that were then put in the book since they fit the theme of the novel i really enjoyed these chapters of the book and they saved it from a one star rating","369":"wow bulaweyo does unbelievable beautiful and powerful work in this story capturing the african experience of a child in a way i've never heard or read her chapters of intermission which capture the collective immigrant experience are among the most beautiful passages in literature the story and plot moves quickly while still being literary and descriptive a must read for sure","370":"this had been on my radar for a while but due to a few disappointing reviews i doubt i would have bothered with it if i hadn't been reading the booker longlist and whilst the book's not perfect it was a great deal better than i'd been led to believe the freshness of the voice hit me from the first page darling the young zimbabwean narrator is on the way to steal guavas from a rich area with her friends says we didn't eat this morning and my stomach feels like somebody took a shovel and dug everything out a simile you can feel recently i've noticed a few things that predispose me to like a contemporary novel including characters from a social class different from the one i grew up in and vivid metaphors which germinate from the story's setting we need new names has both in abundance darling is too immersed in her world doesn't know enough that's different to describe it in a sensationalist way that this is how it is voice hearing things on someone else's terms with little overt judgement or analysis is very appealing and which i often find makes so called difficult subjects quite easy to read about we need new names moves so much faster is more political and more immediate than ghana must go another 2013 debut novel by a young woman with an african background and an ivy league education bulawayo lived in zimbabwe till she was 18 and she's used that experience to make this book way more interesting than selasi's slow upper middle class american family saga with a few scenes in africa another obvious new release to compare would be americanah which i haven't read the most frequent criticism of this book i've seen is that it goes wrong in the second half when darling goes to live with her aunt in america i really can't see where this is coming from the episodic structure is so similar to the zimbabwe half for starters there is something less zingy about its tone but that reflects the disagreeable michigan weather the amount of time spent indoors and the whole failed american dream thang zimbabwe local people killed with machetes over politics usa local people killed with guns because of money or general violent tendencies zimbabwe 11 year old gets pregnant and too few people care usa kids regularly watch hard porn online whilst parents are at work the jobs aren't much better for illegal immigrants in america but at least there's organised education sanitation abundant food abundant opportunities for consumer debt and the inspiration of a young black president and in both countries friends to have adventures with there were a few faults that could have been easily sorted out through editing inconsistent chronology and stylistic tics like overuse of 'verbing and verbing and verbing' and of the achebe allusion things fall apart cut these by half and they'd have still been distinctive and memorable the book could have done with footnotes especially for the phrases in ndebele and possibly like a tale for the time being for other points too i enjoyed looking things up online and now know a bit more about african politicians and musicians but it's not always convenient to google stuff when reading we need new names had some totally unfussy reflection on the differences and kinships between black american ebonics culture and recently arrived immigrants from africa something i'd heard a little about in a british context but not enough and a great scene about trying to communicate with officialdom in english as a foreign language which made me think u0026amp was reminiscent of a concise chinese english dictionary for lovers because you have to do all this preparation when you get to the final step something strange has happened and you speak the way a drunk walks and because you are speaking like falling it's as if you are an idiot those who speak only english are busy looking at your falling instead of paying attention to what you are saying the guardian review of this book asks has the caine prize for african writing which noviolet bulawayo won in 2011 created an african aesthetic of suffering this sounds like a question worth considering one which i don't have sufficient knowledge to answer but bulawayo addresses the wider issue of what people think and show and want to hear about africa to an extent through her narrative in scenes of white western journalists darling and her friends encounter in zimbabwe and near the end when she phones one of her old friends who stayed there you think watching on bbc means you know what is going on no you don't my friend it's the wound that knows the texture of the pain it's us who stayed here feeling the real suffering it's us who stayed here who have the right to say anything as well as a critique of the author as self appointed spokesperson this could allude to the way that a lot of internationally recognised african writing comes from authors who no longer live on the continent i haven't read a lot of african fiction so this is a tentative opinion on bulawayo's response to literary stereotype mongering a very readable book which gave me quite a bit to think about glad i gave it a go after all the quotes i've used don't reflect the freewheeling sense of adventure in we need new names which isn't a tediously worthy book as i may have made it sound here it's as vibrant as its cover","371":" darling lives in a shanty town somewhere in zimbabwe she and her family used to live in a real house back when independence was still a simple victory but the economy has crashed and the government is cracking down her father has emigrated to find work and now they live in a shanty town and can never go back suitcases full of worthless paper money under everyone's beds gangs roam bolstered by rhetoric searching out white people who are no longer welcome ngos come and deliver t shirts with slogans on them attempts at a democracy nobody's ever experienced are struck down darling and her friends listen to lady gaga wear chinese clothes play at killing bin laden and dream of america land of the bad motherfuckers this is a global world where no place is a backwater of course when she does manage to get to destroyedmichygen in america she promises to stay in touch to come home and visit but she never will because the economy is what it is and the government is cracking down on illegal aliens and she can't get in properly but if she leaves she can never come back so there she is always the african in american eyes always the emigrant in her friends' eyes never able to be at home again a ghost we need new names is told in chapters that seem almost like independent short stories i was reminded of alice munro more than once the trouble in as much as there is one is partly that some of those chapters how they lived for real hitting budapest the horrifyingly simple we need new names almost work better on their own than as part of the longer story partly thanks to darling herself being one of those narrators who observe but rarely act which is part of the story of course but whenever bulawayo gets a little too on the nose with the symbolism and parables i find myself wondering if that's really what an 11 year old would notice then again we always underestimate each other don't we 4 5 because it's memorable and because it promises more","372":"3 5we need new names might tread familiar ground with the theme of migration to the west from a country in turmoil and not have anything particularly new to say on the subject but the voice of the narrator is the driving force of this book and keeps it fresh and compelling","373":"lovely voice of darling i could see the world through her eyes i enjoyed her jokes and can understand lots of things that i would never have been able to i could also feel for the many characters while some in our book club liked the part in africa i liked both parts life in africa and the us i felt privileged for darling to share her life with me us excellent work","374":"it took me almost to the end to get my interpretation of this book straight since i was thrown off the scent by a snippet of praise from peter godwin noviolet bulawayo is a powerful authentic nihilistic voice feral feisty funny i haven't read godwin's book so to me he is just some white guy and i've gotta say i hate the gendered word feisty which is supposed to mean 'spirited' but throws off sexual connotations and also 'feral' which means wild like a free undomesticated animal and in combination i think these words make the kind of description of a black woman that deserves a serious side eye but what got under my skin and stuck there was the word nihilistic which means correct me if i'm wrong believing in no truth in nothing a nietzschian philosophy thanks to some white guy i spent most of the novel thinking 'is this nihilistic ' because that is one big fat claim to make about an author in this incredibly annoying context i wish i could wash my brain and read this again the first line that really struck me was protagonist darling's realisation in church that 'i had no sins' all my brakes slammed on because i believe most people feel themselves to be in the right almost all of the time except when actually actively in the throes of guilt over something darling has already talked about stealing about being in trouble with authority figures in her life and not doing what she is 'supposed to' do yet she 'has no sins' in the mind of what judge does she have no sins in her own mind or is there no mind that records transgressions or is there no such thing as sin bulawayo makes bold references to for instance things fall apart and most provocatively to billie holiday's song 'strange fruit' drawing a parallel between lynchings in the us and aids in african countries like darling's i wondered about the meaning of the title which comes from a moment when darling and her group of friends are playing their names seem to be made of chewed up postcolonial detritus but bulawayo does not discuss this however the re visioning and re creation of the world through play is really important in the book and it's the aspect that i continue to reflect on most after reading most strikingly after witnessning the funeral of a gang murdered activist the group reenact his death which they have not seen in the form of play bulawayo draws attention to the way children understand each other so profoundly in play that they almost meld into a hive mind it's no wonder then that darling feels bereft in the usa where friendships have different tensions and each mind is more isolated i enjoyed her unusual perspective on snow as a stifling horror i liked the scene where she and her friends stole a car and went 'shopping' the level of rule breaking is consistent in both countries and i found darling u0026amp her accomplices mischief against the ranks of privilege really satisfying i also appreciated her comments on the dangers of driving or running while black and there are some hints at empathy with african americans that i was able to pick up thanks to chimamanda ngozi adichie's much more incisive and detailed analysis by narrative of the dynamic between aa and nab non american black people in americanahdarling's refrain 'supposed to' external and internally recurring is not confined to her childhood though neither is her enforced obedience to various authorities its meaning seems to shift or float freely suggesting a buffeted will the scene where the children witnessed the gang evicting the white man had i thought an edge of derision and no decisive sympathy in either direction all of the actors in the little drama the children watched from the trees seemed foolish craven unappealing thus political machinations are written as theatre and take on more meaning through reinterpretation in play in this sense there is perhaps something nihilistic rather than just indecisive about the pre migration sectionhowever once transplanted in the usa darling's emotional life and thoughts take on sharper focus as she observes the rootless consumers around her seeming no more at home than she far from the country where people bury the placenta in the ground so the child will stay connected to the earth 'sons of the soil' one activist addresses a crowd of fellow black africans for me there were some alienating notes such as her resentment that in the us it's not socially acceptable to 'beat some sense into' one's kids and what seemed like a total misunderstanding of the occupy movement which is flawed sure and has race issues yes but still 'when i saw their pretty little tents and food piled on tables i laughed at how they were trying to pretend they knew what suffering was' misses the mark since the protest is not about the suffering of protesters themselves but about the exploitation of the global 99% darling's comment sounds like the ever useful ' {do what i say}{stop complaining}because there are children starving in africa' right at the end though the anger comes judiciously to the boil i think what brought me to my senses was the medicalisation of tshaka zulu declared mad for speaking truth maybe godwin handed down the nihilism verdict to help him sleep at night but i disagree i think the book itself is a verdict not on the emptiness of the universe but on the colonised world one as severe as a slap in the face to a spoilt kid i finally thought of kurt vonnegut though i'd much rather read this again or better more from noviolet bulawayo than any of his brilliant horrible books","375":"the author wrote convincingly of the expectations of living in america the land of plenty and pathway to riches and the reality and challenges african immigrants meet here","376":" as more and more people are forced to leave their homelands the literature of the diaspora becomes more diverse and interesting noviolet bulawayo is a zimbabwean woman now living in america her stunning debut novel we need new names is no doubt at least partly based on her own experience bulawayo illuminates the starkness of the choice so many people must make - to stay at home in abject poverty even at risk of your life or search for a new life and be forever a stranger in a strange land read full review here http newtownreviewofbooks com 2013","377":"so good i think i am in love with the way that bulawayo writes","378":"i really enjoyed this book especially the first half set in zimbabwe it gives a voice to those who have suffered are still suffering under mugabe's regime i liked the vivid believable setting and the narrator's cast of childhood friends it's one of the dubious ironies of life that a friend filled imaginative childhood in your own country during an oppressive regime is kind of preferable to the materially richer life the west can offer an emigrant immigrant a bright girl like darling the narrator couldn't stay she had to go to america when the opportunity arose but part of her died when she left zim the beloved homeland loved the dialogue especially the pompous but hilarious verbiage of the guard the children encountered in a wealthy area of their city","379":"excellent book in the narrated by a young girl who left her country to come to the america of her dreams but the reality was not as expected very sad but good book","380":"it's not a bad book by any means but it's message s were to me disjointed and didn't carry the weight other books in this genre held","381":"didn't fully engage me there was something about the plot--the story is told more as a series of vignettes than any one concerted narrative--that i couldn't grab on to the writing is strong and the sense of character and of place equally strong bulawayo makes some very powerful points","382":"the first half of this book is good then it just completely unravels in the second act i even hesitate to call it a second act because it's trying to be about so many things that it isn't about anything at all this is a first novel and it absolutely feels like one noviolet bulawayo has an interesting voice and i hope she eventually develops it","383":"intense and compelling narrative loved the contrast between africa and the states precious moments of seeing the us from an outside perspective got to have a sense of humor about us culture to enjoy this book","384":"maybe not quite 4 stars but for the way she writes about childhood in zimbabwe i love the characters' names and their determination to live their childhoods despite the tragedies surrounding them what bulawayo does poignantly is shatter the myth that america is the be all end all the storytelling fell apart for me in the last third but the message and pain were clear read alikes tiny sunbirds far awayamericanahthe book of unknown americans","385":"every chapter in bulawayo's book can stand as a short story because she talks of different things related to the desperate situation in their country zimbabwe i think the writer uses the voice of a child so as to lighten the issues she addresses https julieinspire wordpress com 20","386":" bulawayo is the most genuinely detailed translator between her native tongue and english that i've ever read which isn't saying much but there are a healthy handful of books written recently about the african immigrant experience and we loved this one especially the descriptions of childhood in the streets in zimbabwe i'm comparing this book to half the sky and things fall apart this book is episodic no true plot a fact those i've discussed it with liken to the fragmented memories of traumatic memoirs from war veterans one of bulawayos sisters' names means basically enough girls already as a third girl i appreciated that the first chapter entitled hitting budapest describes the children deciding to storm a village to grab fruit from trees even though the fruits cause diarreah reminds me of a game my neighborhood crowd played in the bushes on selected neighborhood streets called fighting vietnam bulawayo spoke in pasadena at the pasadena festival of women authors in april 2015","387":"not so much a novel but linked short stories darling has a convincing commentary as typical 'african' issues impinge on her childhood utterly shot through with loss family community nation humanity","388":"this book says a lot about experiences in zimbabwe under robert mugabe's rule that have not been widely exposed and it is told from a unique view point that of a feral child in the poorest of shanty towns i expect there is also very little written about the particular experiences of african people adapting to life in america especially those who have evaded the immigration authorities a hard sad life from a literary point of view though i struggled with it i'm not sure that it fits any known genre perhaps that doesn't matter","389":"interesting and worthy but i can't say that i really enjoyed it it makes important points but it was hard going at times not the subject although the subject was hard but i was expecting that and that's not what i mean but the narrative style it didn't do anything to dispell my preconceptions about award nominated books","390":" noviolet bulawayo's we need new names is the first novel i have read by a zimbabwean writer we need new names tells the story of darling who with her mother has been relocated to a rural location in the chaos of zimbabwe in the mugabe years we meet darling as a part of a band of roaming children making up games to amuse themselves and slowly learn that she has been displaced from a happier time when she and her parents lived in a brick house in a suburb the government razed houses and forced people to leave now her father is away in south africa and she and her mother make do in the new place adult culture seems to be dominated by the charismatic preacher and the woman who brews the beer older children take sides in the political struggles ones that darling doesn't really understand the story is told in the voice of a child a child who wants to be rescued by her father's sister and taken off to america in due time this happens and darling finds herself first in detroit and then in kalamazoo michigan where she lives with her aunt her aunt is married to a man who is also an immigrant but from ghana he has a son and the four of them make a tenuous family one that falls apart when the son joins the us army and serves in iraq darling goes to high school in the us learning how to live with and through her classmates in the novel darlings thinks about her aunt--how she has managed to carve out a life in michigan and also how she misunderstands parts of american culture we see darling figuring out how to get along partly by reflecting on her aunt's troubles she also studies her new friends and figures out her own ways of moving thought the world she finds herself in--a world that is more and more distant from that of her mother and her friends back in zimbabwe we need new names contributes to our understanding of the experiences of immigrants one of the last chapters written in the voice of \"we\" making explicit that bulawayo is telling this specific story as part of a larger story about migration bulawayo moved from zimbabwe to kalamazoo michigan in 2000 when she was 18 she attended high school in bulawayo zimbabwe and kalamazoo valley community college locales that are featured in the novel i was in zimbabwe in 2003 and i was awed by the landscape the wonderful people i met and the devastating economic collapse i was eager to read this novel for how it could help me understand what i experienced there but what captured me about this book is bulawayo's eye for detail and how she tells the story through what darling sees and experiences","391":"this is a book written in the voice of a child adolescent living in very trying times in zimbabwe then relocating to michigan to live with an aunt it consists of one vignette after another of experiences told through the eyes of a child there are scenes related to voting and being disappointed of white families being dispossessed of their property of fanatic preachers of adults dying of aids of poverty and forced removal of blacks from certain areas and hopelessness and the desire to leave while it gives some of the flavor of life from the perspective of a child it is frustrating to not get the full context of the times her adjustment to modern american life is also trying missing family african food african culture dealing with stereotypes the desperate demands of those back home and the frustrations of communicating in a seconded language i thought this book was spotty some really moving chapters and stories and some annoying chapters overall i am glad i read it and admire the young author for telling her story","392":" i was all set to give this book 5 stars right up until i read about three quarters of it i am giving it nothing less than four stars because i loved the first half of it so much the story centers on darling a 10 year old girl who was born and raised in zimbabwe currently living in a shanty town after having been displaced by military i loved this part of the book written with the sparse stark language a child uses and dripping with the beauty found in a child's perception bulawayo creates a lovable funny realistic charachter there were parts of this narrative that i read three or four times just because they were so beautifully and poignantly written bulawayo captures the playfulness in a child's heart as well as the sadness that infiltrates a child who has undergone a traumatic event everything about this section was well written beautiful descriptive and soul shattering i feel like i can't even articulate how powerful this narrative was to me i just don't have the words for such beauty then we get to the second half of the book in this half darling has gone to america to live with her aunt fostalina the third quarter of this book is not really bad i like the honesty with which bulawayo writes about the transition of living in a new place being surround by a new culture and trying to decide whether or not to assimilate to that culture or rather decide how to assimilate to a culture without feeling like a traitor to your own after this the book took a sharp decline for me for one thing the voice didn't change it didn't grow up which bothered me because darling is now a teenager and i feel like the voice is still written in that of a child maybe the author was trying to imply that in some ways coming to a new country keeps you a child but i wish she had made the voice age as the character did and then she did the one thing that nearly always ruins a book for me she introduced a significant character over half way through the novel this brings is to the weird and bizarre tshaka zulu he is first introduced at the wedding and reappears later in the story in some scenes that last for pages i still am not sure what his role was it seemed that she was trying to make him significant in some sense but there was absolutely no character development for him thereby making him a confusing and annoyingly unsolvable bump in the story and the ending it felt rushed to me unfinished it felt like she had a bunch if little pieces left over that she couldn't work into the novel anywhere else so she just put them together and said the end kind of disappointed because like i said i loved the first half if this book so very much so much in fact that despite its shortcomings it still gets four stars","393":"authentic and true voices of african children who survive a genocide told in first person perspective we become intimately involved in their childhood antics we can relate to the nuances of their lives and then everything is upended rips your heart out makes you laugh makes you think all the qualities of a great read","394":"i liked this book a lot the contrast of life in the two countries without putting one above the other was real and i liked it the voice of the storyteller was funny and not overdone in the way that a lot of adults write children characters as i recommend it","395":" if you're at all interested in literature you need to read this book if you're at all interested in literature set in post and peri mugabe zimbabwe you need to read this book if you're at all interested in the experience of illegal immigrants in america you need to read this book full of beauty and pain and utterly engrossing this is a book that i put down softly with a sign of loss that it was over it is easily the best book i've read this year i found out after i picked it up that it'd been shortlisted for the booker and in my opinion it's a well earned nomination i don't want to make any predictions about the outcome because i'm still working my way through the short list but this has to be a strong contender","396":"this book was disappointing to me i wanted more day to day of what life was like living in zimbabwe and i would like to have seen more of darling's reaction to life in america than what was shown it seemed like there was a lot of fast forwarding once she got to her aunt's house it was alright","397":"i wanted to love it it's beautifully written and really brings across the emotions of leaving one's country as well as the absurdity of america and americans' view of africa the ending was weird though i think i like it better than americanah though","398":" this is a story that will tug at your heartstrings the author tells the story of a young girl darling who lives in africa who then is brought to america by her aunt the narrative is extremely raw and is striking in the lack of innocence the young children have they are exposed to the tragedies of life at a young age and yet unaware of what it all means in the big picture of life life in their african country was normal to them they knew nothing different yet heard many stories and knew that there was a different way of life in america they all dreamed of escaping and being rich and always having enough food yet when darling moves to america while her physical needs were satisfied she often felt this longing for her home her friends her mother as she strives to fit in to american society a must read for everyone eye opening about some of the harsh realities of this world","399":"i give this book 4 5 stars mixed up feelings whilst i read it powerful ending that left me in silence for a few seconds because i don't know whether i have to be sad or mad","400":"like reading two books in one the first part is the story of ten year old darling and her friends children who survive and play in the shantytowns of zimbabwe the second part is darling's story of attempting to assimilate and stay despite being there illegally in the u s it felt a little more like a series of short stories occasionally with too much crammed into them to me than one cohesive narrative but i liked darling's voice very much mrs p","401":"what a beautiful voice this writing has i loved the book and was moved by how complex the writing was which seems at face value simple noviolet bulawayo's debut novel takes you into the mind of darling a young zimbabwean girl who immigrates to detroit in the second half of the book the stories the characters the thoughts simply wonderful and heart wrenching at the same time","402":"amazing book got me laughing all through","403":"this was a lovely book to read it was a lot of fun too i am just unsure which one came first between this book and chimamanda's americah i felt like i was reading americanah when i read this book there were a lot of similarities in the narrative other than that it was a good book to read","404":"i could not have enough of the experiences in budapest and climbing of the fambeki the humour is fresh","405":"a very light funny book enjoyed it to bits darling and friends are just hilarious swearers of note but awesome guava stealing adventures were just funny the u s part was okay but not as enjoyable as the first part of the book based in zimbabwe","406":"well written memoir style novel of growing up in zimbabwe then relocating to the us the parts in africa were interesting because the kids telling the story were so young they didn't really understand what was happening and they acted accordingly when darling comes to america she finds it hard to adapt but does slowly learn about her adopted land i thought the last 1 5 was pretty rushed though as darling got older and faced newer realities","407":"raw visceral and at times shocking bulawayo's debut is startlingly profound for a first go undoubtedly worthy of its place on the booker shortlist we need new names has a big message that deserves worldwide readership","408":"first time novel about a girl who immigrates from zimbabwe to the us although her country of birth is never named beautifully evocative writing from a child perspective a coming of age about navigating two different cultures the book is not plot driven and instead is a richly drawn portrait of cultural assimilation and growing up","409":"if you were going to read this novel and want to approach it with fewer preconceptions stop reading after the first three paragraphs i took my time reading this book because of other things going on and this might be partly why i noted rather gaping narrative holes between each chapter but i think they are intentional these chasms are really noticeable especially in the second half is this because she is growing up quickly in america do we only get to see the times she is often painfully reconnected to or alienated from zimbabwe for my own purposes i can trace concerns about hunger including insatiable hunger for home and belonging not alleviated by plenty language and us wars and immigration in this work that i have been working with for 1 5 vna texts bulawayo also seamlessly works in commentary on police violence against people whose crime was driving while black a number of times about uncle kojo and the girls joy riding trouble with categorizing this books fits if poorly on my shelf of what i am thinking of calling the uncontainable a mode of writing i am starting to love dearly for now let me just refer to the uncontainable as books in which the wide though deep concerns of the author stretch the sequence of the traditional narrative to its splintering point and start to cross the line into connected short stories or vignettes without the specific marketing as such house on mango street and winesberg ohio would be examples of the intentional classification of a novel of vignettes or connected short stories and there are moments when bulawayo's text feels like reading perhaps a cross between sandra cisneros and sherwood anderson also i often thought of stealing buddha's dinner a memoir by bich minh nguyen while reading we need new names due to the uncontainable quality of what i was reading and the themes addressed specifically related to food anyway we need new names offers a poignant experience with our humanness our vulnerabilities and cynicisms imperfections that can be endearing response and explanation or at least links to the articles to criticism that bulawayo is writing poverty porn but there is another question that i can't resist asking about helon habila labelling her debut novel as poverty pornography i actually do not ask the question ivan mulumba matthias does and i add soup to it noviolet does not mince her words in response \"i do not write to please people i can't please everybody i quickly learnt to be fine with it in 2011 since i do not write for critics or habila i am fine with the poverty porn label \" dayum i do not know what to ask next quote from http brittlepaper com 2014 08 novio see articles and my commentary helon habila's review https www theguardian com books 201 he mentions an episodic structure of the novel this is what i was trying get at in my idea of the vignette novel or thematically linked short stories possibly mislabeled or fitting into the caine prize parameters i agreed with his questions about china and i don't think i like what she is suggesting by misspelling black power moving on habila asks what does the suffering do is it cathartic or de sensitizing and essentializing about africa being a mess i am not entirely sure but i will come back to this i do wonder if she romanticized childhood a bit too much but i certainly respect bulawayo's response above i also know that you can deeply long for the most imperfect of places and people further reading an interpretation of kabila's comments does it over emphasize his critique http asterixjournal com afropolitan complicating the poverty porn claim what i would like to point out from my reading of this novel is her pronounced ambivalence about the depiction of africa as a monolith of suffering she both speaks generally of africans in how they lived and complains about it when people in america do it the woman at the wedding jim at the store and eliot perhaps both of these things can coexist because she is really trying for something slightly more universal if you will in how they left the story of diaspora i might ask what happens to critiques of imperialism and neo imperialism in her approach though fictional of the push factors for migration in the age of market globalism where are the critical teeth in post postcolonial texts considering how she deals with problematic depictions of africa it is also quite clear that she is both subtly critiquing and exploring what might drive poverty porn regarding female circumcision for one in this film contains some disturbing images how could alexis recommend a video depicting ritual genital mutilation to kristal what kinds of things are these girls subjecting themselves to through the internet why do they watch it there may also be some queer theory at work here that also needs to be analyzed but i will leave that for another time to read more carefully against the binary she is accused of creating that africa is terrible and america is great which is pretty ridiculous from the way i read it there are constant parallels she brings up between paradise michigan for example hitting budapest and hitting crossroad writing on the wall of her bedroom and on the durawalls of budapest games they played in paradise countries syria is out more specifically in the game finding bin laden the dog who betrayed his master is killed in the same chapter in which uncle kojo announces bin laden has been killed is this the neo imperialism critique i am looking for if so she gets into the kind of critical territory i was discussing earlier the children critique the adult world wars in and between nations are seen as deadly games finally this is a world where the names for things indicate uneasiness with their ability to contain what is being described the same words and names are used to identify disparate experiences or may be considered ironic neither the language she has to work with nor a traditional plot structure can contain her message so she directly confronts the uncontainable","410":"the topic was very compelling and had am interesting character perspective however i had some difficulty getting beyond the choppy writing style","411":" 3 5 stars the book is split between darling's childhood in zimbabwe and later teenage years in detroit had it been only the former easily 4 stars seeing contemporary zimbabwe through childrens' eyes is a unique perspective and very compelling iparticularly enjoyed the kids mocking portrayal of ngo workers and chinese construction crews vibrantly written even wrenchingly graphic at times but i was much less convinced by the latter part of the novel darling's life in detroit i've happened to pick up a lot of novels recently of african immigrants in the us and found this somewhat trite the surprise of snow and less insightful nuanced in comparison say to americanah or strength in what remains to take two very different examples","412":"have you ever read a book that told your own story so well it seems almost like you whispered the words to the author","413":"great book interesting to see africa from a different perspective","414":"this book was a cliche ridden mess not sure was it was shortlisted for this year's man booker which in my opinion is turning out to be very poor the book improves slightly towards the end but ultimately did not save it from being just awful","415":"poetically written another booker novel thought provoking story and an eye opening look at what it means to be an immigrant","416":"very interesting at times but i never got that invested in darling or any of the other characters there are also some very strange sections that i could have done without e g the lengthy section in which three teenage girls are watching and describing internet porn in vivid detail i listened to this as an audiobook so i did appreciate the narrator's change in accent over the course of the book","417":"noviolet bulawayo's we need new names is a jarring challenging look at one girl's life in mugabe's zimbabwe followed by her relocation to america the protagonist's voice is strong u0026amp unique some of the other characters are fascinating the transition between the two halves of the book the first in zimbabwe the second in america is very jarring in hindsight i think that is intentional to give us a notion of how the protagonist felt when trying to reconcile her old u0026amp new lives","418":" meh meh this book did very little for me for context i enjoy books with realistic speech dialogue strong and dramatic family ties strife betrayal beautiful turns of phrase and characters who get under my skin in the best and worst ways this book had almost none of any of this i really preferred the character driven first half set in africa as soon as darling steps foot on u s soil it gets flat out boring even the first half though didn't keep me on the edge of my seat or reveal anything significant about the characters also maybe i'm a little bitter but that whole scene where darling laughs in an anorexic teenager's face and fights the urge to kick a small dog i said to myself there's an unlikable protagonist and then there's just a 'bad press is good press' mentality","419":"i give five stars to a lot of books but this one really touched me on a deep level beautiful exploration of the african immigrant experience told from a young girl's perspective on identity war violence diaspora and assimilation into a new country such an honest painful and lovely story that goes straight to the heart","420":" within the pages of we need new names author noviolet bulawayo makes an unusual choice she never identifies its setting--any one of a number of african countries--by name yet in this debut novel nothing supersedes the theme of one's native land indelibly and uniquely shaping its people's shared identity perhaps she hesitates to name it with wisdom knowing readers might be too heavily weighted by their own preconceptions to appreciate the beauty that can unexpectedly grow out of unfavorable circumstances not until the acknowledgements does she single it out and of course to zim beloved homeland country of my people i love the affection in this nickname this line in every experience told and in each musing shared by the story's protagonist readers get a glimpse of the authenticity of the author's love for her zimbabwean birthplace darling begins narrating her days as a ten year old surrounded by her closest friends sbho chipo stina and godknows all led by bastard in the fictional town of paradise in her sing songy albeit blunt manner she describes their raw street savvy and seemingly fearless ways playing country game stealing guavas from the neighboring village of budapest to fend off hunger vying for cheap trinkets from passing lorries and processing the political turmoil around them they hadn't always defecated behind the bush before political upheaval and bulldozers forced their community into shanties darling remembers her family's brick home having boasted separate bedrooms and a roof tall enough so family members needn't bend over to walk through it but the children's ability to nevertheless endure and create a spirited childhood for themselves shows how imagination sprouts in even the harshest of environments they face the ravaging effects of the sickness aids they witness the entitlement and brutality of blak sic power meanwhile darling dreams of the pop culture promises and riches in america's destroyedmichygen she finally gets her chance to go quickly the fantasy shatters bitter snow and drive by shootings the harsh reality of having expired visas means no scholarships no real jobs and no respect it seems as if every place must be polarized by the haves and have nots those in paradise versus budapest the blacks versus the whites those in africa versus america those who are legal versus illegal it might be shocking for some readers to learn of chipo's pre teen pregnancy caused by her grandfather or that her friends naively try to help her relieve herself of it through a mixture of voodoo and a coat hanger while in zimbabwe similarly darling can hardly fathom an american toddler's inability to respond to nonverbal cues like the look she gives to insist he behave when she instead slaps him party goers respond by gawking in alarm at her socially inappropriate reaction these moments remind us of our mutual ignorance as when darling's american peers refer to her birthplace as \"back there \" lumping all the african countries together as if they were one devoid of any distinguishing characteristics can readers find respect when they cannot draw upon a shared experience not only does bulawayo choose evasiveness for her book's setting but also in having selected a pen name in place of her given name elizabeth tshele still she gives readers glimpses of herself in we need new names maybe readers will even catch the reference to bastard's cornell t shirt tied around his head honoring bulawayo as an alumna she peppers darling's speech with her native language untranslated and its richness brings the immigrant experience to life bulawayo bites off a lot in this book incest alcoholism mental health class warfare eating disorders puberty hunger bullying immigration and civil wars to begin the list ultimately she reminds readers to take pride in their culture and to show tolerance in lieu of ignorance toward others when the experiences that make up our formative years no matter how good or bad expected or shocking surely differ","421":" i always like a young protagonist but i don't always enjoy a foreign setting that is so different from what i know this took place in zimbabwe for the first half in which we find darling playing and stealing guavas with her friends in the second part she is living with an aunt in detroit and the book becomes about an immigrant's experience it is based on some of the author's experiences i liked this book and i really liked the discussion that the genrex had i was coincidentally reading another zimbabwe book at the same time a memoir don't let's go to the dogs tonight by alexandra fuller so this increased my enjoyment and appreciation for we need new names","422":"we need new names is more of an experience than a story bulawayo captures her young protagonist's voice and perspective with such precision that each chapter is almost photographic in its clarity the book is divided into two parts one in zimbabwe the other in the us one a photo the other the negative","423":"when a country disintegrates it breeds a set of writers who bring to us the stories of wars the political disintegration the running away to greener pastures and the impact of the rootlessness no violet ticks the right boxes so there are all the tell tale signs of her childhood home razored to dust leaving her friends tasting the dream the future called us of america and how the dream turns bitter and salty on her tongue yet she fails to tug at my heart few issues with the book it runs in montages and stops being fiction and sometimes becomes essays stories are left incomplete and no story is complete to a reader like me unless you furnish the details and finally we have heard the stories before and from great writers from the content who say it with more detail more emphasis and far more assuredness yet a very promising writer and someone who has a lot of great writing in her hell she is a writer born in 1981 so here's to many more","424":"the author's childhood in zimbabwe during a revolution is filled with games fear uncertainty loss displacement refugees death laughter and adventure then america attempted assimilation culture shock where school shootings are reminiscent of the civil war she left and a longing for home","425":"this book was easy to read and also masterfully written a book for children or adults and full of truths read for an immigration story from zimbabwe to michigan and also for an insightful look at america from the perspective of a child from another country it's a novel but touches on the serious from racism to global poverty and also teenage growing pains recommended","426":"wowthis novel starts with a bangusing simple sentence construction but powerful word choices i have been thrust into the heart of zimbabwe with children dealing with the aftermath of political turbulencein the opening scenes you can connect with the feeling of betrayal that the starving have as we carelessly waste foodnow page 07 of 298 each vignette the author tosses off is shared matter of fairly but is devastating when you step back from being engaged with these particular children you can see how revealing the events are they show the human side of despair betrayal hopelessness through the eyes of children who have only the vaguest notion is life in a real country","427":"surely one of the weakest booker finalists ever","428":"i loved reading this book bulawaya is a wonderful writer the young narrator simply had the most exciting similes of any narrator i can think of i hope having read this book brought me closer to those who have left their homeland out of necessity we need new names is about a girl from zimbabwe who flees to the u s it is shocking brutal funny truthful raw and delightful i can't wait to see what she's going to write next recommend for upper high school and beyond","429":"one of the most beautiful books i have read in a long time bulawayon captures the tone and cadence of a young girl growing up half wild in a ravaged slum in zimbabwe darling is by turns hilariously funny and breathtakngly acute in her estimation of the grownup world running with her gang from a settlement called paradise they steal guavas from the lush trees of budapest a more upscale suburb they play ingenious games the country game is a perfect child mirror of the reality of first world and third world an finding bin laden is fun only up to a point then it becomes a bore eventually darling is plucked out of this world and travels to the us to live with her aunt in destroyed michigan and isn't that an apt misunderstanding of a foreign name the remainder of the book follows darling as she settles into a new home new realities and remembers but cannot recapture home home there are parts of this book that are so acute so perceptive so beautiful the reader is stopped in her tracks wondering at such a soul","430":"the writing is powerful witty strong and full of verve the uneasiness of living in a paradise amidst terror is poignantly told with an unusual flair the zimbabwean portions of the novel were sheer genius and in comparison the american segments were a little cliched another painful immigration story but quite brilliant in its own way","431":"excellent story beautiful and unique language and the exploration powerful ideas this book carried me away and swept me along at an alarming speed i recommend","432":" i can't quite recall where i first heard about this book but i have been hearing about it a lot lately i discovered that we need new names is definitely not being over hyped it is awesome this is probably the first work of africa related contemporary fiction i've read since achebe's things fall apart in high school and it made me feel like i've been missing out on something profound and interesting this book is beautifully written it is just full of amazing imagery i'm not inclined to gush about such things but as i was reading this book i just wanted to drink up all the language and become drunk from it because it was so heady even though the story is told from the point of view of a child the language isn't necessarily puerile darling the narrator doesn't use lots of sophisticated language but her thoughts are really succinct and what she says makes the reader picture everything for example when speaking about the heat she says \"the sun keeps ironing us and ironing us and ironing us \" which is something i can relate to with the heat wave happening at the moment in another chapter darling is watching a funeral and comments of the cemetery \" it is mounds and mounds of red earth everywhere like people are being harvested like death is maybe waiting behind a rock with a big bag of free food and people are rushing tripping over each other to get to the front before the handouts run out that is how it is the way the dead keep coming and coming \"not all the imagery is morbid of course but this example stood out to me because it's such a mature observation even though it is rooted in kid logic as to the plot which is i suppose what people want to hear about in a review the book is told from the perspective of darling a girl who lives in paradise--a shanty town in zimbabwe her observations about life are folded in among vignettes of playing with her friends bastard godknows shbo stina and the pregnant chipo darling dreams of moving to america a place where everyone has enough food and is rich and she knows that one day she will because her aunt fostalina lives there the second part of the book focuses on darling's life in america specifically in \"destroyedmichygen\" and how she copes with the reality of living in the us works through her identity and relates to others the result is both a poignant view of life in modern zimbabwe and of the immigrant experience in america the first half of we need new names made me realize how little i know about zimbabwe specifically and africa in general from the way the story is told the reader can gather that zimbabwe used to be ruled by a king but then it was taken over by white colonialists the colonialists were eventually ousted by the native black people who were then deposed by another group of black people that is an extremely rudimentary understanding but clearly this isn't a book about politics or history it's about one person's experience in zimbabwe i feel like i should be able to at least put names on some of these movements or governments but i don't have any in my head i think that reading up on modern african history is definitely going to be on my to do list the second half of the book was in a way more relatable just because i am american and darling's experiences were easier for me to digest even though they were through the eyes of someone new to the country i briefly taught english as a second language when i was a teacher so i was able to appreciate some of the observations about learning or improving more accurately english in one scene aunt fostalina is on the phone trying to order something from victoria's secret but she is not being well understood darling comments about how you can practice what you want to say beforehand but the words still come out wrong concluding \"english is like a huge iron door and you are always losing the keys \" this is such an amazing way to conceptualize all language learning but especially english learning something incidental to the story but that i really liked is the concept of a \"talking eye \" essentially this is when you look at someone in a way that says something like when a little dog wearing a pink jacket tries to get attention from darling and she gives it a talking eye that says \"no dog you don't even know me like that \" or you could give a talking eye that says \"don't even think about it \" or \"get over here \" bulawayo has managed to name something i didn't know i needed a word for we need new names is stuffed with observations about life both in zimbabwe and in america i really enjoyed bulawayo's take on the world and i feel like my worldview has definitely been expanded which is the point of reading in the first place there is a lot more in this book that i haven't discussed because i know i can't just talk about a whole book but if anyone who has read it would like to discuss it with me i would love to talk about it i will definitely be keeping my eye out for future works by noviolet bulawayo what should you read after you've finished we need new names here are some things i am thinking of picking up that have similar themes americanah by chimamanda ngozi adichie seems to be focused on immigration in a similar way to bulawayo's work but centers on a teenage couple from nigeria the woman in the couple manages to immigrate to america but the man is unable to do so adichie won the 2002 caine prize for african writing for one of her previous novels a contellation of vital phenomena is the debut novel of anthony marra this story is set in chechnya another place i don't know enough about the fear robert mugabe and the martyrdom of zimbabwe by peter godwin looks to be a pretty solid work on the modern political situation in zimbabwe if like me you know want to know more about zimbabwe this would be a good pick to read more reviews visit digitalmanticore com","433":"thoroughly enjoyed this book although it's not always a likable story at times the writing style is a little hard to follow but it works for this book story although not a big book in terms of length it's huge in terms of what it has to say","434":"how do you call a book about violence crime and crumbling nations repetitive by starting a review with that question there was nothing new about this it was the same atrocities to emigration story seen over and over again and it had nothing unique in terms of voice structure or content it was intelligently written but that's not enough to make darling's story stand out be engaging be memorable as others reviewers have shared just because a book isn't bad doesn't mean it's good no matter the topic","435":"i read and share books on www appraisingpages com check us out for giveaways bookish apparel and more what i love the most about a book is when i really truly learn something from it i love how books can inspire compassion in me and hopefully in others too by how they expose you to other people other countries other cultures etc i hope my kids enjoy reading for this reason i want them to be non judgmental loving and accepting of all kinds of people and i think reading can show you other worlds you wouldn't encounter without them some books that make this list for me include the fault in our stars by john green i will never say trite cliched things to a person with cancer or any other illness again sisters in sanity by gayle forman troubled teens are troubled for a reason get to the bottom of it instead of mindlessly punishing them and the glass castle by jeanette walls this book did this for me in a way i didn't see coming it taught me not to pity or condescend to someone foreign specifically someone from perhaps a more poor culture or country in this novel darling is born and grows up in zimbabwe until around 14 when she moves to the united states to live with her aunt and uncle even while she is in zimbabwe she sees the invisible children and save darfur workers cock their heads when she laughs and plays with her friends the unicef workers her drop off food and take pictures only to leave when she moves to the united states it only worsens she loves her culture as different as it may be but immigrates to a place that pressures her to disown it she feels expected to be thankful for the bountiful food which she is but she also misses hunting for guavas with her friends to fill their starving bellies she quickly finds out that her childhood is assumed to be only one of war torn child soldier roots when although it wasn't easy is far from the truth she learns that the discipline style of her country that taught children the wisdom of their grandparents is considered abuse in the united states when she tells strangers about where she's from she gets only a oh you poor thing how very awful for you i'm sure you are so glad to be here and away from that awful awful country in response the thing i learned about culture from this book is that it is always a part of you the good and the bad and that growing and changing doesn't have to mean leaving the bad behind you can fully embrace it as a part of your childhood a part of your life and do so with pride she craved those guavas after a few years in bitter cold michigan she missed the sound of her friend's cackling laughs so much it hurt she was tired of the confusing and exhausting ways americans acted happy and polite all the time when they didn't mean it she was tired of bottling her emotions inside instead of the loud and passionate expressions of her country the second to last chapter is a total masterpiece i wish i had this as an e book so that i could copy and paste it here it read like an essay on reclaiming yourself it should be required reading for humanity truly beautiful and really brought the message behind the novel home i will never ever condescend to someone from a different country regardless of how impoverished or foreign its stereotypes may be funny thing is that this chapter is also what kind of threw the book off for me and is causing me to give it 5 stars on goodreads instead of 4 it spliced the novel and took me out of the stories and away from the characters i almost wish that she had sprinkled the sentences from this essay throughout the novel for the story's sake although it works so powerfully altogether as well i guess i'm being fickle","436":" i really enjoyed this book in fact it could have won the booker if luminaries hadn't come out in the same year and both first books very impressive i enjoyed her style of writing each chapter held a small story of her life within the whole overall story of her life and i am sure a lot of it was autobiographical i also like the theme of a immigrants identity and how that identity changes externally when they immigrate but not internally she makes a lot of references to the materialistic values of americans compared to her previous life of poverty back in africa which i felt was an important theme that i haven't seen explored much previously in new fiction this book is actually filled with a lot of complex themes which made it 4 star for me enjoy","437":"simultaneously grim and lyrical contemplation of home and displacement","438":" written from the perspective of a 10 yr old girl in south africa this book spans several years she begins as a child playing silly games with her friends she's poor but doesn't realize it she eventually emigrates to america where she struggles to find her place that premise has so much potential yet the story falls flat the writing is stream f consciousness style and very difficult to follow because of that i had a hard time understanding and getting to know the characters and never had an empathy for their struggles the story seemed to just sort of end without the typical components that mark a good plot flat is the best way i can think of to explain he arc of the story or i suppose the lack of an arc","439":" i really loved the voice or rather voices in this book and i think that's what made it a page turner for me i'd definitely consider it one of my favorite books that i've read in the past year in fact i loved every second of reading it as i'm wont to do with any book that laughs in the face of objectively unfunny situations it did leave me wanting more though it tiptoes around too many themes for 290 pages if the second half was a sequel to the first half as opposed to being contained within the same book it might have been perfect","440":" powerful but uneven book about a girl growing up in zimbabwe during the economic political collapse during the first decade of the 21st century and then immigrating to the united states some of the chapters were so much stronger and more immediate than their surrounds that i have to assume they were published separately in magazines or something before the novel came out the scene with the girls trying to solve the problem of chipo's stomach was genuinely terrifying i recommend and i'm excited to see what her next novel will be like","441":"reviewed excerpts of the novel here https douaparale wordpress com 2014","442":"noviolet bulawayo writes about what it is to lose one's home as well what it is like to leave one's home for better opportunities elsewhere using language that is often poetic bulawayo shows us the joys of having little when you have friends and a supportive community and the difficulty of living in as an immigrant in a country like america","443":"i guess the book is an analogy for the depressing life style that is in africa however life in american does not seem much better the writing style drags and there is one horrific incident after another when the protagonist gets out her life changes is it for the better who knows i did not enjoy this book","444":"great to listen to on audiobook i feel that the voices accents and pronounciation of names added so much depth to this novel darling has a deeper connotation of the word country than i have ever encountered and i had a very empathetic response to this she uses the word country so frequently but in unexpected places and her analogies are so very relatable while the novel seemed to not have a strong plot line her painting of the world in which she lives is beautiful","445":"provocative and thought provoking not one of these books that one reads and easily leaves behind and forgets still not sure about the african first half but the american is terrific in my private 2013 booker challenge wnnn tops in the moment","446":"a fiction that gives an insight into the lives of people in ruined zimbabwe the childhood part of the book is wonderful and descriptions are vivid the american side not so much","447":" i really liked this book and it's going to be the first i recommend to a friend if said friend were to ask why are you always on about all the great novels by african and african diaspora authors and i'd be all read _we need new names_ because it's really really good and then they'd totally agree with me it is a series of connected vignettes that tell deep emotional truths about poverty inequality and immigration i'm currently teaching a unit on immigration and my class recently got into a discussion about how immigration can be so so painful i could easily include some of the later chapters in we need new names as examples","448":"this novel is told from the viewpoint of a young girl growing up in mugabe's zimbabwe later the action moves of all places to kalamazoo","449":"really strong at the start but it fizzled out and went totally scatterbrained once the character came to america bulawayo is clearly a talented writer but the magnitude and complexity of what she wants to say is well beyond the scope of this book for sure and may well be beyond her current writerly abilities this territory was mined much more effectively by chimamanda ngozi adichie's americanah and i highly recommend that book instead","450":"did not realize when i started this book that part of it would be set in kalamazoo that would prove to be an added bonus the author provides a sense of what a huge shock it would be to move from zimbabwe to michigan especially as a child it was interesting to contrast with americanah","451":"i would have stopped reading this book if i was not stuck on a delayed flight the story of darling a 10 year old girl living in africa who has no idea what a miniature dog is yet knows paris hilton and paparazzi really the story could have been interesting but the writing was choppy there was little character development and in the end it was boring","452":"darling is a transplant from zimbabwe come to live with her aunt in michigan i found her perspective on both her original culture and america intriguing this book left me wanting to learn more about zimbabwe which i have now been reading about i forget how good we have it here and yet still become occupied with trivial things and carry around an air of entitlement","453":"powerful story of how life for 10 year old darling transitioned from colonization to freedom to life after paramilitary police destroyed the supposedly good life in zimbabwe a story of displacement hunger and escape from a homeland to a land of abundance and opportunity america with a new set of challenges a story of mixed rewards and losses a story that could be applicable to a number of immigrants an eye opener good read","454":"absolutely stunning use of language wakes up what could be a predictable setting and makes this book hard to put down second act in the book had for me a startling change of pace but writer managed to keep it believable can't wait for moire stuff from ms bulawayo","455":" as a passionate fan of the author junot diaz i am interesed in the books he reads and reviews this is one of his recommendations which i thouroughly enjoyed reading over labor day weekend the setting is split between zimbabwe former rhodesia and detroit and chronicles approximately a ten year span of the life of a young woman darling who is 9 when the novel starts the first half of the novel centers on her life in zimbabwe in the early 2000's amidst the backdrop of zimbabwe's deteriation under long time president robert mugabe she runs with a group of colorful friends with memorable names like bastard and godknows the second half of the novel centers on her life in america she has the opportunity to come to the states because her aunt fostalna her mother's sister lives in detroit aka destroyedmichigan like the novels of diaz and jhumpa lahiri this is a novel that explores the benefits challenges and down side to assimilation ultimately what does it mean to leave your home perhaps forever the novel has many zimbabwean cultural references that will drive you to google especially with regard to food some of which you may want to try at home don't miss this one","456":"fascinating funny tragic thought provoking not a huge epic but an absorbing and crystal clear illustration of one african immigrant girl's experience both in her home and after leaving it one of the best this is going on my all time favs list","457":" wonderfully crafted darling u0026amp co live in paradise a zimbabwean shanty town which shot up after their own homes were bulldozed there is grinding poverty hunger charity arsenal google t shirts fgm aids but this is not just about african suffering there is joy and humour the children even chipo pregnant at 11 play the most inventive games and gorge on guava from rich white gardens darling displaced after moving to the usa experiences tragic irony where 'things fall apart' bulawayo's mantra throughout her remarkable debut novel","458":"the first 146 pages of this book make a five star novel the last 144 almost make another this is two stories told by the same narrator at two different ages and in two different countries the second dilutes the power of the first there should be more of a break between them a pause to think before rushing into the next story i would give the whole book 4 5 stars if goodreads allowed fractions the first half of the book is the story of life in modern zimbabwe told through the voice of a ten or eleven year old girl called darling the life is not a good one and there are plenty of very grim incidents but the narration has a light touch and brings out small moments of pleasure and happiness which contrast with the horrific ones it is a masterful piece of writing and story telling with emotional punch it ends with a poetic chapter on leaving the second half of the book is set in the usa where darling is now living with her aunt it feels like a memoir a very good well written one darling's voice is different she is a teenager now and also expresses herself in a more westernised idiom the shanty town she left was ironically called paradise her new life is better in many ways but not the paradise she dreamed of the exile's sense of not belonging in their adopted country is well expressed","459":"noviolet bulawayo's ten year old darling tells her story with all the sassy and vibrant honesty of a young girl who is fully accepting of and in love with the precarious life she is offered growing up largely unsupervised and in a greatly changing zimbabwe when darling moves to the united states readers are treated to an illumining funny heartbreaking and eye opening look at two cultural perspectives on friendship family and consumerism","460":"wow what an enlightening world opening book as captivating and entertaining as it was educational so glad i read it","461":"an amazing first novel bulawayo is a gifted story teller this is fiction but it feels autobiographical the story is narrated by darling at the beginning a ten year old girl living in zimbabwe with her mother and grandmother her father has left for south africa for work and has not returned she prowls around her shanty town paradise with a pack of lively playmates inventing games like \"find bin laden\" and stealing guavas from a nearby community where wealthy whites and africans live in mansions in air conditioned splendor her observations on her life her surroundings her country's political turmoil and american culture are poignant insightful and often very funny eventually darling's aunt fostalina brings her to america... to \"destroyedmichygen \" which turns out to be detroit michigan culture shock ensues... snow people obsessed with being skinny in spite of copious amounts of food smart mouthed teenagers who don't speak proper english children who don't obey their parents people sending their aging parents to be cared for by strangers dogs wearing pink leather jackets and so on as darling grows up and becomes a high school student she begins to assimilate into america but misses her home and her friends in a particularly moving chapter \"how they lived\" darling concisely captures what it is like to come to america as an immigrant and mourns all that has been lost just so very beautifully written i loved darling's inner dialog and narration and her zimbabwean friends just popped off the pages so real you could almost touch them highly recommend","462":"darling is a character who will stay with me for a long time her story of life in zimbabwe and america amazing","463":" this book is told in two parts in africa and in america i found the beginning part in africa the most interesting bulawayo is a very descriptive writer and did an excellent job sucking you in to the world of darling the protagonist at times this story is plain confronting but in such an honest way that it kind of makes you embarrassed that this stuff comes as a shock to you the way bulawayo immerses you in the african culture and the struggles of the country should be commended stark contrast is also achieved once darling moves to america it is done in an effortless way where the way darling tells the story kind of acts to unintentionally illuminate waste and thanklessness that she doesn't recognise from home i think this book is a success and is written cleverly and beautifully","464":" i really enjoyed this book it made me laugh almost cry reminded me of my mother my childhood and she has the words to explain what it feels like for immigrant children when they come to america what they feel about leaving and missing an entire country and all your friends and family to soon not feel you belong she packed a lot into this novel i sometimes wished it didn't move so fast that she would spend as much time on other parts of her life as she did with talking about paradise spoiler alert i was really disappointed in the ending","465":"i felt the book had many good points but it did not hold together coherently i always felt like an outsider looking in slightly lost and trying to keep up with the shifts rather than being able to lose myself in the narrative perhaps those feelings are intentionally invoked and help you to understand how the narrator feels in the united states overall i felt unsatisfied at the end of the book","466":"i really enjoyed this book i'm sure it has been compared to americanah but it's a pretty different read even if it shares some similar threads i liked how each chapter stands almost on its own as a short story capturing an episode in darling's life and moving her narrative forward","467":" this book did not have a nice feeling i don't know what i mean it's like it was written angry or bitter or something i like the subject but the undertones were very negative a great exploration of the dilemma of being voluntarily imprisoned in a country you can't leave not even to go to your parents funeral also the quandary of raising your kids in another culture and being scared of getting arrested for smacking i can relate to that so they turn out like their new culture and don't look after the parents ironic the most painful moment was the phonecall from zim believable worlds collide","468":"you meet darling who is living in poverty but enjoys hanging out with her friends whereby they hunt for food play games get in trouble sometimes and dream of better lives the country is having problems whereby she is relocated to the us with her aunt where her friends and family are left behind which she misses dearly yet notices that this new place she is having a hard time fitting in and meeting new friends first half is a peak into her life in africa the second half is her living in america enjoyed the writing","469":"i really loved the young honest writing style that noviolet bulawayo brought to this for me the enjoyment of this book was not only in the stories and characters but very much in the telling with many zimbabwisms i just made that up to bring it to life just great","470":"i enjoyed reading about the culture i appreciated the authors voice and liked the children until she got to america","471":"i was excited for this book but never really got into it i admired bulawayo's ability to craft such a believable child narrator i think that is very difficult to do especially when that narrator must do two difficult tasks equally well 1 connect me by reminding me of the commonality of all children of how i struggled to navigate growing up in similar ways and 2 to illustrate the incredible fundamental differences between the child i was as a result of my environment and heritage and a child who grew up an impoverished refugee in an african country bulawayo accomplished this there is a moment when darling expresses her confusion at why white people would go a steal a whole country when that is such an obvious and giant thing to steal it is crystal clear child logic moments like those were fantastic additionally i really liked the chapters that switched to 3rd person omniscient they gave needed overview but moreover they provided deep reflection on a wide variety of themes on top of that they were beautifully written poetic plotwise though i wasn't pulled in the plot felt built to purposefully display the themes bulawayo wanted her audience to understand and as a result didn't feel natural","472":"i liked this a lot and couldn't tell if my feeling that it was sometimes disjointed came from my having started it on tape then switched to the print version then finished by listening again over the course of many weeks there were definitely some jarring transitions and changes of voice that were not caused by my add like picking up and putting down but generally very good writing and a worthy addition to my immigrant fiction favorites","473":"the book starts off in zimbabwe with darling and her friends playing in the village and scrumping guavas from the bigger houses to stave off hunger it ends with darling in exile in the us lamenting the fact she can't go back i found it was neither one thing nor the other was it about mugabe's zimbabwe poverty emigration colonialism an interesting 1st novel but a bit directionless","474":"poignant funny tragic story a must read for anyone who grew up or lived in africa i still warn my kids about the tokolosh","475":"3 5 there were some things i really loved about this novel i loved hearing about darling's upbringing and also seeing her thoughts on american upbringing and how it differed from her own one thing i couldn't get behind was her hypocrisy on one hand her friends back home are judging her for leaving and telling her that zimbabwe isn't her country anymore so she experiences that pain then she starts laughing at this girls face for being an anorexic saying that she'll never truly know pain i don't know i just feel really strongly that our problems shouldn't be dismissed just because someone may have it worse that may be a naive and white person kind of pov but i'm sticking with it this was only one thing that bothered me about the book though finding it to be a mixed bag of things i loved and things that i didn't like quite as much","476":"enjoyed the book the language the main character felt submerged in the atmosphere was a little disappointed by the ending but it was a reflection of reality which also made it poignant i would read something by the author again but not the book","477":"3 5 4 this book reminded me of salvage the bones and we were animals two books i loved i was totally immersed in the parts back in zimbabwe and felt darling's ache when she thought of home even if it's not really home for her anymore","478":"this will knock your socks off","479":"good god that was beautiful","480":"very disturbing account of post independence zimbabwe life from a 10 year old girls perspective","481":"loved loved the rhythm of the prose the story flowed swiftly with amazing imagery there was so much crammed into the story and liked how the author picked certain bits to delve into and other bits to just mention in passing the author had many unique and powerful ways of describing the immigrant experience","482":"lovers of afro politan discourse this is a must read","483":"really 3 5 stars but the missing half star is for gratuitous cruelty to dogs fyi","484":"disappointed by this booker short list book while there were some funny and clever lines particularly as one culture is viewed through the eyes of another the random nature of the writing just gets frustrating i wanted to like this book i have great interest and empathy for the victims of the chaos that has been zimbabwe yet the incomplete and jumpy storytelling is just unsatisfying","485":" i thought i was going to be love this book and i did at the beginning the story of darling and her life in zimbabwe was beautifully told in the first half of the book noviolet bulawayo is a gifted writer who drew me into the sadness of darling's life in africa with cleverly created images what i expected from the second half of the book i didn't quite quite get the character's weren't as easy to connect to the abrupt ending was a disappointment but i think the author achieved what she set out to do and i am left with plenty to think about","486":"not an easy read but a very powerful story of a young girl growing up in a zimbabwe shanty town","487":"a book that builds strength with each chapter how we live is especially strong","488":"such an amazing read really bulawayo crafts sentences that are so beautiful it makes you want to cry but not at the expense of a compelling story she's the real deal thank helene for recommending","489":" not sure how to rate it since it was more like an education of abuses than it was a really great story by abuses i mean the abuses of the people of zimbabwe and then of the immigrants who come to america to a land they claim is wonderful and rich but then they work at low wage back breaking jobs killing themselves to send money home to family their country is at one point is related to a bottle once you break a bottle you can't fix it likewise many people thought their country was broken and so they fled to other countries because zimbabwe couldn't be fixed so it was interesting and i picked it to read a novel by an author from zimbabwe and i did it had r rated parts like when darling as a teen in america watches porn but i think part of noviolet's point was that with her aunt her caretaker so busy with 2 jobs and sending more money back to zimbabwe doesn't have time to watch and make sure her niece learns to avoid that","490":"a really interesting take on the immigrants dilemma this time with the narrator transported from a squatter's settlement in zimbabwe called paradise that was anything but to the us some parts were really memorable","491":"it tells a harsh tale of a harsh life but does it e get better by fleeing to a new life in america we are left in no doubt that the u s is as dangerous a place as zimbabwe just differently perceived in the media the tale is not full of literary finery or flowery prose and for my money fails to finish properly but i kind of understand that too as this story has no end however failing to finish a sentence or a statement can be quitesee what i mean","492":"we need new names was nothing that i could have anticipated and it was everything one could wish for when reading contemporary non fiction noviolet bulawayo intrigues with a unique writing style that alternates from the honest observations of her main protagonist 10 year old darling and then spliced in sections that pertain more to the group experience of living in a country where there is political decay civil war and poverty to the extreme she takes both these styles and weaves the tale of darling as she lives in a zimbabwean shanty town called 'paradise' and later as she comes to america to live with her aunt and her auntie's family although it takes you a while to adjust to her writing style lack of punctuation and stream of consciousness mode of expression noviolet bulawayo quickly draws you in with her honest and innocent portrayal of young darling as she navigates the dangerous terrain of the shanty town it's broken people and the constant hunger that plagues her and all her friends the innocence of a child combined with the real desperation of a people suffering from political upheaval and civil breakdown give you such a clear view of exactly who darling is while she and her friends wander the streets and steal guavas from the local gated community populated by affluent foreigners there is so much that breaks your heart for these children they are roaming un monitored since schools have been closed down and they try to think about games to play as they make observations about the world around them and speak about what they will be when they are grown meanwhile darling finally makes it to america and lives with her aunt and 'uncle' and her cousin who was born in the states her adjustment to this new and strange country is described with the true culture shock one might only imagine but observed through darling's eyes it is somehow more real more sad more heartbreaking she is bullied at school has to adjust to using english and at the same time adopt the slang and accent of her peers so as to fit in a huge task for anyone but particularly a young girl coming of age torn from a country she loves and the people and culture she knows it is amazing just how many aspects of her life she is forced to alter yet on the inside she stays the same observant and honest soul this book verges on poetry more often than not no sugar coating there is so much pain expressed about the immigrant experience that i had never really considered as a nurse i have treated patients from all over the world many of them refugees to canada who have very little experience with the language yet these new comers are expected to communicate clearly even during the most stressful of situations and it is hard to find translators in an emergency i never really took all these items into account but now i see that the children they deliver on my obstetrics unit represent so much more than a new baby it gives them a tie to their new home this book will forever change the way i interact with these patients at many points in the novel i found myself wanting to cover my eyes and scream please no please no please no which makes no sense until you read about the horrors and the violence noviolet describes with such startling clarity i won't spoil these parts by describing them but placed next to the innocent and inquiring nature of darling they are than much more shocking this book picks up speed as it rages on and you will have difficulty putting it down bottom line i recommend this novel to anyone who works with new immigrants to america or any other country that takes in refugees and students visa's into it's embrace my eyes were thrown wide open to issues i had never considered and i had a pretty solid idea of how difficult the transitions can be to begin with working in the area of nursing i do obstetrics it is more than a story about a girl's journey to america it is a story about loss true sorrow fractured families and the cruelty of the promise of the american dream there is good and bad in both the before and the after parts of darling's journey but it is her unflinching honesty and manner of observing the world that makes this book such a winner noviolet bulawayo is one to watch a must read for me this review is based on an arc obtained through goodreads first reads giveaways the opinions expressed are my own and are in no way influences by goodreads the author or the publisher of this material","493":"i really wanted to like this book the first half was great but the second half was quite well boring if there was a story or plot i missed it","494":"i flew through this book with my favorite parts being when darling was still in africa and her acclimation to america destroyedmichigan i became a little disinterested in her high school years as i felt she had turned into a bratty teenager which disappointed me based on how i interpreted her character of her younger self the standout chapter was by far how they lived showing the struggle of trying to embrace two cultures at once i enjoyed this story","495":" so this is going to make me sound like a douchebag which is a pretty good sign that i am a douche i guess i liked this book okay and unlike some other readers thought it flowed fine as a novel instead of a series of short stories i think some of the chapters were stronger than others budapest blak power my america and i really enjoyed the intermission like chapters that were titled how they ____ and read in a very things they carried o'brien way butttt especially in terms of the second half i also kind of felt like i'd read this book before not the whole thing but there were whole passages really the parts that discuss the immigrant experience in america that were so similar to americanah and ghana must go which were also published this year and i read this summer and i suppose the similarities across these books means that these experiences are all very true to life but it also means that that same ness kind of divorces the reader from the story i guess i think that the experiences of the nigerian ghanaian and zimbabwean immigrant in america are different especially as people come from different social classes but these three books make them all seem the same it wouldn't be distracting for these to all read similarly if it didn't seem like the point of these kinds of passages is to illustrate how people from disparate places on a continent are all treated like a homogeneous group i really wanted to like this more i guess oh i also really loved how the word zimbabwe was never mentioned discuss among yourselves if you think rhodesia counts not even as an adjective to describe a nationality many other countries were mentioned by name but never darling's own i thought that was a cool stylistic choice","496":"this was a slow starter almost halfway through is when the story begins to take any type of shape the writing goes from choppy to effusive to a pseudo third party expose on assimilation unfortunately even that doesn't draw the story together or involve any of the characters there were some strong underlying themes that the author could have focused on","497":"this read more like a short story collection than a novel to me the chapters could all stand alone these character driven stories were heart breaking but also funny when comedic relief was needed bulawayo does a great job capturing the voice of a child i liked her thoughts on the english language spoken by african immigrants","498":"was ambivalent on first half but the ending is really incredible","499":"i do like it and it reminds me a little of the bluest eye i like the first half of the text in zimbabwean society and the ending the ending","500":"this book is different then from what i usually read but it is beautiful","501":" noviolet bulawayo doesn't present an epic astounding or sweeping work of literature this book's appeal lies in its subtle trickery you will read through heavy themes without feeling overburdened by them you will feel involved sometimes you will laugh with darling and her gang sometimes you will feel like reprimanding them or feel sorry for them and wish you could do something for them or you would simply appreciate being part of them and sharing their sad or silly little secrets this is the magic of writing please see more at http jumabahati blogspot com 2013 1","502":"although the narrator's voice is simple that of a 9 year old child for half of the book it must have been a deceptively hard book to write this book is about zimbabwe immigration america and everything in between written with sharp wit observational skills and real heart i found myself wanting to underline many many passages","503":" did i like it i did more towards the end of the second half as darling grows up and has to real with the feelings of displacement when she is wrenched out of her the world he knows which though it is far from ideal being a dictatorship state isn't altogether unhappy and moved to a not much safer world in the us leaving illegally among other immigrants it feels in part a bit moralistic and like and advert for supporting african charities it develops into a book about trying to forge a new identity and missing the home she left","504":"http www guardian co uk books 2013","505":"what i got most out of we need new names is the fact that even though your country may be being run to the ground and escape is inevitable you never lose that sense of homesickness and your new country never ever feels like home or at least that's how it read to me","506":"i had a false start but on the second go really loved this darling and her friends have such real kid voices real kid concerns real kid confusions being little and mean and loving and adventurous and scared and playful then the teenager feelings diaspora feelings longing and pride and loneliness and responsibility noviolet bulawayo tells these stories so beautifully","507":"this was a book i read by swapping between hardback and audio book which was an interesting experience i may repeat it tries to reflect part of the modern history of zimbabwe in the life of a young girl and it clearly has an autobiographical slant i enjoyed the perspective and the language but i can't say i loved the novel as a whole in trying to cover the vast sweep of life which it did i felt it got swamped by the author's ambition it would have worked so well as a series of separate but thematically linked short stories","508":"this is a book of big ideas hidden inside small slices of life told in deceptively simple language the stories memories are spun in a distinctive voice and style that while disjointed at times is undeniably impressive and the comparisons between a dangerous and poor but happy life in zimbabwe and an unhappy but relatively comfortable life in the us are eyeopening to say the least","509":" spectacular debut novel which shows great promisenoviolet bulawayo's intensely personal debut book we need new names absolutely sizzles with life and colour this is a young african author who shows great promise and i devoutly hope that she will fulfill that promise as this implies we need new names is not fully successful the book began as a set of short stories developed by the author into a narrative which was brought into the world a little prematurely more work should have been done to take from the realm of the short story into that of the novel which should have more direction larger themes and a broader canvas there is still the flavour of the writing workshop here of a writer enchanted by her own newly discovered voice but not knowing quite what to do with it as such the book is a brilliant study of youthful exuberance and sexuality but leaves the reader with a sense of not having gone as far as it should have done the author's very real talent however makes this a five star read and i can't wait to see what comes next a highly entertaining vividly written book recommended to all","510":"not nearly good enough to have made booker list i need more socio political context for much of the african portion of book to have any signifficant story telling power the us portion seems much stronger but still incomplete definitely reads like a 1st novel or novella from author with unrealized potential","511":"i didn't finish this book i wanted to get into it but the subject matter is too heavy for evening casual reading","512":"loved this book","513":"pretty good this isn't really a novel not really it's a collection of short stories that feature mostly the same main character arranged mostly in chronological order maybe that's why it feels like such a fast read i started and finished it in like three days if that doesn't bother you and you want to read about a part of the world that doesn't often get a lot of attention from someone who has lived this experience you should pick this up","514":"loved this book it's always interesting to walk in someone else's shoes especially someone young living in zimbabwe and then in detroit","515":"this was really readable and drew pictures fro a child's perspective in both zimbabwe and usa had a lot in it to make you think but presented in a very matter of fact way will look for more of hers it may have been worthy of a 5 star worth reading","516":" the novel is about a young girl darling and it is set in zimbabwe for about a third of the story and then it moves to detroit where darling emigrates to pursue the american dream at the beginning of the book i am struck by what zades mda complains about in his memoir 'sometimes there is a void' is it entirely necessary to portray african nations and african life in a uniformly negative light is that a fair representation i really don't know the answer to that and mda himself says no that it isn't at all balanced but that is what we have here in this story darling spends her days with her friends stealing fruit from trees to stay fed she has to avoid predatory priests and child prostitution her father is dying of aids and she is witness to the suicide of a stranger who is similarly afflicted her 10 year old friend is pregnant from a rape by her grandfather these may very well represent small village life in sub saharan africa but rather than using fiction to explore the undelying effects this all has on the social fabric it is really just presented and we move on in the story the second two thirds of the book is about the transition to the reality of life in america as compared to what darling thinks it will be in this segment of the story i am reminded of the film 'lost boys of the sudan' where a group of boys in war torn sudan are pulled from a refuge camp and brough the the u s under a church sponsorship they are stunned by the amount that they have to work to be successful in the u s without much in the way of a formal education they are subject to all sorts of barriers but the dream that they had was that it would all be quite easy when in fact the process of climbing the ladder of success is very arduous this book is very well written but i think i would have been happier with the two halves of the story staying separated rather than merged it is the author's first book though and a very strong showing","517":"one of my best reads this year","518":"i listened to the audio version of this book and i am so glad i did the reader and her ability to do what i heard as an authentic accent really drove the story and helped build the characters and their experiences there were scenes in this book that made me want to hit the eject button and escape because they hurt so badly but i did not because in the end i felt like empathizing deeply and having greater awareness is the least i can do","519":"the author's voice is incredible in this novel that tracks the experience of a young girl growing up in zimbabwe and her transition into american culture","520":"no words can describe this book","521":"there are times though that no matter how much food i eat i find the food does nothing for me like i am hungry for my country and nothing is going to fix that 3 5 stars i loved that the kids in the story were typical kids and just adapted to their circumstances and kept on playing their made up games the author definitely has a sense of humour and you can see this in the names she chose for these kids bastard godknows etc but this was still a very dark and unsettling book darling the main character's feelings on moving to america were complex and for me this part of the book was even sadder than the first half the writing was very different from anything else i've read before and although there were many moments of absolute genius for me it was inconsistent this is totally understandable as it was her debut novel and i am looking forward to her next book the story we need new names is the 2013 debut novel of expatriate zimbabwean writer noviolet bulawayo a coming of age story it tells of the life of a young girl named darling first as a ten year old in zimbabwe and later as a teenager in the midwest united states we need new names was shortlisted for the man booker prize 2013 the guardian first book award shortlist 2013 and a barnes u0026amp noble discover award finalist 2013","522":" this book started out very slow for me sadly i know little about the african nations the book takes place in zimbabwe in the recent past my guess is that it is semi autobiographical during the first part of the book which takes place in africa the reader is introduced to a group of children the narrator is one of the children the second part of the book takes place after the narrator immigrated to the u s to live with her aunt the narrator gives deep insights into the feelings of immigrants if you stick with the book you will be rewarded","523":"some books are more literary than others this one was full of literary devices that befit the young narrator i thought the similes in particular were both apt and poetic good story if a bit scattered and an engaging look at identity for a young woman in a completely new country","524":"it was like a collection of essays more than a novel there was no chronological order and i quite liked that you'd get to a point where you think i know darling then the next chapter is about an event years prior and exposes flaws in your understanding of darling because it is added info and more info means more understanding but i don't think we can ever fully understand someone else especially in darling and chipo's last conversation were we learn that even she darling doesn't truly understand herself good easy light hearted yet heavy read it falls under my new favourite genre which adichie calls truth with emotion the ending was a bit disappointing like uhm is that it overall i would recommend this book","525":"no no no what was the point of that it went all over the place after darling got to america and seemed to be more random musings on being displaced from your homeland than any sort of coherent story and the ending wtaf definitely one to avoid in future","526":"a wonderful story of a child growing up in post independence zimbabwe it is a tale of belonging and finding ones place in a pretty unsatisfactory world","527":"i just finished and i can't think of anything else going to ask a friend to speed read so we can discuss it's one of those update i also interviewed noviolet for the los angeles review of books about writing in a child's voice http lareviewofbooks org interview finding her voice an interview with noviolet bulawayomy favorite quote her being a child with no strong ties to our zimbabwean culture meant she simply sneezed zimbabwe out and inhaled america and kept it moving","528":" one of the few books that started slow but really grew on me one of the few that seemed evenly paced all through rather than rushed in the second half one of the few that presents almost a mirror image in two halves with life in africa compared to the one in america evocative descriptions which beautifully and aptly describe the feelings of immigrants in a foreign land universally applicable that they are why not 5 stars because the book didn't have layers and as much depth as i would have liked what you see is what you get no need to put the book down every so often to contemplate on what has been written","529":"rarely and i do mean rarely does a novel come along that actually moves me like this one skipping right to the chase read this book between the stories in this novel and the creative dynamic use of language it was easy sometimes to feel as if i was an onlooker rather than merely a reader looking into other people's lives it's also a timely read at the end of this month elections are scheduled once again in zimbabwe and robert mugabe in power since 1980 is once again a candidate the novel is divided into two parts the first set in zimbabwe and the second in the us the central focus is on a character named darling a young girl who lives with her mother in a tin shack in an area ironically named paradise it hadn't always been so until their entire neighborhood of brick homes was razed out of the blue by bulldozers whose operators were protected by the police she and her family had lived a good life until they were displaced due to policies set in motion by the country's ruler displacement is a major theme in this novel which also deals also with the concept of identity as people move away from their homes in darling's case to the united states and the ties that keep them connected to what they've left behind the first part of the book is comprised of darling's observations about her friends her life and what it's like living in a country where poverty political corruption and betrayal of a cause are day to day realities while the second part takes darling to the us where she lives with her aunt's family and can't return to zimbabwe because of her visa this is not an easy novel to read on an emotional level darling and her friends are hungry and fill their empty bellies by strolling through more affluent neighborhoods and stealing guavas or finding things to sell the schools have closed down the teachers have all left attracted by better pay in other countries and this group of kids spend their days roaming around playing often bizarre games and observing what's going on all around them but for darling there's a way out she is able to make it to the us to the home of her aunt her observations about what it takes to fit into this alien culture reveal painful adjustments and provide a way for darling to examine her zimbabwe life but as time goes on she comes to the painful realization that while she can stay connected with people in zimbabwe via the internet and phone she finds it harder and harder to stay connected with them on a more meaningful level it's hard to explain this feeling it's like there's two of me one part is yearning for my friends the other doesn't know how to connect with them anymore as if they are people i've never met i feel a little guilty but i brush the feeling away while she tries to fit in with her new friends and her new life she constantly alters different aspects of her outward life while remaining an honest observer of what's going on all around her in her new home a lot of it plainly and simply is not pretty either in her native home or the one she's come to there's so much more to this book that but above all the language the author employs here makes you feel less like a reader and more of an onlooker there are some sections in this novel that are incredibly difficult to read but the ugly realities are not the main focus here it's more a case of living in altered realities at particular moments in time and how people adapt and the costs of doing so for me the first part of this novel absolutely sings and stuns at the same time and though the second half continues darling's astounding honesty in her observations for the most part i just didn't find it as compelling as the scenes in zimbabwe i also have to admit to being worried about the author choosing a young girl as the voice of her narrative but believe me i was relieved to discover that there's no young adult feel to this book at all on the contrary this is very mature territory super book and highly recommended funny but the reviewers who gave this book low ratings seemed to have missed the entire point as in this one from amazon another poverty african story to appease western tastes obviously this person has no clue","530":"the real star of this book is the voice of the narrator darling darling's is a remarkably accomplished and artfully rendered voice beginning as a ten year old in dirt poor zimbabwe its a smart confident voice that understands her world on its own terms plays brilliantly complicated games with her small gang of friends has live dynamics with her friends where within a sentence they'll have rowed tested one another and then be back to being friends and playing again all of that is spot on darling's ten year old's voice is also full of fun humour and a real ten year old's bluntness and selfishness the voice then evolves and develops as we move from zimbabwe to 'destroyedmichigan' here the voice is getting older its a bit lonely a bit isolated but still smart and alert to whats going on around as the voice ages and becomes an american teenager we still have the smartness the awareness of double standards but we also have the teenagers awareness of what can and can't be said and what needs to be done to fit in the problem i had with the book though was the lack of a plot we are getting the story of being in zimbabwe as a child and then being in us as a teenager but the story doesn't really seem to be about that toward the end there are some interesting arguments made about the emigrant's relationship to the homeland the homeland defines the person in the eyes of the new country but the community in the homeland don't feel ownership of the leaver instead that person is defined by their new country this leaves the emigrant in limbo not able to return home and not truly belonging in their new home this is touched on but not developed overall i think perhaps the story is about too much the focus moves too rapidly and never allows the reader to rest on one thing for long enough for it to develop more poignancy or meaning this makes it difficult for the story to end and the ending feels somewhat pulled from the air having said that i would still recommend reading it in order to enjoy the voice of darling the no nonsense smart as a whip and fun loving ten year old","531":"i liked the story told from the point of view of what an immigrant lives in their country u0026amp then when they get to america i don't think i truly got everything the author was trying to say as i'm not really well acquainted to african politics now i know i need to learn more","532":"point of view of a child living in zimbabwe during the wars quite good but missing the little thing that would have made this a superb book","533":"a crisis a struggle to survive from a kids pov and it's powerful 3 5 stars","534":"this book was described to me as telling the story of a young african girl's immigration to the united states and her struggles to become an american so i was a bit surprised when about one half of the book was spent describing her childhood in africa as it turned out this was by far the best part of the book perhaps because i myself was born and bred in the united states i found her descriptions of everyday life in africa much more interesting than those of life in america what i did find utterly convincing was the way bulawayo inhabited her child protagonist and then later in the book the teenager the author has a very unique way of showing the thought processes going on in the heads of her characters such as the child's delight in playing simple games her obsession with food and her occasional defiance of adult authority each scene unfolds from the child's point of view more often than not revealing her incomplete understanding of what is going on in the larger world around her this is incredibly effective in several scenes in the first part of the book when the protagonist and her friends either witness or nearly perpetrate incredible cruelty without actually understanding or being affected by it the author skips a few years in the protagonist's life and presents her as a young teenager already living in america the transition was awkward and left me wondering why there was little to no explanation of how the girl ended up living in michigan the descriptions of difficulties with the simplest things like making oneself understood over the telephone or answering misguided questions about one's country--were well done and were undoubtedly drawn from real life so too the short sections in which she deals with the angst of the exile a fascinating combination of exhilarating triumph look at me i have a home of my own children who are americans and deep sadness never being able to return home watching one's children ignore or belittle traditions from the homeland there are also some telling critiques of american society but overall this entire half of the book felt more preachy than enlightened long passages about teenaged girls' obsession with clothes and porn seemed to serve little narrative purpose and the ending was strangely difficult to understand so i am glad i read this but for a more compelling--and nonfiction--take on africans in exile in america i would highly recommend rescuing regina by josephe marie flynn i listened to this as an audio book read by robin miles she did a fantastic job of doing all kinds of different accents very nuanced wonderful performance","535":"amazing bulawayo nailed the voice of darling the plot is interesting though it kind of drifts a bit in no subtle way outlining certain political elements especially the end geez","536":"so damn good stories left me laughing and shaking alternately powerful","537":"this is probably the only novel that i have read that has had the pov of a child but written for adults and oh boy did that have a strong impact on me as this is a novel that we are studying at school i have been forced to analyze it more than i would have otherwise and am i ever glad that we are intensely analyzing it as without doing so i would have never realized how amazing and impactful this book is","538":"this review might be a little spoilerishy look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same when i started we need new names i was immediately enchanted by the main character darling and her gang of friends as they made a raid for guavas on the relatively rich town of budapest they stuffed their empty bellies full of the stolen fruit despite knowing that it would lead to painful constipation i later learned that this opening chapter was originally a short story hitting budapest that won the 2011 caine prize for african literature for noviolet bulawayo no doubt richly deserved despite their hunger and their tin shacks and their ratty clothes and the fact that their school had been closed some time before the preteen friends accept their lot make up games and dream of emigrating to south africa or dubai or america these children aren't innocents one of them is pregnant the result of a grandfather raping her and they are hyper aware of american celebrity culture and how to manipulate western volunteers what we really want to do is take off and run to meet the lorry but we know we cannot last time we did the ngo people were not happy about it like we had committed a crime against humanity...they just like taking pictures these ngo people...they don't care that we are embarrassed by our dirt and torn clothing that we would prefer they didn't do it they just take the pictures anyway take and take we don't complain because we know that after the picture taking comes the giving of gifts as an aside i was surprised that this ngo gave the children toy guns i know when we have packed a shoebox before for operation christmas child there were explicit instructions to not include war toys as it might be traumatising this also made me pause and think since i have seen the pictures sent back to the classrooms that show the smiling children opening their gifts it never occurred to me that they might resent having their picture taken that their dignity might have been too high a price to pay for dollar store pencils and toothbrushes in a later chapter darling remembers how she and her mother had lost the nice brick house they had been living in the events that had forced them to construct a shack in paradise the men knock down our house and ncane's house and josephat's house and bongi's house and sibo's house and many houses knockiyani knockiyani knockiyani men driving metal metal slamming brick brick crumbling...when the bulldozers finally leave everything is broken everything is smashed everything is wrecked it is sad faces everywhere choking dust everywhere broken walls and bricks everywhere tears on people's faces everywhere gayigusu kicks broken bricks with his bare feet and rips his shirt off and jabs at the terrible scar running across his back and bellows i got this from the liberation war salilwelilizwe leli we fought for this facking lizwe mani we put them in power and today they turn on us like a snake mpthu and he spits musa's father stands with his hands in his pockets and does not say anything but the front of his trousers is wet little tendai points at him and laughs on one of their guava raids from their perch high in a tree the friends watch as a gang of weapon waving young men all the time chanting africa for africans confront the wealthy white owners of the home and garden no you listen the white man says like he didn't just hear the boss warn him about telling black men to listen i am an african he says this is my fucking country too my father was born here i was born here just like you even though they had watched the gang punt a little dog out of the yard enter and destroy the home and lead the couple away against their will darling and her friends go into the house and make a game out of using their things and eating their food and answering their phone they are always capable of regarding the violence around themselves with a detached interest and i found many instances of this to be deeply touching from straightening a coat hanger to get rid of the pregnant girl's stomach even though they don't quite know what to do with it to pretending to beat one of the boys to death after secretly watching the funeral of a political activist when a westerner with a camera who has been filming them asks what kind of game is that one of them replies this is no game it's life perhaps most affecting is when darling's father finally returns from south africa father comes home after many years of forgetting us of not sending us money of not loving us not visiting us not anything us and parks in the shack unable to move unable to talk properly unable to anything vomiting and vomiting jesus just vomiting and defecating on himself and it smelling like something dead in there dead and rotting his body a black terrible stick i come in from playing find bin laden and he is there although he is supposed to be kept a secret darling's friends enter her shack and immediately show compassion with songs and touches to someone whom they recognise as dying of aids in the first half of we need new names darling and her friends are smart and funny and can dream of richer lives without feeling sorry for themselves i could admire them without pitying them and i really felt like i was getting a glimpse at an african or at any rate a zimbabwean childhood but in the second half of the book darling finally joins her aunt in detroit and the american dream turns out to be not what she had expected there is snow and gunshots and an obese cousin who plays video games all day her aunt is obsessed with being skinny and is exercising any time she isn't working which is two jobs so she can afford to send money back home with her new friends a nigerian and an african american darling watches porn and for no good reason a video of a young girl suffering a female genital mutilation ceremony and whereas she used to be charming and resilient darling is now flat and doesn't really react to what's going on around her years pass and darling continues to be disconnected and i was disconnected from her things felt less real in the american half of the book it felt cliche to have the daughter of the rich man who darling is cleaning for turn out to be an anorexic or when darling confronts her african american friend about the amount of slang she uses kristal replies first of all it's called ebonics and it be a language system but it be our own naamean 'coz we ain't trynna front i didn't buy for a minute the use of the word ebonics by this teenage character by the end of we need new names darling starts to realise that she would have been better off staying in zimbabwe that hiding out illegally in the us after letting her visitor's visa expire like so many of her compatriots and working night and day to improve the lives of the family she left behind who are now asking for satellite dishes instead of care packages is no life at all i can't argue with that conclusion if the author believes it she certainly portrayed darling as happier and more herself when she was in her real home but this book was so uneven to me that i couldn't fairly compare the two halves of darling's life they seemed to have happened to different people i wanted to give this book its proper context and have been looking at zimbabwe and mugabe and seeing what others have had to say about we need new names i was intrigued by these two reviews one from the guardian which discusses whether noviolet bulawayo is guilty of writing the caine prize aesthetic the guardianand this one from new zimbabwe that found the second half of the book to be more profound new zimbabweif we need new names had ended as strongly as it began it would have been one of my favourite books of the year as it is as can be seen by my lack of passages from the second half if nothing else it screeched to a halt and left me wanting","539":"darling is a precocious 10 year old girl who grows up in zimbabwe with her friends their daily lives revolve around games they make up stealing guavas from richer neighborhoods and vague memories of her father before he went off to south africa to find work she knows she will go off to america at some point to live with her aunt fostalina and there she will live a glorious life where she will never be hungry or poor again the innocence of the child is brought sharply in contrast against the background of the ruthless paramilitary aids and the shocking truth behind a friend's pregnancy but when darling arrives in america she learns that the life of an immigrant is not a bed of roses homesick but unable to return because she came on a visitor's visa she takes part time jobs after school to help with expenses for many like her dreams of being a doctor an engineer a lawyer or an accountant fizzle rapidly when they realize they can't afford college fees they work to send money back to build homes for the families they left behind and hide the truth from those who will come over in the next wave a sad and wearying tale of one girl forced to grow up in conditions beyond her control but who never loses sight of who she is and what she will do to survive","540":" the first half of this novel is set in paradise a shantytown in zimbabwe in 2008 it relates the adventures of a small group of children through the eyes of darling a ten year old girl it consists of a series of vignettes dealing with different aspects of their lives each is rich in descriptive language and is like a miniature painting taken all together they form a stark often disturbing but somewhat colorful mural in the second part of the story darling has left paradise and immigrated to michigan where she lives with her aunt these are her teenage years again there are short chapters that seem almost like a collection of related short stories then there is a shift the first person singular voice changes to \"we\" and the narrator is no longer telling her own story just a few pages earlier she was deploring the fact that her employer lumps all people from africa as one people now she herself is using the collective \"we\" to include not only all immigrant africans but also all the other immigrant groups this larger picture of inferring the general immigrant experience from the story of one individual is overdone i felt as if she were drilling it into me the sermon was too long and repetitive she did not trust me to read her story and draw my on conclusions as to its broader meaning however the rest of the book was so good that i feel comfortable in recommending it and look forward to seeing more from this author","541":"we need new names is quiet funny beautiful shattering story of village girl who is lucky enough to immigrate to america the writing is skillful growing with the narrator as she ages from childhood the early chapters made me laugh and cringe recounting my trips to rwanda as that white ngo worker with a camera and i have never read such a heart rending take on the duality of immigrant life as in the latter pages of this book highly recommended","542":"this was one of the most disjointed books i've ever read the ending was awful and made no connection to the beginning or middle interesting characters but they were never completed","543":" this was a genuinely moving book half set in zimbabwe half in the united states about african immigration rootlessness homesickness and loss the narrator darling starts out with a child's perspective on the deteriorating situation in her country she is surrounded by her friends always embarking on danger tinged adventures in which reality and make believe are often mixed up while the lives of the adults in her world are crumbling around her later in the book she emigrates on her own to the us to live with an aunt and as she grows up she begins to realize all that she has left behind and the perpetual in betweenness of the migrant condition the contrast between childhood and the gradual awareness of the adult realm is well realized and the novel contains some stunning passages","544":"bulawayo's book is beautiful some of the vignettes are devastating and haunting others are funny and vivid i'm excited for whatever she has in store next","545":"very moving story written from the perspective of a young girl living in a shanty town in zimbabwe while her living conditions worsen every day she and and the gang of her friends remain c hildren who play like children anywhere while hunger sickness especially aids poverty and exploitation rage around them the schools are closed no violet knows what she is descbribing she also knows the jargon these kids use when in the end the girl emigrates to the u s a she has no guarantee for a happy life there as she is cut off from her roots very impressive nove","546":"passages of stunning and awe inspiring brilliance but just misses a perfect score from me by packing in too many ideas leaving some subjects the diaspora home sickness and rejection too lightly touched fantastically readable","547":"fast engaging read i had trouble embracing the child's first person narrative for 300 pages and i would have liked more a of plot it reminded me of a house on mango street though it's probably been 15 years since i read that book so my memory could be off base","548":"a powerful well written book that grew on me as i read darling is coming of age as an african immigrant in michigan a good perspective of the immigrant experience as a young adult","549":" darling and her friends live in a fictional place called paradise in africa which is poverty stricken unlike its name the children enjoy a life of adventure and mischief and all of them dream of staying in an actual paradise of a developed country darling has hopes to go to america and live a 'good' life what she loses in the bargain and what she gains is for us to find out perhaps bulawayo should not have tried to deal with so many themes political turmoil aids ngos at africa white africans not welcome anymore in africa immigrant experience child abuse etc etc at the same time the staggering burden of the themes often dissuaded my interest along the course of the book at certain points it began to feel like 'yet another immigrant story' so often written in contemporary literature there were portions that i immensely enjoyed and there were some chapters that felt very boring which made my overall rating of the book go down however i would still recommend this book because the language is lovely and bulawayo has exposed so many harsh realities in a 'white world'","550":"a charming powerful story but i'm not sure it has anything special to put it above and beyond other similar immigrant stories","551":"a child to teen witness of an unnamed colonised africa country its independence and life in america as illegal immigrants the narration is descriptive and shockingly graphic there are some funny moments which remind me 'ah they are children and immediately made me extremely sad it is a page turner and rings certain familiarity for me being an outsider living in a foreign country","552":"#weneednewnames had me laughing out loud and remembering bits of my childhood that were so far gone took me back to a time where saying 'you are not my size' made you feel major and adding 'and what what' at the end of a sentence explained everything great read would highly recommend it especially to my 263 connects","553":"i loved this book i felt like i was with darling playing games with her friends i felt like i was with her when she arrived in america all in all a great story that was told like a song goodreads giveaway book","554":"very poignant in some places disturbing in others overall a powerful picture of a life and country in turmoil before the main character comes to america as a refugee the author has the ability to capture some very deep powerful thoughts about the turmoil refugees go through in her amazing ability to use words in unique ways to paint a touching picture","555":" much to my shame and despite my interest in africa i have very little exposure to african authors most of what i've read is along the lines of michela wrong jeff sachs and other well meaning white foreigners so it was with enthusiasm that i picked this up to start filling an important deficit in my reading all too often stories about africa emphasize poor africa full of corruption wars and atrocities committed against women and children it's too easy to forget that africa is made up of people especially children who focus simply on their day to day activities this book is about one child growing up in africa with the political catastrophes aids and other injustices in the background the book focuses on darling and her group of friends as they grow up in a town in zimbabwe looking for guavas playing find bin laden and watching the adults interact it reminds you that africa and here i am committing the unforgivable act of putting so many different tribes and cultures into a single africa bucket is more than the constant troubles we see on the news my favorite chapter is how they lived which is an amazing portrayal of what so many immigrants must feel when they first move to america and in and of itself is worth reading","556":"really enjoyed the audio book well written portrayal of two vastly different settings and the complications of immigration u0026amp acculturation","557":"not so sure about the title haha but i liked the book young gal emigrates to the us struggles with life in the us friends and family left behind coming to terms with all of it","558":"super great and such a pleasure to read i laughed loudly on the bus and probably made the morning commuters jealous complex funny descriptive and beautiful","559":" when the story opens 10 year old darling lives with her mother and grandmother in zimbabwe darling like all children has a vivid imagination and loves to play with her friends but the violence and poverty that surrounds them exposes them to fears and pressures that most children never experience when darling goes to america to live with her aunt in michigan she leaves behind physical hunger and many dangers but as her experiences illustrate there are many other kinds of poverty readable and compelling darling's story is beautifully individual but also represents the life of many in zimbabwe and in the african immigrant community in the united states","560":"this book for me was the worst book i have read this year sure it started off as a promising read but somewhere down the line something happened that changed the book from good to worse to worst there are several themes a lot of story line holes and unrealistic stuff that a 10 year old normally would not comprehend it may be because i am prudish but at some point i felt like the book had violated me","561":"the continent of africa is a complex mix of many different countries and situations some marked by hopes some by large challenges and some sadly by extreme despair zimbabwe is one such tragic example i did development work there in the early 1980's soon after independence and was amazed at the optimism and positive energy everywhere among africans so it has been especially shocking for me to see the economic collapse and political chaos that have devastated people noviolet bulawayo has now written a vivid and deeply authentic novel of zimbabwe's ordeal as seen through the eyes and unvarnished insights of a group of 10 to 12 year olds running free in the bulldozed remnants of urban settlements where their parents try to survive without jobs amid attacks from government gangs and spreading cases of aids darling is just one of the young girls but her life becomes the focus as she sees her schooling end as teachers flee to countries where they will be paid as she sees her father die of aids as she sees political oppressors kill local community activists and as she experiences the mixed effects of african religious leadership with its anti feminist ethos in zimbabwe the intensity of the social critique is passionate but so is the sense of togetherness that the young people create darling then shifts to america saved by her aunt and the second part of the novel traces the other dimension of the tragedy of zimbabwe's people how when you are forced to go into exile you cut yourself off from the vibrancy of your own roots bulawayo handles this part of the novel well too but perhaps with somewhat less brilliance than the part set in zimbabwe the strength of this book is its vivid authenticity both in seeing the world through such young eyes and in observing zimbabwe reality in such stark and unsentimental terms bulawayo will write better novels in the future with a stronger sense of plot but this book is a great success darling is a character who will reach you on a deep and enduring level","562":"quick read lots of beautiful metaphors u0026amp language some really graphic scenes i was not prepared for liked the vignette style would recommend","563":"noviolet bulawayo is going to be huge her debut novel is phenomenal i cannot wait to meet her next week and hear her read","564":" if i could i would give this 3 5 stars i read this book initially about darling's life in zimbabwe her life after and admittedly it just seemed like a stream of consciousness book whatever that means then the author allowed me to see more and more of what happened previous to the beginning of the book and then she reveals the source of the hopelessness and constant uncertainty that many immigrants suffer however then the setting moved to michigan rather darling moved to michigan and there was the other side of the issue sad story turned happily ever after eh no there are new problems guilt and responsibility to those left behind confusion and uncertainty always uncertainty this was a book that snuck up on me in fact i'm changing my rating to 4 stars","565":" what an incredible book i give it 6 stars yes the names noviolet writes in the voice of darling her friends are bastard godknows sbho chipo stina there's a village in zimbabwe near victoria falls bulawayo never have i felt more white middle class than reading bulawayo's speculation what if her zimbabwean village filled a posh american mall hundreds of kids would be screaming up the escalators women would be setting up a market within the mall it would be alive with color and energy in a way that american isn't this device of putting her former culture in her new culture builds a vision of contrast that you long to experience or the million ways that she looks at america through the eyes of an often starving child from a zimbabwean refugee camp and yet she never seems to judge just observes americans have these odd choices they don't like their bodies they change them it's life so far away from that of simply surviving and in america she embraces her new culture whole heartedly all the time longing for her original life her old friends her syntax could only be devised by a kid who comes from africa knowing english but learns the american language from her teenaged peers having this acute ability to hear and record but using her past to create her voice her images are picturesque perfect and endless sometimes profound sometimes charming never forced the novel doesn't pull you or push you along with story as much as give snapshots of living in africa in a refugee camp the chapters often feel like short stories in the second half when she gets to america i'm more readily pulled along turning pages to find out","566":" the best book i have read this year darling's matter of fact narrative of the horrors they all endure told in the glib voice of innocence is beautiful touching and at times funny i don't think anything i say will do this book justice so here are a few of the author's words even though every single page yielded treasures and it was so difficult to choose a book for keeps page 20 'if you are stealing something it's better it is small and hideable i don't know what the white people were trying to do stealing not just a tiny piece but a whole country who can ever forget you stole something like that 'page 73 74 'they appeared in angry waves like the wretched sea they appeared with the dust of their crushed houses clinging to their hair their skin they appeared broken shards of glass people 'page 75 'and like that they mourned perished pasts their voices came back like tiptoeing thieves in the dark 'page 76 ' fell apart like crumbling towers and wept with the wretched grief of forgotten concubines 'page 92 'there is no night so long that doesn't end with dawn 'page 132 ' like people are being harvested like death is waiting with a big bag of free food that is how it is the way the dead keep coming and coming 'page 153 'there are times i find the food does nothing for me like i am hungry for my country and nothing is going to fix that 'page 160 'a country is a coca cola bottle that can smash on the floor and disappoint you when a bottle smashes you cannot put it back together 'page 238 'in america we saw more food than we had seen in all our lives and we rummaged through the dustbins of our souls to retrieve the stained broken pieces of god 'page 285 ' it's the wound that knows the texture of the pain it's us who stayed here feeling the real suffering '","567":"book club book and it was an excellent book with a great deal of discussion one i'd recommend","568":" when i started reading this book i was a bit reluctant as it is from a child's perspective again i have read so many books with the child in the first person i then decided to give it a chance as i really wanted to enjoy this book not the 'book's fault' that i've read too many books that are similar well i'm glad i did as i really enjoyed the story yes one can say that the topic gets boring but if you've never been in this situation you don't actually have the right to say anything well that's my opinion i love to find out more about other countries and other cultures so will i recommend this book most definitely yes","569":"very creative writing noviolet has readers journey through the struggle strife joys quirks glee and exhilaration of growing up in rhodesia in its transition period the application of contrast in the period overseas reads very much like chimamanda's americanah uncannily so","570":"the second of my man booker prize shortlist it was an okay read i've read other books of a similar style topic that i have enjoyed more","571":"one that suffered from the over hyped problem","572":"this was one of my book club books good points the voice was authentic and blended humor despair and the mundane in a very believable way that said it was told in a first person stream of consciousness manner that just never resonated with me the ending is terrible i'm not asking for a happy one but some resolution should but be given rather than just stopping mid thought perhaps it is someone else's cup of tea but it sure wasn't mine","573":" told from the point of view of eleven year old darling who lives in zimbabwe the children darling bastard godknows sbho chipo and stina play in their refugee camp called paradise they no longer go to school as they have been uprooted war has driven their families from their village now they live in shacks mothers sell or do whatever to help their family survive the men have been beaten down psychologically fortunately for darling she is brought to america to live with her aunt fostalina her common law husband kojoe and their son tk leaving behind her family and friends as the years roll by darling becomes americanized adopting the culture of teenagers though never forgetting her heritage the author shows the struggles some immigrants not just those from africa but also those from other countries have contrasting the culture and lifestyles they leave behind with that of their new adopted country i enjoyed this novel made even more powerful because it is told through the eyes of innocence","574":"i cannot fault this book i story to be heard by as many ears as possible read in two sittings this book did not take long to devour but the story will linger on","575":"i know we need new names is a novel but it really reads more like a series of related short stories i think it stands much better as a series of vignettes from narrator darling's life exploring her refugee experience in zimbabwe in the first half and her immigrant experience in the us in the second half than as a single story the last chapter story was a weak ending in my opinion but i enjoyed the journey even if the destination wasn't all that some of the middle stories were better in particular i'm remembering shhhh the related chapters how they appeared how they left and how they lived and my america i recently read the book of unknown americans and was continually reminded of it in the later half of new names especially in how they lived i liked darling's voice throughout but didn't see growth in it as i would expect of ~5 years of aging over the course of the book additionally it really never stopped being confusing that bulawayo doesn't use quotation marks ever on the whole though i enjoyed we need new names and i look forward to reading more by bulawayo","576":" a coming of age novel that tantalises and kindles one's imagination a portrayal that provides the reader with an honest dismal and yet naively sublime picture of contemporary zimbabwe and the alienation of immigrants in the us a novel that reminds us that youthful innocence is universal that loneliness and loss are irreparable that cultures collide clash mix but ultimately remain unalterable but most importantly bulawayo instills a hope even as things are falling apart the will to live to survive to thrive to build and grow and dream those remain unbreakable","577":" we need new name is a story told about every day life in zimbabwe told by a young girl named darling darling's father went to south africa to mine and make money to send home darling and her mother never hear from him darling and her friends always feeling hunger steal guavas from rich neighborhoods nearby they no longer go to school and their time is spent together playing games stealing guavas and watching life around them one of their eleven year old friends is pregnant she had been impregnated by her grandfather darling's father finally comes home sick with aids darling and her family pray at the top of a mountain for praying is the only hope they have living so vulnerably in zimbabwe change is supposed to come to zimbabwe daring and her friends witness the looting of an old white couple's house and the death of their dog when one of the gang kicks the dog like a football change does not come darling has a chance to go to america to live with her mother's aunt she leaves her friends promises to write and starts her teenage years in america darling cannot believe how much food people in america have access to although her guava days are over accompanied by constipation darling still tastes and longs for the guava's sweetness her childhood friends her real home but is her african home her real home any more darling suffers from being caught between two worlds like many immigrants it is in the words of noviolet bulawayo that make the immigrants like darling become known to the reader while she lives in america we ate like pigs like wolves like dignitaries we ate like vultures like stay dogs like monsters we ate like kings we ate for all our past hunger for our parents and brothers and sisters and relatives and friends who were still back there we uttered their names between mouthfuls conjured up their hungry faces and chapped lips eating for those who could not be with us to eat for themselves we looked at people sending their aging parents away to be taken care of by strangers we looked at parents not being allowed to beat their own children for the visas and passports we begged despaired lied groveled promised charmed bribed anything to get out us out of the country we would never be the things we had wanted to be doctors lawyers teachers engineers no school for us even though our visas were school visas we dropped our heads because we were no longer people we were now illegals the truth about life is often hard to read thank you no violet blawayo","578":"i liked it a worthy culturally expanding book a slice of life no plot kind of book didn't like the ending but i suppose it's true to a life is hard and often unfair message","579":"i enjoyed this book it read like a memoir and i had to remind myself that it was fiction bulawayo's prose is deceptively simple","580":"this is a really well written but frequently depressing book it seems to fall somewhere between fiction and memoir and deserves all the acclaim it's received almost a series of short stories i was sometimes confused about the passage of time between chapters but the main character's development and the storytelling style never stopped being engaging","581":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the book starts out very interesting while she lived in africa but once she went to america things kind of stalled and the ending all i could think was what the","582":"i really enjoyed this book up until the time she arrived in america i guess when you're describing your native country to readers most of whom have never been the words full richer and much more alive post displacement the story takes a major tumble and i found myself skipping past some of the pages i would recommend this story to anyone who is interested in reading it and may even read more of ms bulawayo's work in the future","583":" this is a book of two halves the first half is set in an unnamed african country that bears more than a passing resemblance to zimbabwe and the second half is set in the usa narrating both halves is darling a ten year old child in the first half and a teenager in the second her voice is compelling and beautifully written throughout and i think it's darling's voice that was the main reason for the novel's booker shortlisting here is darling for example describing her aunt fostalina's struggles with the english language as she tries to order a push up bra over the phone the problem with english is this you usually can't open your mouth and it comes out just like that - first you have to think what you want to say then you have to find the words then you have to carefully arrange those words in your head then you have to say the words quietly to yourself to make sure you got them okay and finally the last step which is to say the words out loud and have them sound just right but then because you have to do all this when you get to the final step something strange has happened to you and you speak the way a drunk walks and because you are speaking like falling it's as if you are an idiot when the truth is that it's the language and the whole process that's messed up and then the problem with those who speak only english is this they don't know how to listen they are busy looking at your falling instead of paying attention to what you are saying there are other wonderful pieces of prose like describing parked cars \"surrounding the little ballpark like teeth\" and \"if these walls could talk the buildings would stutter wouldn't remember their names \" the language always feels fresh the voice strong the novel also gives a great insight into life in a country that is unravelling and the experience of moving to america and having people refer to africa as a single country with a single unchanging reality my favourite chapter was one narrated by an insane old man in a nursing home i'd love to quote it in full but instead i'll just recommend that you read it it's a searing account of life in zimbabwe and the compromises and sacrifices and sometimes heartbreak involved in migrating to america what stops me from recommending this book whole heartedly is the meandering plot the trajectory is \"darling runs around stealing guavas with her friends as her country falls apart darling moves to the us and becomes partly but not wholly american not fitting in with americans but struggling to connect with her friends back home too \" beyond that there's not much of a shape to it and the ending felt completely flat as i look back over the novel i think i see why it was that way the point i assume is that emigration is not the happy ending that darling had naively imagined while sitting at home in zimbabwe she is stuck just as her aunt and uncle are stuck just as her country is stuck the american dream is inaccessible to them but their homeland offers nothing so the lack of an ending is true to life - there is no grand denouement life just goes on still as a reader i found it frustrating i expected the characters to change in some way beyond the familiar story of immigration and the struggle for identity i kept reading for the voice for the sometimes funny sometimes angry sometimes heartbreaking descriptions but the lack of plot or character development was disappointing i can see why the book got so much praise and i can see that bulawayo is a talented writer and i think the book is certainly worth reading but i wouldn't urge you to rush out and buy it right now i'd add it to the \"tbr some day\" pile","584":"this story is brilliant amazingly told near the end there is a chapter titled how we lived that i imagine must be the most encompassing description of what it must feel like to be an immigrant in a strange new country that i've ever read the entire book is a beautiful ode to that sense of home and belonging that we all search for never have i read a novel that so clearly illustrated many of the ways that we are similar and different at the same time noviolet bulawayo is a writer who has mastered her craft and i look forward to reading more of her stories","585":" this was an excellent read narratws by darling a native of zimbawe she relates her life and adventures in zimbawe and the u s she lived in zimbawe until about age 11 when she emigrated to the u s to live with her aunt and have a better life i had such empathy for the plight of the zimbaweans and i gained a greater appreciation for their culture her life in the u s was so different and her accounts are both sad and hilarious i had a better understanding of immigrants in the u s particularly undocumented ones","586":" wonderful it is always a delight to find a completely new voice almost every page made me stop and think what a wonderful way to put that the story is set in zimbabwe the former rhodesia and i couldn't help but think about the classic line from cecil rhodes shortly before he died well they can't change the name of a country can they this is not an easy book to read some of the incidents make you shudder while others make you laugh out loud but there are times when the writing is so authentic and so gorgeous i would stop and read them out loud to my wife or just to myself if nothing else read the chapter how they lived and you will be astonished as well great things are to be expected from this first time writer it will be a long time before i forget darling and bastard and chipo and godknows and sbho and stina and the guavas of budapest","587":" i could not finish this book for a variety of reasons i tried and tried i made it through to the usa part the writing is episodic and really is a bunch of short stories this does not allow for characterization at all i therefore could not identify with darling which means although the incidents in her life were depressing and sometimes horrific i found i did not care if the book was an allegory for the state of life in africa vs new world usa it also failed on that level it was not powerful enough if it was rite of passage there have been many better rite of passages that allowed for more empathy i think this is part of a whole new wave of african authors and possibly the cultural differences render them difficult although the south american authors do not i think the critics bestowed too much praise on the book","588":"vibrant writing intense story telling story of a girl whose family loses everything to political upheaval and terrorists and is sent to live with aunt to get an education and better life in the us she faces cultural change remembers her life in zimbabwe and comes to terms in looking into her own self author too has an interesting story","589":"you may love a book and hate it at the same time i did for this one why love too many reasons african man booker tagging at it youngish writer and a powerful and unique style that is not too easy to forget why hate because because why cram in a million things into a single book at some point i felt like i was reading a reportage of zimbabwe and the american immigrant experience all rolled into a tight clever linkage to the main character incidents and mis adventures so that the issues stood so out so much you'd feel that they sort of mattered more than the story well that's a longer paragraph than the love one but love outweighs the dislike these kind of books are rare trust me that though they have a singular inherent weakness the artistry of the story's delivery is enough to overlook it it is divided into two the story the first part is of darling and her friends back in zimbabwe craving guavas and running out to steal them through the eyes of darling we see not only the pain of those close to her but the collective pain of a nation that has been brought to its knees its best citizens are running out of the country and poverty and corruption eats away at the rest every one wishes to step out all in droves are running to find a better world the bridge between the first part and the second is a powerful two page statement of this exodus an exodus into other nations where these immigrants desperately seek a life an identity a belonging but are met by some cold facts for darling its america where she goes to be with her auntie to find an education but the struggle has only just began america is nothing like the life she thought she would have nothing like the dreams of owning her dream car and being a millionaire it is a cold place where she has to find only some semblance of comfort in her fellow immigrants and her struggle to make sense of things this is a readable book that has been well realized with characters one is not likely to forget so soon","590":"i feel like i should have liked this more but it wasn't for me i found it hard to empathise with the narrator when she could see a body being torn apart and then think about food i'm sure it's the world she lived in but there is no compassion or empathy in this narrators voice","591":"still thinking about this book months after i finished changed how i say and use the word awesome coming of age immigration zimbabwe heartsickness homesickness and tweens taking over their world what do you know about zimbabwe or refugees you need to read this if you think you anything about either most likely the most lovable book of my year","592":"i stumbled on this book in the library and had to get it as i loved that it was written by an african woman the author is from zimbabwe i have a lot of friends who have come to the us from central africa seeking asylum and i thought this book might shed some light on their experience even though each person's story is very different i liked the unique perspective but i have to say this story was much more serious than what i usually read it's an intense book and i found myself only able to read a chapter or two at a time my favorite chapter was near the end and called how they lived it tells the story of migrants and how they leave their culture and country behind yet they still long for it it was beautiful and i think what i was expecting most of the book to be like one thing that drove me nuts was the author's lack of quotation marks to indicate when someone was speaking i am glad i read this because it told a story i am not familiar with and in a small way can aid me in being more understanding of others even if at times it was more intense than i wanted i believe there is a lot of truth in the author's words","593":" the author has crafted a complex multi layered book she has a gift for description and her similes are unparalleled i found the first part of the book at times difficult to follow and kept wondering how her friends got their names this is not an easy story to tell children suffering unspeakable tragedies the second part of the book taking place in america brought many smiles to my face and looks of horror too the slapping of the unruly child at the wedding had me laughing aloud i'll be interested to read more from this writer","594":" bulawayo is clearly a very talented writer and i liked that her writing was descriptive without being overly lyrical i loved the parts set in zimbabwe though some scenes were hard to read for some reason i wasn't as into the scenes set in michigan even though they were an interesting contrast to the earlier scenes there was also a chapter near the end that abruptly switched to second person and that really took me out of the story still a solid read and i look forward to reading more from bulawayo in the future","595":" i think this author has potential but to have been nominated for the annual book award and mann booker prize is premature she has too much to say in too little space she has produced a series of related short stories more than developed themes worthy of a novel i want to know more about each issue she has raised but has left unexplored she has delved into aids foreign aid groups failing in zimbabwe racism and colonization in africa and how it affects africans in usa and american blacks failures of stereotypes difficulties with fitting into either country when one immigrates and difficulties of being an adolescent so none of these is explored well many would work better as op ed pieces than fiction the absence of grammar rules in the first half of the book makes it difficult to understand what happened in the past and what is in the present i'm more inclined to rate this a 2 star book but the inflation comes from the influence of the award committees","596":"this book is one that i won't easily forget it tells one girl's story across two different worlds the first a shantytown in zimbabwe and the second in suburban detroit the story begins as darling and her friends explore their neighborhoods as well as wealthier enclaves that border them they are poor and hungry and chock full of american cultural touchstones and attitude they sometimes discuss the time before when they went to school and lived in houses before the military came but mostly they play in the world they find themselves in however this is also a story of immigration and alienation when a few years later darling gets the chance to go live with her aunt in suburban detroit on the one hand she is amazed at all the things she has access to but darling also begins to realize what she has left behind this book is funny but also deadly serious bubbly but tragic and all through darling's voice shines through","597":"the importance of voice reviewed by sheila trask for readers' favorite a sad and beautiful coming of age story of a child and her country noviolet bulawayo's novel we need new names takes us to zimbabwe during the mugabe era here 10 year old darling copes with extreme poverty hunger and near homelessness in her ironically named shantytown paradise we join the smart observant darling and her roving band of friends as they hunt for the best places to steal guavas and play frequent games of \"find bin laden \" bulawayo's knowledgeable and empathetic descriptions allow us to feel their hunger but also their friendships most of all we see them becoming adults before their time as in a wrenching scene where the friends try to figure out how to \"get the baby out\" of 11 year old chipo's stomach bulawayo looks unflinchingly at harsh economic racial family and personal experiences in zimbabwe through darling's perceptive eyes later in the novel -- which reads more like a series of linked vignettes than an action filled story -- darling travels to america to escape the dire situation at home however detroit michigan is hardly the answer to all of her problems in fact her new home brings new complications which bulawayo covers in chapters focused on technology music capitalism violence and pornography these later sections feel a little forced as though the author had a predetermined list of issues to address though her observations are spot on a girl who never had enough to eat is appropriately alarmed by an american culture that celebrates a combination of overeating and extreme dieting for instance lyrical at times no reader will forget darling's first experience of the michigan snow that came silently to swallow everything up with its whiteness we need new names is not a speedy read darling takes her time expressing herself and there is no anticipation of crisis to create momentum readers will however appreciate bulawayo's unique voice her cross cultural comparisons and the compassion with which she portrays one girl's international journey toward womanhood","598":"i've just finished we need new names by noviolet bulawayo shortlisted for the booker prize and the eitisalat prize for literature i really enjoyed reading this book which presents the contrasts between life in zimbabwe and the us in a very authentic and interesting way","599":"when you leave your home you can never really go back but can never be home in the new place","600":"first half was good but lost interest during the second half based in usa no real ending","601":" the year of short stories this is the third of fourth book of short stories i've read this year which is a record breaker for me i tend not to really like short stories i like a connected linear plot and so this was interesting for me in that it followed a linear trajectory and the stories were connected i did enjoy this book it was great to see the world and a country in a continent that american media only tells us of its despair and problems from the eyes of a child who while recognizing the problems of her country and feels her hunger and poverty on a level that we could not also knows the joy and beauty of her country the joy and love for her country comes in when discussing the games they play they conversations they have and the longing she feels when she leaves it also offers a look at just how other countries view america as well and what happens when their expectations are met with reality there is one thing i wish the author had done differently there is a particularly poignant passage that talks about interactions that those from countries in africa experience with americans and how folks go on and all and all they do is smile that chapter would have made a great ending to the book as it is it seems misplaced","602":"bulawayo is an incredible writer her ability to spin a metaphor makes this a page turner the earnest and sometimes devastating observations of her protagonist darling are incredibly moving that there's not too much of a linear plot is immaterial it's a quick read and you'll have a hard time picking out your favorite passages you'd run out of highlighter ink read this and look out for more from bulawayo","603":"not an easy read the first half of the book is set in a slum called paradise in an unnamed african country the children are an unruly mob filled with violence and unhappiness they have seen death starvation war the main character darling dreams of the day she will move to america to live with her aunt in destroyedmeechigun aka detroit michigan the second part of the book is dedicated to her life in america and her feelings as an immigrant insightful well written but not easy this book is shortlisted for the 2013 mann booker award","604":"powerful read of a young african girl's growing up and coming to america","605":" i enjoyed this book although it became uninteresting in places especially after darling moves to the us i don't think this book is as powerful as it gets set up to be in the beginning but i do like the exploration into themes of the displaced african diaspora what i did particularly love was the chapter starting on page 239 entitled how they live which while not connected to the rest of the story and quite out of place in this novel is an incredible essay about the sadness of leaving africa and what that means to those individuals this chapter could and should be published on it own as it is powerful and thought provoking","606":"i applaud this debut novel for the raw candid journal type account of this coming of age and coming to america experience the current news inserts gave the reader a reminder as to how fleeting time is and the constant struggles for darling to not lose her internal homeland yet acclimate to life in america highly recommended","607":"4 5 stars told mostly in the first person by darling a young zimbabwean girl this novel paints first a picture of life in a shantytown in zimbabwe as mugabe is coming to power and communal life is falling apart then of what it is like to move as a young person to the u s in this case michigan where the material abundance is so great it is incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it and where play is dominated by materialism one of bulawayo's great achievements is to capture darling's voice convincingly in these two different worlds while showing how her vocabulary and perceptions change with age and a new culture the plot of the story is minimal it is the strength of the impressions of life in both countries and the conflict they generate in darling that hold our interest darling's observations of others particularly adults are spot on listening to an american adult talk about the donations she has made to those poor african children darling notes then she puts her hand over her heart and closes her eyes briefly like maybe she's listening to the throb of her kindness a few short chapters scattered throughout are told in an anonymous first person plural voice and act as a kind of chorus to darling's story capturing the larger picture of devastation in home countries and the shocks of immigration to the u s though these could have been distracting or detracting i found them deeply moving all in all a quick informative and affecting read","608":"we need new names is an outstanding debut noviolet bulawayo's voice is strong unique and her use of language is both playful dazzling and deeply involving it's a joy to read the world is painted vividly through ten year old darling's eyes at times naive at others experienced beyond her years her impressions of life in an impoverished zimbabwe township unflinching and unfiltered it is at times funny at others very dark touching upon religion including the brilliantly named prophet revelations bitchington mborro superstition suicide rape child pregnancy immigration the american dream family poverty race injustice the narrative follows darling as she leaves her home and goes to live with an aunt in america growing into a teenager although it is only loosely plot driven being more of a series of vignettes and while each chapter seems whole and complete within itself there is a sense of dislocation and incompleteness to the novel as a whole nothing is tied up neatly which is rather fitting of darling's experience of life noviolet bulawayo is wonderfully talented and i can't wait to see more novels from her","609":"extraordinary writing bulawayo's voice is symphonic we hear the bass brass of the bulldozer the tympanic thunder of weapons smashing windows the schizophrenic screech of strings as children hide in the trees to witness forbidden sights melodic power that we experience physically there is a two page chapter in the almost exact middle of the book that signals the setting change which will be discussed in literature classes for decades to come the book is stuffed with issues like children eating stolen fruit as though bulawayo thought this might be the only book she writes but she orchestrates with such personal majesty we hear the melody within my heart stopped and soared bulawayo's debut will live with me for a long time","610":" occasionally when reading i will bookmark pages of importance relevance or beauty so when i happen upon literary nostalgia i can see what i loved about a book the first time with \"we need new names\" every page was a profound revelation when we first meet darling she is ten and stealing guavas living in a \"temporary\" shanty town called \"paradise\" held up only by sticks and dreams her best friend chipo is pregnant to her grandfather ngos visit with smiles and optimistic objectives but little understanding by the west seems satirical in juxtaposition to the bleak realities of paradise this isn't to say butamayo's novel is without humour you are enticed by the antics of innocent children and laugh despite their problems \"we need new names\" is emotionally articulate and complete this book has a sense of being bigger than readers opinions than the ideas as it encompasses this book is not merely a \"portrait of africa\" as some critics claim whilst this debut is set in zimbabwe there is not one human experience that remains untouched by bulawayo's \"we need new names\" butamayo is set to join other great \"displaced\" novelists jm coetzee and junot diaz a poignant read and worthy of the man booker for which it is shortlisted","611":" \"we need new names\" starts with a bang but ends with a whimper the first half of the book is set in zimbabwe and the language and characters there are rich varied and emotionally resonant although the world that's depicted by darling the pre teen narrator is hardly an uplifting one there's widespread poverty and almost no food the government bulldozed their houses forcing them to rebuild a shantytown they call \"paradise\" ngo workers occasionally show up to give them a few things none of which they need and one of darling's 11 year old friends is pregnant there's a sense of resiliency and innocence in these children who while away the days without school by inventing a series of new games they're interesting characters with actual problems in a relatable world that's well defined and described once darling immigrates to america though her voice becomes stilted and while this is intentional and has a point the isolation and loss of voice involved in the immigrant experience it's neither interesting nor enlightening to read particularly given the relatively well trod cultural juxtapositions darling offers snow is strange americans don't hit their children americans can be super fat etc given that the opening pages are full of energy and semi shimmering prose it's an enormous drop off to read a bland account about teens going to the mall or that one supervisor at the supermarket who's kinda racist and creepy it's also unfortunate that this book was published within a month or so of adichie's far more nuanced and brilliant novel involving nigerian immigrants' experience americanah which makes this book seem all the more paltry i'd skip this and read that instead bulawayo may indeed write some great novels at some point but she's not there yet","612":"wonderfully woven story","613":"eh so so not my style of writing no direct quotes from characters i glossed over parts didn't hold my interest","614":" we need new names is a powerful story narrated by darling a ten year zimbabwean child who grows up witnessing an era of massive social change her unconscious honesty allows her to tell zimbabwe's story in a way usually lost to politics and history \"if you're stealing something it's better if it's small and hideable or something you can eat quickly and be done with like guavas that way people can't see you with the thing to be reminded that you are a shameless thief and that you stole it from them so i don't know what the white people were trying to do in the first place stealing not just a tiny piece but a whole country who can ever forget you stole something like that \" we open in paradise the shanty town where darling lives with her mother in the aftermath of her home's demolition and her father's emigration along with her sidekicks darling faces daily obstacles such as finding fruit to soothe their hungry stomachs attending the sermons of the prophet revelations bitchington mborro reluctantly posing for the cameras of ngo workers in order to collect their gifts attempting to help chipo throw out of the baby growing inside her...spoiler as darling's mother struggles to keep a roof over their heads they are surprised by the return of her father however in truth he has returned to die of an unnamed illness when darling's aunt fostalina offers to bring her back to america a new path opens up for her growing up in detroit with her sullen cousin her traditional uncle and her weight obsessed aunt is not what darling expected of america darling quickly finds herself occupying a half world between her friends in zimbabwe and those in detroit \"when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same \"bulawayo's exploration of the impossible choice offered to her compatriots to stay or to leave is a sobering read displaying at once the wonder with which children see their world and the vulnerability that they unwittingly face she humanises a conflict that can sometimes be dismissed in dichotomist terms darling's coming of age story has many parallels with a country that is struggling to come to terms with its identity a renewal that requires a high price from many of its inhabitants in parallel the costs of emigration are shown to powerful effect when our children were old enough and we told them about our country they did not beg us for stories of the land we had left behind they went to their computers and googled and googled and googled when they got off they looked at us with something between pity and horror and said jeez you really come from there there can only be hope that nuanced and transparent stories such as bulawayo's might also make it to google highly recommended","615":"zimbabwe is the setting the narrator is darling a young girl and the story opens with her group of friends bastard chipo a pregnant 11 yearold others hunting guavas in a nearby richer neighborhood they call \"budapest \" the adventures of this pack of wild things continue and seeing adult behavior through this young girl's eyes is what gives the book its flavor lots of time we just their voices not knowing exactly who's talking the dialogue is amazing fresh direct lyrical some of their metaphors are so telling the scenes are amazing and vivid finding a dead woman hanging in a tree they take her shoes to sell for bread a church scene where a pastor gropes a woman who's come for a blessing seeing women with chinese workers at a construction site the way they and the adults behave when ngo workers arrive in a lorry perhaps most thrilling are the scenes where they are playing their games \"country \" where they telling act out the power relationships of countries in the world \"er\" where they act out scenes they've seen on television including a harrowing decision to cut out chipo's baby at the end of the scene you finally realize they are not really going to do this but it seemed very real as darling described it this was also true in another scene where they reenact the beating of a young man from their village the plot turns when after the adults go to vote and are crushingly disappointed with the results violence overwhelms their communities darling is sent by her family to live with an aunt in america - and a whole new chapter emerges here we get an immigrants eye view of trying to survive in america bullying and social struggles in school coping with lowest level jobs adapting language and values to assimilate one really poignant scene is where darling calls her mother and speaks to some of her old gang - one of whom has now sort of taken her place as a daughter in the house this is just a wonderful rich empathetic story of an african community","616":"i loved her voice as a child confident yet some adult things are just beyond her comprehension i also loved her exploration of being an immigrant to the us the dreams and economic betterment yes but also the demeaning work what was left behind and lost and the eventual sense of belonging to neither place","617":"i have always wondered what happens to children removed from harsh lands to america still seen as the land of dreams and opportunities darling's story while fictional gives some insight into that dramatic change fleeing africa with visions of the america she'd seen on tv darling winds up in significantly unglamorous michigan she is a young girl in need of guidance who never gets it instead making her way mostly on her own she lives a life that will be limited because she's not in america legally her childhood dreams don't seem that much different as she ages in america her family and friends back home don't have the real view of america that darling lives her reality is harsh she's destined to spend her life working jobs that keep her off the radar of the government the worst thing that could happen is she could be found out and then sent home to a place and people she wouldn't recognize her life is probably safer in american than it would be in her homeland her personal safety is not as threatened as it would be in africa but she seems lonely no matter how american darling becomes she seems to still miss the things she loved about her african childhood this is the kind of story that reminds me how lucky i am to have been born in america my life has never been run by fear or even the kind of abandonment so many children in this world see as normal it is a raw story that may make some uncomfortable it made me grateful i could never walk a mile in an immigrant's shoes this book gives me a chance to walk just a few steps darling's dreams aren't all that different from mine or anyone else's a chance for a good safe happy life if there was one more chapter in this book i'd like to think darling gets all of that and more","618":"this novel pulls the reader into the lives of children striving to survive both the political and economic atrocities in zimbabwe forcing those of us who think we endure hardship to realize how good we actually have it in comparison to much of the world's population the survival dream is to go to america which happens for some of the characters who try to fit into a culture that isn't their own in destroyedmichigan detroit as dry as it sounds this book is a surprisingly intriguing read bringing to light the commonalities between children everywhere and the search for a dream that most of us pursue i will admit to being disappointed with the ending but i'll let you find out for yourself whether or not you agree with that point just read it","619":"this story is told through the eyes of a child and later young adult and i love that the author captures this perfectly it reads true","620":"this is a really well written book the narrators voice lingers even after finishing the book i recommend i just dislike all that references to pop culture","621":"i wanted to like this more i felt as though an otherwise compelling narrator was tasked with telling stories that didn't belong to her made her own narrative feel a little thin","622":"i wanted to like this more than i did the naive narrator just wasn't working for me this time perhaps you must be in the mood 48 pages in but i am moving on","623":" this is an incredibly frustrating book it has so much it wants to say and even some moving sections and yet so much of it is so boring and so laborious and it never devotes enough time to the myriad topics it brings up so you end up thinking to yourself what the fuck all of this at the same school what is this degrassi high which is not really a good comparison because that's a canadian show and this is all about ~ ~america~ ~ still it's like bulawayo made a list of every single social issue in zimbabwe and the united states and decided to cram them all into one book narrated by one young character darling it comes across as implausible so much so that it really ends up just as eye rolling as degrassi and it's so infuriating because as i said this novel has some really good parts parts that make you know it could have been so much better the good news is that the best parts have nothing to do with the plot of the novel not referencing the characters at all so they can be and should be read in isolation chapters 10 and 16 are beautiful and poetic on the theme of the exodus from zimbabwe and the hardships of life abroad there's also some good stuff in the other chapters but they're all mixed up with less good stuff so you can't look at them in isolation the same way the other aspect to this book i liked was the way darling's voice changed over time at the beginning of the novel she's a ten year old kid living in a zimbabwean slum after the demolition of her real home by the end she's a teenage indocumentada in michigan and has lost all the vibrancy and enthusiasm with which she began her story it's a subtle progression and very well done it's too bad these things were let down by other aspects of the book each chapter is more or less a self contained story so you have bizarre things like darling's father returning from south africa dying of aids then never getting mentioned again once his chapter is over the first half of the book before chapter 10 the brilliant bridge follows her life in zimbabwe the second half her life in america each is characterised by spending long periods of time describing very mundane boring things in agonising detail bringing up a very weighty issue and not giving anywhere near enough time to developing it then returning to mundanity over and over again in the america half there is also a kind of revolting chapter where darling and her friends watch porn including a snuff film and that has to be described but then in the middle of this revolting chapter is an important and powerful section where darling ruminates on how hard she finds it to keep in touch with her friends back home... i really liked that section but why did it have to be bookended with the gross porn descriptions hopefully i've conveyed my frustration enough this has potential but it's squandered and i came away disappointed some of the reviews of this book where people have taken the ideas presented here and run with them i liked much better than the book itself it has at least increased the urgency in my mind of reading chinua achebe's things fall apart as it's yet another book that makes extensive reference to that","624":" like other authors that do not use quotation marks noviolet bulawayo's technique forced me to read more closely careful to not miss plot forwarding dialogue written in almost diary form blow by blow rundowns then skipping ahead in time changes in style then stream of conscious musings for me this story explored the nuance of the extreme shift and yet rapid acclimation to first world life phone calls home and the chapter titled how they lived were particularly poignant clearly depicting the clash of cultures and the often unseen ignored immigrant experience","625":"3 75 stars i'm not sure if i consider this a novel or a sort of chronological collection of short stories at any rate this is a book about a group of children growing up in zimbabwe notably darling a 10 year old and her subsequent move to 'her america' to begin with i found the book a bit slow and i had a hard time getting into the story but about 30 pages in i really started enjoying the plot and stories many stories made me laugh the reverend in zimbabwe for example or some of the insights from the main character when dealing with ngos and or foreigners in zimbabwe or the dynamics between the children and the adults in zimbabwe and in the united states as well as the way ms bulawayo describes certain things in america from an immigrant african teenager point of view other stories made me mad such the glimpse into the state of things in zimbabwe and how it leaves its people suffering i found very clever the way the author depicts zimbabwe yet never once mentioning the name of the country 'zimbabwe' it is always assumed it is in zimbabwe yet never clearly uttered very clever considering the critique she gives of the country and its rulers clearly my favorite part of the book was the first half set in zimbabwe the games the children play the simplicity of the language she uses and yet the serious realities she manages to pass on were profoundly touching and thoroughly interesting i enjoyed much less the second half of the book about darling moving to america maybe because i'm getting tired of all the books written by the diaspora about being immigrants that always tell the same story just with different characters and plot i personally would have enjoyed for the plot to be only set in zimbabwe and see how darling and her friends do growing up there and how the country changes or does not change overall i recommend reading this book it's an easy enjoyable and captivating read that for those who only know too much about what the author is describing will make you laugh and angry and for the others who don't well it will show you how things are in a country like zimbabwe and how life can be as an immigrant great first piece of work ms bulawayo and to many more","626":"quite an amazing book it feels autobiographical even though it is fiction it follows a 10 year old girl in the congo living amidst the poverty and political unrest in the region she has her group of cohorts and they play games like find bin laden and other child enactments of what they observe around them her departure to america and the complexity of being an immigrant is wonderfully handled the educated people professing to admire african arts and culture whilst immediately being shocked when any of that wonderful culture conflicts with their educated western idea of what is acceptable was especially interesting i am not a fan of hitting children however when the main character slaps this objectionable small child for throwing something directly at her the author brilliantly shows the outrage of the americans surrounding her and the protagonists understanding that she must never repeat such an action but purely based on acceptance not on the morality of hitting a small child the immigrants need to blend and integrate with all its complexities is wonderfully handled it is short listed for the man booker prize","627":"for the audio book version wow stunning writing and a phenomenal voice performance i highly recommend listening to this book","628":"i listened to this as an audiobook the reader is wonderful i'm not sure who she is i put it down before finishing although i got nearly to the end the voice especially when the narrator is still a child in africa is refreshing but too much about the book feels on the nose there is nearly nothing to make me care about the characters or the story unfortunately it feels like the author has a ton of potential but this first book was flat","629":" i loved this story about a young girls struggle to grow up in a war torn zimbabwe for the first part of her young life u0026amp eventually destroyed michigan detroit michigan where she moved as a pre teen my only complaint is the unnecessarily graphic nature of one chapter entitled this film contains some disturbing images i realize that as a teenage girl her u0026amp her friends may choose to search out information to help them figure out the craziness that is human sexuality however it seemed an unnecessary addition to an otherwise good book hope this helps i should add that the chapter mentioned above is short u0026amp please do not let it stop you from reading this book just be prepared when you read it","630":"i mean this book was alright there wasn't anything particularly special about this book which attempted to cover the merging of different cultures it was kinda a repetition of different immigrant's stories we've heard in the past looking at the lenses of the outsider and what not still there was some great funny moments and the narrator is often keenly honest startlingly naive and refreshingly genuine","631":" i was torn on this book there were parts i loved sections that were so painful and evoked such a strong response from me the narrative begins in zimbabwe with darling struggling to have a childhood with her friends including a pregnant 12 year old i think but eventually moved to the u s when darling becomes part of the modern diaspora either part of the novel could have been its own story i struggled a bit with the transition and with feeling the connection between the young darling and the darling in america ultimately i felt that there was too much crammed into one book for it to be a single cohesive narrative","632":"very great beginning nicely written ending was unsatisfying","633":" reading around the globe zimbabwewhile browsing the library i stumbled upon this novel its bright lively cover was beaming at me from the shelves where it was standing between the depressing black vampire teennovels it seemed to fit with my dissertation so i did not hesitate to bring it with me no mistake it appeared honestly this novel blew every expectation i had of it i hadn't heard of it before so i began reading quite blankly the prose is fantastic it's poetic and meandering straight and filled like literature then we have the story featuring darling living in zimbabwe and feeding on dreams of better lives regarding representation this novel is immensely important it's accesible in terms of language not too heavy on the topics but important in themes we need more representation of african writers the balance is off and we need to fix that i still can't believe that there is no buzz surrounding this novel","634":"this was by far the most honest and most simply written book i have read all year part of it tackles issues dealt with african immigrants to the west and the stories were told very sincerely and in a way that made it very easy to relate to the characters lovely read","635":"slow at the start and i didn't think i'd like it but it improved when she repatriated to the u s still no what is the what if you're looking for a book on the african diaspora i recommend eggers first","636":"what a voice noviolet captures darling from child through young adult so compellingly her portrayal of both zimbabwe and economically depressed detroit feel real but both are equally foreign to me lives in zimbabwe are intertwined and there is a strong sense of community but there is no hope of a better future in detroit the possibility of a more prosperous life is tantalizingly close and almost as impossible to achieve but life is socially isolated and bleak so which is better neither society understands the other and darling is caught between the 2 wishing for the benefits of both but also understanding the shortcomings of both a powerful and disturbing book","637":"interesting stories about growing up in zimbabwe and kalamazoo but they don't cohere as a novel","638":" our smiles melted like dying shadows and we wept wept for our blessed wretched country we wept and wept and they pitied us and said it's okay it's okay you are in america now bulawayo explores and shares with us a powerful account of her life as a child of two vastly different cultures her candid story telling is often disturbing and painful but her love for her homeland shines through the reader is forced to reckon with her raw discourse on poverty questions about god injustice depravity american madness all from the comfort of our overly stuffed couches","639":" the first three quarters of this book is alive the main character darling's voice is strong and captivating i open my eyes and i'm tagging along with darling and her group of friends in a world of laughter color togetherness friendship family and love searching for fruit to fill my empty belly but its also a world of fear poverty pain and survival darling and her friends struggle to understand what is happening around them as they struggle to survive and make the best of what they have in a small impoverished town in africa darling is looking for her escape and she knows she'll find everything she could ever want in america but she has to leave her friends her mother and her home behind when she gets to america she struggles to find her way and misses home this is where the book slows down and the strong and colorful voice becomes a bit monotonous for me the story becomes more of a list of activities that darling goes through until the last few chapters where the story telling picks up again noviolet bulawayo is a gifted writer the story she tells is real and moving i am definitely on the lookout for her next novel","640":"the book was beautiful in parts funny in others sometimes too vague that i couldn't get a great handle on the context but good overall","641":"i really loved this book it is composed of a number of short stories that together form a whole novel each story follows on the plot of the previous to create an entire narrative i really appreciated the writing poetic descriptive and real the narrator added to the story by her use of her voice to create the different characters and help maintain the setting by varying her accent","642":"told from a young girls perspective from africa to the us wonderful language good story","643":"vivid thought provoking and heart wrenching story of a leaving a native landing and mourning it","644":"a beautiful and heartbreaking story about living in a country going through a dangerous unrest and moving to american only to find out the life of an immigrant is not what everyone thinks is the american dream the audiobook narrator was amazing i'm thinking second only to jim dale she was that good","645":"i just finished reading this book the first half of it literally had me flying through the pages and then my interest dropped suddenly it was as if the author was taking it in a direction that was not flowing with what i'd hoped the book to be that's when it started collecting dust and became almost a chore to get through instead of something i couldn't wait to read it was a book that kept nagging me to finish i am still rating it highly it is worth a look","646":"well written a narrative told from a place of innocence and freshness the author channels a kind of naivete that is at once endearing for its brutal honesty and at the same time one is occasionally frustrated by the stream of consciousness quality of the storytelling the tales of disintegration of zimbabwe were startlingly vivid and chilling","647":"a series of short stories chapters revolving around a girl from zimbabwe who immigrates to the us some of the chapters were amazing like so they lived about the immigrant experience some were ok good author to keep tabs on though","648":"very good novel reading about conflict and turmoil from a child's perspective was fascinating bulawayo's uses language wonderfully","649":"the first half of this book the half set in zim blew me away it was deceptively easy to read and emotionally devastating part of it was the incredibly evocative exploration of race through the eyes of children one of many potentially devastating subjects which were gracefully handled here through the lens of naivete the second american half was still an outstanding book but it lacked some quality which the first half had in abundance a part of this might be related to the fact that i read we need new names almost immediately after finishing adichie's americanah which tackles many of the same topics adichie is a true master and it feels unfair to hold bulawayo's debut novel up against hers but i can't help it and it says a lot about the strength of the writing that much of the book does more than hold its own it mesmerizes i can't wait to see what this author writes next","650":"not a review but a question my book club had a great discussion over this book in particular the dogs in the story especially the one at the end we thought perhaps they were a metaphor a symbol of the story somewhere or maybe we were just overthinking it of course we googled for answers but came up empty arrrgh so i put it out to the goodread gods do the dogs mean something or should my book club put down the wine thanks","651":" we need new names follows the coming of age of a girl named darling who grows up midst the challenges having absentee parents in the impoverished and civilly unstable shanty town of paradise zimbabwe these struggles drive darling and her parents to america for a high school education while darling gradually loses her native identity and becomes increasingly american her parents rare stuck in the same lives they have always led back in paradise darling's story offers students the valuable perspective of a modern african youth moving from the third world to the first world an outsiders desire for the american dream which ultimately proves empty to darling as she realizes her true identity and pride lies in her native heritage bulawayo also applies a critical eye to the various systems of oppression embedded in the social realities of her homeland aids strikes the father and characters seek spiritual remedies to the feared sickness students can relate to the unique and maturing first person voice of darling they can enjoy the rich symbolism of nomenclature given to significant things such as \"paradise \" as well as characterize the radical and unexpected life changes of immigrants moving to the \"land of opportunity \"","652":"an important and powerful read but not an easy one","653":"i liked ending was a bit stupid but overall a well written book","654":"it failed to provide any new or deeper insight into the immigrant african story it felt contrived almost because it shared a perspective that was too common and too obvious","655":"heartbreaking and an excellent reminder that the world is infinitely more complicated than what i encounter in my corner of the world told from the perspective of a young girl from age 10 18 trigger warning there is some sexual violence as seen through the eyes of children not a light read but a good one and a relatively quick one","656":" i started this book a few months ago lost interest and put it down but came back to it recently some of the earlier parts lost my interest because i didn't quite understand everything the author was saying that was due in large part to the difficulty i had in understanding a culture so different from the one i've always known the way the first half of the book is written is a little fractured so it was slow reading for a while the second half has picked up though and i found myself learning about the life of an immigrant from a perspective i've never had very interesting stuff","657":"this first time novelist who hails from zimbabwe writes a story about a girl darling who spends her young years in that country until such time as she can relocate to detroit to live with her aunt the reader learns about life for those in zimbabwe after the destruction and devastation brought on by the military extremists and how this contrasted for darling once she was able to leave and immigrate to america what darling encounters in america is not necessarily what she and her friends spent much time dreaming and talking about","658":"insightful and well written","659":"i think this is more of a 3 5 but i've given it a 4 because some of the sentiment and imagery is extremely powerful and bulawayo does a wonderful job of capturing the flavor of life in two very different and difficult contexts but i am not sure it tells one complete or clear story it is more powerful as a set of images that the author seems to be coming to terms with herself imperfect but sometimes powerful","660":"excellent story telling in this debut about a young girl's experiences in zimbabwe and then as a recent immigrant to the us some of the scenes are both troubling and laugh out loud funny thrilled to have stumbled across this man booker nominee once again reading the nominee makes me eager to read the winner","661":"a broken bottle of a novel the smooth as glass prose gives way to jagged sharp edges a tale of losing one's homes exiling empathy and the inability to make personal connections in an unjust uncaring world what gives sustenance isn't just food and it can't always be described or understood as such or even in reach an immigrant's story a blase coming of age novel a novel of loss all these describe the book but don't come close to naming what it is recommended","662":"i make a point of trying to read whatever african fiction comes across my path but this is only the second work i've read from zimbabwe the other was shimmer chinodya's 1991 book harvest of thorns from my amateur perspective it appears that the bulk of post colonial african fiction concerned itself with recounting the colonial condition the struggle for independence and the disappointments of life under native dictators zimbabwe's independence came a bit later than most but harvest of thorns manages to hit all three of these themes quite well and so i would recommend it as well worth reading before you pick this book up what this collection of linked stories about a young girl named darling does is explore what seems to be the current fixation of the african fiction that makes it to america namely getting the hell out of africa to a better place and the toll that takes on the soul see for example americanah and ghana must go in the first half of this book we see contemporary zimbabwe through the eyes of 10 year old darling and her daily life in a shanty town it's a rich and colorful portrait of a place but it's hard not to feel like each chapter story was designed to highlight some particular issue for example one chapter focuses on a hucksterish christian pastor another on the toll of aids another on chinese penetration of africa another on rape another on inept international aid assistance another on mob rule and although bylawayo does a nice job weaving all of these issues into darling's life via her family and friends some readers might feel like there was a checklist of topics that she was ticking off with each part one exception is the flashback chapter detailing the shocking razing of her middle class neighborhood that led to her current shanty town life the second half of the book is about darling's dislocation and culture shock in america as she joins her aunt in destroyed michigan one of the many bits of wordplay that dot the book and one that is far too on the nose to be effective this while also generally well written and described is somewhat less interesting if only for its familiarity there are some engaging scenes i especially liked the chapter where darling skips school with two other girls one american one nigerian and they karaoke watch internet porn and later get in an argument in which the two african girls mock the american girl's way of speaking on the whole i suppose the book is well worth reading by those unfamiliar with contemporary africa and or those unfamiliar with contemporary african immigrants in america it does a fine job of conveying a lot of each experience personally i didn't find too much in it i hadn't previously encountered or thought about","663":"i really tried but i found this book very difficult to get into and to understand the prose a noble experiment but for me it didn't work","664":"exquisitely written account of a young woman's journey from zimbabwe to america deep beautiful thought provoking and honest it will haunt me and any other thoughtful reader for a long time","665":" noviolet bulawayo's first novel made the 2013 booker shortlist which gives an insight into her talent we need new names is the story of darling a young child living in poverty in a zimbabwean shanty town darling and her friends run riot amid the squalor and their games innocently reflect the horror going on around them darling eventually escapes this environment and moves to the usa where she struggles to get to grips with her new life she feels the strings attaching her to her old country but knows she can never go back the first half of the book is both amusing and shocking as darling describes the games she plays with her friends however the second half is a more mundane account of a young immigrant in a new country that said there is one chapter called how they lived which is as good an account of the experiences of a third world migrant to the new world as i've ever read gems like this chapter make we need new names a very worthwhile addition to african literature","666":" about the book a good read it follows darling the main character from childhood in zimbabwe to her teenage years in america it's a story that i appreciated because i could relate to a lot of the transitions darling had to go through adjusting to life in america i think the author did a great job with portraying how most people living outside the u s view america and how that view changes once they actually live in america she also touched on the disconnect that one can feel with their homeland after living in the states for a while which i appreciated i loved the ending the truth of chipo's words stung and i know it is something that will stay with me about the audiobook i listened to this book on cd book and oh my god i loved listening to this the narrator robin miles was amazing it felt like there were multiple narrators the way she was able to switch up her voice her accent was on point better than most actors even her inflection and tone was as if she was darling and darling was her i would absolutely recommend listening to this audiobook it is on par with junot diaz's audio for this is how you lose her","667":"wonderful book story told in the voice of a girl living in an african slum town and then immigrates to usa simple telling that keeps the you reading sometimes with a chuckle or intrigue or horror or anger or tenderness","668":"the book gives glimpse of life and suffering in zimbabwe once the lead character moves to america there is pain and suffering of another sorts the book can be more elaborate transition from africa to america should've been more detailed decent exposure to the circumstances i would say","669":"i thought the first part set in zimbabwe was wonderful darling who tells her story in the first person is a young african girl whose childhood is spent in her war ravaged homeland blighted by poverty famine and violence yet her life is filled with games adventures and friends who leave an indelible heart wrenching and vibrant mark on darling as well as the reader then she manages to immigrate to america destroyedmeechigan where her aunt fostina lives and her story becomes the immigrant experience interesting but not nearly as compelling as her life in zimbabwe with its ngos and stolen guavas and children with names like bastard","670":"very intriguing engaging and eye opening sometimes had to stop reading to process some of the images but i really enjoyed it","671":"really interesting book a young girl from africa moves to the us the first half of book is her life in africa which we see as fraught with problems but to her is her life second half of book in the us which we expect to be better is fraught with problems opens your eyes to the feelings of what it's like to leave your home to go to a safer better place which is so strange very interesting","672":"t finish it i did not like it at all and couldn't finish it","673":"there is so much i could say about this novel which has one of the most completing heroines i've meet in a while but i will just say that you should read it","674":"in the great timeline of gangs or urchins running the line between charming and menacing i think it starts for me with dodger and the lads and their mild corruption of oliver from there my time line of gangs and urchins passes through the double deckers ralph jack and piggy in lord of the flies danny smiffy and plug in the bash street kids chas mcgill and his mates in robert westall's the machine gunners and the menacing wormsley common gang in graham green's short story the destructors but not since oliver and dodger have i been as enticed and intrigued by a gang of kids as i was by no violet bulawayo's cast of zimbabwean street urchins darling bastard godknows chipo sbho and stina are as good as anything conjured up by dickens golding or greene in my view in fact there's a wonderfully dickensian feel to the whole book it's subject matter could have been a bit too traumatic a bit too raw a bit too down in the hands of someone with less skill it could have been a modern day bleak house and in some senses it is a pretty bleak story in two pretty bleak settings zimbabwe followed by the us but in fact it's a wonderful book that pulls your emotions every which way saved from being overly bleak by a cast of unforgettable characters and infused with a sharply observed humour some of it very dark from the first page to the last it tells the story of ten year old darling the narrator and her friends on the streets of their zimbabwean shanty town the ironically named paradise it follows their lives which are in many ways about as far removed as you can get from the apparently privileged safe and structured lives that kids in the west enjoy this is their life after school not as in something which happens at the end of the school day but as in something which happened after the opportunity to go to school disappears from their lives thanks to mugabe's idea of independence they roam around chat and steal guavas to slate their hunger regardless of the later consequences for their bowel movements they get up to mischief they run riot though never really in a way that's harmful and they play games that are influenced by their perception of the world beyond zimbabwe including find bin laden and the country game the country game is their version of a sort of last man standing and it's got resonance for both the first part of the book and the second part for the country the kids most want to be is the usa and the countries they most want to avoid are those in africa which have little chance of winning the game and at the top of the list of these weak countries is their own zimbabwe if you'd like to read the rest of my review of we need new names you can find it at http theonlywayisreading com 2013 1","675":"an incredible look at the journey of a young girl from zimbabwe to michigan u s very real characters and an important critique of the ignorant privilege of so many white americans","676":"being a child in a war torn country coming of age life of immigrants in the us this book mixes all of these topics but it all makes sense since all the stories are connected to darling's life there are no big stories in this book but all these little happy and sad episodes that make up a life","677":"brilliant and gritty gritty by necessity i think a reader could not fully experience the story if it was toned down i will be looking at our america every ad every news report every movie and song in a very new light","678":"gut wrenching heart breaking and beautiful","679":"novel written by young woman from zimbabwe story is about a 10 year old's journey from young childhood in africa to teens in detroit lots of insights","680":"i didn't love this book as much as i wanted to imo americannah was a much better story on a similar theme the novel seemed to progress over time while leaving huge chunks out i felt like i wanted to know what happened in the lapses some characters just came and went with no explanation darling was a reliable narrator and was at her best as she told of her unfolding life in michigan","681":" a bit of a slow starter for me but i soon fell in love with darling the young protagonist at the centre of this novel i really liked reading a novel set in contemporary zimbabwe a country that is certainly within the international conciousness as facing difficulties but doesn't seem to actually feature in news coverage i also liked the switch to the united states where darling perhaps doesn't have the ideal immigrant experience that sometimes appears in such novels bulwayo has a really interesting style although i did feel like the random non narrative chapters that are interspersed throughout the novel weren't so successful i loved her character building as well in addition to darling the other young friends and pretty much every character darling encounters are excellently drawn","682":" the first part of this book showed the author describing life in zimbabwe darling and her friends play their games in the midst of aids white ngos and poverty for me this was the better part of the novel the second part of the book tells of darling's life in america this section of the book seems more disjointed but i found the story of the three young women watching porn one of the better chapters maybe i have read too many similar books in the 70s to be really impressed but there were some evocative moments throughout the book","683":"complete love hate relationship with this book definitely hard to digest at times","684":"it hardly seems like it can have been more than 20 years since i spent a semester in zimbabwe as a college student this book snapped me back to those memories but also viscerally evokes how much zimbabwe has changed fallen apart in the years since bulawayo charges through her narrative like a merciless township lorry a heartbreaking book about the diaspora of a country that was once the hope of the front line states","685":"a brutally honest book about growing up in the third world and then immigrating to the us highly recommend to all","686":"i like that darling analyzes the beauties and flaws in each of her homes zimbabwe and michigan the book is divided relatively equally between the two places and she continues to grapple with that division in her own life throughout the entire novel i liked the stream of consciousness style and the occasional use of we and us that really brought the reader into the story of darling's life 4 5 5 stars rounded down read for the #readharder challenge #8 read an african author","687":"a well written perspective on the zimbabwean diaspora experience","688":" this was a truly amazing book a first novel by this zimbabwean writer who won the caine prize for african writing a year or two ago it gives you a tiny taste of the emotional and day to day life of an african villager who then becomes a u s immigrant the first half of the book takes place in a shantytown village in zimbabwe after the villagers' substantial homes were destroyed by the government based on real life incidents about 2008 the homes were of people who had voted against the reigning government i believe the narrator is a 10 year old girl darling running with a gang of kids stealing guavas from an upscale neighborhood's trees making up creative games etc after their school was closed for good she becomes a 14 and then a 17 year old who has come to the u s at 11 the voices of each age seem so true to life from the innocence of the 10 year old trying to make sense of the adults surrounding her and their very adult issues to the typical american teenager with a whatever mentality there are so many memorable moments like the white ngo people coming to bring food etc and their taking pictures of the kids without permission we are careful not to touch the ngo people though because we can see that even though they are giving us things they do not want to touch us or for us to touch them we want as a society and as individuals to the right thing by our international community but do we have to get our hands dirty to do that maybe her metaphors and descriptions are so striking too many to even begin to count when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands it is unimaginable to me the number of conflicting emotions upon leaving your homeland wretched in many ways but still home to lead a life physically comfortable in a country which you feel will never totally accept you leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same darling's vantage point on america certainly points the finger at our shortcomings and sometimes just our foibles in america the fatness is not the fatness i was used to at home over there the fatness was of bigness just ordinary fatness you could understand because it meant the person ate well fatness you could even envy but this american fatness take sit to a whole 'nother level and description goes on as you can imagine and sometimes it's just the difficulty of adjusting whether it be language or whatever the problem with english is this you usually can't open your moth and it comes out just like that first you have to think what you want to say then you have to find the words then you have to carefully arrange those words in your head then you have to say the words quietly to yourself to make sure you got them okay and finally the last step which is to say the words out loud and have them sound just right english is like a huge iron door and you are always losing the keys do i hear an amen from all non native speakers everywhere i wish there was some way to really connect with those outside our own narrow culture to not be like one of the white characters he has traveled all over africa but all he can ever tell you about the countries he has visited are the animals and parks he has seen but it's a lot easier said than done one final comment i've read recently that it's become quite politically incorrect to talk about african writers generalizing to a whole continent such disparate cultures but i note in this book and especially in a wonderful interview with the author by a nigerian woman author on litquake's podcast in may of this year that there is no mention of this i sensed a solidarity between the two women as africans especially as the interviewer opened with a quote from a nigerian critic who said this was the best book on africa he'd read in a decade both for content and writing i know it will stay with me a long time","689":" this book grabbed me it challenged my assumptions and beliefs darling's life in the slums of zim and her transition to life in the united states are captivating stealing guava playing countries aids elections evangelism politics rape beauty ngos and aid chld abuse hunger love caring poverty alcholism fear belonging family education friendship escape kill the boers it is all there and as we listen to darling's voice we see it all has a strange beauty and synergy she brings a keen intelligence and curiosity to her world and her place in it asking herself and us many many questions what is an african why do whites take photographs of us what good are democracy and human rights whose country is it what is the difference between them and us here and there dreams and reality","690":"interesting to note parallels with americanah americans smile all the time shallowly and not to be trusted fitting into a new country an african setting realized what what for and so on made me smile each time i came upon it i liked the voice of this one better than americanah and felt more involved in the lives of the children than i did with thirty girls","691":"see my review here https whatmeread wordpress com 2015","692":" npr u0026amp junot diaz gave glowing reviews so i picked it up a candid look of growing up in modern zimbabwe and a later escape to america not fitting in displacement the immigrant experience homesickness dashed hopes of america but thankful nevertheless wonderful smooth writing and a fearless prime character had me finishing this book in a day can't wait to see more from ms bulawayo on her mother sometimes she is just silent like that with her head held like a heavy melon in both hands like somebody told her be careful or your head will fall on the ground and smash into red impossible pieces when the children are scared that their parents haven't come back from a journey i am thinking i want my mother too even though when they are here we really don't care about them then after just a little while even before we are proper wet the rain stops and the sun comes out and pierces like it wants to show the rain who is who we sit and get cooked in it","693":"sad and poignant story very well written and felt very real","694":" i don't think i've ever rated a book based mostly on its second last chapter but i think that's what i did here for the majority of this book i thought it was an average read the first part with the child narrator in zimbabwe was ok but so scattered and not overly interesting how many times can the kids steal guavas eat guavas get constipated from guavas it felt like a bunch of observations and anecdotes some standalone short stories even not really a cohesive novel then the child immigrates to america and grows up and there are some wonderful moments like discovering that you can buy almost anything over the phone that people throw away food regularly that toilets flush by themselves and great scenes and moments that made me smile at my own memories of discovering the supermarkets and the tv channels and people who won't touch a doorknob which i still don't understand anyway the second last chapter titled \"how they lived\" is a stunning piece of writing that brought all of the second half together for me it should be read by anyone who is anti immigration or who believes in the sweeping deportation of illegal immigrants not only is it an agonizing account of how often people go to other countries because it's literally life or death not to steal your jobs or corrupt your world but it is a beautiful raw piece about the hidden pain of those who leave home the knowledge that this land is not your land and never will be and the strangeness and tension that doesn't quite leave a few months ago i went home after a long time and didn't notice at first that my whole demeanor had changed that invisible thing pressing down on me constantly in my new country was suddenly gone and i was light and ok and i could breathe again that second last chapter knows why you promise your parents you'll be back next year the year after definitely next year next year for sure and often the parents left behind are thinking of you over here in the abstract they think you've grown selfish and forgotten them that you don't love them enough to visit not that you have a real life and a job with barely any vacation time or a spouse or children in school and certainly not that you don't have enough money to go back because everyone in america is rich and so much time goes by and they don't know how much it aches to not go back they don't know because you don't tell them and you don't tell them because you try not to think about it and these misunderstandings fester until one day you call and there are nephews and nieces you don't know and there's nothing to say because you don't even know these people anymore or you get those middle of the night phone calls which at first seem to be annoying all these years and they still don't remember the time difference but that turn out to be the phone call you knew would come one day and it takes you two days to get home and you miss the funeral or worse you can't leave the country at all because you don't have the papers to get back in bulawayo writes a small scene in this chapter about putting on loud music so no one will hear and wailing wailing wailing over the grief of a dead parent you never saw again i am the target audience for a book like this so my enthusiasm is skewed i'm sure especially since i was lukewarm for the first half of the book bulawayo is great at scenes and emotive writing but not yet too skilled with structure there were so many ideas that could have and should have had their own book instead of small mentions child rape and child pregnancy incest aids mugabe's bulldozing starvation suicide and christian fundamentalism are just a few of the topics crammed in here 3 5 rounded up","695":" the first 150 pages or so of new names is brilliant five star worthy and then as is said so often throughout the book winking in the direction of achebe things fall apart the book loses its richness that wonderful blend of humour and darkness and everything else and at times becomes no more than a half thought out tract about the migrant experience in america about how americans let their kids run wild and eat too much food and how there's all kinds of horrific porn on the internet there are a few moments in the second 150 that are good but really an editor needed to step in and say no the story didn't need to stay rooted in childhood in zimbabwe but everything that was right about the first bit was missing in the second she stopped fleshing out characters perhaps with the exception of tshaka zulu incidents happened that had basically no impact no meaning to the reader no reason for us to care sometimes it wasn't even clear if these incidents were meaningful to our hero she lost her ability to describe the mundane in an endearing way and instead everything was dull and dry and bland like it was a first draft that was really about nothing that somehow made its way into a published book soooooo frustrating after a killer opening","696":"written by the zimbabwean author noviolet bulawayo we need new names is actually an extension of her caine prize winning short story hitting budapest the book is about a native zimbabwean girl and her perspective on living in a country which is suffering from hunger unemployment inflation and aids read the full review http www indiabookstore net bookish","697":"riveting if you like americanah or anything by adichie you would love this book","698":"a young girl in zimbabwe with her group of childhood friends she ends up in the us with an auntreminded me of say you're one of them","699":" actual rating would be closer to 3 5 stars i had high expectations when i picked up this book and it mostly lived up to them i did struggle a bit with the narrative at first but when i got used to it i liked it a lot while the book tells a coherent story it also feels like you could read the chapters as short stories they stand alone very well some of them are painful to read veiling the problems african countries face some of them are delightful and fun to read all in all though it's kind of a sad book with a lot of big themes what i liked is that they're not thrust into your face but cleverly woven into the story as a whole i know i cannot relate to most of the issues but i also feel this book gave me insight into what is going on elsewhere in the world","700":" this one was pretty solidly a 3 5 for me i think with rounding four stars goodreads when will you get more granular this is a novel built of loosely connected stories narrated by darling a girl growing up first in zimbabwe and then in michigan she's barely adolescent in the first part of the book and is in her college years by its end the stories in between show us darling's world as it changes and gets more complicated as she starts to see things through more adult eyes view spoiler so the first thing to know is that this is a fairly brutal book darling's voice is vibrant and strong but her world is a violent and impoverished place it's also a place based on gaping chasms between the haves and the have nots with darling always on the side of the have nots the first story arguably the strongest follows darling and her gang of young friends as they pillage the guava trees of a rich neighborhood this isn't just norman rockwell childish hijinks they love guavas and later in life darling will miss them with deep nostalgia but they're literally foraging to feed themselves one of them a girl named chipo is pregnant by her grandfather we later learn another friend godknows has rips in his clothes that leave him half naked and all the kids are on the lookout for property owners and security guards who will chase them out of the neighborhood darling narrates all of this in her matter of fact way up to and including their discovery of a dead woman hanging from a tree the woman's body spooks the kids until one of them a boy named bastard points out that they can sell the woman's shoes to buy bread many stories later we learn that the dead woman committed suicide because she like many others was infected with hiv so it's that kind of book darling is a wonderful amazing narrator she's unflinching and mean and bold and smart and naive in all the right ways almost no adult in her world escapes shades of guilt in this story because the fact is that almost no adult isn't implicated in the violence poverty and misery of darling's zimbabwe at the same time many adults are also victims darling's own father is absent leaving her mother alone to raise their daughter by selling goods and possibly herself but when he returns from south africa in the final stages of aids it's clear that he too is a pitiable figure the book's most scathing renditions are reserved for clueless white people and particularly for clueless white americans in one story darling and her friends witness a black mob overtake the home of a white african couple people who protest that they were born here as were their parents regardless they live in luxury while black zimbabweans suffer and die and so their house is trashed and they're led off to an uncertain end this is one of the chasms that darling sees so clearly which somehow seem invisible to the wealthy minority another is the chasm between america even relatively poor america and africa when she leaves zimbabwe and moves to live with her aunt in michigan darling has to grapple with america as a real place instead of a fantasy land bulawayo handles this with varying degrees of success in one of the weaker stories darling attends the marriage of a white american woman to a black african immigrant man the man needs a visa the woman is fat and can't find an american husband this is darling's cool discomforting assessment there's something a bit off about this setup maybe because in this case darling is allowed to give us her version of things without any challenge or complication from what we see happening around her the bride's white son acts up horribly a white woman says well intentioned but benighted things to darling in the bathroom it's a cavalcade of white americans behaving badly and while it's doubtless i do not doubt it true that this happens it doesn't make for good fiction it feels like a pile on or a venting session rather than a carefully focused view of the many different factors at play this is tricky territory because i don't want to argue against american culpability or white culpability or the general culpability of privilege in the face of the inequity and injustice that darling endures some people are more at fault than others that is true some people behave badly and others behave well but some of bulawayo's stories feel more nuanced and layered ironically for me the ones narrated by darling as a younger child it's a real technical challenge to imbue a child narrator with a real and believable voice while also giving the reader enough room to see around that child and understand the world in ways that she can't bulawayo does a terrific job at this but when darling grows older she seems to lose her way stories about darling going to the mall working crummy jobs and watching internet porn with friends seem to wander without much direction i found myself craving more of a sense of her development and the changes in her personality and perspective hide spoiler bulawayo does gives us some moving passages about darling's growing loneliness and disaffection as she moves into adulthood but by the end of the book i felt as if we'd just brushed the surface a whole other book could be written about where darling goes from here making her way as an illegal immigrant in a country that is racist unjust and more full of opportunity than her own homeland maybe bulawayo will write that book if so i'll read it","701":" not bad i enjoyed where the book went by the end but found the opening african chapters interesting but not overly engaging a worthy read once you take into account the author's story but as a stand alone piece i find it one of the surprising entries in this year's booker 2013 longlist read it if you've never read much african fiction and there's definitely something extra in it for people who have left one culture for another and find themselves unable to completely identify with either over time overall this was just an 'okay' read for me not bad but not great","702":"if this book actually had a storyline or point i think i missed it although an interesting story of a girls life before and after moving to america i likely would have given up on it 100 pages in had i not been reading it for a book club","703":"loved everything about this story and grieved for the lost hopes people realize in america","704":"this book was chosen as part of my syllabus for the course africa in the 21st century i found the process interesting but i just wasn't able to connect with the flow of the narrative i felt like some of the plot points were really laborious to read and didn't influence the overall narrative i did enjoy some of the descriptive language but ultimately this book fell very very flat for me","705":" noviolet bulawayo contrasts life growing up in zimbabwe vs the u s through the voice of darling a pre adolescent impoverished girl living in a dysfunctional country as the story begins in zimbabwe life is mostly about finding enough to eat although she and her friends both girls and boys also have the spirit of play and keep busy since the schools are shuttered inventing games that they play over and over strangely after aunt fostalina brings darling to live with her family in michigan while materially life is better always food in the fridge in many other ways it is not the voice of darling is the centerpiece of the novel as she tries to understand herself and her surroundings in a hard place where she is at home to an easy place that socially and emotionally and legally she doesn't feel at home this is the most entertainingly bleak novel i have read since sherman alexie's the absolutely true diary of a part time indian","706":"this is more like 3 5 stars i devoured the book found it fascinating but did not care for the ending that is why i could not go up to four","707":"the first half set in zimbabwe was impressive and shocking but the story felt less authentic in the second part","708":"fabulous book by a very talented author this is about a girl from zimbabwe who moves to the u s when she is a pre teen the first half of the novel is in zimbabwe which she continues to call my country the 2nd half is in michigan both parts of the book are excellent searing and sad but they feel totally truthful the descriptions of the immigrant experience are especially strong and moving","709":" we need new name is the story of darling a girl who describes her childhood in zimbabwe and her later experiences in the united states the authors weaves an interesting story while offering commentary on cultural exchange the meaning of home and citizenship racism and living with hardship violence uncertainty and poverty the book raises questions about the ownership of stories and experiences and how stories are used to describe and define entire countries continents and populations it reminded me of chimamand ngozi adichie's americanah exploring similar themes and challenging me to consider my own thinking in similar ways as a whole the novel is lovely the chapter titled how they lived is among the most beautiful chapters of fiction i have read in some time","710":"very unique writing style great story teller","711":"first darling is a young girl living a bare existence in zimbabwe longing for a fantasy life in the far away united states of america then darling a young teen is living an outsider's life in the u s longing for the country family and friends she left behind darling's struggles and disenfranchisement and small joys shed light on the realities of emigration and immigration and not having a country of your own","712":"this was a fascinating book ever wonder what it might be like to be a child living in poverty in an unstable african country wonderful vivid writing long listed for the man booker prize some disturbing violence sexual content language just a heads up","713":"i guess i've been on a bit of an african set novel streak lately maybe blame that on what my local library is stocking so this is another one of my latest reads i find i'm enjoying reading about a continent i know very little about and a lifestyle my middle class white north american self can little relate to anywho the book itself is set in modern zimbabwe a country which has rapidly devolved since the 1980s when it was seen as a powerhouse of emerging africa darling is a girl who began life relatively privileged but somewhere in the upheaval of the president's dictator's new policies her family suffers and finds themselves living in a slum later darling moves to america to live with her aunt her aunt works hard to improve the lot of her african family while darling her cousin aunt and uncle live a working class lifestyle for all her dreams of america to me it seems like darling can't help but miss the life she had in africa as american as she tries to become she is never quite there i did find the ending to be a bit abrupt and would have liked to know if she ever went back to africa or if she went to college but that's the trend in novels the non ending ending c'est le vie","714":"i really liked this book overall the stream of consciousness style was really unique in this perspective and darling's narrative really allowed me an american to kind of see myself through a different lens however the book kind of ruined itself for me in its callous treatment of eating disorders an incredibly short section yes but still insensitive enough to bump it down from a four to a three","715":" very compelling best scene is when the oblivious white ngos arrive snapping tons of pictures and giving away pointless gifts of plastic toy guns and shirts that say google on them the second half of the book is a bit less vibrant when the protagonist moves to destroyedmichygen but perhaps that is intentional becoming more american and acculturated dulls the vibrance the ending left me feeling a bit jarred not sure how i felt about the way it all concluded a great first novel and i look forward to reading more from this talented author in the future","716":" nice and interesting book in every way a pleasant read and pretty fast one too i have to admit i'm not too experienced in different ethnicies and their cultural literature even though i have all the reasons to be i mean i am on a cultural studies program and even considered having anthropology as my major but somehow i've found myself tied tight to contemporary gender studies here in northern parts of the world instead i think it's about time i started experimenting we need new names first charmed me with its descriptions and portrayals everyday occurances games and adventures that very well illustrated the cultural crash of different social classes and differences in power and importance dirt hunger and the ascetic life most have been pushed to from considerably higher standards of living are brought out clear yet in a quite cultivated way so even though the author clearly has a lot of knowledge and experience on how the life may be when you live in the middle of discord and power play and people getting sick and tired and risking their health and hopes to get something better the images weren't all that dark or accusitave or helpless life goes on as it usually does the childlike wishes to get away and do better than survive came true to some of the characters who then had to balance between different cultures their expectations and their roots and family they had left behind all in all i found this a very informative yet with a hopeful positive overtone that did a very good job at keeping me interested","717":"hmmm what to say about this the plot is not really there so much of it is cliched sentence structure is all over the place and jarring and she uses the phrase things fall apart about 20 times no joke but the voice is powerful nihilistic and stays with you what a voice for that it gets a 3 4","718":"maybe i came late to the party on this book but i just didn't find anything new in it in fact i tried skipping ahead in it to see if i could get through the childhood in africa part and even then i was disappointed i gave up","719":"wonder what it's like to live in a small village in zimbabwe wonder what it's like to be a young african immigrant living in the us this book can give you the insight into another world","720":"amazing voice i was impressed with the way bulawayo captured both a 10 year old's experience in zimbabwe and later a teenager's experience in the us i liked the way she expressed the effects of political upheaval in zimbabwe through the lived experience of children in harare","721":" there was a lot about this book that i liked the love that the author has for her country zimbabwe is obvious as are her understandably mixed feelings about leaving i was ignorant about the 1990s social and political scene in zimbabwe british rule mugabe aids poverty etc but didn't feel lost reading this because of bulawayo's use of a child narrator darling my biggest complaint is that personally i prefer more character interiority and these characters felt a bit flat to me despite that the story arc of darling's move to america kept me interested and reading","722":" another reminder that while growing up in the usa i had no idea what the experience of an immigrant was no idea that we were sheltering and offering new lives to people and no idea what they had experienced to make them live in the usa i also didn't realise that living in the usa didn't mean you didn't miss home couldn't visit home and return without a visa in total i thought that immigrants who made their home in the usa wanted to be there rather than wanting to be home but home wasn't a place you could live","723":"2 1 2 stars subject matter compelling but done in a meandering way i wanted to like it more but i keep thinking it could've been done better","724":"it was a disappointment the subject matter was interesting but i just could not care about these characters the whole book felt disjointed","725":"one of the books in which i got to experience the growth of the characters ms bulawayo has told the story quite brilliantly she has successfully managed to make the readers experience the happiness carefree ness anxiety and energy of children and later the pain of separation longing and the feeling of accepting your fate and living with the numb pain last book that i remember made such an impression on me was pigeon english by stephen kelman","726":"really cute coming of age novel for an expat coming of age in america i wish it would have had a little more plot but it was a good read nonetheless","727":"not as good as i thought it would be it was too easy to put down and there was one chapter in the middle that was more of a rant and not part of the story line can't imagine it will win the man booker","728":"i received this as part of a goodreads giveaway the novel was pretty good it was different from what i expected but i liked it i could relate a little bit to the character's life in america feeling stuck between two cultures two totally different worlds but other than that i couldn't really understand the main character all that well","729":"especially the first half of the book was incredible i cried more than five times within the first 50 pages the book touches on so many topics but all of them only slightly it never directly addresses some of the topics but mentions them almost like it was an accident this is the power of the book you get to read between the lines a lot you get to discover the horrible truths youself a tragic tragic book that never spoon feeds you","730":"impressive first novel i'll be looking for more from this author","731":"this is one of those books that is going to follow me around for the next week or two poking at my brain with its curious questions and strange voice the narrator of this novel reminds me of scout finch darling and her friends make up games to play in the front yard but instead of boo radley it's find bin laden she is also young u0026amp innocent lacking the vocabulary to describe what she witnesses when the story shifts and darling is in america the narration is even more phenomenal my favorite is the wedding scene describing an obese white woman a wonderful coming of age tale that is both breath taking and heartbreaking","732":" you can see that i've rated it 4 stars but i'm still dubious about it so i might change it later i'm not very sure how i feel about it right now at one end of the spectrum nothing really happens it's a story that flows and flows with nothing as such what we call a plot on another end it's a story with which i instantly connected though i have nothing in common with the main protagonist i think it lacked coherence as various characters sprout off in places who had nothing much to do there are incoherent scenes as well i'm just gonna end this review here because it's not making any sense anyway","733":" we need new names starts with the story of ten year old darling in a zimbabwe slum mugabe's so called land grabs are in full effect all opposition is being brutally supressed and the sense of hopelessness is palpable amid such hell darling and her friends among them boys called bastard and godknows scour rich suburbs for guavas and play 'country games' which facilitate their dreams of escape noviolet bulawayo's first novel plunges deep into the eroding and increasingly abused culture and tradition of the region from the crazily drawn prophet revelations bitchington mborro to a faith healer called vodloza who claims to cure all ailments from aids and epilepsy to bad luck getting visas especially to usa and britain when they are not squatting in agony from gorging on too many guavas a fruit notorious for causing constipation darling and her friends create new games in a graveyard called heavenway i used to be very afraid of graveyards and death and such things says darling but not anymore there is just no sense being afraid when you live so near the graves it would be like the tongue fearing the teeth the device of telling a truly horrific tale of a nation through the prism of a young and innocent narrator is of course nothing new but bulawayo utilises it to excellent effect steering the reader into becoming a sort of supporting cast for darling and her crew of rascals and making the horrors when they do arrive all the more devastating for the naive incomprehension with which they are described unlike her friends darling does have an escape route an aunt who is already ensconsed in the united states or as darling describes it destroyedmichyegan as she enters her teenage years darling's story switches across the atlantic and becomes one of one of an innocent expatriate struggling to adapt in a land of plenty again nothing new but told with no false notes and a touching simplicity which renders even everyday adjustment more powerful in light of what happened before when the microwave says nting tk takes out a pizza and eats it when the microwave says nting again he takes out the chicken wings and then it's the burritos and the hot dogs eat eat eat all that food tk eats in one day me and mother and mother of bones would eat in maybe two or three days back home i have one issue with the book i'm a huge fan of interlinked short stories which add up to a novel whole the most obvious example being jamil ahmad's utterly magnificent the wandering falcon but bulawayo's book seems caught a little between two stools in that respect darling's life unfurls in eighteen stand alone chapters yet as they are almost entirely chronological there doesn't seem a lot of point all it really does it break up the natural narrative that said we need new names is a very touching book told from the heart by an author whose own journey from zimbabwe to the united states mainly mirrors that of her subject and while i'm a little surprised to see it on the man booker prize longlist i'm also delighted to see it get its due like darling herself this is a book you really can't help cheering on from the sidelines","734":"i'm bummed i have abandoned the book at page 75 it in my opinion just was not interesting at all the character development was slow and awkward the story wasn't moving along at a speed that kept me interested at 75 pages in the story wasn't going much of anywhere even though i know from reading summaries of the book it does go somewhere but i questioned how tedious the journey might be when i started scanning and flipping through sections of the book this has become a sure sign that i am considering abandoning the title i stop reading for a moment and start flipping and skimming to see if i can gauge whether it is going to pick up the pace or not bulawayo takes the reader through 10 year old darling from a shantytown in zimbabwe to america from my scanning the story line really never gained speed nor did character development i'm so bummed i was super excited to pick up this book and i felt it held a lot of potential but it was a tedious read and the stack of books i have on my nightstand that i believe hold some good and engaging reads ultimately prevailed","735":"read for the book riot read harder challenge task #8 a book by an author from africasome absolutely stunning writing in this one which isn't always what i notice most about a book but it was hard to ignore here i've seen some other reviews that didn't like how much the author put in the book that felt that a narrower focus or clearer plot line would have helped and i sort of agree i responded to this better once i started thinking of it as a series of interrelated short stories about a fascinating central character rather than looking for a clear narrative thread that wasn't going to emerge 3 5 5 stars","736":"a thought provoking look at african identity in the modern age of immigration and dispora with a light and often comical tone this book is made for bedside table","737":"amazing i don't want to forget so many of the wonderful lines in this novel those of us who give up our homelands live with quiet knowledge nestled in our blood like an incurable disease even as we are here we are tied to somewhere else","738":"i liked a few of the moments and reflections in this book but in the end i just found myself bored and struggling to finish","739":"a superb book what a great debut novel and an exciting new voice with something different to say other than the usual western viewpoint","740":"recently i've been reading novels of recent immigrants to the us from other places in the world and think this is a good one as i read this one i had in mind americanah and nomad diaries and doris lessing's african novels set in zimbabwe then rhodesia fascinating to get this perspective from someone in the thick of the worst of it in that country and then the culture shock of the us of a","741":"i wanted to love this book but i had a tough time with it she really captures so much beauty and heartbreak in both leaving africa and coming to the us though","742":"what a lovely coming of age tale the more i read it the more i loved it and i continued loving it till it got to the end and i was like eh where is the rest of the book still","743":"this is one of those books that i'll be thinking about for awhile if half stars were an option this would get 3 5 the book is written from the perspective of darling a 10 year old girl in post mugabe zimbabwe her home those of her friends and their schools have been bulldozed their lives are divided into before and after now they live in shanties stealing guavas and making up games to pass the time darling is sent to live with her aunt in the us and the narrative style changes as she ages and becomes americanized she gives what is likely a realistic account of what life can be like for an illegal immigrant","744":"couldn't get past page 5 might have been good story but those names really bogged me down","745":"this book is tough the stories of life in the zimbabwe homeland and life in america as an immigrant are both heartwarming and heartbreaking we'll worth reading","746":"this is not a book it is the book","747":" review i picked this book up toward the end of 2013 or beginning of 2014 and didn't realize i had both a kindle and the audio addition then i realized that this would fit for the cat challenge for december then i realized that it made a great companion read with elizabeth costello by j m coetzee who has one section on the novel in africa which debates whether there really is a difference to novels from and by africans i enjoyed this story written by a young woman about the refugee experience and immigrant experience to america like others i enjoyed the first part best even though darling the protagonist is a refugee in zimbabwe she is happy the second part is set in america and captures the immigrant experience and the illegals experience in america and is not as happy i liked the protagonist voice i liked the readers rendition the first part was a little hard to follow so having the whispersync was very handy once in america it was easier to understand this book made the long list for the booker first sentence we are on our way to budapest bastard and chipo and godknows and sbho and stina and me last words and the delicious delicious smell of lobels bread","748":"we wanted to put our heads in their mouths to catch every precious word every feeling the language in this book is just beautiful","749":"powerful story sometimes too elaborate in details","750":"not always an easy read but a fascinating tale of a young girl trying to understand the very confusing world around her","751":"though provoking look at zimbabwe while we are safely tucked into our first world countries my book group found the narrative flow and lack of climax and ending a bit off putting but it was a solid read","752":"i chose this for book club but it was crapthe first half in africa was ok but the bit in america was formulaic and box tickingread americanah if you want this topic done well","753":"painful but gripping any writer who is able to convey a sense of national pride while simultaneously finding beauty in devastation has a gift noviolet bulawayo she has taken as her name the city of her origin speaks to my love of reading about life in all its horrid realities the book is a needed reminder of the divide between our comfortable lives and the suffering of so many","754":"i am not sure about this book i finished it because i thought i ought to not because i wanted to she is a good writer and there are sentences phrases and even paragraphs that were quite hilarious but the story is too disjointed for me it is a whole lot of chapters narrated by a 10 year old but they read like short stories the first half is set in zimbabwe in a fictional place and the second half set in usa i suppose the problem was i didn't engage with any of the characters i remained on the outside and was not drawn in to the storytelling at all would be interested to see what someone else thinks of it it is definitely not useless just missing something to make it good","755":"it's a fast read i got 3 4 of the way through before i realized i was far from enjoying myself","756":" halfway through this book i almost abandoned it the voices of the children i initially considered to be unique and authentic had become a bit twee and annoying but then our protagonist moved to the usa initially to destroyedmichygen and the stories became more interesting again our protagonist's struggle to find her way in the new environment but helped along by relatives acquaintances from her home country was sometimes fascinating sometimes devastating one chapter in particular was quite upsetting with young teenagers systematically watching very explicit porn after school a few other chapters the author seemed to experiment with a different narration style first person plural but that didn't work for me and i was glad she changed to her more balanced narrative for the last section of the book","757":"absolutely fantastic phenomenal writing with an interesting and well paced storyline noviolet bulawayo has a very original distinct and vibrant voice that shines through on every single page she has a very compelling way of using language to create vivid scenes that make the reader feel as though they are reliving a memory of their own despite how far removed their own experiences might have been from darling's childhood innocence in zimbabwe to her struggle through adolescence in america bulawayo accurately captures the very raw and emotional experiences of her main character with simple and brutal poignancy i devoured this book and i have a feeling this is the kind of book that will stay with me for a while","758":"great story current and true but the telling of the story was incredible","759":"i loved this it was soo innocent and vulgar at the same time but i must say part 1 of the book was better than part 2 nevertheless it was amazing 5 stars","760":"i was looking over the list of books read in the past year and realizing the majority surprise surprise were by white writers not sure why it occurred to me to make this assessment but it resulted in my decision to seek out more writers of colour luckily goodreads and its listopias gave me a place to start we need new names is structured more like a collection of connected stories than it a traditional novel which means each story's ending tends to have impact and to feel resolved there are no quotation marks to denote dialogue either the book feels to me like a hybrid a unique and very specifically created meld of of what cultures written vs oral traditions the kids in these stories are a scrappy fiercely independent band part of the most recent generation of the shanty towns that so many african families call home using this girl voice to tell the stories of her family her band of friends her neighbours works beautifully first the kids are at age where they have wonderful powers of perception they see everything they accept what is because they have precious little to compare 'now' to yet they are privy to some of the adults memories of before secondly the young narrator works because darling's voice is so believable her descriptions whether they are of a burial in zimbabwe or a winter day in detroit are completely unique and feel completely honest i think what i am liking best about bulawayo's writing is the honesty she doesn't try to pull on the reader's heartstrings doesn't sugar coat anything but doesn't go to far in the opposite direction either i really really like noviolet bulawayo's writing i would definitely read something else by her","761":"the best word i can think of to describe this is 'earthy' because there is something about the writing that made me feel how strongly the children were connected to the earth of their country for me the book was less successful when set in the us but maybe that's the point the connection is just not there i just thought that point was more heavy handed but i still enjoyed the book","762":"i recieved this book from the publisher via goodreads giveaway this was a very exciting book and a wonderful coming of age novel that really explores coming to united states and growing up in a word completely different from your own","763":"pros this book made me feel lots of things made me nostalgic and homesick and feel desperately sorry for lots of the characters writing was great i felt like i was really feeling what darling was feeling cons there were no characters i really loved the chapters often felt a little disjointed and the change in time didn't always feel like it made sense felt like it could have done with a bit more editing the end felt a bit abrupt and random","764":"very nicely written although i'd agree with the hushed voices that suggest the excessive african depravities the journey of the african woman into the american girl is amazing the fluency and pace gripping what steals the show here is the circular way of writing which brings you back to previous things like a life lesson only you're just realizing it with the character","765":"meh how do the booker judges choose these books we need new names is similar to a tale for the time being only the latter was pretty good these two books are as similar to each other as last year's harold frye and the lighthouse one would think that the judges would cull out the weaker of the two books before they hit the long list i am still peeved that kate atkinson's life after life did not make the long list especially after having to read so many mediocre books done with the whining i will post a real review later","766":" friendship hope and change are the subjects of noviolet bulawayo's we need new names a native of zimbabwe with a master of fine arts degree from cornell university where she won a truman capote fellowship ms bulawayo writes about the pain of having to leave one's country when things go bad at eleven darling and her friends hungry roam the streets of zimbahwe searching for guavas to steal to fill their bellies darling's family home has been bull dozed by paramilitary police and her father a college graduate has left to go to south africa to work the schools had been closed eventually daring's father who has sent no relief returns to die from aids darling's eleven year old friend chipo has been raped by her grandfather and is pregnant they live in tin shanties but they have been taught to respect their elders the best parts of this book are those which bring to life the youngsters who are darling's playmate stina bastard chipo godknows sbho and the wonderful women who serve as community disciplinarians like mother of bones the hope of all these youngsters is to escape through immigration and in the end almost all scatter to other countries darling comes to america with the help of her aunt fostalena her mother's twin and uncle koko she longs to return to her native land but cannot because her visa has expired she would not then be able to return to america to continue her education they live in fear because they are illegal aliens but they work hard to help the other they left behind bulawayo captures the vitality of the zimbahwe culture the angst of loss and of giving up one's country to be absorbed into the american culture hers is a powerful and original voice","767":" bulawayo had me hooked her language the narrator's clear rich and urgent childs eye point of view and the characters i felt that way about the book overall though once darling moves to the u s the writing lost me a bit i'm pondering that experience as one that may also parallel the narrator's in some way perhaps deliberately and i'm open to that one thing that bugged me throughout the second half were various cultural cues and reference points in darling's experience that felt dropped in and written around and while i got the point and they were important points politically and for the character i felt a little annoyed and wished for more tightly woven narrative around those experiences overall though highly recommended","768":"an impressive first novel though i wonder of that is an accurate description this is more a collection of related short stories starting in zimbabwe and taking our character darling to the usa her heart however remains in her homeland even though her childhood friends question where her allegiances belong worth a read","769":"an average three stars four stars for the beginning and middle two stars for the end i really enjoyed the part when she lived in zimbabwe","770":"honestly this book is captivatingly amazing i know i say that a lot about the african writers i read but maybe that's just because there are so many fresh talents telling so many brilliant stories i loved the raw prose style the choice of a 10 year old allows a whole new perspective on african politics and mugabe type regimes i also loved that bulawayo didn't bother with a happy ending all the way through the book is raw and it stays raw even after the american dream phase her descriptive passages are breathtaking i wanted more at least 200 pages more well worth the wait","771":"a perfect book gorgeous language beautiful structure incredibly original probably the best book i've read all year","772":"i found this book very read able i liked the character development and the author's ability to really capture the voice of darling as she transitioned from a girl in a zimbabwean slum with very middle class roots to a teenage immigrant in america i also thought that aunt fostalina and uncle kojo were very interesting characters i would have loved to know more about them what disappointed me however was the ending it was a really let down the author did a nice job of tying up the various childhood games and i appreciated that but otherwise i thought the ending read more like someone who got tired of writing and wasn't very sure what the climax of the story was but aside from the ending it was a thoroughly enjoyable book","773":" i'm not a fan of this one i think i didn't like the story i found it really depressing i felt like these children from zimbabwe had been failed by their government and corruption and society and then the main character darling goes to the states illegally and just ends up with really crappy jobs and she can't go back home it's just not a happy book aside from the story i liked the writing style and as i did an audio book for this one i liked how the reader's accent changed throughout the book as darling became more acclimatized to the us","774":"an enlightening portrayal of life as an immigrant who are the lucky ones those who remain or those who escape life in the shanty highly recommended and utterly enjoyable","775":"just a description of life not a story","776":"this is the story of a girl growing up in zimbabwe through the tumult of the land uprisings and eventually goes to live with her aunt in america in terms of plot that's about it i generally don't like books with so little plot but it's well written and keeps moving which makes it pretty engaging ultimately it's more of a perspective or a window into a worldview than a specific story","777":"the first bit was very good te way in which known political events were seen through the eyes of a child i did not think the american parts worked nearly so well","778":"book club book and one that led to a good discussion","779":" 4 5 stars rounded up i had read mixed reviews of this novel with comments focussing on it being disjointed or running through a ticklist of african problems to squeeze in them all some have taken issues with the first half of the book some with the second half it is the story of darling she is born in zimbabwe and in the first part of the book she is ten years old darling and her gang of friends chipo godknows bastard stina and sbho do pretty much what children left to their own devices will do in terms of games adventures and getting into trouble they live in a shanty town called paradise and each day has its own particular adventures they often venture into the wealthy white area to steal guava and enjoy a transient sense of importance they all dream of a different life some at home and some in other places like the us the second half of the book follows darling as she moves to live with her aunt in detroit michigan or destroyedmichygen as she calls it we follow her as she grows up and moves on to more adolescent adventures it has taken me a while to pin down what i think of the novel the writing is unusual and idiosyncratic english is not bulawayo's first language this i think means she takes some liberties with the language and takes it to some different places this is refreshing the novel describes difficult experiences but there is an honesty and humour about it which carries it along the chapters take snapshots of events which has led to accusations of disjointedness i didn't find this a problem and for me the book flowed well and was easy to read there were little niggles but not the major problems i was expecting form some of the reviews bulawayo describes very well darling's growing sense of disillusion and alienation as a migrant in america there is a brilliant chapter towards the end of the book entitled \"how they lived\" which describes the migrant experience in a heartfelt and angry way which really hits home i have seen reviews which describe the novel as nihilistic i really don't get that at all it describes poverty and alienation it moves from zimbabwe where conditions were difficult and there was great poverty but darling and her friends seemed full of life and often joy to the us where there is much greater material wealth but it is not home home is an important concept as bulawayo explains \"there are three homes inside mother's and aunt fostalina's heads home before independence before i was born when black people and white people were fighting over the country home after independence when black people won the country and then the home of things falling apart which made aunt fostalina leave and come here home one home two and home three there are four homes inside mother of bones' head home before the white people came to steal the country and a king ruled home when the white people came to steal the country and then there was war home when black people got our stolen country back after independence and then the home of now home one home two home three home four when somebody talks about home you have to listen carefully so you know exactly which one the person is referring to \"if you want to read a more interesting and balanced review than those you will find in the western literary press read the one by nkiacha atemnkeng i have attempted a link here http munyori org essays nkiacha ate the book portrays through the eyes of a child adolescent the effects of imperialism and colonialism and highlights the difficulties of the migrant experience it is also a simple human family story of how life goes on in the face of different types of adversity and oppression i found it refreshing and thought provoking","780":"we need new namesnoviolet bulawayo author debut novelist noviolet bulawayo's we need new names is a book about life identity and finding a place to call home it follows the life of darling a ten year old growing up with her friends in a shantytown in trinidad and follows her trip to america searching for a new life the book has darling as the narrator and it is told believably in the type of language and phrases a child would use to describe her everyday life and concern but there is a definite change in tone and pitch once she leaves her home this book is in many ways two parts rather than a cohesive whole and may have worked better as two distinct sections the story is tightly written and plotted full of surprises and plot point that feel natural and the fact that the ending does not have a contrived feel good ending is also a point strongly in its favour there is much to like in this book that reveals the struggles and challenges that face children in such circumstancestances","781":"bulawayo is an incredibly gifted writer some of her images are so powerful they just reach out and grab you right from the page","782":" it's hard to articulate my thoughts on this book as the son of immigrants but if i had to choose one ultimately reductive adjective to describe it i would have to go with powerful noviolet's voice is lyrical and harsh simultaneously scattered yet sharply focused and at times very emotionally trying without feeling heavy handed one of the most haunting and beautiful chapters in the book how they left features no established characters and is less than two pages long please read this book it is important","783":"i enjoyed the early bits of childhood set in zimbabwe but was more than a bit bored after the move to the us","784":"the story begins when darling is ten or eleven years old she and her friends live in an impoverished village paradise in africa i forget which country exactly or if she even says which country darling talks with her friends about going to live in america she has an aunt who is already in america and she is going to send for darling and darling will live in america and never again have to worry about being hungry the first half of the book takes place in africa darling witnesses several horrific things but at most she seems confused maybe a little frightened but mostly confused by the things that she sees she and her friends re enact a murder they witness in play they find a woman hanging from a tree according to the note in her pocket she killed herself because she had the sickness the children simply remove the woman's shoes and trade them for bread the story was difficult to read because of the many horrific events yes i realize that such things really do happen and i realize that i live a very sheltered existence in a very safe bubble and that is why i did not put the book down after the first disturbing scene i need to be made aware what i can do beyond praying i rarely know the second half of the book takes place in america this part of the story also had its heart breaking moments as darling tried to adjust to and blend in with american culture years pass and although she wants at times to go back home and see her friends and family darling cannot leave the country she wouldn't be allowed back in the states and so she must stay put a great distance grows between darling and her friends a schism of cultural difference of what really matters completely different lifestyles shape them into people who barely relate to one another overall the book was ok i enjoyed the writing style","785":"this is a book suggested to me by an amazing reader and i decided if she liked it perhaps i would too it was an excellent read and can certainly help to make one more understanding of people in all walks of life would i suggest it to those narrow minded people out there i would and would hope for the best","786":"the narrator of the audio book was amazing i'm not so sure if i would have much enjoyed reading the book","787":"a great writer can go from fun and frivolous to intense in a turn of a page lovely book thoroughly enjoyed reading it much more than just a coming of age story","788":" added this to my read list based on a good review by onions this is fiction and in a lot of ways reminded me of a book i read recently that was the true story of 3 african boys and the hardships they endured but darling the lead character in this leads a different life and it's a rather interesting one the story is easily divided by her plane trip to usa first we get a good picture of what her life is like and what she and her fellow kids do for entertainment then we see her adapt to western culture but how much of her african culture gets supplanted","789":"i need to process this a bit before i can rate and review it properly","790":"engaging most of the time if a bit slow here and there like the perspective it is written from as it gives the reader a true sense of what is feels like to be a refugee both within your country and out of it","791":"loved haven't really read anything quite like this tells a powerful story of politics race relations and 1st vs 3rd world countries through the personal experiences of its characters beautifully written","792":"beautiful sad funny terrifying pick an adjective and we need new names will fit it i really loved the characters and even though it tackles so many hard topics the writing style somehow makes it so readable and compelling this is not my typical read but i'm so glad i broke away from routine and found this original and challenging book","793":"i'm not sure i've ever read a book where i completely loved the first half and was so disappointed in the second half darling the narrator is a feisty 10 year old girl living in zimbabwe after the war for independence darling's story of living in a shantytown called paradise through darling's eyes we learn of having to steal guavas to have food her pregnant 11 year old friend gangs and the fight for change but then darling is brought to america by her aunt a chance for a new beginning the voice of the story changes and becomes more a commentary on all that america is not for those seeking to leave the violence and poverty of their country there was so much that could have been told as darling becomes an adult in a new culture instead it was a jumble of start and stop stories with little tie in to the overall story a fascinating glimpse into growing up in zimbabwe too bad the ending didn't reach the same caliber","794":" the language of this novel will captivate you it is what you would call vivid the story is told through the eyes of darling and her narration feels like she is just reminiscing about growing up in zimbabwe recounting childhood games and such while looking forward to escaping to america the quotation less style surrounding dialogue makes for clean and fanciful prose there are some passages here that are difficult to digest but nothing that is book stopping the way darling makes us pay attention to her story and her development is amazing because the story just kind of glides along but the reader is very much invested this is quite a feat for a debuting author you would think that trying to process politics culture social ills through the eyes of a child would prove to be difficult but in the hands of this author it seems easy and it works add this book to your must read list","795":"i really wanted to like this book it starts off well enough but i found it hard to stay interested in the main character once she journeys to the us the author could have flushed the storyline out a bit more as she did in the beginning","796":"4 5 stars a childhood in a disrupted african town with a gaggle of friends who are street savy to a us urban existence with an aunt who has become americanized what a contrast this is a unique book the style of writing is fresh relevant saucy and the result is that this book hits you with a whallop perhaps even makes you look at things with a new perspective that's what a good book can do","797":"here is my review in portuguese http oquevcestalendo wordpress com","798":"tugs at your heart especially towards the end of the book could relate to the pain she felt on leaving her country and her helplessness in standing up for or sticking by her country when it was in a turmoil a piece of her is back there and yet her present forces her to move forward in life","799":"we need new names was a difficult read for me i thought the novel did a good job of showing that it is difficult to understand the living conditions of any particular place at a given time without physically residing there it also highlighted how this leads to misconceptions and communication gaps the events of the story seemed to show that there are sources of joy and horror regardless of where you live i definitely preferred the first half of the book set in zimbabwe to the second half set in the u s darling the main character was mainly an observer and used as a lens through which to view the story this left me without much of a connection to her the side characters were flat and i was not invested in them either i did not find the writing style to be lyrical or unique the story would jump years forward without warning making the pacing cumbersome the ending was brusque as well on more than one occasion i was disturbed by the abrupt inclusion of events of a graphic nature","800":"i abandoned this book at the halfway point the story is not well told in my opinion the adolescent style of the narrative put me off so i stopped wasting my time","801":"chosen by my book group i didn't expect to enjoy this book it was a pleasant surprise written in an easy going style it tells the story of a young african girl her daily life and her aspiration to go and stay with her aunt in america it has some harrowing passages but also some laugh out loud bits all intermingled and interwoven to produce an enjoyable read","802":"simple and to the point","803":"amazing portrayal of zimbabwe told by an eleven year old girl about life with her friends in a devastated country africa very accurately described second half is a great portrayal of emigration and conflicting identity of an immigrant in a new country","804":"wonderful poignant book about africa and emigration loved everybit of it so sad to finish it","805":"while the story and perspective was fresh fascinating i thought the language and voice used was rather inconsistent throughout the speaker switched between fluency and quaint metaphors too frequently for it to seem like a deliberate part of author's craft and likewise switched between specific anecdotes stories and a macro view of the world migration movement in general too abruptly though i did think that the latter part held one of the best most moving chapters it just didn't quite fit in with the pace and style of the rest of the book it seemed like the book was at points on the verge of something but never quite reached it and i almost abandoned it in the middle still alright as light reading and i'd love to read more perspectives from this region","806":" look at them leaving in droves the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves those with nothing are crossing borders those with strength are crossing borders those with ambitions are crossing borders those with hopes are crossing borders those with loss are crossing borders those in pain are crossing borders moving running emigrating going deserting walking quitting flying fleeing to all over countries near and far to countries unheard of to countries whose names they cannot pronounce they are leaving in droves when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth lest they be mistaken for those who want to claim the land as theirs look at them leaving in droves arm in arm with loss and lost look at them leaving in droves","807":"while it was a good and entertaining read and there were some powerful passages about living in the us as a recently arrived foreigner and the compromises made to remain here and not return 'home' i don't get the adulation this book received","808":" 'we need new names' is a heartfelt and eye opening literary fiction novel that tells the moving story of darling a young girl who finds her way out of her home village in zimbabwe to the united states we see her struggles and watch her overcome obstacles that we couldn't even imagine she finally makes it to the united states to live with her aunt only to find that the land of freedom and possibilities is incredibly limited to her because of her legal status as an immigrant this story was masterfully told with such emotion and insight that it felt like i was right alongside darling during her life in zimbabwe throughout her journey to america and beyond darling is a fantastic and unusual main character for the novel she's just a young girl who migrates to america from africa however her preconceptions hopes determination and beliefs are palpable to the reader to the point where my heart broke for her at times while at others i was cheering her on the writing was conversational being from darling's point of view but it also was insightful and intelligent the pace was steady and flowed seamlessly which made this a completely fascinating novel there's so much more to the plot that darling's life and journey to the united states the reader realizes things they had never thought about before things that may have never crossed their minds otherwise it brings a wonderful sense of understanding and eye opening realizations to the reader throughout the entire book highly recommended for fans of contemporary fiction and literary fiction disclosure i received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review","809":"it is always interesting to see how america and americans are viewed by foreigners we all want the same things but we are not all in the same position to achieve","810":"the book begins with much promise and the first half set in the unnamed country although i am never sure why it is not named unless it is something clever to do with the title of the book is quite riveting the problem with maintaining the voice of a child when you are an adult is not just verisimilitude but consistency when looking at a picture of a soldier the ten year old narrator does not know the word for medals calling them 'metal thingies' even though the unnamed leader of her unnamed country often wears dozens of them yet she writes elsewhere 'with colourful crosses emblazoned on their robes' for me this is why the centre cannot hold why 'things fall apart' as the author is fond of reminding us four times at least but she's not in the same league as chinua achebe or yeats i do not know how this has been long listed for the booker","811":" informative a young girl growing up in zimbabwe when the country started to fall apart lots of incidents are only alluded to which is all very well as the narrator is only 10 years old and wouldn't really know what is happening she then moves to the us and the story continues to relate her experiences in her new country the whole effect was very piecemeal and rather episodic i found the characters difficult to relate to i didn't particularly enjoy the book but i did feel that the author created something different and authentically drew a picture of a child's point of view would class it as young adult literature","812":"i don't want to come off as unsympathetic but this book is not very good it's basically about as generic as a book about an african immigrant who comes to america can be it also includes horribly cliched turns of phrase like in america we saw more food than we had seen in all our lives and we were so happy we rummaged through the dustbins of our souls to retrieve the stained broken pieces of god sorry but this is just not my kind of book points for diversity though man booker list","813":"i wish i could give the first half of the book five stars and the second half three","814":"an honest warm hearted book of the coming of age of a young woman from zimbabwe during that nation's turbulent times unbearably sad at times funny and joyful at others ahhhh the resilience of children","815":"disappointed there was nothing of the story that really drew me in i enjoyed the first half of the book when the main character was still living in africa but once she arrived in america it was boring and didn't go anywhere","816":"i loved the beginning of the book where the author is a child in zimbabwe her voice was haunting i didn't find the book as interesting once she moved to the u s although it remained interesting","817":" a rather poignant response to american concern charity about the spectacle of internecine war in zimbabwe the ready availability of the camera and the news to document the spectacle but the utter impotence at completing anything of value paints an unsparing picture of the end result of expatriation often to places where they cannot become legal citizens the endless drudgery of work the lack of social value the ostracization from their home culture and the endless tide of need they must try to stem really a very powerful book","818":"this started off so strong with a vibrant and distinctive voice but it just didn't carry through the rest of the book","819":" darling - the young narrator of this powerful debut novel - lives in a town in zimbabwe called paradise - a misnomer if ever there was one a collection of shacks inhabited by displaced families the run down town is just a stone's throw from neighboring budapest where whites and wealthy africans absorb the good life noviolet bulawayo's prose soars in her descriptions of this poignant childhood we experience the hunger pangs that force darling and her friends to venture out and steal fruit from the abundant guava trees we feel the misery and powerlessness as darling's absent father slinks home from south africa another faceless victim of the spreading aids home and we shudder in horror as darling and her friends don the roles of the crew of the tv show er in order to rid their 11 year old friend chipo from an unwanted pregnancy with a rusted clothes hanger and other primitive instruments yet we need new names never becomes the stereotypical book about the horrors and despairs of poverty in africa rather noviolet bulawayo's destination is interior not exterior her goal is to help us explore the landscape of darling's fertile mind and what a mind it is like most any imaginative child darling is entranced with paris hilton and other icons of american culture she makes leaping associations the ngo workers who embarrass the children by insisting on taking photo after photo are not unlike the press that hounds american celebrities a luxurious bed in a smashed up home is a good place to jump and jump and jump...\"the springs lifting us so high we raise our hands and almost slap the white ceiling each time we go up \" nothing can rob darling of her childhood yet half way through the book the focus shifts to america darling is one of the fortunate ones who can escape living with her aunt fostalina and her common law husband uncle kojo as readers we've traveled this territory before the oddness of snow the gun shots the ubiquitous technology the ever available porn the teenage slang and disrespect there are times even in this section where ms bulawyo's words rise to poetry \"we ate like pigs like wolves like dignitaries we ate lie vultures like stray dogs like monsters we ate like kings we ate for all our past hunger for our parents and brothers and sisters and relatives and friends who were still back there we uttered their names between mouthfuls...if only our country could see us in america see us eat like kings in a land that was not ours we need new names is almost but not quite a 5 star book it certainly introduces an author with a stunning talent and who uses it to give us a compelling character who is ultimately straddled between two cultures","820":" haunting disturbingly funny aching these are just some of the words that describe this book from the beginning the narrator knocks on your soul and demands entry this narrator is funny a brilliant original voice who writes the wild yearnings of youth on dreams of hope and air the book has been called episodic for its transitions and chapter short story feel i think this is close but in truth the book moves the narrator eats and you taste her wonder she plays and you feel her joy she sits still and you feel her hunger this is not an easy book it does not shy away from hope loss and change in fact it welcomes it i was not as sold on the narrator of the second half although i expected time to change the younger version of the character i yearned for the earlier word play and moves but perhaps that is the point we grow we change we become something else as we search for something more and the book offers so many searchings in the end i must give it a near 5 for its deftness and its beauty my heart hurt when i turned the last page to the book's main character darling i hope you found a way to fight against the cruelties of this world","821":"http africanbookaddict com 2015 10 hmmmm i think appreciated this story as a whole i read noviolet's short story that rightfully won the caine prize back in 2011 the first chapter of this book is actually that caine prize short story but i was really tired of the shanty life storyline in the beginning there seemed to be no plot and i was struggling to get into the book in 2013 i remember when this was popular and how i was only into 'americanah' at the time a few friends told me this book was boring and i get where they were coming from hahaa i enjoyed the story more once darling moved to michigan which is like after page 150 some stuff darling was getting into after she moved to the us was stupid to me though why was she so into watching porn with her friends that was a bit random even though i guess that's what young girls of today are into i don't know that bit of the book was awkward darling became a brand new person after she lived in america for some time and i was over her new attitude towards the end of the book i was over the plethora of stereotypes noviolet dumped onto the pages in zim all the people in the shanty town were stereotyped abject poverty while i know poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor is terrible back in zim the lack of a solid plot made it hard to ignore the excessiveness of the sad living conditions all the people darling encountered in michigan were stereotyped too especially mr eliot's daughter who just had to be white rich spoiled in an ivy league school had an eating disorder bulimia was generally depressed and had a cute dog that donned designer fashions i have a feeling this book was nominated for several awards and won some because this is what the west loves to read a story on african struggles with excessive stereotypes this is just my opinion don't get me wrong there is a uniqueness to this book especially in the writing style i wouldn't say this is written 'beautifully' as everyone claims but it is surely unique my favorite chapter is chapter 16 'how they lived' where noviolet speaks in general on the african immigrant experience in the west it seemed pretty spot on and i enjoyed that i also enjoyed how darling's english changed from her time in zim to her stay in the us the diction of the book changed from broken english to 'standard' english it was also interesting to witness darling practice her american accent etc etc other than that this book was a struggle for me to get into and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot if i wasn't buddy reading this with zainab i would have given up after the first 30 pages this is more 2 5 stars for me more on the book blog soon","822":"bulawayo has a funny take at religion do not do religion just believe https storify com samdemic we need","823":"contradiction humor freshnessi came away from \"we need new names\" in a state of blissed out confusion darling is the main protagonist we follow her from the age of ten to about age fourteen she was born in zimbabwe and soon immigrates to the us where she joins an aunt this is a book of contradictions as is africa and america compared to zimbabwe america seems to darling equal parts blessing and curse a step up and a step down and away from the majesty of africa an africa that is being torn apart from the inside and from the outside writer bulawayo never gets maudlin no matter how horrible things are she describes hunger disease religious fanaticism funerals rape etc and she does it in a believable way through the eyes of darling and her friends and they've known little else so they just get on with their lives and make the best of things of course their experiences upset them but they always find a way to have fun obstacles are there to go around as are the adults in their lives this is the same philosophy darling adopts when she gets to america bulawayo helped me see america in a way i never could have as a native darling's eyes are fresh and so is her irony about our traditions as well as our assumptions about immigrants by coming here darling lost an entire way of life but she's also gained another one along with some opportunities it's a mixed bag she never lets her enthusiasm or sense of proportion or humor flag however the freshness of this book is its strongest asset this review is based on an advance reader's copy provided by the publisher disclaimer given as required by the ftc","824":"this book had an interesting beginning because it was a story told through the voice of a child in africa however when the child adolescent moves to america she is obviously torn between two different cultural identities the story is reflective not progressive as there is no grand realisations at the end of the novel and perhaps there isn't meant to be a grand realisation the author's usage of current events and teenage slang was quite impressive might be a text young adults will really relate to most vivid memories of this book are the captions of africa told by a child some might enjoy this kind of text more than others","825":"powerful images of what it must be like to try to be a child in a war torn land and then what it must be like to be an illegal immigrant as a teen in the us each chapter stands on its own my only criticism is that it ended abruptly for me like other reviewers wrote this book grew on me","826":"riveting look at a girl who grows up in africa and emigrates to detroit which she calls destroyed harsh realities were tempered by humor","827":"an interesting story about suffering due to the abuse of the oligarchy immigration to paradise and more suffering","828":"interesting especially the view of zimbabwe's political social struggles through a child's eyes which is the first part heartbreaking the first hand telling of living in exile in the promised land of america it got me from beginning to end making the spots that were a bit rocky writing wise not a big deal because i had started it and then had to put it down for a long time halfway through i started at the beginning again and it was worth it such fresh writing","829":"funny heartbreaking informative and extremely beautiful this is a must read i couldn't have chosen a better book to star 2015 i recommend it to everyone","830":"i liked this book and especially what the author has to say about the immigrant experience which many of us will nevertheless know personally","831":" i would really probably give this two and a half stars but i will err on the positive side because bulawayo certainly can write beautifully and at the sentence level there are some portions of this book that are genuinely amazing there was a vogue in the blurbs on book jackets a few years ago to refer to writing as incantatory maybe there still is but that adjective really is fitting here the very brief two page chapter entitled how they left sets the flight of zimbabweans to anywhere that is not zimbabwe in the language and cadences of myth and it is beautiful aside from the focus on zimbabwe though and one could argue that this ultimately is not fundamental to the story anyway the story here is not a new one and-- much more problematic-- i am not sure bulawayo has much of anything new to say about it people immigrate to the united states to get out of a bad situation back home when they get here they find that it does not match their expectations that adjusting to their new home is unexpectedly difficult and that leaving did not solve anything because really what they want is not a new country but for the one they have to be the place it should be that is indeed an important story and bulawayo is effective in evoking the feeling of being trapped between two possibilities neither of which is satisfying the narrator darling is also convincing and nuanced but the story doesn't go anywhere bulawayo puts darling into these circumstances and does a remarkable job of showing how it feels to be in her shoes and then the book ends there is no particular reason for it to end where it does and darling has not really changed from the character she was 80 pages earlier there are too many scenes that seem to little narrative work beyond demonstrating repeatedly darling's ambivalence about american culture and society without any sense that she is coming to any kind of realization or solid opinion about anything the writing is good enough to push the reader through to the end but the book is ultimately unsatisfying it is both unfair and unwise to ask that the author of a book like this come up with a solution to the big general problems at its center but there should be some kind of resolution not the same as a solution for this character this case at the end we don't know if darling will go to college or not go back home or not maintain her relationships with family and friends back home or not-- anything neither does she but the book feels unfinished or irresolute more than deliberately ambivalent bulawayo is a talented writer and i will read her next book because i think she could write a great one but i don't think this is it","832":"like reading two books in one the first part is the story of ten year old darling and her friends children who survive and play in the shantytowns of zimbabwe the second part is darling's story of attempting to assimilate and stay despite being there illegally in the u s it felt a little more like a series of short stories occasionally with too much crammed into them to me than one cohesive narrative but i liked darling's voice very much","833":" this book is being read by people all over my county dekalb georgia as part of the many voices one county initiative to discuss the diversity of voices and experience among us in we need new names bulawayo writes about the story of darling a 10 year old girl living in a shanty town in zimbabwe after her family's home and neighborhood was destroyed by the mugabe regime it describes her life and her community vibrantly and in a unique and lyrical voice in the second half of the book it describes her decision to move to the us specifically to michigan the book loses some of its energy and it's difficult to tell whether this is simply a narrative losing energy or a deliberate choice that reflects the character's experience of the us as a cultural experience that lacks the vibrancy of zimbabwe this was a fascinating and engaging book with an interesting perspective and set of experiences neither zimbabwe nor the us are romanticized although later we see darling's nostalgia for the country she calls home i admit that part of my engagement through the whole book is that a good chunk of darling's later experience is set in kalamazoo michigan my hometown and clearly the author has lived there and knows the community although about 25 years after i left it knowing the community i think darling's are a fascinating set of eyes to see it through i would have liked the book to be a bit more linear rather than what seemed to be a somewhat episodic set of linked short stories darling's life made leaps that shook me out of the story and left me with gaps that i wished the author had filled particularly around darling's departure from zimbabwe the fragmented structure of the story and the number of cultural issues with which the author grapples left me feeling unfocused it seemed like the author raised a laundry list of cultural and political issues also the author does have a set of authorial ticks with some overused constructions that i imagine will be smoothed over as she writes more novels i thoroughly enjoyed this book however and will definitely look for more from this author","834":"great debut novel the story of a young girl darling growing up beginning in zimbabwe and ending in america ms bulawayo paints a vivid picture of life in a shantytown where violence and hunger are a daily experience but there is also hope moving to america brings with it mixed rewards and it's own challenges","835":"one of the most powerful books i have ever read beautiful with an unparalleled perspective","836":"amazing i love her language and especially the way she writes about zimbabwe without the usual geographic or political context as a child would see it her character even asks 'what is an african ' best zimbabwean writer i've read since marechera recommended highly and for those who are writers watch her pure genius metaphors and fresh insights","837":"i finished the book and actually kind of tired of it by the end it's good but not great i think it's a bit overwrought and isn't consistently written makes a statement and then goes to the first person pov again so i liked but did not love it","838":"heartbreaking","839":" this book is all about the great expat question should expats have any say in what happens in their native country once they have established their roots elsewhere do they get to criticize or scoff or proselytize about the workings of the land in which they were born a land they fled for a better life abroad 'just tell me one thing what are you doing not in your country right now why did you run off to america darling nonkululeko nkala huh why did you just leave if it's your country you have to love it to live in it and not leave it you have to fight for it no matter what to make it right tell me do you abandon your house because it's burning or do you find water to put out the fire and if you leave it burning do you expect the flames to turn into water and put themselves out 'longing for the land that overwhelms each sense for just being home the whiff of traditional food the touch of crumbling clay the taste of local fruit the sound of nature's innate music the visual onslaught of familiar colors - form an expat's core layered with guilt for leaving behind loved ones with apprehension for what lays in store for them in future and the most significant of them all with uncertainty as an expat does not enjoy the sense of security that comes along with being born a naturally born citizen hailing from a country of whose economy a healthy chunk is bolstered by remittances from expats i found we need new names quite resonant with what i have seen my fellow countrymen struggle with should they choose to stay true to their culture or should they assimilate in the culture of the land they live in now noviolet bulawayo captures this very dilemma beautifully and i look forward to reading more of her work also we need new names happens to be my first foray in african literature and i am quite annoyed i didn't get to it before","840":" motherlove is singing out there nobody ever sings like that in paradise voice swinging like ripe fruit you can pick and put in your mouth and taste its sweetness when you hear motherlove you know that her shebeen is now open for people to go and drink such a bittersweet tale such evocative writing bulawayo does one of the better jobs i've seen of telling a story through the eyes of a child through darling we see that the horrible things the hunger sickness poverty political upheaval and paramilitary violence are also the things that are home when they are part of your daily landscape they just are when darling leaves zimbabwe to live with her aunt in america she discovers that paradise isn't really","841":"i respect what bulawayo did with this book and the story of a young zimbabwean girl is impressive it's understandable why it was nominated for literary awards unfortunately i didn't really connect with the main character or the story the stylistic choices made made me pay attention to the author's razzle dazzle with language than anything else it became work to finish","842":" i need to start reading upbeat novels the writing in we need new names is very good writing but the story is pretty much depressing life is hopeless and brutal in zimbabwe and life in american is shallow boring and hopeless even with an education the characters are limited to cleaning toilets or sorting recycled materials for a living reading this made me realize why so many people read fantasy where there is hope for a good ending i feel for the plight of the characters in literary fiction but when i read several in a row i started to see the world as a bleak and lonely place i think i need to read a good comedy now","843":"great read enjoyed it tremendously","844":"very glad i stuck with this book","845":"a number of book reviews talked about how this book's second half isn't as strong as the first half but i think in some ways it is intentional the vividness of her childhood in zimbabwe makes detroit seem drab and lifeless in any case the first half of the book is one of the most incredible tragi comic narratives i've read in a while it's truly brilliant","846":"quick read with an interesting insight into the journey of a young immigrant to the us a good portrayal of the mixed emotions of leaving one's home for good sadness longing for familiar things relief and how america and its people come across to the young zimbabwean","847":"this was an interesting book about the before and after of immigrating to america bulawayo skillfully uses language to describe darling as she hangs out with her friends in a zimbawean shantytown after their house is destroyed her father leaves the family and she and her mother is forced to move in with a distant relative darling matter of factly describes situations that average americans would never be able to survive and notes both the good and the bad when she goes to live with her aunt in the u s on an expired visa life gets both better materially and worse emotionally and spiritually as darling tries to find a place where she fits in bulawayo intersperses darling's day to day experiences with short chapters containing statements from many displaced persons not a fun read but a quick and powerful one","848":"3 5 i loved the names of the children in this novel godknows bastard and darling to name a few darling is our narrator she is ten years old in a very changed zimbabwe once they went to school now the schools are boarded up and the children roam and steal they live in paradise which is a sort of shanty town but they go to budapest which is where the wealthy black and the white people live chipo her 11 yr old friend is pregnant and the children try to understand how she got that way she is sure of her place in this life at least as sure as any ten yr old can be soon she will be sent to detroit to live with her aunt and her life will be very different this book is more a series of linked stories than a continuous narrative i loved the sensitive portrayal by the author of darling can tell she realty liked this young girl we also get a clear look at modern day zimbabwe and what some of her people are dealing with also deals with the displacement and sense of not belonging when an immigrant enters a new country there were a few plot lines that could have been developed but instead were dropped i liked this book i think the author is very talented it is just sometimes i have problems with these linked story i feel that i am not always getting a clear picture i will for sure look for this authors next novel curious to see how she develops","849":"who discovered the way to india vasco da gama vasco da gama vasco da gama i've never read a book like this before the author does children's voices incredibly well admittedly the book is kind of thin on plot but i don't care about that kind of thing","850":"worked well for the first half of the book but lost energy and felt like loosely connected short stories in the end bold but not fully realised interesting and thought provoking and well worth the effort though","851":" i'm really rating this as 1 5 stars but rounding it up i really wanted to like this book i felt almost obligated to like it however i just can't bring myself to like it what bothered me the most was that there was almost no sense of time or actual cohesive story there's a girl darling she lives in paradise and things are terrible and she moves to the us and finds that things are a different kind of terrible there that's the basis of the plot however we find this plot through short stories each chapter is an independent short story that could absolutely be read in complete isolation i really had an issue with that i wanted a narrative story where we get to see darling as she struggles in her homeland and her adopted country the stories just didn't deliver that for me there were moments of beauty where the flow and word choice was spectacular hence the 2 stars those moments simply can not overcome the shortcomings i had with the overall lack of cohesive storytelling","852":" instead of a review i'll excerpt some of the email messages i sent to my friend while reading it to friend my new favorite fiction genre 'african women talking much shit aboutaspects of american life while tellin no lies' writers include noviolet bulawayo and chimamanda ngozi adiche from friend lol awesome what book did bulawayo write to friend it's called we need new names i'm not done with it but i'm loving it more and more as it goes on she isn't in the u s the entire time she starts out in zimbabwe and she just arrived in michigan but her observations are cracking me up to friend also because she's a child when she's in zim she's talking about these major events that are happening around her but she's talking about them indirectly because she's a child and she's more interested in playing with her friends and all the other silly things kids are preoccupied with when they're kids it's such an interesting perspective she doesn't clue into everything that's going on but when she's making an observation it is so well put that you think maybe the kids are more clued in than we give them credit for and then she gets to america it still sounds like a child's perspective but it also starts to sound like a foreigners perspective like someone who is directly translating sayings from their mother tongue from friend cool that book is now on my list to friend fuuuuuuck the only thing about reading this type of fiction is that is too close to home you realize you grew up in a country where your mom doesn't make sense and your grandmother misses you and relatives had these dreams of knowing you holding you and raising you and they never got to and now you're this person who appears every few years to say hi like a stranger and leave again from friend that's it exactly migration is a bitch","853":"i read noviolet bulawayo's novel we need new names in one sitting a exceptional book with an interesting episodic structure it is authentic funny moving surprising i'm excited to interview noviolet next week at @nationalbookfoundation 2013 5under35 awards #lit","854":" i read this for my book club u0026amp though it's one i thought i wanted to read i didn't end up liking it i normally enjoy or appreciate international stories like this but this one just missed the mark for me i didn't feel a connection to the characters i found the writing choppy u0026amp each chapter seemed almost stand alone causing it to lose the continuity you would find in a better told story i am scratching my head at the fact that this book received so many plaudits u0026amp prize nominations when it was released a couple of years ago is it because it's an african book shining the light on life in post colonial zimbabwe among other topics themes all the themes u0026amp topics woven throughout the book are certainly worthy ones but i feel like i've been fortunate enough to read better books with an international u0026amp or post colonial focus","855":"compelling and beautiful the picture of zimbabwe and america she draws is exquisite i could see and feel and taste what darling and ger friends saw touched and ate i was mesmorized by the words a brilliant novel","856":"i'm going with 3 5 stars i'm not really sure how i feel about this book darling is growing up in zimbabwe with friends and neighbors from before but now it is after after their homes and houses and possessions were bulldozed and they are now living in a shanty town running amok amongst each other innocently playing games like find bin laden and stealing guavas from the rich people in budapest then darling is transplanted to michigan with her aunt and the tone and imagery of the book are completed turned upside down i'm not sure if my american ways are fantasizing the imagery and conditions of the story in zimbabwe but i felt like once darling came to america everything about her was lost in this dreary and cold country that was ugly to look at it's people were ugly her whole life was ugly terrible things were happening in zimbabwe but it was her country and her life with friends and family as hard as it was you could feel the love and joy she had there once she came to the usa i feel like everything turned blah and there wasn't anything good about being here materialism runs rampant though they were greedy with the ngo people in zimbabwe but what a different level this book just gave me all sorts of weird feelings we have book discussion about it the first saturday in april so i am looking forward to seeing what others though and felt","857":"this is an amazing book written from the perspective of a girl between the ages of 11 and 18 who emigrates from zimbabwe to the usa it's funny clever authentic heartbreaking and searingly insightful absolutely loved it","858":"this was a weird read mostly because it's told from an 11 year olds perspective the beginning 1st half was really captivating but i found the second half lost momentum all in all i'd encourage readers to read this","859":"this is a fast read and well worth it it gives a deeply layered picture of what it feels like to be an immigrant what you gain what you lose where is home and the many misconceptions of everyone involved","860":"new perspective life in africa life in america as a young immigrant took a bit to get used to the author's use of language but then the language helps to fully immerse reader","861":"enjoyed this book great perspective reality check but the ending","862":" how they leftlook at them leaving in droves the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves those with nothing are crossing borders those with strength are crossing borders those with ambitions are crossing borders those with hopes are crossing borders those with loss are crossing borders those in pain are crossing borders moving running emigrating going deserting walking quitting flying fleeing - to all over to countries near and far to countries unheard of to countries whose names they cannot pronounce they are leaving in droves when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth lest they be mistaken for those who want to claim the land as theirs look at them leaving in droves arm in arm with loss and lost look at them leaving in droves","863":"i really love this book i think i gobbled it up to quickly and i need to go back and reread it but i just adore the voice of darling the protagonist i love the way readers are taken inside her mind and get to see how she observes the world i especially love the way she smiles often the forced type that she is asked to do when the ngos come to take photographs or when she's at a wedding and she's cornered in bathroom with a litany of questions about africa so these guests can try to figure out which sob story to associate with her and i especially love the last couple of chapters where she talks about what it's like to live as an undocumented person in the u s and all the others from around the globe whose story is not altogether different from hers the coming of age voice of darling is intoxicating","864":"days after finishing this book i would find myself thinking about the characters and wondering what will happen to them and then i had to remind myself that i'd finished the book so i might never know noviolet bulawayo breathes life into the characters with force and poetic truth i didn't get into it straight away but once i was about a third though i read it in one sitting walking home from borderlands cafe where i finished the book i was listening to words on a wire a literary podcast i love and one of the presenters talked about being a judge for the pen hemingway award and guess which book won yep there was something in the air that day a shard of synchronicity that kept darling and her friends close to me a little while longer","865":"this would have totally gotten 4 stars if it weren't for the last sentence i'm all for ambiguous endings things not being wrapped up but that was a bit too stark for me","866":"amazing powerful and raw and worth rereading","867":"i would have liked it better if i could have read it in a shorter time alas i was tired then traveling and tired and it took me too long and goodness the ending last sentence last image was sad i heard bulawayo read from it and would have probably enjoyed a full day's worth of listening to her read it aloud","868":"this was an interesting account of the life of a child in africa and how their life has changed when they have moved to a more developed country darling's character was endearing","869":"i loved the book did anyone else find the not so subtle references to things fall apart i think the book is a great testimony to how childhood is lived and perceived in many places like zim kids play and laugh and run and talk but also go through traumas as their adult parents do and they don't dream of becoming doctors or nurses lawyers etc they dream of running away to better places","870":"this is an amazing novel told in the innocent voice of a child 10 year old darling darling is a young girl in zimbabwe during the early years of independence she narrates an at times terrible tale of war violence religious hypocrisy poverty broken families political unrest aids crime all told in the wide eyed voice of a child through her eyes we really see her life and the lives of those around her in the second half of the book a now teen aged darling moves to america to live with her aunt she faces the challenges of a completely new culture a new language a new family this second half of the novel was not as immediate nor as gripping as the first part and characters were less intense u0026amp authentic there were a few chapters written in a more global voice and these i found strained forced the voice of darling was strong enough to communicate whatever needed to be shared actually these chapters appeared lifted from another book perhaps essays or lectures on zimbabwe overall this is a powerful novel searing in its honesty and vividness the narrator darling has a powerful exhuberant innocent voice the characters with names like godknows bastard and mother of bones will live with me for a long time","871":"3 5 stars i thought the voice of the story was great but it wasn't very plot driven this one gets bumped up to four stars solely because of the chapter toward the end titled how they lived if you aren't going to read this book at least pick it up and find that chapter it's a beautiful essay on its own","872":"darling is 10 she lives in a shantytown in zimbabwe like any child she plays with her friends but their games are fraught with danger they are surrounded by violence that can explode at any time just a few years earlier darling lived in a real house and her parents had good jobs now the political situation has changed and their homes were bulldozed and they were forced into this makeshift village but darling is going to leave she has an aunt in the united states destroyedmichygan and so darling is sent away to make a new life for herself uprooted from the land and people she knows like so many other people desperate to find a better life or at least a life with enough food and the promised of better things i am remembering the taste of all these things but remembering is not tasting and it is painful these are a teenage darling's words as she struggles to assimilate into her new country there is more food but it lacks the flavor of the food she grew up on there is a house but all the familiar customs of home are missing darling is no longer part of the country she left but like so many immigrants she continues to feel like a stranger in her new one the writing in this book is brilliant noviolet bulawayo almost chants certain litanies in the book when the voice becomes we and we hear the voices of the dispossessed her children are full of life not necessarily likable but real the images are sometimes disturbing darling is studying biology but can't bear looking at the pictures of wounds maybe because her own are too raw as are those of the country she has had to leave there were moments reading this book that i literally gasped from shock the work is one of the most vibrant texts i've ever read i felt as though i'd really come closer to someone's life","873":"freshly written from a child's perspective adolescent really in a changing and very unequal zimbabwe the tone shifts radically when she moves to usa sad moving funny charming","874":"by far one of the best books i've read lately a rather interesting account on home exile and identity written in simple but witty language both heartbreaking and highly funny at times noviolet bulawayo is looking rather promising","875":"bulawayos style is impressive she manages to capture zimbabwe and the united states through the eyes of darling a 10 year old girl bulawayo's words paint a clear yet lyrical message of life in zimbabwe a country in turmoil for decades under autocratic rule we follow darling as she assimilates to life in the united sates a country so strange to darling in every way searching for her identity far away from home has an air of sadness as well an endearing quality as darling navigates her way through her new home while yearning for her homeland family and friends we need new names is a powerful and unforgettable story","876":"a fascinating narrative voice some striking verb choices that stick with me there was just one chapter where she lost me in that chapter darling the 1st person narrator disappeared and was replaced by a mysterious we i recommend this","877":" revised noviolet bulawayo's debut novel we need new names is the story of darling a young zimbabwean girl living in a shantytown called 'paradise' she is feisty ten year old an astute observer of her surroundings and the people in her life bulawayo structures her novel more like a series of linked stories written in episodic chapters told loosely chronologically than in one integrated whole in fact the short story hitting budapest that became in some form an important chapter in this 'novel' won the prestigious 2011 caine prize for african writing in addition to darling the stories introduce her gang of close friends they are vividly and realistically drawn and we can easily imagine them as they roam free in their neighbourhood and also secretly walk into 'budapest' a near by district of the well off one of their goals is to get a glimpse how the other side lives but primarily to find food and anything useful to trade they enjoy climbing over walls peek into gardens and houses and heave themselves into trees to get their fill of guava a fruit that can temporarily lull their constant feeling of hunger but with unpleasant consequences darling's story is bitter sweet her father has left the family for the mines in south africa and her mother ekes out a living trading in the border region darling is left in the care of her grandmother mother of bones they all had a better life once and darling went to school then but the family was expelled from their real house during an earlier political unrest in the country in the first half of the book the backdrop is zimbabwe in the early years of independence and issues of poverty and inequality violence and suppression of human rights disappointment with the lack of democracy are touched upon without breaking the flow of the young protagonist's authentic voice consistently bulawayo stays with voice of her young protagonist whose natural curiosity helps her to make sense of the things she doesn't quite understand she expresses her views in often comical ways in a mix of unusual imagery and associations as astute descriptions of life as she sees and understands it from her limited experience that is mingled with her witty interpretation of stories she hears from adults her language can be crude and raw but also gentle and sensitive i very much enjoyed the vibrant fresh voice of bulawayo's young protagonist darling darling has an aunt in the usa and she often tells her friends of her and that she will move to america to live with her aunt and to experience everything that goes with wealth and comfort her american dream it is not surprising however that life when she has arrived in michigan is quite different from what she imagined it to be still told in episodic chapters darling appears to lose her vibrant and innocent voice it becomes more mature and even but also flatter also the stories are no longer as closely connected as they were in the first part while giving insights into her daily life and that of her close family we lose the astute and wittily critical observer we have come to like and engage with darling's life follows more or less the usual paths of young or older people arriving on visitors' visas and staying on under the radar darling makes every effort to fit in and to adapt to the realities she encounters she adopts an american accent that her mother and her friends on the phone have difficulty understanding darling still thinks of home her mother and her close friends but with nostalgia as well as resignation into the impracticality of such a visit in the chapter how they lived written in a voice that is not darling's bulawayo generalizes the experience of immigration and the efforts immigrants from all over the world put into sounding happier than they are not telling friends and family back home honestly how their lives have turned out in order not to sound discouraging and ungrateful a strong story in its own right but will darling be able to draw any lessons from it","878":"i found this book a little confusingly written and slightly lacking a point the book is written as though darling wrote it which i think was very good it showed the way that her language developed over time but some chapters seemed to have no point at all and veered massively from the story line also there were a lot of jumps in time that were not very well communicated i'm not sure if that was a part of the fact it was written by the character or not","879":"o hilarious tales and guava escapades abound indeed southern africans need new names really cheerless mood towards the end sobering and quite disheartening tales in the diaspora starts out with the cheerful childhood memories growing up !o deg ! hilarious tales and guava escapades abound indeed southern africans need new names ++ really cheerless mood towards the end sobering and quite disheartening tales in the diaspora","880":" some readers will be thrown i think by the loose structure and lack of a clearly mapped narrative arc it's not exactly a collection of vignettes or moments it's stuff happening it feels like a work with strong links to an oral tradition a chapter might begin with so i asked my aunt for example particularly in the wonderful evocation of voice it is a vivid examination of a character's state of being without the usual conventions of psychological inquiry we are used to a remarkable book","881":"personal account of a failed state view through a child teen immigrant's eyes hilarious genuine while tragic at the same time","882":"this is an incredible read i found it hard and sad to read a must","883":"i enjoyed reading this book you laugh out loud but you never lose sight of the social commentary","884":" i must not have been the right audience for this book or maybe i was just expecting a book that would walk on water which admittedly would be hard for any book to measure up to the first half of the book describes the life of 10 year old darling as she is growing up in zimbabwe life is chaotic nasty brutish and short her father has gone to try to find work in south africa but returns dying of aids her mother is gone for long spells of time leaving her with her grandmother and when she returns has a clandestine affair for love or money that is left unclear with someone who is not her husband darling and her friends are basically free to roam their shanty community and \"make their own fun \" despite the obvious disadvantages darling feels a sense of community and structure flash forward to second half of the book darling has emigrated to america on a student visa to live with her mother's twin sister in america she has many more material advantages but her life there is less communal less rich in culture and cultural support and she struggles to maintain her connections to home and to answer the question \" who am i \" while some readers pointed to the universality of this immigrant experience i wondered what was new here as compared to other books which have addressed the same topic if i had to choose i preferred other books about the immigrant experience such as jhumpa lahiri's and chimamanda ngozi adichie's i preferred their writing styles but clearly my opinion is in the minority b c this one was short listed for the booker prize and has been widely lauded in a lot of literary circles ","885":"despite all the awards and good reviews for this book i have to admit that i was disappointed i felt there were basically three different styles to the book the chapters in zimbabwe the chapters in the us and the reflections on being a diasporan african and though they were related to me they were not a particularly well integrated whole","886":" zimbabwe unclarifiedcritics have heaped praise on we need new names by noviolet bulawayo and astute readers know the reason she is a cornell mfa and a wallace stegner fellow at stanford university in short establishment any reviewer who says the novel sucks implies that these institutions and madison avenue suck as well the novel starts out ok after we learn budapest is a neighborhood somewhere in zimbabwe and not in hungary the author uses dramatic irony in the form of children's games to make her points it affects the reader but not nearly as much as the child narrator in \"say you're one of them\" by uwem akpan one of the great short stories of all time the second half of the novel is blase as darling the main character adjusts to life in the usa","887":"really liked this particularly one of the last chapters almost a poem the description of her home in zimbabwe and the new home in detroit were also eye opening","888":"this was a very engaging different and thoughtful book there are flaws to be sure but overall i enjoyed it enough to give it four stars especially as it is a debut novel the story has a dreamy disjointed feel to it and it is read best as a collection of experiences and themes rather than a solid plot but yet there are many little bits of excellent plot throughout the subject matter is quite gripping shantytown life in zimbabwe and illegal immigration to america are both explored i will say that i found the half of the book in america to be less compelling than the half in zimbabwe in part i think because the actual leaving was not covered and it felt like there was some lack of emotional continuity it still had many positive aspects however one thing i particularly liked about the whole novel was how it was written without fear or explanation our narrator darling lives her life as she knows it and there were aspects that were intriguing and confusing for me that were never explained for example the names of the characters in zimbabwe are strange and wonderful and i do not know the context for it i truly think this was brave and very positive i am an outsider and the book in a way was not written for me i did my best to understand it and gain knowledge but it didn't hand me answers because it was telling darling's story as an african and that is very cool i would be interested in reading more by bulawayo especially as i think she can only become a stronger writer from here on out","889":"edited ok after book club i can appreciate this book a bit more i'll give it a 2 i hated this book hated it with a passion it was so disturbing and messed up and just ugh and yet i'm struggling to rate it because while i hated it i have to admit it was well written and thought provoking the 1 star rating i'd give it doesn't quite feel fair and neither does a higher rating so i'm going to leave it ratingless","890":"i loved this book the childhood stories all sounded too familiar her journey to the usa resonated with my experiences here and the struggle of adapting to a culture that has no roots to your own upbringing here's my favorite extract because we were not in our own country we could not use our own language and so when we spoke came out bruised because we were not using our language we said things we did not mean what we really wanted to say remained folded inside trapped in america we did not always have the words","891":"fantastic must read","892":" absolutely heart wrenching coming of age story of a 10 year old in zimbabwe who later spends her teen years in usa as an illegal immigrant who can not return to her native country this is a nontraditional novel that reads like a collection of short stories the first half of the novel that focuses on the tales of darling and her friends is flawless the second half which takes place in the us is uneven and gets mired by noviolet bulawayo semi biographical storytelling the brilliant parts of this novel soar but there are a few chapters that drag the quality down still a really masterful and powerful work","893":" ultimately i really enjoyed this book for a bit at the start i wasn't so sure sometimes harsh sometimes beautiful includes several passages i will likely utilize in class discussions on the issue of crossing cultures as a work of historical fiction it likely only has value to a reader with some knowledge of zimbabwean history over the past 40 50 years when history is mentioned it is assumed the reader knows the time u0026amp references someone with no background would be lost by historical references including the history of the last decade or so","894":" one of the best books i've read recently and i don't usually say that about new books i generally prefer those books that have stayed in print for 20 years plus and thus stood the test of time bulawayo narrates using darling a child's voice which i found really powerful bulawayo using darling's voice is able to recount a scene in breathtaking naivety with the child's voice allowing what could be extremely painful scenes to be described with a tenderness that makes them bearable as a child darling bluntly describes things as they are allowing me to appreciate the narrative on two levels what darling described and the humour and playfulness the children are able to find in it and the gap it left for me to fill between how things were and how they could or should have been for example on one level stealing guavas is a great game on another level its a very sad example of starving children scavenging for food bulawayo also forces me to reflect on my opinions of contemporary events by presenting things i have seen or read about on the news and formed passing opinions of from a very different perspective likewise it encourages me to pay a little more attention to people i see every day like the ghanaian and south american cleaning and catering staff that work in my office the loss of names is a metaphor for the whole loss of identity as one's way of live is destroyed or forced to change there is only one section in the book where the inhabitants of paradise have 'real' names and the destruction of their lives at that time is i think reflected in the change in their names there are echoes of the grapes of wrath with bulawayo using a similar narrative construct with chapters written from a more distant perspective giving a view across time and whole groups of people these are particularly prominent in the second part of the book after darling moves to america with the emigration of people from zimbabwe echoing the migration west during america's great depression i enjoyed the first section of the book when darling was in zimbabwe more than the second part after she had reached america i thought the narrative flowed better in the first part the second was perhaps a little more disconnected overall though honestly one of the best books i've read in a while and i hope it does really well and i must have liked it because i've just had to write this review twice the last one didn't save","895":"i thought i was finished with precocious child narrators who offer wise and wry insights on the world's evils but there is room for one more we need new names is very good and the audio version is superb","896":"this is a very powerful read about a young girl who grows up in zimbabwe and is taken to america to live with her aunt there's some funny moments but there are also a lot of emotional moments to echo mandy i had to set it down occasionally as it certainly affected my mood","897":"beautifully written vivid imagery but kind of a downer","898":"the first half of the book was interesting then suddenly out of nowhere it went into hello america mode i wished the author had spent more time describing the events prior to the trip how darling felt what impact it had on her mother and friends because of this i felt the book was rather incomplete but nonetheless after reading such books you can't help but feel so lucky not to ever live through such trauma","899":"http www dallasnews com entertainme dallas morning newsby jenny shank special contributorpublished 31 may 2013 07 26 pmwe need new names noviolet bulawayo's bold debut plunges into the lives of kids growing up in recent post british independence zimbabwe a time of hunger unrest and upheaval -- yet also cultural pride although schools are shuttered the kids display savvy awareness of world events evident in the games they play such as \"find bin laden\" and \"country game \" in which each participant assumes a role as a country and \"everybody wants to be the u s a and britain and canada\" and \"nobody wants to be rags of countries like congo like somalia like iraq ... and not even this one we live in -- who wants to be a terrible place of hunger and things falling apart \"the hungry children often search for guavas in budapest the wealthiest neighborhood near their own ramshackle one called paradise the kids' guava hunt puts them at the center of the action when a group of paradise men inspired by robert mugabe's program of land reform seizes the luxurious house of a white couple as seen through the eyes of 10 year old darling zimbabwe's troubles are legion -- from incest that results in her friend chipo's pregnancy to gnawing hunger that prompts the kids to grin for ngo photos to earn snacks rampant emigration sends many including darling's father to seek opportunities abroad darling's father returns when he's dying of aids a pervasive specter the kids know as \"the sickness \" yet these kids are not downtrodden -- on the contrary they are proud resourceful witty boastful and always dreaming of better days it's easy to see why bulawayo a zimbabwe native who earned degrees at texas au0026amp m commerce southern methodist university and cornell and currently holds a prestigious stegner fellowship at stanford has won so many accolades even before publishing her first book in darling bulawayo has created a fresh believable voice of a young woman that stays true to her age and perspective while conveying eye opening layers of knowledge pairing innocence with singular experience in the second half of the book when darling moves to michigan she pines for home even as she tries to lead a typical american teenage life with the access to facebook and internet pornography this entails when she daydreams over a guava smuggled through the mail that transports her to zimbabwe we are with her for all its charms we need new names is not quite structured as a novel bulawayo introduces elements that seem central to the story such as chipo's pregnancy darling's father's illness and darling's expired visitor visa but doesn't develop them when darling moves to america she's suddenly there with no building of suspense or detailing of plans that the move is imminent characters appear and quickly disappear each of these chapters is intense moving and vivid but it's best to enjoy them as stories and not look for overall plot momentum this isn't bulawayo's fault but that of the pesky sales seeking subtitle \"a novel\" that marks many linked story collections with talent this ringing readers can expect continued fine writing from bulawayo in whatever form it takes we need new names shows that even children raised in what darling calls \"the tatters\" of a country carry forward memories of languages cuisine and traditions that forever shape their imaginations jenny shank's first novel the ringer won the high plains book award","900":"loved this book have recommended it for my book club to read it","901":" we need new names was one of the most explosive literary debuts in recent years it got shout outs from junot diaz and ms magazine among many others and was eventually short listed for the man booker prize i have a divided opinion of it but noviolet bulawayo is an important new voice one who may have significant impact on the literary scene the narrator of we need new names is darling a ten year old zimbabwean girl due to political unrest darling and her family have been forced from a nice neighborhood into a slum in lieu of school children wander across the country stealing guavas and playing games we witness the tension in zimbabwe through the not quite innocence of darling and her friends a major shift comes half way through the book when darling goes to live with an aunt in detroit although the novel does not wholly drop zimbabwe the story's focus shifts to the immigrant experience my favorite part of we need new names is a small but intentional move by bulawayo although there are frequent mentions of africa the words zimbabwe or mugabe never appear in this book this omission is understandable as a child would be less interested than her readers in the current political scene more importantly this made we need new names a more universal story the first part of the book could happen in any country facing fear and unrest the second could be the life story of any immigrant i admire bulawayo for not giving her story a nationality i did mention that this was a powerful debut if you turn to the back cover of the first edition you'll see the praise an exquisite and powerful first novel i take issue with this statement not the exquisite and powerful bit but the part about novel i would argue we need new names is a collection of linked short stories masquerading as a novel thus i find it difficult to assign one judgment to the entire work the sections swing between sublimity and mediocrity for example how they lived one of the last chapters the book is alone worth the cover price bulawayo leaves darling and enters first person plural to condense the entire immigrant experience into just a few pages hope plenty success racism homesickness deterioration of culture it's all here that chapter is simply devastating yet rather than make that compelling section the last note of the book bulawayo crams in two final stories both among the weakest of we need new names the most distinctive facet of the book also my greatest reservation was the voice the first lines of the book are we are on our way to budapest bastard and chipo and godknows and sbho and stina and me we are going even though we are not allowed to cross mzilikazi road even though bastard is supposed to be watching his little sister fraction even though mother would kill me dead if she found out we are just going with a few minor blips the childish tone stays uniform for the rest of we need new names it is honest but not very enjoyable to read a brief aside i've always been unsure about those novels that aren't only from a child's point of view but try to mimic that voice if you're a third grader and you turn in the first chapter of we need new names the teacher will moan and tell you how to write properly if you're an adult author and you turn in the first chapter of we need new names junot diaz will rave about your skills and publish you in the boston review i know that comparison isn't fair forgive me but really what would happen if a third grader wrote we need new names would that child be declared a literary prodigy no there would probably be a parent teacher conference and some remedial writing tutorials most people seem to agree that this voice isn't beautiful or full of imagery or even enjoyable to read but it is accurate i actually contest that point yes the first chapters perfectly capture the voice of a ten year old a ten year old whose schooling has been interrupted by political unrest at that but by the end of the book when darling is a college student who frequently brags about her mastery of the english language and american slang the voice has not even shifted at all eight years pass darling returns to school but her tone does not even budge despite some of the critiques i did enjoy we need new names some of the chapters such as how they lived and an earlier bit where darling and her friends innocently try to abort a friend's pregnancy are simply riveting however most of the chapters fell far short of that sublimity in particular when darling moves to america bulawayo got too ambitious she tried to pursue far too many themes at the expense of a cohesive story however the honesty of the voice was appealing if not enjoyable and the cross cultural narrative gave bulawayo the chance to make many astute observations about america","902":"this was actually a really interesting read but i have no idea what the point of the story was it seemed a bit all over the place and the ending was confusing still enjoyed reading it though","903":" darling's childhood was great and her teen years even better but i wish we'd been more deeply mired in the transition from africa to north america from the permanence of her temporary home roaming the neighborhoods stealing guavas with her friends to the transitory feel of her permanent relocation to her aunt's house nothing quite as easy to grasp as those guavas were i loved what there was of the adjustment the immediate adjustment that is and wish bulawayo had sunk into it more but overall this is strong","904":"a book i will read and re read because i relived my childhood if you want a good laugh this is the book written from a child's perspective","905":"i did like this book telling a story from the point of view of a 10 year old is difficult but this was autobiographical so somewhat of a break for the writer still the rawness the unflinching shock of what this young girl sees in the us as compared to the brutality of her life in zam i wondered if she exchanged one evil place for another but she has opportunity in the us that she certainly did not have in her old country however knowing what to choose is the challenge this story of an exceptional young girl is most definitely worth your time","906":"interesting debut novel set in newly independent zimbabwe as told through the voice of darling and her friends who live in a shanty town bulawayo's style captures the innocence of children but draws us to the reality of corruption hunger violence and the internal conflicts facing the asylum seeker","907":" really good challenging provocative and smart at the outset of the novel darling is a ten year old living in a shantytown in zimbabwe running with a pack of close knit friends who enjoy stealing guavas in a wealthy neighbourhood and playing finding bin laden together resilient and sharp tongued despite the unfairness around them darling then joins her aunt in detroit where she seems more adrift alienated both from friends and family she left behind and from the dominant culture the writing is episodic and the ending inconclusive but these felt like deliberate meaningful choices","908":"one of the best books of 2013 hands down bulawayo has created the strongest narrative voice i've read in years it will most likely be compared to stephan kelman's pigeon english but i found it much stronger than kelman's novel","909":"while the author has a gift for expressing the rawness and reality of the characters' complex emotions and illuminating the cruelties and complexities of the political and social issues in zimbabwe the story loses power as it moves along perhaps a narrower scope would have been more satisfying to the reader many of the passages are so beautifully written one expects the whole book to a achieve such heights worth the time spent reading it but i finished it wishing it had lived up to what it could have been","910":"wow hilarious story with weird names and characters it was like listening to a ten years old tell the stories of her escapades thumbs up","911":"this is darling's story the first half takes place in the country formerly known as rhodesia i e zimbabwe the second half takes place in michigan i e in the united states darling is born into a middle class family shortly after independence her father is a university graduate and both her parents work they have a nice home the all the homes in their neighborhood are bulldozed by the government who knows why and they live in a slum called paradise darling and her friends no longer attend school because all the teachers have left the country the hospital is closed because all the doctors nurses and staff are on strike food is scarce the kids go nuts when the ngo truck arrives and spend much of their time stealing guavas off the trees in a much richer community darling's father has gone to south africa because there is no work for him in rhodesia when he finally returns he has the sickness things actually get worse and then darling at 10 years of age is rescued by her aunt who lives in detroit michigan she enters the us on a school visa that is good for one year the visa is not renewed and she does not leave darling finds america to be vastly different that the america of her dreams she pines for home for her country her mother and her friends but she cannot return even to visit as when her visa expires she is an illegal this is a debut novel and i found it quite enjoyable however as many reviewers note the author has thrown a whole lot more issues into it that seem to distract from what i perceived as the main theme the african diaspora for me there are two chapters that are among the best writing i've read about the african diaspora the first is a two pager found at pages 147 48 or the hardcover called how they left the second paragraph is an excellent example of the emotion of this short chapter when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands the second is 13 pages found at pages 239 252 called how they lived on page 244 the following paragraph is a sample of the poignancy of this chapter and because we were illegal and afraid to be discovered we kept mostly to ourselves stuck to our kind and shied away from those who were not like us we did not know what they would think of us what they would do about us we did not want their wrath we did not want their curiosity we did not want any attention we did not meet stares and we avoided gazes we hid our real names gave false ones when asked we built mountains between us and them we dug rivers we planted thorns we had paid so much to be in america and we did not want to lose it all i am rounding this up to a 4 star primarily for the content of the two chapters described above i look forward to this author's next effort","912":"for what it's worth i liked the first half of this book much better than the second overall the writing is gorgeous and fitting for the narrator a girl growing up in a world two worlds actually filled with surprise and uncertainty a couple chapters step outside the narrative and feel awkward even as they provide a more grown up perspective of things short not always sweet and a bit disconnected at times but enjoyable and at times heartbreaking","913":"i loved the narrative voice in this book darling's voice as she grew older and moved from zimbambwe to the us was moving and effective at conveying so much it is hard not to compare this book to americanah which i read earlier this year and which bowled me over there was less depth or complexity to the story and characters in we need new names but it was beautifully written and well worth the read i wil look forward to reading bulawayo's next novel","914":"beautiful writing and story what americanah was attempting but much better","915":" this book was such disappointment for me after reading so many great reviews there were so many disconnects pieces of the story that just abruptly ended u0026amp never returned to again i suppose that may have been intentional given this was a story of a young girl forced to leave her homeland u0026amp immigrate to the us but it made for frustrating reading u0026amp an overall feeling of disconnect in me personally i often struggled with the writing style as well particularly in the descriptions of things settings feelings she seemed to use contradictions in a way that just left me confused for example in america roads are like the devils hands like god's love reaching all over finally some of the violence u0026amp sexual themes kids watching pornography online described in full detail were just too much raw disgusting u0026amp distracting from the otherwise emotional appeal of a child displaced","916":" i was lucky to have met ms bulawayo at the la times book festival and i am happy i did she dealt with the typical immigrant experience in this novel and although it dealt with illegal immigration there are lessons to be taken for the legal immigrant as well two passages stand out to me the others spoke languages we did not know worshipped different gods ate what we would dare not touch but like us they left their homelands behind they flipped open their wallets to show us faded photographs of mothers whose faces bore the same creases of worry as our very own mothers siblings bleak eyed with dreams unfulfilled like those of our own fathers forlorn and defeated like ours we had never seen their countries but we know about everything in those pictures we were not altogether strangers i love this passage because my personal immigration experience is not much different that any other immigrant we carry the hopes and dreams of family and our family's family what a burden the second passage is we did not go home to visit because we did not have the papers for our return and so we just stayed in the usa knowing that if we went we would not be able to reenter america we stayed like prisoners only we chose to be prisoners and we loved our prison it was not a bad prison and when things only got worse in our country we pulled our shackles even tighter and said we are not leaving america no we are not leaving powerful stuff given how bad the immigrant experience can be it is still better that our homelands nobody would willingly give up their homeland for a xenophobic one if things were not so hopeless in our respective homeland as immigrants we live between two worlds and excepted by neither i will never be accepted by my american brethren because i am different even though my passport says american i have been rejected by my kin because of the perceived rejection of my old values i am seeing as american by my family chasing the american dream of plates of food weighing more than head the mcmansion's and of course material possessions that are so expensive the individual purchase could feed a family back home for years and years the other important point that i took from this book is that we want to be content in life we chase contentment but this contentment only breeds mediocrity it is this agitation and this discord that we experience internally that ultimately makes us a success in america whatever that success my be great literature arts and scientific contributions to our society do not come from contentment but the internal agitation that we potentially all feel that makes us successful in other words when we feel that we don't fit in we are apt to be our best interesting yes this is ms bulawayo's first novel well done","917":" excellent zimbabwean author bulawayo tells the story of a young girl who leaves zimbabwe to live in the usa i read chapter 16 several times because it was brilliant i later found an interview where the author was asked her favorite part of the novel and sure enough chapter 16 here's an excerpt we heard all this but we let it enter in one ear and leave through the other pretended we did not hear we would not be moved we would not listen we were going to america in the footsteps of those looted black sons and daughters we were going yes we were going and when we got to america we took our dreams looked at them tenderly as if they were newly born children and put them away we would not be pursuing them we would never be the things we had wanted to be doctors lawyers teachers engineers no school for us even though our visas were school visas we knew we did not have the money for school to begin with but we had applied for school visas because that was our only way out instead of going to school we worked our social security cards said valid for work only with ins authorization but we gritted our teeth and broke the law and worked what else could we do what could we have done what could anybody have done and because we were breaking the law we dropped our heads in shame we had never broken any laws before we dropped our heads because we were no longer people we were now illegals when they debated what to do with illegals we stopped breathing stopped laughing stopped everything and listened when they talked about employers checking on workers our hearts sank we recalled the tatters of our country left behind barely held together by american dollars by monies from other countries and our blood went cold and the jobs we worked jesus jesus jesus the jobs we worked low paying jobs backbreaking jobs jobs that gnawed at the bones of our dignity devoured the meat tongued the marrow we took scalding irons and ironed our pride flat we cleaned toilets we picked tobacco and fruit under the boiling sun until we hung our tongues and panted like lost hounds we butchered animals slit throats drained blood we worked with dangerous machines holding our breath like crocodiles underwater our minds on the money and never on our lives we got sick but we did not go to hospitals could not go to hospitals every two weeks we got our paychecks and sent monies back home and every so often we listened over the phone to the voices of our parents and elders shy voices telling us what was needed they had long since ceased to be providers for us we were now their parents our extended families sent requests and we worked worked like donkeys worked like slaves worked like madmen when we hesitated they said you are in america where everybody has money we see it all on tv please don't deny us","918":"a very powerful book","919":"i enjoyed reading this book especially the first half of the book a 10 year old darling and her friends in zimbabwe the author choose interesting names for the characters it's hilarious and sad at the same the book takes you on a remarkable journey in the lives of the characters the zimbabwean culture and their daily struggles i finished reading this book in less than a week","920":"i especially enjoyed the first part of the novel which dealt with darling's young life in zimbabwe the tone of the book changed in the second part of the book when darling's life is americanised warts and all the major recurring theme of the book illustrated in both zimbabwe and america is of 'things falling apart'","921":" we need new names did more and less than i expected so much of the writing was beautiful and vivid sometimes startlingly so and this made me perhaps too critical of the occasional clunky bit i loved the parts about the people and the land which made me think of the grapes of wrath and i really liked darling the protagonist who is able to hold a lot of different visions of the world as it can be as it has been as it is now in her head at once i look forward to teaching it i'm particularly interested to see the reactions of my students who have grown up as immigrants or children of immigrants i imagine they'll have a lot to say about darling's experiences","922":" some liked the first half and thought it fell apart when darling came to america some thought it started slowly and picked up when darling came to america i found both parts very good and incredibly depressing each chapter is a stand alone short story in my opinion darling with her pals is a ten year old living in a shantytown in zimbabwe they do wild things stealing guavas from trees in a richer neighborhood while sometimes recalling when they had homes and attended school darling gets to come to america and live with an aunt she and her friends in michigan watch porn when no one's home she takes bad jobs with no future really affecting","923":" i liked this book for the insight into the struggles of the people of zimbabwe as they shed colonialism only to fall victim to more violence and corruption under local rule the author described one episode i assume to be based on fact where an entire middle class neighborhood was bulldozed and its inhabitants were left to relocate and build a shanty town never to recover i also enjoyed the funny names of the children and their knowing banter i gather that was meant to be the sugar that coats the reader's throat and stomach so as to the ugly truth medicine to go down but i didn't find the banter and knowledge of the children to be believable and the last section of the book was a gross departure in tone and content from the previous sections that was disconcerting","924":" what a unique and powerful book it opens with darling a girl growing up in a zimbabwean shantytown called paradise which it's anything but filled as it is with refugees living in tin shacks playing with her friends bastard stina shbo godknows and chipo the children crave some guavas so they run off to a nicer part of their town they call budapest to steal them from the wealthy residents the glimpse of life bulawayo gives us of growing up in a place like paradise is riveting tin roofs never enough food searing heat friends and family members dying of aids dust dust always the dust not having shoes because they're too small but then darling moves to america to detroit to live with her aunt and it is there that she comes of age but is she american is she still zimbabwean she doesn't really fit into the world of most american teens she gets angry at her friend for not using proper english and she's a hard and conscientious worker at her job at the grocery store but yet she's no longer zimbabwean she calls home to speak with her friends but what can she say she's so far removed from their reality interspersed in darling's story is a few chapters of the pain that immigrants to america face every day separated by so many miles from their loved ones and their homeland just to try to live a better life i was moved in particular by the chapters entitled how they left which straddles the first section when darling is still in zimbabwe and when she moves to detroit and how they lived from how they left look at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same it's writing like this that sucked me in the pain so very evident that's just behind the surface the pain of an immigrant who misses her home but knows it's no longer home and though i am definitely not an expert in the african experience i lived for a month in kenya in a tent near a shantytown and the disconnect between the life of the teens there and the life i lived as a privileged american teen was mind blowing i highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand his horizons and ideas of life in other countries","925":"an ok and quick read it did feel a bit disjointed each chapter was like a short story","926":"this would be amazing as an audio book could not put it down in your face","927":"this was all right better in some parts than others","928":" \"we need new names\"by noviolet bulawayothough set in zimbabwe during the economic collapse this is not an account of political mayhem rather about a group of children coping with the consequences 10 year old darling and her friends residents of a shantytown named paradise roam the streets of next door suburb budapest to steal guavas or anything that will stave off their hunger they deal with childhood pregnancy and absent parents who return from work in south africa with nothing but aids but dream of life in america as seen on tv later darling joins her aunt fostalina in the us but immigrant life is far removed from tv a world of menial jobs where to survive \"we need new names\" to cover for their illegal status dreams now are of the homeland to which they cannot return the scope of the novel is perhaps over ambitious but the writing exquisite noviolet bulawayo is a writer to watch","929":"so much humor and so much heartbreaking tragedy all at once increasingly the latter as the story moves on i did think it was interesting how she never once used the words zimbabwe or mugabe during the entire thing which i'm sure there's a motive for even if i don't understand it i was slightly disappointing by the ending slight spoiler because it just seemed to end abruptly and with a really disturbing final image but i think maybe that final image was supposed to signify deeper things that i didn't get or maybe there just is no neat ending for a story like this anyway","930":"i'm not exactly sure what to make of this book it was jarring and dark at times but extremely well written i think bulawayo's best work is still to come but she set the bar high with this book","931":"this book was quite odd the writing style and story weren't as engaging as they could have been and made it hard to follow and really care about the characters","932":"the argument is often made that books can take you anywhere it's an old maximum about the importance of reading and the joys it can bring but where has it taken you recently has it just been entertainment for your middle class american life maybe at best a fantasy dystopia that is actually just a metaphor for middle class american life well sometimes it's nice to read a book that really takes you somewhere else to a different life that opens your eyes to things you aren't seeing or don't want to see","933":"started off with a strong voice but i lost the thread of the story somewhere through the middle and never found it again i agree with a lot of reviewers in thinking that she tries to do too much still was worth the read some striking writing","934":" note this is a first novel written by a zimbabwean writer the author has recently won a 5 under 35 prize from the national book foundation and a spot on the booker prize shortlist it was from these prestigious accolades that i was interested in the book and i am glad i found it it is a beautiful first novel darling the narrator is a young zimbabwean girl who comes to america and the author captures the harrowing and sad journey with crystalline sentences and very moving characters there is so much raw sadness in this book can't wait for the next effort by this young talent bulawayo","935":"the first part of the book really was amazing darling the ten year old zimbabwe girl is the narrator and her voice is funny authentic in the second part of the book darling comes to america to live with her aunt fostalina others told me this part wasn't as good but i think that is because darling is describing her life in a culture that is so not zimbabwe she is not critical of her new home just factual and the difference between the two are so stark that one has to wonder about what darling has gained and what she has lost","936":"first let me say that my review is leaving a lot of wiggle room for what i hope becomes a long writing career for bulawayo second let me say that i hope darling's character returns in the future i want to know what happens in her life both as a child and now as a teen she is such a bright and sharp observer she admittedly has no clue to what studies she will pursue but conflict with her aunt over her career seems likely and her extended american family is falling apart the road ahead does not look any easier than the road behind her one thing is clear she can never return to zimbabwe both because she has only an expired visitor's visa and because she sees the irrepairable change that has taken place within her while in america thus the ending which at first left me baffled but on reflection makes sense i now understand the death of the dog there were a lot of dog cameos in this book symbolizes that loss while the odor of the bread indicates the continuance of life i'm not really giving a lot away all this is rather obvious as you read i admit to having read this as a novel it says a novel in small letters on the front but it's really stories and a few assorted related writings assembled in chronological order of which a couple proved a distraction for me bulawayo is a marvelous storyteller but just as masterly was her ability to make the reader see themselves in the book either as darling or as an american citizen interacting with darling and she shows us how large that chasm of misknowledge is in both directions this is a must read for anyone whose lives intersect with immigrant cultures or whose work or study includes foreign travel to war torn or underserved countries it would also provide interesting discussion for liberal inter faith organizations but be forewarned some content is graphic and disturbing bulawayo gives you the real dirt with precision and poetics and heartache beautifully done","937":"a stunning tale of leaving home and never being truly at home again bulawayo was born in zimbabwe and now lives in the us but her story is surely a universal one expressing the dislocation of the immigrant experience","938":" find all of my reviews at http 52bookminimum blogspot com noviolet bulawayo tells a tale that is almost unfathomable who could ever imagine living the first few years of life as an average middle class girl in an average house in an average town attending an average school and having that world flipped upside down that is the story of what happens to darling and her friends when bulldozers sweep through their average lives in zimbabwe demolishing everything in their path now the children and their families live in a shanty town overrun by starvation disease and despair darling's only hope that keeps her going is the dream of one day making it to america and living with her aunt what a remarkably honest book noviolet bulawayo makes you become darling you truly feel like you are reading a story told by a 10 year old girl and you progressively get older along with her dealing with the horrors of reality ranging from poverty to rape to racism to aids to the fact that america may not be the land of milk and honey which so many dream of bulawayo pulls no punches the writing style of chapters that read like miniature stories rather than a continuous narrative really works in this book bulawayo has a lot to say - a lot that needs to be said - and she found a great way to put it all in one book that is just the right length","939":"sfpl's jan feb on the same page book not really my cup of tea but this story of a young girl in zimbabwe who ends up emigrating to america is a pretty good outsider's look at the u s she doesn't provide enough conttext at times what happened to tk being a big example","940":" how do you say something about a book like this well written vivid descriptions faces actual faces that look back at me street signs smells joy fear sorrow i loved reading this book even though poverty porn is despicable to me somehow i could find joy in the parts that the west finds poor and those who lived it find rich multi textured and honorable stories told about people leaving their homes to find better places to live always have me peeking from behind my skirt or my mama's in terror i'm afraid they're going to say something that the rest of us are going to have to explain when people pose their tiresome questions beginning of chapter entitled how they lived i don't think i can be objective because my heart of hearts lies in the pages of this book take from it what you will nkosi sikelel iafrica","941":"i did not enjoy a single moment of reading this book it's not a bad book but i enjoyed none of it i'm sorry i had to waste my time on it and it on me we both should have been seeing other people","942":"haunting and beautiful these stories will stalk me for a long time","943":"at first i found we need new names challenging i persisted and ignored the nightmares that the story generated i'm glad i did because this is an excellent book the story line is clear and noviolet bulawayo's articulate writing paints the pictures i recognise the zimbabwe she is writing about and it breaks my heart from the minutiae to the broad global scene there is a resonance any immigrant black or white can identify with","944":"we need new names is remarkable beautiful if ever there was a time where art could shape policy this is the time and this could be the book","945":"oof this book was so brutal that it was almost disorienting horrors observed casually through the eyes of a child and then later the careful but devastatingly mundane observations of a teenage girl in a much different scenario powerful and i'm glad i read it but proceed with this book ready to have an intense experience","946":"this is an extraordinary book vital raw shocking and tender beautifully and poignantly written i so appreciated being exposed to the human experience of zimbabwe's turbulent recent history","947":"the part of the book set in zimbabwe was excellent a unique take on the country's problems seen through the eyes of a child it hit home like nothing else i have read unfortunately the momentum is lost when darling moves to the u s there were moments of redemption but generally they were too few and far between and the book became tedious if it were the first half alone it would have received five stars","948":" darling's story is both specific and universal about the realities of growing up on poverty and of immigrating for both facets of her life this book is a gripping read the hope of something better albeit to be found in destroyedmichigan buoys darling in her zimbabwean existence the remembrance of before makes now a challenge with the lack of food schooling and other minor amenities the transition to life in america is no easier and she is old enough or wise enough to realize that she can no more return to home than she can ever be home in america","949":"beautifully written in its own unique poetic language loved the part set in zimbabwe second part set in usa didn't add much bit disappointing","950":"another book by a zimbabwean inspired by what mr mugabe has done to the country a good and easy read telling the story through a child's eyes takes off a bit of the edge no need to understand zimbabwe but it would certainly help it's fiction but only just i'll certainly look for her next book","951":"who can resist the author's name i thought this was a very good book was more interested in the zimbabwean than the american section frustrated and confused by the ending","952":"i read this in one sitting i am haunted by the images of war torn zimbabwe and it's starving children thinking that life is better here in america only to realize it isn't to be displaced as an immigrant taking menial jobs and adopt alien customs read this book that's all i have to say","953":"i found the pidgin a bit difficult going at first but as i got into it it really flowed a touching fictional but real look at a large portion of the people on the african continent","954":"i've recently realized i quite enjoy fiction for adults narrated by children we need new names is an incredible example of why couldn't put it down","955":" 3 5 stars this book has been staring at me from the staff recommendations shelf of my bookstore for so long i figured it was about time i picked it up the first half of the book flew by for me but the second half lagged lethargically and i found myself struggling a little to hard to reach the finish line we need new names tells the story of darling a young girl who spends the first half of the novel in paradise a shantytown in zimbabwe she used to live in a middle class enclave but following the political unrest and revolutions of her country her family sought refuge in paradise she spends her childhood in paradise running around and exploring with her ragtag group of friends beautiful sbho loud bastard logical stina quiet and pregnant chipo stealing guavas from the homes in wealthy neighborhoods climbing trees to watch funeral services playing games like find bin laden and singing to lady gaga songs bulawayo writes this part beautifully and her influence from chinua achebe is evident darling is a wonderful heroine she switches from precocious childlike wonder to wisdom beyond her years she and her friends have been forced to grow up too fast as many other reviewers have pointed out the book struggles in its second half the episodic nature of bulawayo's storytelling worked very well in zimbabwe but feels rushed and haphazard once darling moved to detroit many key moments in darling's life i would have liked to see her goodbyes to her friends and family in paradise her plane ride overseas her first day at an american school are glossed over or not acknowledged at all the story shifts inevitably perhaps to a more typical story of a young immigrant's struggle to assimilate to american life without losing ties to her home life and country the story how they lived chronicles this struggle beautifully but it's a story that's been told many times i was also confused by how bulawayo chose to end the story specifically the last page that might be my own fault the significance might just be over my head but i would have liked a nicer ending than that gory sad incident this book will definitely be five stars for the right audience which unfortunately isn't me it has some beautiful beautiful passages in it and some wonderful characters bulawayo is an author to watch","956":"my boss shared this book with me and prefaced it by saying she liked it more than americanah the prose is elegant even as its protagonist darling struggles to make english and then american english hers the story was too slow for me in the beginning but the prose was compelling enough for me to continue reading and i came to care about little darling the themes of religion being other western paternalism loss the american dream and others are all touched on in some manner and while i would love to read a collection of ms bulawayo's essays i'm glad she made this novel pithy i agree that this book got glossed over in the rightful hype of americanah but i hope more people will take the time to discover ms bulawayo i wish i could give this book 3 5 stars instead of merely 3","957":"for some reason i just didn't really enjoy this book i guess it was your typical africa to america book and when the girl got to america i really lost interest in the novel a good story and well written but not of my interest","958":"read it cover to cover on a flight from new york to california possibly the best book i read this year i wish everyone who judges immigrants harshly for not learning english for misunderstanding cultural cues for their differences could read this or at least the short chapter called how they lived heartbreaking poetic illuminating","959":"i think this is a wonderful book and certainly deserved to be short listed for the man booker prize beautifully written and indeed very realistic","960":" i'm not sure what to think about this book on one hand i understood the main character at the beginning she's young she's hungry her social support is more or less a group of equally hungry preteens one of whom is pregnant via rape the beginning is a gripping interesting look at life in a country i know nothing about the second half of the book is about a bratty teenager whining because america is not the land of milk and honey she imagined she didn't come here to clean toilets or work crummy jobs it's incredibly hard to care about her lousy job in a supermarket when a i've worked in retail myself and b earlier in the book she breezed past a retail greeter like the woman didn't exist honestly her most likeable moment comes when she slaps a miserable child who throws a ball at her the rest of the characters are unlikeable i especially hated aunt fostalina oh the woman over the phone can't understand your accent time to be a bitch to her chipo the incest rape victim back in zimbabwe starts out sympathetic and heart breaking then ends as a nag who bitches at the main character because she left the land of starvation and rape to go to america subtlety is for wimps i guess noviolet bulawayo is talented that much is obvious however i don't think this book is a good example of that talent","961":"its a book about a group of children dealing with poverty and systemic despair caused by political incapabilities in zimbabwe it illuminates their childlike concerns and perspectives on many issues having to do with african experiences and theirs specifically when the protagonist darling goes to america its about her juggling of two identities and two worlds in the same headspace its about what it means to run for survival but feel guilty for the act and miss where you're running from at first i was very sceptical about the voice of darling because it was inconsistent she went from saying childlike things to suddenly expressing herself in overly philosophical or too articulate ways so it felt slightly messy in that regard but i enjoyed the expressions that the writer used they are expressions that are apt but not immediately obvious you'd never think to say them but they are true e g my country is a coke bottle that breaks and disappoints or something like that the book had lovely poetic qualities and great insights and questions like what it means to be african and also put a spotlight on the curiosity and patronising nature of ngos","962":"not an amazing read the beginning was amazing however tragic but after the first half of the book everything gets rather fragmentary and you loose grip of the story as it processes much too quickly it's one of my most important pieces of literature i've read this year however a voice often hushed has here been raised and with great potential","963":"more of a 3 5","964":"i really wanted to like this book more i have read a number of books in this strangers in a strange land genre and i thought the writing here was particularly flat and preachy","965":" not sure how to feel about this one there were parts that were so beautiful and powerfully written especially having just read gow i could make a lot of connections between the descriptions of the experience of being an outsider foreigner the narrative of this was just a bit too jumpy for me i suppose each episode contributed to the overall narrative but they were just so random to me the chapters and sections that were beautiful were really powerful and i guess that would make this more of a 3 5 stars for me","966":"i know i read to escape and for entertainment but what the heck did i just read can some one explain it to me","967":"told through the voice of darling a little girl living in an african shanty town called paradise running wild with her madly named gang of friends they love nothing better than to visit the nearby town of budapest to steal guavas from the trees of the rich people they play games and observe the adults in their town they all aspire to a better life and to moving away from their homes to live in the mythical land called america darling is lucky her aunt takes her to america where she has to learn to fit in and where she discovers that america is not the fabled land of plenty she imagined it to be a story about home and family and the hardships of immigration","968":"enjoyed the pace of the book and the way ms bulawayo gave me this incredible insight into the immigrant experience here in the us","969":"beautifully written haunting characters that will stay with you i thoroughly enjoyed every moment the idea of moving away from everything and everyone you know and seeing your future generations altered because of it seeing your culture muddied and diluted because of a move to a new country with new cultures and how that will change your children and your grandchildren amazing","970":"a young girl travels from africa to america only to find one set of problems replaced with another i didn't warm to the writing style format of this book it came across as a series of short stories rather than a complete novel even though there were some good ideas sections in this work i didn't feel that i gained anything from reading it","971":"wonderful writing there are a few points where it shifts from a plotline of one girl to social commentary which while i agreed with the message i found jarring pulling me out of my investment in the story but an excellent novel overall","972":"we need new names is pretty far out of my usual reading through no design of my own i seem to gravitate toward american european authors probably a function of the things i have easy access to i first heard of we need new names when news of the 2013 man book prize was being reported when the short list was announced i made note of all the titles and intend on picking them up at one point or another read my full review here http www thewhynottblog com book re","973":"this felt more like a collection of stories rather than a novel although i enjoyed it for the most part i felt that she would have done well to develop the characters more not as good as i hopes it would be","974":" we need new names is my third recent foray into works by african ex pats there was ngoze adiche's americanah before that peter godwin's memoir when a crocodile eats the sun and now noviolet bulawayo brings us this lively often painful account of a zimbabwean girl's journey from her homeland to the u s at first you think you're in europe because the kids are going to budapest it doesn't take long to realize that budapest is just a district and that there are others named after other such cities these are areas with fine homes and gardens where the children can steal guavas to assuage their hunger it used to be better for them it was rhodesia ruled by whites then the whites were conquered then mugabe's new black government bulldozed their homes no explanation but if you read godwin's book you know mugabe needs no explanation everyone's leaving to find work or a little freedom and darling the narrator's name has an aunt on the east coast and eventually she's able to get there one problem once her visa expires she can't leave unless she wants to leave permanently so she takes menial jobs manages to go to school some a scattered and hodgepodge life alienated from her closest family friends culture and customs and as the title suggests names much of the book is fun great teen and pre teen hijinks both in africa and the u s flavored always by context of race and nationality some of the scenes are horrifying as the one where a 13 year old's friends attempt to perform an abortion on there to rid her of her grandfather's fetus however all the high quality writing can't save the book as a whole its episodes are not unified by voice or style sometimes she sounds like a twelve year old other times like an adult looking back on her twelve year old self","975":"fantastic book about the realities of home the american dream and how culture and family affect us","976":"interesting enough to keep you reading i wanted more in the end","977":"i can't decide how to rate this one some parts were stronger than others and the very last few paragraphs left me somewhat baffled they clearly meant something to the author but whatever it was i didn't follow also i couldn't help feeling a twinge of irritation at the american dream is a sham theme given that the author has in fact received an ivy league education and was short listed for the booker prize i realize most immigrants won't achieve anything like her level of success but still neither will most of the rest of us","978":"i was underwhelmed by this book i am giving it three stars because there were stretches of really lovely writing","979":" i thought this was a wonderful book that will stay in my head for a very long time noviolet bulawayo tells the story of darling a young zimbabwean girl who eventually moves to america in darling's own voice her ability to capture this voice is remarkable bulawayo's choice of an episodic structure for her novel gives it the feel of a journal rather than a tightly structured narrative this seems perfect for a child's point of view it also makes the book a little frustrating to read as certain narrative strands are never really concluded she also never actually names her country zimbabwe at first i thought that she was being a little too precious in not giving this important information but then i began to realize that she wanted to emphasize the universality of the immigrant experience which she does in one of the few chapters not written in darling's voice look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth lest they be mistaken for those who want to claim the land as theirs look at them leaving in droves arm in arm with loss and lost look at them leaving in droves this kind of language makes this book a delight to read although there may be a few flaws in we need new names they in no way make it any less wonderful to read in fact any flaws are more the result of risks the writer was willing to take i would much rather read a book in which the author took chances even if they don't work perfectly than one which follows a prescribed formula this is noviolet bulawayo's first book i look forward eagerly to reading her next one","980":" hard to say what drew me to this book the author's name is just awesome the cover is eye catching the reviews have been stellar also i've long been interested in the painful history of zimbabwe once british colonial rhodesia since i tried to figure out how to teach this hugely complex subject and do it justice in my middle school social studies classroom i can't say that i ever really succeeded bulawayo writes a searingly beautiful story a fictionalized memoir about a young girl darling growing up in a zimbabwean shantytown called paradise the words zimbabwe and mugabe never appear in the book which somehow makes the sense of place and the menace of the president all the more real bulawayo is brilliant at showing us zimbabwe through the eyes of ten year old darling and her friends even the most horrifying and heart wrenching scenes are leavened by the children's incredulity defiant mischievousness and bursts of humor the language is simply beautiful fresh genuine evocative most impressively bulawayo keeps the narrative just as compelling when sort of a spoiler but not really darling moves to america halfway through the book this would be a natural place for a book to lose steam changing settings after such a vivid first half but darling's story remains riveting and we see america afresh through her eyes what does it mean to be american to be african where does darling belong and what is 'her country' the book offers no easy answers that would be impossible but with immigration a hotter political topic than ever we need new names offers us a wonderful intensely personal perspective on what it means to be an immigrant in modern america highly recommended for high school and above and the scene which gives the book its title wow so poignant i can't do justice describing it so i won't try but you'll see when you read it","981":"powerful and thought provoking series of interwoven stories about darling a young girl growing up in zimbabwe who moves to the united states the book reminds me a little of the style of junot diaz's this is how you lose her except i think this book holds together a little more cohesively excellent","982":"it was alright i guess i was expecting more not much plot","983":"after not reading for fun for quite some time thanks grad school i picked up this book based on the positive buzz surrounding it from casual readers and authors whom i really admire junot diaz being the primary advocate i could not have picked a better book to start reading for fun again ms bulawayo's writing style is so unique crisp and clear our main character darling is a child throughout the events of the novel so her language the way she views the world her emotions are all those of an actual child darling and her friends make up words explanations why the world is the way it is games and toys all in such a unique mash up of english that made reading this book so much fun and interesting i fell hard for both the characters and ms bulawayo's writing it reminded me a bit of both mr diaz's books and another favorite of mine that played so well with english characters and voice ' everything is illuminated' because darling our main character is a child the events she experiences are seen through a child's eyes things that would have become overwhelmingly unbearably sad in another protagonist's views and in another author's hands we are able to see understand and empathize with when seeing them through darling it is a unique way to introduce us to an old tale made new here through this new character and this new author would definitely recommend","984":"i adored everything about this book and can't wait to read more from noviolet bulawayo bravo","985":" i disliked this book at first but in retrospect it grew on me the style is different and somewhat difficult it's almost stream of consciousness like a simple honest account of every day little things that provide insight after letting it digest overall i would liken it to a plate of vegetables that you know is good for you and you should eat or read i learned a lot about her life growing up and then how difficult it is to be uprooted and expected that if simply placed in the us all else will fall into place in enjoyed the book in retrospect but not necessarily while reading it i would recommend it","986":"what i enjoyed most about this novel was the realism there was no romanticised happily ever after story but rather a young woman darling who is truly a displaced person she doesn't feel at home in the usa and she no longer feels the connection to her homeland i imagine this to be a common story amongst immigrants all around the globe","987":" another good novel by an african writer that focuses on african immigration similar to adichie's americanah it is more of a coming of age story than americanah as bulwayo's main character is a girl who yet to graduate from high school at the end of the book what bulwayo gives us is a child's perspective of life in the home country that she never mentions by name and the complexities of life in america's midwest like americanah we need new names is an honest and critical view of america through the eyes of a newcomer without giving too much away i highly recommend this book to be read with americanah","988":"a tremendously compelling look the experiences of displaced refugees and their subsequent lives as immigrants often undocumented in america painful and heartbreaking at points and startlingly funny elsewhere bulawayo does an incredible job of working in the voice of a child and young adolescent in relating these experiences intersperse with the voice of a collective narrator who communicates the broader experiences of these groups","989":"i might even rate this book 2 5 stars i didn't love it slow moving i felt no connection to any of the characters i liked the concept of the storyline but this book didn't do it for me probably would not recommend","990":" a startlingly sincere sweet and superb slice of life translated onto the page with a ferocious simplicity and strength noviolet bulawayo manages to translate both the savagery and the sumptuousness of life in an african village as well as the utter displacement of immigrants who leave their homeland behind through healthy and well timed bouts of humour the reader is lead by the hand through the eyes of the fledgling protagonist darling as she steals plays hides dreams and despairs throughout her early and teenage years sensitive issues swipe into the story with extreme subtlety sneaking upon the seemingly naive characters playing games based on murder grief and the harsh lives faced by the multitudes of individuals abused silenced and made homeless thanks to the machinations of a country around them whilst an african country reveals itself as a nerve wracking setting it remains colourful vibrant and wondrous thanks to the description of the landscape atmosphere people and culture through such sensitive eyes and words although america is idealised as the 'dream' of darling her eventual landing upon us shores drop the veil on a bland foul mouthed grey lonely society and culture centred around ideals of beauty envy anger war alcohol sex and technology this overarching weight of america as an oppressive nation for the african immigrant is somewhat overcooked as you near the final chapter but the strength and clarity of bulawayo's writing makes for a pensive and thoughtful finale","991":"5 stars for brilliant and striking metaphor and beautiful childlike writing in the first half 2 stars for kind of random unsteady narrative structure and kind of annoying attempts at social commentary","992":"this novel which follows a girl named darling through the months and years before and after she leaves zimbabwe for america took me awhile to get into however as i kept reading it gathered a great deal of power so that by the end i was sincerely impressed and moved by what i had read the beginning chapters in particular did for me what a lot of the best fiction does which is to provide a glimpse of an unknown world in this case life in zimbabwe under the rule of robert mugabe viewed through the eyes of a child who doesn't exactly comprehend what is happening the later chapters which follow darling after she has come to america make our culture both familiar and strange bulawayo has an excellent eye for detail this makes darling's feelings of being torn between two nations all the more poignant reading stories like this about vividly described lives that are so different than my own makes me take a look at all the people i pass or ride the bus with on a daily basis and wonder about where they came from literally or figuratively any book that elicits that sense of wonder from its reader is one to be praised imho","993":"this is a tough one for me it violates my trans dehumanizing commentary 1 star rule the content is so good and necessary that i am ignoring the rule in this one case i think the discussions of race class government ngos poverty etc are amazing totally worth a read","994":"first she lived in a town in zimbabwe called paradisethen she moved to americadifferent problems in each place","995":"as it always happens i'm never able to fathom how books like these are actually debut novels narratives so powerful visions so grasping et al talk of suffering is nothing new talk of it with such intensity is nothing new either but such takes still have me everytime at the sheer honesty yet firmness with which they are told of the graphic descriptions and jagged words that always hold up books like we need new names","996":"quite an extraordinary eye opening book about an african youngster dreaming of escape to america makes you appreciate everything you have when you read of other lives you're hidden from apart from a slight difficulty in understand the way it's laid down there are some beautiful phrases that kept me going","997":"this is a book that started out quiet and really snuck up on me in its intensity and brilliance touching on the tragedies surrounding growing up and immigrating and finding yourself without being heavy handed noviolet carefully lays the groundwork for this incredible story following darling from a young age to her adulthood in america we get the tone and the sacrifices that come with such a significant change and the harsh realities that come with the transition i was also very impressed with the way darling's story feels so powerful and personal but it's written into a larger narrative about the things multiple generations will face it's a good read that makes you think","998":"probably a 3 5 actually it helps having lived in africa i think it probably made it to the finalists of the booker prize list because for political reasons as opposed to great writing some things to ponder as you read along","999":"ms bullawayo really does a great job of looking at the world through the eyes of a 10yr old kid i really enjoyed this one artfully writen about life in zimbabwe and then moving to the western world very funny and poignant","1000":"this is what being part of a book club is about it was interesting to read a book that i wouldn't have chosen for about 5 minutes nothing really happens some broad brush social commentary but basically crushingly boring just a series of events that don't seem to go anywhere","1001":"wow i have just finished reading we need new names the poignant story of darling a young zimbabwean refugee this debut fictional work told in two parts by young african writer noviolet buloway is so vividly told it's almost certainly largely autobiographical i particularly loved the first half of the story in which darling and her friends bastard chipo godknows forgiveness sbho and stina from a shanty town ironically called paradise roam the nearby 'white' neighbourhood of budapest on seemingly typical childlike adventures their escapades include stealing guavas throwing rocks poking fun at the residents episodes that seem at first to be slightly risky but mainly harmless fun all too soon you realise for the children in darling's gang there is a lot more of a struggle for existence going on with members of the group dealing with poverty starvation witchcraft incest childhood pregnancy aids and much more notwithstanding their confronting circumstances darling and her gang are irrepressible in their love for and support of each other and their boisterous spirit and sense of self efficacy are extraordinary this is powerful storytelling told with a clear authorial voice which also challenges the oft patronising and insensitive attitudes of westerners such as the ngos seeking to assist african communities torn apart in post colonial africa despite a somewhat jarring and awkward transition the second half of the book reflects on the issues of displacement associated with darling's refugee experiences in destroyedmichygen detroit michigan north america darling is soon to discover that this new paradise is not quite as wonderful as it promised to be like some other reviewers i think noviolet bulowayo was less successful in this second part of the story it seemed a little confusing sometimes found myself wondering if this a narrative or social commentary at times during the second half the clarity of darling's voice went missing yet at other times it still shone through perhaps the most haunting and beautiful reflection in the whole book is the entire chapter which powerfully describes what it truly means to be a refugee ch 10 how they left i urge you to read it look at them leaving in droves the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they will never be the same again because you cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong all in all i found noviolet bulawayo's story we need new names to be highly original candid and confronting told in an evocative style bursting with humour and pride in her own identity i loved it and give it 4 5 stars","1002":" this was a remarkable and startling narrative that allowed me to understand an immigrant point of view more than any other text i've encountered in the past it is also the first african genre book that i felt was presented in ways that were fully immersive for nonnative readers the fact that this was set in the modern day while using specific details of celebrity brand and situations exemplified the emotional space and allowed me to create the scenes vividly in my mind five stars must read","1003":"guava rum punch1 5 ounces of spiced rum1 5 tablespoons of fresh lime juice4 ounces of guava nectarfresh guava and lime for garnish chill a glass in the freezer cube the fresh guava and slice a round of lime to place on a swizzle stick in the chilled glass pour rum fresh lime juice and guava nectar stir","1004":"gives voice to love and friendship found even in desolation honest insights on arriving without ever feeling arrived and escaping yet yearning to return gorgeous aching thought provoking awe inspiring","1005":"this young writer lets us in on the experience of an immigrant from poverty in africa to poverty in america it's not exactly fun to read but is enlightening and beautifully written i saw myself in some of the clueless well meaning comments made by white liberal americans ah well","1006":" this novel is more of a short story collection but i suppose the stories are coherent enough and follow a common timeline so you can call this a novel as well anyway the first half tells of life of a preteen girl in a zimbabwe shantytown the second half is about her life as a teen in detroit the first half was more interesting but the second wasn't bad either darling the protagonist is a colourful and interesting character and this was interesting compared to the slightly older african literature i've been reading ngugi wa thiong'o for example","1007":"worthy of its place on the man booker short list in my opinion a gem of a book heartfelt and raw","1008":"if this was not a book club book hence a deadline it may have taken me a long time to finish this book i found it heavy going as the subtext is so raw in the end i thought this is one of those books that will stay with me i didn't love this book but it absolutely tells a story i've not read before u0026amp the main character is do possibly someone you know","1009":"the first half of the book was not as engaging as i had expected it to be however the second half after darling left her country is definitely the best the way bulawayo describes the immigrant experience through the eyes of a young girl is anything but boring this is indeed a promising debut","1010":"a lovely book by a new writer part coming of age story and part immigrant tale told through the eyes of darling a young girl from zimbabwe","1011":"brilliant book in every way funny poignant interesting current wonderfully written i see its on the booker long list for 2013 not surprised","1012":"wow this book was something really special while it is short and uses simple language it still manages to pack a powerful punch the child's perspective is really well done and it gave an amazing sometimes heartbreaking glimpse of a child's life in a war torn country where daily living is a struggle but the children still find enjoyment and humour in their lives that is then contrasted with the experience of leaving that country and the new challenges that brings leaving friends and family behind having to adjust to a new life and culture feelings of guilt betrayal and the immigrants dilemma of lacking the necessities for survival in the adopted country i found this to be a beautiful insightful book highly recommended","1013":" as i'm attempting to make my way through the booker short list before the announcement day it was very tempting to dash straight onto the next book after finishing this one but i thought it was better to at least wait until the next morning i finished it at about 11 45 and take stock to let it sink in i didn't have very high expectations of this as the only person i know who has read it was pretty negative saying it floated between compelling prose and mundane drivel this is fairly damning so i went in expecting to wade through it as fast as possible so i could get onto the next one however i didn't feel like that at all from very early on i felt like i wanted to keep going not simply to finish it but because i wanted to know what happened i wanted to learn more it tells the story of darling born in zimbabwe who moved to america when she was about 10 11 as noviolet bulawayo and what an exciting name was born in zimbabwe and emigrated herself i wonder how much of this was autobiographical the opening chapters set in darling's hometown of paradise incongruously named as it is a shanty town are particularly vivid there were a couple of scenes that really stuck with me the images really blazed in my head a woman hanging from a tree who knew she had the sickness children attempting to get rid of chino's another child pregnancy because it would mean she'd die but having no idea how to squatting in the bushes after poaching guava from the neighbouring town of more wealthy budapest the haunting image of darling's father returning from south africa a dying man nothing but length and bones he is rough skin the title we need new names has many references within the text it is a direct quote from the time that the girls try to get rid of chino's stomach once and for all in order to be doctors sbho announces that they need new names christening themselves dr roz dr bullet patient and dr cutter but there are many things in this book that need new names there is a thread running through of the incongruity of naming the shanty town named paradise budapest in the middle of zimbabwe darling's friends bastard chipo godknows sbho forgiveness and stina and then these names that set them apart when she moves to america names are powerful in paradise they quote the names of american celebrities like gods and in america a man from zimbabwe retains his connection to his children and grandchildren whom has he never met through naming he has named all his children and grandchildren each name carefully thought out and finally given over the phone it's how i get to touch them tshaka zulu said to me one day you see every time they are called by name and they answer i am the invisible hand touching them and calling them my own in contrast america seems less concerned with names apart from in the way that they alienate people to them africa is one country they are barely interested in the separation of different places the distinctions between different peoples names are important bulawayo seems to stress this and the loss of identity comes partly from the stripping of their names darling grows farther and farther away from paradise promising to come back to visit whilst knowing that she never will the gulf has grown too wide and if she leaves she will never be able to return because she has no papers she misses her old friends but feels apart from them their lives have moved on chino's daughter is named after her but she almost forgets her existence it is touching and poignant the writing style is fairly fluid not quite stream of consciousness but there are times it feels almost like that the writing fits the age of darling and there are wonderful flowing sentences such as then we are rushing then we are running we are running and laughing and laughing and laughing which conveys the sense of movement and urgency and excitement through its fluidity and lack of punctuation it seems almost onomatopoeic the one thing i do wonder about is the lack of speech marks for dialogue i suppose it may have slowed down the narrative and seemed less true to darling's voice the story is told in first person but i'm not sure that either of these explanations are entirely true if so then it seems unnecessary to me i don't mind unconventional use of grammar as i wrote about earlier but if the reasoning doesn't seem evident to me then i often find it annoying this is somewhere in between i think that i can see the justification but i doubt its validity it certainly feels like a debut novel bulawayo has tried to include absolutely everything in it you can sense her youth her vigour her need to speak to be heard and she has tried to cram everything into one book this makes it seem a little clumsy at points but the raw enthusiasm has a certain sense of endearment to it as well it is not as polished as most literary books but it has its own charm overall the book is poignant nostalgic and ultimately sad darling loses her culture her sense of being in america and although she discovers and creates a new one the loss is raw and real i think this is a story that needs to be told i wanted more i wanted to know more about zimbabwe about the feelings of loss of not fitting in the guilt the estrangement i wanted to understand when i reached the end i could happily have gone on reading and what more can you want in a book will it win the booker i don't know yet as it's only the second i have read but i know that harvest jim crace is the favourite either way i am glad that i read this and am happy the booker brought it to me","1014":"despite some gripping scenes this book never really clicked for me the writing was good but the narration by a young child didn't work for me as darling got older i liked the book a little more especially when she described her time as a pre teen in michigan","1015":"so someone please explain this story to me in detail and the ending","1016":"recently i seem to have read a number of books narrated by children this one is as good as any the stories of childhood in zimbabwe i assume are beautiful i wanted to be part of that group of friends the transition to life in america is quite sobering and confronting there is a chapter towards the end of the book entitled how they lived which describes the life of an illegal in graphic detail it was an uncomfortable read but one i will remember for a while","1017":"the writing is amazing as we watch darling struggle with her african identity in america her insight is innocent but smack dab truth on many aspects of american culture and the sadness she feels as she loses touch with africa beautiful","1018":"i really really wanted to like this book more her writing is very beautiful however once her protagonist darling gets to america i feel the book loses it's power there is also a section with darling and her american friends that is rather graphic and i felt wasn't necessary","1019":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book wonderful metaphors and she really gets into the head of the narrator girl very interesting read","1020":" the book is narrated by a 10 year old girl darling who initially lives in a shantytown in zimbabwe the author's voice for the child provides a perspective of someone who is very young and has survived recent upheavals u0026amp changes i felt this was the strongest part of the book ~ you get a real feel for the difficulties ~ food shortages humanitarian efforts devaluation of currency razing of homes aids diamond mining voting for democratic change ~ through the resiliency and innocent eyes of a child darling u0026amp her friends have very little adult supervision and some events draw unexpected reactions from her friends which causes darling to reevaluate her own feelings the second half of the book is more disconnected when darling immigrates to the united states to live with her aunt again there is no adult supervision and darling is now a teen and still interpreting life through the eyes u0026amp reactions of her peers the situations these girls find themselves in are troublesome to say the least i wanted darling to show more depth there seemed to be a hint or promise of insight when darling was younger that is missing when she lives in michigan there is a chapter entitled how they lived that appears without context to the storyline describing the feelings of immigrants it has some amazing passages and could stand alone as an essay on what it is like to come to america the strength in the book is in the author's voice i wish there had been a more cohesive theme or an uplifting ending the ending was not what i had expected","1021":" darling and her friends are trying to cope with their changed circumstances in zimbabwe but when their parents vote for change all it does is cause one of their own to be tortured and killed darling escapes to america but discovers it is not all she wants it to be the book is a little disjointed the chapters are almost short stories and anecdotes of darling's life experiences in themselves rather than a developing narrative we don't find out what happens to darling in the end does she finish her schooling and is she successful perhaps that is the authors device to make the reader feel disjointed and unclear about darling's future","1022":" i enjoyed this book because of its roots in nonfiction and the author's own experience it was different from most books i've read i admit i haven't read much african literature aside from poetry and i appreciated the change of pace however i feel like i wanted more from the book as a whole the narrator's voice is unflinching and real and her narration alternates between heartbreaking and hilarious between naive and insightful between kind beyond her age and downright mean i tend to love narrators authors who are honest with themselves and by proxy with the reader i loved the scenes with darling and her friends stealing guavas acting out in front of the philanthropists and spying on the funeral of a victim of the political fallout because of the believable grit in darling's voice as she relayed the true to life and un embellished events that took place still the voice wasn't enough to carry the book through to become one of my favorites maybe i'm just sensitive and internally reeling from the revelation of the real world in this book where 11 year old girls get pregnant in zimbabwe and young kids watch hardcore porn in their aunt's michigan basement when no one is home that's a world i've never experienced so it's possible that it didn't resonate with me because of my lack of experience either way we need new names was appreciated by critics and consumers alike so it has to be doing something right","1023":"a novel about a young girl growing up in a shanty town in an unidentified african country in the second half of the novel she struggles to adjust to life in working class michigan i really wanted to like this but it didn't grip me i liked the writing style and i think she is clever but i didn't like any of the characters and the plot was too slow and patchy for me","1024":" in darling's zimbabwe there is no mercy no succor no food and no future when things fall apart \" bulawayo writes describing the shantytown her young narrator and mischievous friends roam freely \"the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning city ten year old darling is haunted by memories of before--before their homes were destroyed the schools closed and their families scattered seeking jobs abroad when darling finally escapes zimbabwe for the land she's dreamed about she finds suburban america's abundance hard to reach and she recons alone with the sacrifice of assimilation isolated detached a teenage darling experiences the yearning of the immigrant--at home nowhere we need new names is beautifully written vivid rhythmic fresh it is painful and honest and throughout it the voice of bulawayo's candid narrator shows a writer at the height of her craft winner of the 2014 pen hemingway award for debut fictionwinner of the 2014 los angeles times book prize for first fictionshortlisted for the 2013 man booker prizewinner of the 2013 etisalat prize for literaturefinalist for the 2013 guardian first book awardone of the new york times notable books of the year for 2013one of national public radio's great reads of 2013","1025":" this was a nice mashup of a coming of age coming to america real life in africa story it's similar to the wonderful novels by chimamanda ngozi adichie tho' the character is younger and this novel isn't quite as good still if you like adichie you'll like this i particularly liked the parts when darling is in zimbabwe disturbing as those are i also liked one stream of consciousness chapter when she was in detroit the remainder of the detroit story wasn't as good as the rest still the story is wonderful and the images are still with me highly recommended","1026":" i really liked this book up to half way the first part was really engaging and the narrative voice was compelling however the book turns into something else in its second half and it was incredibly disjointed maybe bulawayo intended for this to happen as the story shifts into being about displacement when the first half felt a lot like a satire i think bulawayo just packs too much into this short book and it doesn't really work i'm happy i've read it though and would still recommend it but i'm not sure about the second half","1027":" it's very easy to get into this novel - to see the world from the start through darling's eyes her naivety and experience leaves gaps for the reader to peer through but by seven chapters in i felt we were still moving at the same pace - little has happened or changed not for the first time i wonder if authors choose a child narrator because the inherent naivety allows them to get away with a simple book than an adult narrator would demand that said the novel becomes more interesting when darling gets to the us - her knowledge and naivety both becoming more starkly apparent but it's all pretty standard fare apart from when a couple of stand alone chapters that take on an almost poetic power - list like and omniscient - and show what bulawayo can do i can see that these couldn't make up the entirety of a novel - but they were the few points that really made me sit up and take notice","1028":"this wasn't cooked long enough it reads like a group of linked stories not a novel the writing is ok but not special i wanted more i think this is an author to watch but she needs to mature my thoughts are that she was rushed into publishing before her work was really ready pity","1029":"while the narrator provided an interesting perspective a young girl's view of her life in africa and as an immigrant in the us the story lacked a plot interesting threads started and stopped without warning i find the literary praise for this book to be surprising","1030":" we need new names is the semi autobiographical debut novel of zimbabwe immigrant noviolet bulawayo the story is narrated in the voice of darling a 10 year old girl who lives in a shantytown ironically named paradise darling and her group of five friends all 10 12 years old essentially run wild having to forage for their own food and other necessities some have parents some don't but poverty aids government corruption and the like render everyone of every age pretty helpless due to at least minimal media exposure the children toss around the names of celebrities u0026amp luxury goods with a bizarre familiarity they make up games like find bin laden chipo one of the 10 year old girls is hugely pregnant seemingly all the white people u0026amp ngo personnel whom the children encounter take their pictures and pass out trivial gifts darling's life changes when her aunt who left zimbabwe u0026amp immigrated illegally to detroit michigan comes and takes darling back to the us with her ultimately relocating to kalamazoo bulawayo writes with both humor and horror we need new names deservedly ended up on many 2013 best of lists and was short listed for the booker and many other literary prizes it's quite a read","1031":" i absolutely loved this book it was heartbreaking and beautiful and amazing there was a sweetness and a rawness about darling's story and view of the world while she was at home and then a perfect mixture of bitterness strength and perseverance once she moved to america the love of home even if home betrayed you over and over the love of a dream that does the same thing the cast of children in zimbabwe were all perfection the friends she made in america were the weakest part of the story they felt mostly irrelevant except as a slight foil but the rest of the characters more than made up for it it's a book that i am just letting linger in the back of my head","1032":" i was instructed to read this novel for my critical thinking and writing in literature class and it's only the second book that i've finished for an english class for the entirety of my educational career it's not something that i would've picked up and read on my own but i couldn't help but love the way bulawayo writes everything has this poetic feel to it the story itself can be strange at times it has a very raw feeling and talks about such a vast assortment of present day issues however sometimes i feel that the topic can get muddled a bit the reason i gave it four stars was because i personally do not like how it bounced around the big conflicts that i was waiting to be resolved had a lot of build up and the resolution to all of them was pretty much just whispered and then pushed aside not to be brought up again","1033":" very descriptive book about growing up in zimbabwe and eventually coming to live in detroit at times the story line felt slow but her voice is so strong and some of the writing is so eloquent i'd give the overall plot 3 stars just because it didn't always engage me but her writing 5 stars she has an amazing chapter talking about how it is to be a working adult without papers doing jobs that no one wants wanting to go back to your own country but you can't not relating to your kids born in the u s that chapter alone made the book worth reading","1034":" loved this book especially the first part of the story set in zimbabwe the description of the kids' play and little society of friends was wonderful and showed the kids having fun even living in a country on the brink of disaster as darling the narrator grew and moved to the us the narration developed with her age but it always seemed authentic to her age the book highlighted the difficulties of people moving between cultures especially for people who really don't have much choice in the matter there was a lot that wasn't specifically said and the author was able to convey a lot with actions and superficial talk without spelling out exactly what was going on in the characters' heads there were some dangling threads in the story what happened to the man who impregnated the young chipo what would happen to darling when the story ended did tk ever come home i would have liked a little more wrap up of these things but that is just my own curiosity they are not needed to make the book complete","1035":"i found this novel very disjointed the authors initial voice while she was growing up in her country of zimbabwe was fascinating but the book seemed to lose steam when she moved to america she tried to tackle too many subjects without really delving into any particular one","1036":" noviolet bulawayo's we need new names is a tale of the immigrant experience in a post colonial world told through the story of a young girl's journey from zimbabwe to america the first half of the novel follows ten year old darling and her friends in post colonial zimbabwe - a country stricken with hunger poverty and corruption the second half of the book covers darling's adolescence living with her aunt in america and struggling to adapt to a new culture darling's new life as an immigrant shatters her childhood dreams of america as she deals with assimilation displacement and cultural hybridity bulawayo's structuring of the novel is less of a cohesive tale and more of an episodic collection of darling's experiences the author utilizes darling's journey to provide social commentary about her homeland and the immigrant experience however the execution often feels misguided and the author's focus feels misplaced it seems as though bulawayo tries to fit darling into the social commentary instead of smoothly weaving the social commentary into a story about darling the social commentary overshadows the story itself leaving the plot and characters rather flat despite this one weakness i am moved by the novel's themes and impressed with the way bulawayo is able to touch on so many aspects of immigration and our post colonial world the author's profound representation of the harsh realities of transcontinental identity make this book a deeply meaningful and worthwhile read","1037":"one of the best books i've read all year","1038":"an honest and touching narrative from the entirely loveable perspective of darling an incredible story about a young girl's life with her friends in africa beautiful","1039":"i really loved how darling's character and voice developed throughout the novel the differences that america made on her were very interesting also however i would have liked a better transition from paradise to detroit rather than suddenly being in america at the beginning of another chapter the story was vivid and overall i loved it however i expected it to end in a different way","1040":"first book of 2013 the very fresh voice of noviolet bulawayo who captures the exuberant if harsh life of children in an african refugee camp and their subsequent experience adjusting to the 'shattered coke bottle' of america vivid graphic funny and tragic all at once loved it","1041":" the narrative is told by darling a child growing up in zimbabwe the energy and the childhood voice make darling's tales of running around with her friends vivid and captivating definitely worth a read however the desire of the author to cover every little experience and thought that darling could possibly have as a zimbabwean child and refugee made this more a disjointed collection of events than a story this is particularly noticeable once darling is older and living in america random characters and events are introduced just for a few pages so we can see them through darling's eyes before they disappear again never to be mentioned again this makes the novel feel more like it's trying to educate and inform than give an insight into a great character which was a shame if you want a thrilling story which happens to be about a refugee and spotlights the immigration system from the other side read the other hand by chris cleave if you want a close insight into a character from zimbabwe that packs a powerful punch read nervous conditions by tsitsi dangarembga this last in particular deals with the differences between the western and zimbabwean relationship with food in a way which makes bulawayo clunkily ushering in a fat bride and later an anorexic teenager for a few pages just for darling to pass judgement on seem superficial and inadequate hmmm this sounds a bit like i didn't like this book i did and the language is beautiful i particularly enjoyed the first half and the 'leaving in droves' passage around the middle","1042":" this is a moving book that portrays the complexities of immigrant life it is a series of related chronological stories that begin with the narrator's childhood in an unnamed but tumultuous african country the author is from zimbabwe but specifically avoids naming the country within the book although that life is full of undeniable hardship it becomes clear once she immigrates to america that there are many things back home that she misses and can't replace both her identity and her relationship with her own history become more complex and confusing and she illustrates that being uprooted to a new place despite the opportunities that brings for new connections sometimes means being even more isolated than ever removed from the old culture but never fully fitting into the new the story that i found to be the most moving 'the way they lived ' should be required reading for everyone given the current firestorm of conversation about immigration and immigrants in the media also her incisive observations about american culture are entertaining and thought provoking","1043":"the descriptions of darling and her gang of friends were very evocative of the ongoing turmoil in zimbabwe i thought the book lost direction once darling moved to missouri to stay with her aunt the story lost focus for me and seemed unfinished an interesting first novel i look forward to seeing the author develop her voice","1044":"i thought the first half of the book was quite lovely if somewhat sad because of the very real hardships darling's family and community faced after when the protagonist traveled to the us the novel changed dramatically one would expect the character to change once she was transplanted to another place but i felt as though the tone feel of the novel itself changed i can't really explain it other than to say that the second half of the novel was less lyrical and lovely and more common and what i would expect to find in any so so novel about american youth","1045":"interesting writing style storyline good but i found it less than engaging i read it because it was a free debbie book i'm not sorry i read it but i didn't pass it along sorry sharon didn't see you wanted to read it until after i got rid of it","1046":"i loved the character of darling and her unique view of the world preferred the parts set in zimbabwe but still engaged when she went to america","1047":"bulawayo writes a complicated novel about leaving home and growing up a stranger searching for a sense of belonging somewhere new and about being defined both by your past and your present location the story is indirect and elusive but interesting coaxing the reader to fill in blanks about feelings and setting the point out exactly how little we know even about the places we might consider our own","1048":"beautiful book beautiful story but the last 89 pages are a complete waste of time save for the chapter how they lived wanted more for the ending of the book some of the narrative falls apart once our protagonist moves to america there is a definite loss felt by the reader","1049":"i picked this up for work related reasons but it's just not for me it's ok but i just didn't want to pick it back up and there are too many other books to read so i'm stopping about 2 3rds of the way through","1050":" it took me a wee while to get into the book partly because i felt the first half was really a collection of seemingly unrelated and random anecdotes but it really picked up in the latter half especially from the moment the kids meet the guard in budapest i felt truly moved at some points by the rage loneliness and quiet despair of being uprooted disconnected there were a few passages about language and being another person entirely like her uncle with his fellow countryman who was revealing a new person as if he had been split open that resonated with me and made me deeply nostalgic and weepy for my own even if i remain here willingly it is not all bleak though the narration is humorous and feisty but i will go to bed with heavy heart tonight and le mal du pays profond","1051":" to be fair in terms of skillful evocative original writing this book deserves four or five stars it is really marvelously written and i believe that bulawayo really nailed the point s she intended to make because i know all too well that everything she portrays is true i found this book to be terribly depressing there is nothing uplifting about darling's american dream or about the paradise she escaped nor does the book end on a hopeful note bulawayo took every disheartening awful thing about living in a country like zimbabwe and how it feels to emigrate and crammed it into 290 pages if i had never read anything like it before i would have been profoundly touched","1052":" a classic immigrant tale that hooked me from page one now the book is not perfect and i found the voice of the child darling in the first part of the book incredible at one point i read in horror in the anticipation as the children were wading in truly scary moment in there life it was so well written the children's story and their voice are wonderful to read and written with great insight when we get to the next part of the book it does seem to have more ups and downs when it comes to solid story telling but oh there is one chapter how they lived it was powerful and should be required reading this book is on the man booker long list for 2013 and deserves to be if you get a chance to read this please do","1053":"a powerful and eye opening story of a childhood in mugabe's zimbabwe and the bleak lives of undocumented immigrants in the u s possibly deserves more stars than the three i gave it","1054":" on the booker shortlist and no wonder the writing is fresh funny brutally direct and at times lyrical we live with the young narrator darling in zimbabwe as she plays games and hunts for guavas amongst the violence of the slum streets and are then transported to the us to destroyedmichygen \" as darling calls it an exploration of loss and abundance of home and away the chapter describing the children's attempt to end their friend's pregnancy she is 11 is the highlight of the book a painful astonishing arresting piece of writing","1055":"while the writing was often beautiful this book fell flat in my opinion i couldn't care very much about the main character perhaps i did in the beginning but she and her story became less interesting to me as the book went along perhaps it's because i felt the author was trying to make her story too much about the recent history of zimbabwe and not enough of a novel the characters all became archetypes of the various problems that immigrants face first there was the harsh life in africa then there were the harsh realities of trying to fit in to american life and finally there came the realization that in many ways immigrants can never fit in to the new country but they can never go home either i thought the first half of the book was more compelling in the middle there was a section that was told in the first person plural like the book about japanese picture brides the buddha in the attic that approach is really unsuccessful in my opinion it removes the reader from the action and just seems preachy or false i'm sure that one is supposed to feel pity for the main character and sympathize with her and i do feel sad about all the harsh circumstances somehow other books with similar situations have managed to pull me in more than this one however","1056":"i read this coming off a high from reading adichie's 'americanah' both books explore the experience of the african immigrant to the us but adichie's approach is fantastic characters and smart pop cultural influence whereas i felt bulawayo's was just a beautiful literary exploration of the african child's experience in zimbabwe as her country is falling apart around her and then her transition and susequent displacement once she moves to the us i cringed i laughed i felt enormous sorrow for darling and her posse of friends this was such a powerful read highly recommend","1057":" while i think the novel lacked a bit of structure in some areas i can't help but love we need new names darling is a fantastic protagonist to follow and noviolet bulawayo's writing is lyrically beautiful the novel offers up a great dichotomy between the expectation vs reality of america and offers a critical insight into the immigration of people from africa into the united states that's important to read i definitely recommend for fans of americanah though the plot and characters are obviously quite different","1058":" 2 1 2 stars this book has gotten really great reviews and was just longlisted for the booker perhaps my expectations were too high but i didn't like it as much as i hoped i would it's the third book i've read in the last three months dealing with africa and the immigration experience it was definitely the one that appealed to me the least i think it's going to be difficult for me to pinpoint exactly why but here are some thoughts after reading it i would say that it's a collection of related short stories the cover says it is a novel it is very disjunct which was probably intentional one of the major themes is the disjunct fractured quality of the lives of narrator darling and her friends and family it's a clever device and she wins points from me for it but i don't usually like short stories all that much a short story that i love is an exception so the fact that this is basically short stories doesn't do much for me child narrator it can be really tough to make this work and in this case it often didn't the past two years the highest rating a book with a child narrator got from me has been 2 5 or 3 stars in this case we get view spoiler a narrator who vomits when sorting bottles because stale beer smells bad but also thought giving an 11 year old who got raped by her grandfather an abortion with a rusty coat hanger would be a great fun game eh hide spoiler the tone has been called original or fresh but it seemed familiar to me i agree that it's realistic in that the events are plausible it likely gives a creditable depiction of a zimbabwean childhood i can't say for sure since i didn't grow up there but it didn't really resonate with me it didn't seem like i was seeing anything through the eyes of a child and none of the characters were developed very well which makes caring about them difficult hostility toward those with mental illnesses i didn't feel much when reading this book besides annoyance and occasionally boredom i just didn't find the writing all that effective i actually feel kind of guilty for not liking it because i was really expecting to and was hoping it would be as great as promised","1059":" this is a first novel about a young girl who moves from the colourful but edgy shanty town life of newly independent zimbabwe to the affluent america where her aunt lives she is one of the lucky ones or is she life back home is much more vivid to her and although she assimilates well excels at school and looks set for a university education the world of big macs and computer games is ultimately deadening to her spirit i think the author has put too much into this novel thematically it is a bit top heavy and there is material for a few novels here however i loved the exuberance of the language and the close observation of the zimbabwean way of life seen through the children's eyes","1060":"loved the characters in paradise the ending was a little too abrupt for my liking i had no great take away from it except only a little sadness perhaps","1061":"this book was 'nothing to write home about' i really enjoyed 1 chapter in the whole book which is unfortunate still not sure how this made the man booker long list","1062":"noviolet bulawayo's debut novel has just been added to the long list for the 2013 booker prize a short story of hers called \"hitting budapest\" won the 2011 caine prize for african literature and became the first of several astounding chapters in ...new names the work feels brave and completely fresh raw even the perspective voice and language held me spellbound on bulawyao's website is a quote from chinua achebe \"let no one be fooled by the fact that we may write in english for we intend to do unheard of things with it \" it seems an appropriate quote for someone who has taken such liberties with language and point of view narration begins in the voice of ten year old darling whose father is away whose school is closed whose friends bastard godknows sbho stina and chipo scream sing with her as they run riot through the neighborhoods in search of guavas to steal bulawayo's darling tells us what they find besides guavas and it is her words reactions and attention that feels real and tells us what we have always wondered how does a child grow up in a world like mugabe's zimbabwe what does the world look like and from where do these children acquire knowledge of concepts like \"justice \" \"fairness \" and \"freedom\" do these concepts include any notion of personal responsibility very quickly in this novel one senses the danger in child's play the world is life threatening and the children know it their play their home life their worship it all has an edge that makes them brave and vulnerable at the same time they rely on one another the chapter \"we need new names\" was another breathtaking high wire act that left my heart in my mouth from this point i did not relax my guard with bulawayo's book in my hands it felt explosive in \"shhh \" darling hides the fact that her father has come home and is very ill when her friends find out they push their way into darling's shack immediately intuiting that darling's father is dying of aids even darling hadn't grasped that--she was angry with her father for having left and angrier still that he came home with a sickness but the children face the man lying on the bed and talk openly about death and heaven and then they begin to sing when godknows starts singing jobho sbho joins in and we listen to them sing it for a while and then we're all scratching our bodies and singing it because jobho is a song that leaves you with no choice but to scratch your body the way that sick man job did in the bible lying there scratching his itching wounds when god was busy torturing him just to play with him to see if he had faith jobho makes you call out to heaven even though you know god is occupied with better things and will not even look your way jobho makes you point your forefinger to the sky and sing at the top of your voice we itch and we scratch and we point and we itch again and we fill the shack with song then stina reaches and takes father's hand and start moving it to the song and bastard moves the other hand i reach out and touch him too because i have never really touched him ever since he came and this is what i must do now because how will it look when everybody is touching him and i am not we all look at one another and smile sing because we are touching him just touching him all over like he is a beautiful plaything we have just rescued from the trash he feels like dry wood in my hands but there is a strange light in his sunken eyes like he has swallowed the sun \"that passage ripped my heart out every once in a while darling will break into our attention with \"this is real\" or \"is this even real \" she captures that sense of incredulity we experience when life starts to feel a little ludicrous and outside our control in the last half of the novel she is a teenaged high schooler in detroit michigan destroyedmichigan her outsider status gives her the requisite distance for maximum observation but she retains her need for community she is continually questioned about and always questioning \"home \"this is an exceptional debut and noviolet bulawayo has created a fictional world that stuns as it captivates i remember thinking that bulawayo and jesmyn ward are sisters of the pen for both have the ability to flay open the skin to get to the \"real \" this is a bravura performance i do wonder however if such a performance can be replicated","1063":"for a stegner fellow at stanford i expected near perfection this africa to america story was good not great for me but the writing strong enough that i will read more of her work","1064":"original thought provoking sometimes hilarious what a great writer she is","1065":"read my review here http utahmomslife blogspot com 2013","1066":"last night at book club i mentioned wanting to re star some of my books i fear i have a history of being to generous with my stars distribution i was going to give we need new names zimbabwe four stars but then remembered that i gave little bee nigeria 5 and cutting for stone ethiopia 5 and i like names better than both these books each chapter reads like an extended poem i love darling's voice","1067":" i listened to the audio book and i have no better words than heart wrenching for this book probably that is too strong but this book awakened so many of the insecurities formed by living in a foreign land a land that can spit me out at any given time it brought back the memories of not belonging hopeless pursuit needless desperation and a deep well of loneliness america no doubt is a good place but truth be revealed not my place try as much as i can i will never be part of still the strings of one day maybe dreams of prosperity and fear of what awaits me back in kenya tug at me endlessly and keep me put here nonetheless though the book is entirely fiction it speaks straight to thousands of foreigners america the beautiful on the outside the land where all are free is truly america the ugly on the inside the land whose inhabitants are imprisoned and accept it too foreigners and originals alike are enslaved to a life of pursuit of nothingness great wealth health beauty love peace education etc which leave us in a great debt of poverty of the mind body and soul in the form of loneliness immorality bankrupcy culturelessness etc which results to addictions of the mind body and soul though we glimpse this and see it infiltrating in our systems we still remain we follow the stream and only a few of us dare to swim against the tide they dare speak against the tide and call unto those who are blind and deaf they are those who have decided to invest in their countries and wisely make use of the opportunities in america they are those who understand the meaning of serving but most of all they are those who have captured and been captured by the truth follow it committedly and understand that our strivings are for naught except that we strive with and in him who holds the truth overally bulawayo is excellent in her use of imagery to bring to life her definitions as already seen the content of her writing is relatable and educational","1068":"i loved the voice and the story each chapter was almost like a stand alone short story and many could have been placed in a different order without changing the overall vibe and cohesion of the novel i'm sad the book is over and left with an ache in my heart for what immigrants to america give up when they leave a place they love","1069":"this book was a bit hit and miss with me there were some really great parts and then some really random ones that didn't seem to be the same story it started of really well but the story seemed almost patched together for the second half overall i am glad i read this because the really great sections were worth it","1070":"and 1 2","1071":"an uneven but engrossing read i was completely drawn into the stories when she was a child in zimbabwe the end felt unresolved and sudden not sure about the metaphor to the dead dog might have been better as short stories pretty amazing to think this is a first book for someone close to my age","1072":"i can see why this was shortlisted for the booker and i can see why it didn't win it's beautiful cruel and unsentimental but with some inexplicable and major inconsistencies it may not be perfect but sections of it are downright chilling especially the chapter entitled how they lived the experience of transplantation and disorientation is so strongly evoked do read it","1073":"wnnn's writing eventually grew on me at first i found the writing style disjointed and too blunt however i ended up liking it by the end overall the story was fairly interesting even if it's been done before however i wasn't particularly invested in any of the characters the main character darling didn't seem particularly remarkable to me maybe that was the point","1074":"loved the books rawness written in the voice of an african child growing up in a small village in a war torn country suffering hunger and poverty but enjoying the simple things in life and surrounded by love the second part is a complete contrast set in america with the dangers and pressure life offers her there great book","1075":" it's really well written and gives you a harsh look at life as an immigrant it ain't pretty it really deserves more stars because it really breaks it down for you how it feels to have to leave your birth country and start a life somewhere strange but i just didn't like the ending and it left me feeling disappointed that's not the writers fault she's just telling a story and they don't always end the way we hoped i loved the beginning of the book when darling was a child still in her home country the children were so fierce and fun and the names godknows and bastard and bitchington i just loved them but then when she moved to melika it just wasn't fun anymore maybe deliberately to illustrate further how she felt either way that's why i'm only giving it 3 stars because it didn't make me feel good which probably isn't a good reason for me to give a book 4 or more it needs to enlighten me you know teach me something or make me feel good and actually this did teach me about life as an immigrant so not a pleasant thing to learn about but still lesson learnt so i am going to change my rating to 4 stars","1076":"one of those books i wanted to love upon reading the summary but failed to meet expectations i'll admit that it's challenging to write in the voice of a child very few authors do it well room for instance i thought was amazing and i feel that this is the biggest problem with this book i'm just not a fan of the author's writing style and therefore struggled through this one","1077":"the book we need new namesthe author noviolet bulawayo real name elizabeth zandile tshele zimbabwean author and stegner fellow at stanford university the subject the story of darling a young zimbabwean girl and her coming of age as she emigrates to the united states as a teenager why i chose it i admit the cover drew me in while i was browsing in the library the rating four starswhat i thought of it i've been making an effort to read fiction from different perspectives than i am used to this book certainly fit the bill a story about a girl growing up in zimbabwe though the country is never actually named who emigrates to michigan as a teenager written by a woman who grew up in zimbabwe and emigrated to michigan as a university student i'm not sure how autobiographical this story is suggesting it might be is not a strike against the book as that sort of experience is far more valuable than any amount of research in the library plus there is the fact that darling's story is set in more modern times time will tell whether this dates the book as can often be the case when contemporary pop culture references find their way into fiction anyway on to the actual story it's actually more like a series of vignettes linked together than a novel with a clear plot so if that sort of thing turns you off then i suppose this is one to avoid however i can overlook a lack of this sort of plot if i care about the characters or if they're unpleasant find them compelling enough not to chuck the book out the window which i did in we need new names the contrast between the fun and games of the children and the darkness of the wider world was put to good effect i particularly enjoyed the part where the white ngo workers come and are duly mocked their photographing of darling's pregnant friend chipo is compared to paparazzi chasing paris hilton it also explored the cultural shift darling experiences as she emigrates to the us in a very interesting way that made me want to read more i haven't read much about the immigrant experience and will definitely pick up some more books on the subject following this one i really liked this book and it was an enjoyable read even if the topics covered weren't always particularly uplifting i definitely recommend it i only wish it could have gone on a little longer and explored later parts of darling's life as it ended rather abruptly just one more thing in case you were curious about bulawayo's pen name as i was here is an explanation of it from this wall street journal article as part of her transformation to being a writer ms bulawayo decided at university she needed a new name herself adopting her pen name from elizabeth tshele violet was her mother's name she passed away when ms bulawayo was 18 months old the \"no\" in the southern african language ndebele means \"with \" so in essence the first name suggests she'll always be \"with\" her mother violet bulawayo is zimbabwe's second largest city and is where ms bulawayo spent her childhood and still calls home","1078":"great depiction of zim as it is today no romance here","1079":"forgot i read this one so powerful imagine being so poor you fill yourself with fruit you steal from rich people's trees a gang of children forced to grow up so quickly i loved this story modern day problems that should have been solved long ago","1080":"3 5 i liked the first half much better but still thought it was strong overall","1081":"i really enjoyed the honesty of this book it is told through the perspective of darling at the time she is ten years old living in africa and she and her friends have high hopes to leave africa darling wants to go to america her america the way the story is told you see the shortcomings of how we view about other countries and also how other countries perceive us too she makes it to america and stays with her aunt and uncle and it is quite original and true the dynamics that she tells of her life there","1082":"the main character darling lives in zimbabwe at the start of the book the book details the hardships of living there and the hunger and poverty she experiences yet she belongs there and has many friends and family and things that are part of her life then darling is sent to live with her aunt in america some people said in their reviews that it was like two different stories this is what i liked about the book the contrast of her african life and her american life was very moving to me it made we think of those that leave behind their families and country to have a better life darling had a bond to both places but you can see the bond to africa slipping away bit by bit it is like i wanted her to have the ease and the fitting in and the joy of her friends and family again but not the hardships and hunger","1083":" i really loved the first half of this book set in zimbabwe the country's troubles are played out through a gang of shanty town kids who have all experienced much more than children ever should teen pregnancy homes being bulldozed malnutrition absent fathers aids closed schools because the teachers have emigrated a country falling apart there is colour and humour which tempers the terrible events in the background the writing is so good that i began to wonder if this might be the book to win this year's booker but the second half of the book where the protagonist darling moves to the us badly loses its way the sense of dislocation of the immigrant is well portrayed and the america darling finds herself in is almost as much a place of nightmare albeit in different ways but the story no longer seems to hold together and what is that squashed dog ending all about","1084":"one of my favorite books super detailed super easy to follow and love how everything flows","1085":"excellent read i love how the author tells a tale of life in zimbabwe and then america through the eyes of an innocent child so much poeticism","1086":"really powerful coming of age story told from the viewpoint of a young zimbabwean girl","1087":"i loved this book it was really like nothing i have ever read fresh perspective of a zimbabwean youth through her transition to detroit and coming of age i loved her gang of friends in africa and they all have delightful names","1088":" we all have problems i get that as adults it's much easier to get caught in the trap of complaining about any given hardship that we encounter or bump in the road that we might face than it is to work towards a realistic solution to whatever the source of our current woe might be we're only human we often get stuck in endless cycles of bad behavior unable to rescue ourselves for torments that are mostly of our own creation sometimes we fail other times we succeed both the highs and the lows can be wild emotional roller coasters children are different though right they're tiny little politically aware activists for change they're miniature sized socially conscious beings with fierce agendas that they want to ram down our throats at every opportunity they exist to constantly remind us of all of the hardships endured by people the world over read more http www typographicalera com need","1089":"this is a good book and worthy of most of the praise it has been receiving the first half in harare was much more multi dimensional than the second half in kalamazoo which had a number of undeveloped scenes that seemed to not go anywhere i did feel like it was trying a bit too hard to be the great zimbabwean novel","1090":" this is another book long and then shortlisted for the man booker prize in 2013 and fits nicely in what seems to be a theme for displacement immigration and opportunity the central character darling is 10 years old for the first half of the novel 10 years old in a zimbabwe where the locals have been forced out of their land and the teachers have fled to better paying african nations the children move in packs stealing guavas to fend off hunger and not fully understanding the terrible events surrounding them the author knows though and so does the reader and this makes their lives heartbreakingly sad halfway through the novel darling moves to america destroyedmichigan to live with her aunt in the land of opportunity her aunt works 2 3 jobs so she can send money home purchasing luxuries for the family members in zimbabwe that she can't afford in her michigan apartment darling feels as underparented in a home with two parental figures as she did in her child pack in africa and the reason is the same the parents have to be away to provide a semblance of survival noviolet bulawayo captures the separate world of children well she doesn't shy away from violence and inequality although sometimes it felt thrown in for shock value she doesn't tie up the story by showing michigan as the land of opportunity because she leaves darling in a place of having to count beer bottles at the grocery store and clean homes just to raise enough money for community college she does all these things well ultra reality but because of this it was the opposite of a pleasure to read maybe i don't want so much truth in my fiction it reminded me quite a bit of say you're one of them in the approach if not the characters or story hard to read but a distinct voice","1091":"i don't really know what to say about this book i've been putting off writing my review and now i'm even more clueless it wasn't a bad book it was just a bit...meh there were good bits but as soon as something started getting interesting the story changed the time kept leaping so the story didn't seem seemless i got a fairly decent idea of what it was like for darling in her country but we didn't seem to actually see much of why it was so bad apart from being a shanty town again with the american section it felt not quite detailed enough i got a sense of what it might be like to be an immigrant maybe more so than someone who lived in a shanty town however there was just too much information too quickly we didn't see how darling settled in really or how she got on with different challenges we just knew they existed plus there were bits that seemed even just to be normal teenage issues which yes darling would have experienced but maybe we could have seen a bit of what was more unique about growing up as an immigrant in america if those 'normal' teenage sections were taken out it had a lot of potential and i really enjoyed some sections however i would have liked more detail any event or thought seemed too quick it never felt exactly complete","1092":"confirmed they need new names","1093":"i loved her imagery there were sentences in the book that stood off the page and grabbed you in some way i think she is a young author and over time i anticipate that she'll do some amazing things i got a little lost in places and the story meandered at times but the prose was really worth the price of admission","1094":"this was a fantastic book don't come looking for a plot as there isn't much of one this is about characters and relationships and they are wonderfully laid out the author has an amazing way with language and it seemed like every sentence was a new little gem of descriptive words beneath all of the gorgeous language are concepts that will make you think about yourself the u s and other countries well worth reading","1095":" in 1990 i was taking a class called the politics of southern africa and while enrolled in the course as i was learning about apartheid and its effects on the whole of southern africa nelson mandela was released from prison and the state of apartheid was dismantled it was an incredible time to study the southern region of this continent i did a semester long project on zimbabwe formerly northern and southern rhodesia and back then president robert mugabe was supposed to be a liberator here we are over two decades later and he is a dictator he is stripping the country of its diamond and gem wealth but rather than allowing the former colonists who came to know zimbabwe as their home he's invited the chinese communists mine and rape the nation's wealth this novel was sad and alarming it was the truth it was hard to put down i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys character driven novels novels based on historical events anyone with an interest in african politics or anyone who enjoys a good read this was a page turner","1096":" this is a story of a young girl from zimbabwe named darling the first part of the book is about darling's life in zimbabwe and the antics of her and her friends who hope to escape the country darling eventually does get the chance to escape to america and the second part of the book is about her time in america with her aunt's family the stories of darling and her friends as youth were entertaining probably the best part of this book was the contrast between the children wanting to escape to america and darling's actual experience in america while america was seen as a haven darling and other transplants were subject to many issues related to their time in america that made it far less of the haven that they believed that it would be there was also a lot of sacrifice in coming to america those who left might not see their family and friends again and it was evident that darling felt that type of loss moreover there were the feelings of those who were left behind which the author addressed towards the end of the book when one of darling's old friend's visits these three contrasts quite simply make the reader think a book that makes you think like that is a good book i borrowed this from the library but it is a book worth buying if you want to see how someone can process contrasts and changes like those presented in the book","1097":" reasonably good for what it's worth although compared to the other booker prize shortlisted novels this is a strange entry the culture influenced metaphors that weave the language of the book together with the author's own history make this book addictive and rich with sensual devices however darling's character does little to keep us entertained too well developed are the other african children who disappear at around the middle of the book every so often we are also given a vague chapter that is used to broaden the personal to the political but at times they are difficult to follow and we as the audience are unsure as to what they are saying if you are going to include chapters that hint at the political you need to be saying something for definite the ending i thought was reasonably effective yet i'm not sure whether we're meant to pity darling at the end or not a quick dog metaphor to seal the ending is also quickly explained could have done with being introduced previously there are also too many plot lines than what the author is capable of grappling with we learn of a man in a care home darling's cousin tk her american family african friends all are hurriedly tied together at the end of the book which is jarring for the reader overall i love the language of the book and what is suggests about the culture shock experienced by those who immigrate to america from third world countries yet at the same time what the book is trying to achieve is a little vague and as a result falls short","1098":" 3 5 while halfway through i thought that the only problem i had with this book is the lack of proper punctuation okay maybe this is to give the readers the proper atmosphere with it being narrated by a kid but it just didn't cut it for me and it wasn't necessary as i read on i realized that the story wasn't really going anywhere the story at least the first half was interesting and i enjoyed it to an extent but it lacked life it could have been better in my opinion i believe that noviolet bulawayo has a lot of potential and i look forward to reading other books she'd write","1099":" we need new names is a powerful story that beautifully conveys children's perspective on war poverty sex whites in zimbabwe whites in america american culture and loneliness it is about yearning for home yet being unable to connect with the past it begins with the 10 year old darling and her friends surviving their life in zimbabwe and concludes with her move to america though some reviewers felt the first half in zimbabwe was more powerful i was moved by the second half as darling struggles to reconcile the life in america as she dreamed of it in zimbabwe and the realities of life in america as an immigrant in a strange country a smart capable human can feel reduced to nothingness because of language \" you speak the way a drunk walks and because you are speaking like falling it's as if you are an idiot when the truth is that it's the language and the whole process that's messed up and then the problem with those who speak only english is this they don't know how to listen they are busy looking at your falling instead of paying attention to what you are saying \" darling's aunt trying to order an angel bra from a victoria secret phone rep was a humorous yet pathetically sad description of that struggle i loved the book but like americanah preparation for the afterlife what is the what the book of unknown americans and all our names i was left with reminders of our privileged arrogance our audacity to utter inane phrases like if they don't like it here louie ck's satire on the phrase i'm starving also comes to mind as darling's friend chipo says \"you think watching on bbc means you know what is going on no you don't my friend it's the wound that knows the texture of the pain\"","1100":"i really enjoyed this book and the style it was written in and certain scenes in it were gripping and took my breath away but i hated how abruptly it ended i felt like i had a lot of unanswered questions about the narrator and i wanted to see more of her life in america","1101":"beautifully performed by robin miles warning raw depictions of atrocities had to skim certain parts","1102":"insight into lives so far removed from mine","1103":"coming of age story that anyone who has had to leave the land of their birth can relate with the immaculate use of the first person voice makes the story quite real especially in the first half of the book the chaos of early 21st century zimbabwe is described through the eyes of a 10 year old expect to laugh and be shocked at the same time","1104":"oh my goodness the village meets the city a perfect little novel about a whole lot that is written between the lines at least that's how i read it i love darling she has to be one of my favourite protagonists it's strong and colourful an absolutely beautiful novel i'd like some guavas now","1105":"wanted to love this but felt strangely unmoved liked the children's games horrible games ingenious games of children lost in a world of politics run amok but the politics seemed too facile the narrator too unloving also emjoyed community descriptions the dislocations of arriving in the u s throughout it felt as if the author's critique was too pat even cheap loved her letter to readers which felt genuine i wondered if this was the award winning book that others thought undeserving","1106":"right on the heels of americanah i read this gut wrenching book about zimbabwe darling wanders around as a 10 year old with her crew of friends stealing guavas not going to school playing games and exhibiting such a relatable child ness all against the backdrop of a horrific military regime these poor kids they saw so many traumatizing things in their short lives i have to say the america parts just didn't do it for me didn't hold my interest nearly at all but there were some really beautiful passages throughout that's what dragged it down to four stars but otherwise a great read thanks cambridge public library","1107":"powerfully written and but so unsettling","1108":"i absolutely adored this book from start to finish i listened to the audiobook which was fantastic with the african accent getting stronger and weaker as appropriate for the story amazing story and amazing insight into a whole different life experience than my own","1109":"the first half of we need new names is utterly enchanting since the narrator darling a preteen zimbabwean girl who conveys both the joy of growing up surrounded by friends in a small african village and the dread of life under a human horrorshow like mugabe darling's language a patois of literal translations of her native language and third hand american popular culture is never less than a delight referring to her aunt's adopted us hometown of destroyedmichigan is particularly lovely then however life happens to darling she immigrates to america grows into a jaded teenager and starts speaking and thinking in more conventional english the lost innocence parable is appropriate but heartbreaking","1110":"noviolet bulawayo really did surprise me never did i think i could enjoy reading a book which displays a child's thoughts and yet it stroke me a child's view may be the most valuable when it comes to describing zimbabwe its true if not blut characters can be shocking but having read several african novels before i was able to simply sit back enjoy and set my smile a must read for everyone who's fond of the african way","1111":"i felt so ambivalent about this collection of stories as i was reading it loved it hated it wondered if it was too sensationalized got impatient for the parts in the us then missed the parts set in zimbabwe it was a harsh mix of third world reality and a harsh commentary on spoiled americans i'm glad i read it and felt the young voice was a perfect vehicle for reporting travesties in both cultures bulawayo also showed never told the loneliness of american suburbia the isolation of the nuclear family contrasted with the accepting community she had back in her impoverished village my reaction to this collection was really all over the place making it difficult to review or embrace now that some time has passed since reading it i think i felt horror over darling's childhood anyone would but somehow never connected with darling herself","1112":" we need new names a novel by noviolet bulawayo plays with names from paradise to destroyedmichygen from 10 year old darling's games with her friends bastard chipo godknows sbho and stina to her life with aunt fostalina in america remembering having lived in real houses having had fathers living with them having gone to school in the past the children growing up in the tin shacks of paradise band together to play and tease and steal guavas to eat in the intense and immediate uncertainty of now they fill their long days with games of their own making and darling is a fortunate child because she has a future in america where she like her aunt from zimbabwe and her uncle from ghana and nearly everyone they know will have no papers and so they can never go home because if they did they could never come back","1113":"this book was amazingly great at the beginning the narrator voice works so well in the story when it's in africa but once she gets to america and is lonely it's so depressing and the pace changes and i couldn't feel excited about reading it anymore","1114":" occasionally i come across a book that is difficult for me to say much about i finish the book put it aside scratch my head as i try to piece together what it is exactly i feel about what i just read obviously i didn't love it but i also didn't hate it it just didn't resonate with me and i can't say why we need new names was one of those novels for me the pieces fit for what could've potentially been a great book but it didn't gel with me bulawayo writes some fantastic prose she is certainly a talented writer and i expect her to continue garnering attention for her work in the future i think she has some wonderful stories to tell as well i think the problem for me with we need new names was that i never completely connected with the story or the characters this may in part be the structure--the \"novel\" is akin to a collection of connected short stories it may also be that the novel is essentially two parts--darling in africa darling in america--and though the two do connect logically stylistically they are world's apart add to this that i never really connected with darling though i most felt close to her during her moment's of alienation in america so maybe i do know how i felt about the novel at least in part maybe i needed to sit down contemplate the novel and write down my thoughts to make clear my feelings--for my reader as much as myself--we need new names shows considerable talent but the urgency of the work felt buried underneath too many threads that's why it didn't work for me other readers may be able to sort through those threads make something beautiful out of them me the non crafty one i ended up with a beautiful mess of string my bad","1115":"really touching book i enjoyed different style of writing the part where bulawayo described missionaires at their work was perhaps my favorite one towards the end i wondered if it was too much for her to care as there was nothing she could really do in order to help the others","1116":" totally entertaining bulawayo tells the narrative through darling a likeable narrator and observer the idea of using a child as first person narrator can sometimes be twee and naff but bulawayo finds the right tone which totally gets you in this book balances a child like view of the world with some really terrible realities perhaps not the most revealing book and peters out more than ends it definitely showcases bulawayo as a writer to watch some of the passages written outside of darling written as a collective voice of the zimbabwean people are some of the best parts of the novel","1117":"i gobbled down the first half of this book in one greedy sitting and loved loved loved it but having reached such heady heights the second half fell flat on its face which was such a disappointment to me what started out as something light and fresh and exciting and heartbreaking turned into a moany whiny teenager i've had the good fortune to visit zimbabwe a few times and my brother even lived there for a while i thought so much in the beginning about buying this book for him but given the second half i'm not going to even bother the book literally lost the plot and meandered off into nothingness i though the porno and snuff movie part was totally unnecessary i still think the first half is worth reading","1118":"currently reading the man booker shortlist and this debut novel by noviolet bulawayo had me hooked from start to finish the narrative voice gives perspective from a child to the harsh realities of life in zimbabwe under the mugabe regime later in the novel life in america is not the dream that darling is hoping it will be","1119":"bulawayo's writing feels childlike and honest in its simple treatment of difficult experiences","1120":" this book was chosen as 'book of the year here in san jose california the story is told through the eyes of a 10 year old girl named'darling' who first grew up in zimbabwe the first half of the book she lives in the slum called paradise darling and her friends play in the streets steal guavas look for other food living with extreme poverty and daily life difficulties darling seems to accept her life her friends community are still her home it's what she knows during the second half of the book when darling immigrates to america we begin to see some benefits yet we also see what she has lost the language perhaps translated was a little difficult mostly i could figure out what was being said but i felt like i may have missed a little of the translation from some of the african words from how some of the african words were used as verbs and nouns i appreciated this book once again we witness the culture shock the challenges of adjusting and all aspects of daily living yet i felt the storytelling itself or maybe it was the structure in writing was at times emotionally flat in the writing delivery not in actual situation this is a small fast read i liked it but didn't love it yet i admire the authors passion to this subject she will be one of the authors present at the bay area 2 day festival in berkeley the first weekend in june","1121":"actual rating 4 5totally engaging the whole way through moving without being too depressing humourous but also poignant i want darling to narrate every book i read from now on","1122":" what i liked about this book 1 how the voice ages from a 10 year old darling living in zimbabwe to a 14 year old darling living in michigan the vocabulary complex thoughts etc grow as the narrator ages but underneath her more refined way of talking it's still clear that this is the same person i really loved that 2 there was one chapter in particular that described how it feels to be an immigrant in america in the 21st century though it noted differences between those immigrating from africa or asia or mexico or south america it also spoke with a collective we that was my favorite chapter it just felt so powerful 3 each chapter both relates chronologically thematically to the previous chapter and stands alone as its own anecdote the writing style was refreshing and beautiful and heartfelt so why did i give it only 4 stars i can't really explain my decision it's just a feeling i did enjoy it some scenes definitely stuck with me and it's probably worth another read but how long will it stick around and would i get anything new from reading it a second time or would i just be reminded of my first impressions i don't know maybe it's just too far from the kinds of books i normally read maybe it just made me too uncomfortable as a white middle class lifelong michigander in reading this book i thought of my cousin who worked with the peace corps in burkina faso for 4 5 years and i thought of a classmate in one of my women's studies classes who was obviously from africa what she looked like how she talked in class what she posted about on her facebook page and then i marveled at how contradictory such associations are of course it's understandable and probably unavoidable that i would think of what little connections i might have to the experiences of the narrator of this story but at the same time it's incredibly naive and arrogant for me to assume all african countries are comparable that burkina faso would be at all like zimbabwe that i could begin to understand anything darling or author noviolet bulawayo went through maybe that's what i didn't like about this book that it would entice me with descriptions of exotic lands and exotic people and then make me feel guilty for finding them exotic that it would try to relate to me with a child's words and stories and then make me feel guilty for accepting its offering that it would dare cause me a bit of confusion and cognitive dissonance but all that is definitely more a problem with me than the book","1123":"this novel about a girl growing up in zimbabwe and emigrating to the us had been shortlisted for several prizes and has garnered excellent reviews i get why but i don't 100% agree with those accolades the author does a nice job showing life through the eyes of a pre adolescent and through the eyes of an immigrant to the us but all novels are stories and this one is disjointed at the risk of providing a spoiler though there is little suspense in this book i really missed the description of darling's flight to the us and where the author so handily invokes that voice of 11 year old darling the character seems never to grow up we see glimpses of maturation perhaps but never a fully formed darling i think that is what disappointed me most that said there is a chapter that describes the plight of the undocumented immigrants in the us that is outstanding and should be required reading for all those who think undocumented immigrants are living the good life","1124":"this book is simple funny and brilliant the author makes me believe that she is the girl who narrates the story you should laugh out loud a few times if you know where she's coming from an example when the mikoro lady is silenced i bring my head to my armpit and giggle because she was making like god told her she is celine dion p 38","1125":"the voice of the child main character darling drew me in right away with her naive but astute narrative bulawayo makes it engaging from the book's beginning in zimbabwe to its later setting in detroit she doesn't waste words doing remedial explanations about african politics but there's a lot for an astute reader to learn","1126":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here overall it was definitely an enjoyable read i loved the strong voice of the narrative and the creative use of language to describe difficult concepts simply through the eyes of a child it provides another great perspective of the immigrant experience in america the strongest parts of the book are set in zimbabwe and the narrative is more disjointed and loses speed in the second half after the migration the second half of the book does a great job of exploring more ideas of the alienation and overall it was definitely an enjoyable read i loved the strong voice of the narrative and the creative use of language to describe difficult concepts simply through the eyes of a child it provides another great perspective of the immigrant experience in america the strongest parts of the book are set in zimbabwe and the narrative is more disjointed and loses speed in the second half after the migration the second half of the book does a great job of exploring more ideas of the alienation and formation of identity i did feel like the chapters with just clear exposition of the author's views on migration the ones written in the we voice were leaden and unnecessary more","1127":"set in detroit and south africa a story of life immigrants and expectations requiring new names very insightful","1128":"the novel tracks the coming of age of darling a native zimbabwean who travels to the u s to live with her aunt fostalina in her early teenage years the new york times review identifies darling's time in zimbabwe as \"a study in contrasts\" and highlights it as the strong point of the story the first half of the novel is indeed alive with an energy that is not captured in the second half of the novel partly because of the cultural aspects and partly because i'm sure it was bulawayo's intention to show darling's shift into adulthood u s culture and cynicism

found it difficult to finish out the story was repetitive and somewhat disjointed overall disappointing spend your money on something else","1130":"i kept waiting for something big to happen a cliffhanger or game changer to no avail this book was sad and unfortunate while the characters were interesting the story was predictable and uninteresting which is too bad because i think the idea had great potential","1131":"audio version very well done","1132":"it was ok there were parts that were very good but as a whole it was very disjointed tangential and felt incomplete parts of it really plodded along and there were many story lines that were left hanging without any hint at resolution or connection with other story lines it just seemed like a random collection of short stories many of which didn't seem to have much of a point and were not woven into a cohesive book","1133":"depiction of a young girl's life in zimbabwe and her transition to the u s i need to review the

cracking up every other page it felt like characterization is perfectly elegant it's like i've actually met godknows and stina and bastard and chipo and sbho now aunt fostalina uncle kojo fat boy tk i have such a clear picture of them in my mind they must be real bulawayo's sentences are poetry that plus the fact that you can 'hear' darling the main character 's point of view maturing through the years pages makes this one of the best coming of age stories i've read in a long while right up there with judy blume's are you there god it's me margaret 3 5 stars from me","1135":"if i were a professional critic and i was denied an interview by the author during an event and hence nursing a grudge it would be easy to be mean to this book it pools together every cliche stereotype and anecdote from both africa and america hunger abortions bedraggled children civil strife missionaries yellow rubber ducks saggy pants and general immigrant plightiness you'd think the author wrote it after bingeing on mtv youtube and the daikymail and strings them together with an overwhelming plethora of similes and metaphors perhaps to achieve that infantile voice of a young person pov a voice that fails to grow up as would be expected in the second half of the book as knowledge and experience of our protagonist grows add to that a decent peppering of not so significant cultural references rihanna kardarshians and all the nice shiny things of america we see in movies that makes you fear for the books relevance ten years from now and you question the booker nod but i'm not that guy and perhaps it was that kind of story while the similes were overwhelming to the point of being purple more often than not the author managed to nail most of them resulting in a read made up of beautifully crafted sentences and imagery that painted brilliant pictures like they say don't critic the book you didn't get but i just feel like if the voice had grown up in the second half of the book and the author had channeled that gift for beautiful sentences and metaphors through a more sophisticated pov it would have made for a more balanced read instead of the jarringly simplistic delivery of rather complex thought processes of a more experienced protagonist in the second half of the book all in all i really did enjoy this book if only for the screams in my head after every brilliant sentence","1136":"stunning and poetic","1137":"i'll be honest i got really bored with this so much so that i even considered putting it down and that's just like a sin to me the story didn't do anything for me and however accurate that type of english might be in africa i got really frustrated with it the blurb was quite misleading and i feel like the only reason it is longlisted for the man booker is that it's a story of white people induced poverty stricken africans written by an african woman there was very little in it to redeem it in my eyes","1138":"i liked the first half of the book a great deal the second half not so much the whole story was depressing the difference between the halves was that in the first half i was hopeful of a better outcome for her life in the second half i realised her life was always going to be pointless and unfulfilled and that ultimately she didn't fit anywhere this book did make me re think the experience of young immigrants","1139":" 4 75this was the first time i read something about the african culture and i really enjoyed it however i did find the first half of the book to be more interesting and promising the second half just dwindled and apart from some chapters that described the struggles of abandoning the land and how it was being an african in america it was a bit unnecessary and brought the book down for me but if you really think about it those scenes could've been there to highlight the struggles and attempts to blend in without new names apart from that i really loved the themes of culture sexism poverty price of freedom cultural dislocation and the sense of belonging to your land so many important issues like media coverage in africa and corrupt rulers were raised the way in which those themes were portrayed in simple beautiful similes ended up creating a very powerful book","1140":"so so so good so good that i missed my metro stop but i didn't even care i just kept reading","1141":" 4 5 starsthis is a creative painful sometimes funny and artistic novel i appreciate the narrator and how the novel seems to come directly from within the character's mind and experience other reviewers have criticized the novel for taking on too many issues but i disagree instead i think the novel accomplishes the issues because they each feel so much to come from the narrator's life she is young playful naive and at the whim of the politics poverty popular culture and suffering all around her it's more accurate to say that life happens to darling instead of darling lives her life she has a little more sense of herself at the end but it comes out more as more conscious awareness of pain and loss never artificial or feeling like the story has an agenda the other reason all the issues didn't bother me is because at its core this book is about language the language of zimbabwe of children and adults names and the significance of a name something given but also owned like when chipo names her daughter after darling which is somehow a death of zimbabwe darling now that she is in america language signifies a person as native or not it makes a person powerful and also makes them powerless there are so many scenes to make a reader think about how people speak to each other and what language means i value these scenes i also appreciate how the writer approached some of the violence and troubling events in this novel she takes us right up to the horror and then backs off or lets us imagine the rest there are disturbing parts but it's clear to me that there's pain in writing them and so she makes wise decisions with how to present them in the work this narrator is crafted with intensity love and courage","1142":" the novel we need new names at times reads like two books in one but yet the two parts flow seamlessly we begin in a zimbabwe even though the country is never mentioned in a tin shack shantytown created after the post independence euphoria had gradually soured but bulawayo does not waste her writing on obvious anti government passages instead we are introduced to things through the eyes of darling as she plays with her amazingly named friends godknows stina bastard and the pregnant chipo they play games of find bin laden and steal guavas causing hours of painful constipation from the bungalows of the rich the careless hours of play are punctuated by gut wrenching scenes of the reality around the kids the death of an aids ravaged parent an attempted abortion mobs murders and refugees but somehow in darling's narration none of this is presented in a poor us pity me voice as she says about living near a cemetery there is just no sense being afraid when you live so near the graves it would be like the tongue fearing the teeth the second part of the book explores the complex relationship immigrants from africa have with the united states and their home countries some lovely observations about language and parenting are paired with the harsh realities of the lives of the illegal immigrant","1143":"like everyone else i heard all the buzz about this book and was excited to read it sadly i think the hype wasn't that well deserved i know the author grew up in the region she writes about but the narrator's voice felt inauthentic to me and i didn't find darling likable or engaging in any way t found the writing style very difficult to get the rhythm of i never really did and the characters were not sympathetic to me at all","1144":"i will not forget this book","1145":" interconnected tales seems to be the trending form for a novel these days sherwood anderson's winesburg ohio is an example perhaps one of the best a novel comprised of a series of short stories linked by a main character or place bulawayo's writing is vivid and evocative normally i don't like books narrated by innocents ie usually children as in this case but darling's perspective is so new and her observations original that i found i enjoyed her immensely an extremely interesting observation both pre and post immigration of an african girl's experience of moving to u0026amp living in the usa","1146":"very good in parts but to me it was disjointed and didn't really pull together","1147":"as an ex rhodesian this book pressed buttons a vivid story of exile and identity not a comfortable read","1148":"the first few chapters seemed a little uninspired and dogmatic to me but i'm glad i kept reading bulawayo has a real gift i've read a lot of african diaspora lit and this is definitely at the top of the list her matter of fact portrait of the unique plight of first generation africans in the u s caught between different worlds crushing expectations from back home and stereotypes and violence in their adopted country is brilliant i'm not crying you're crying p","1149":"probably more a good 3 5 but a compelling debut","1150":"though there were slightly uneven moments in the second half i was absolutely astonished and caught off guard by this debut books written from the perspective of children can be horrid but this is one of those that channels that unique outlook on the world to yield humour insight and bleakness in equal turn revealed a lot about the impact of mugabe's policies on average zimbabweans though never read as a history lesson clearly bulawayo is drawing heavily on her own experiences growing up in zimbabwe and later moving to america i honestly am not one to retain plots but i doubt i'll be forgetting bulawayo's darling and her playmates anytime soon she's given me many laughs and much to think on","1151":"a book to teach","1152":"the first part of the book was very well done but the second part absolutely fell apart and felt disorganized cliche and not as well told","1153":"3 5 stars full review to come","1154":" the library wants their digital copy returned but i'm reluctant to part with this book it hooked me from the start and the pull hasn't lessened i've reread the ending and the how they lived chapter twice the jacket blurbs don't lie this slim volume earns all its plaudits i'd recommend reading it in tandem with americanah because like that book we need new names makes you reexamine preconceived notions about african immigrants in the us and attitudes towards expats in african nations however i think this tale is the stronger of the two books here we meet darling who moves from childhood in zimbabwe to adolescence in detroit but she doesn't start a famous blog her struggle continues without an outlet noviolet bulawayo's voice is striking and original i need bulawayo to follow up this debut soon","1155":"listened to on audio reader was really good","1156":"a 21st century how the other half lives it was uncomfortable but i'm glad i read it the kids were raising themselves even though they had parents and guardians","1157":"enjoyed this greatly i liked the realness of it and it was great to get a glimpse inside of someone else's head","1158":"this was a fast paced novel written with a style that is energetic and surprising however i believe that there was a compulsion to include every terrible issue that africa is facing and cram it into the first half of the book the chapter how they left about refugees leaving their home country was beautiful and moving it was worth reading this book just for that passage of writing","1159":"this felt like a novel without clear direction the author's best chapter was near the end when exploring what it felt like to be displaced from a homeland and trying to assimilate into a new culture while still aching for home","1160":"excellent i loved this book bulawayo tells the story through the voice of a young girl first in zimbabwe and then in the u s we see her change as she becomes accustomed to america and we see american customs through her eyes","1161":" the zimbabwean section of the book was pretty much magic but the american section less so the chapter 'how they lived' was perhaps most resonant and from a strong and multifaceted point of view re undocumented migrants working class migrants and migrants in poverty in the u s but it felt too much out of place i guess that bulawayo tried to reflect some of the disintegration and dislocation of the migration experience through the structure of the american section however this section's descent into a sort of anti narrative rendered it quite superficial which personally i found strange after a really strong and full opening","1162":"i really tried to like this book but couldn't get into the rhythm and the plot was very choppy to me","1163":"in the beginning i had to get the names in order - darling and her friends stina chipo bastard and godknows it was the names which made me think i just may not want to finish this book but as i read on with the story found myself enjoying how these children in the midst of poverty of housing food and education found positive things in getting fruit from the tree and their interaction was not to damage but just get enough to eat even when one of them said when they get order they will go inside the houses which have those trees but was quickly disagreed it shows how they have no power but they have a group to togetherness which gives them some power even in their living condition darling the young girl was waiting for her relative in detroit get money together so that she can come to detroit where she would have the dream of many immigrants coming not just to our country but anywhere they land and have to totally adjust to the environment while grieving your friends and family back home there is food to eat along and her speech which mirrors the people around here - the use of slang the favorite fast food places how the young people disrespect their parents and how the one's back home thinks because she is in america there is money you can send back home my final thoughts are yes you left a place where there wasn't enough food and housing etc and come to a place where much of family seem to disappear","1164":"for about the first third of this book i wasn't sure if i'd be able to continue the narrative style is very stylized which is something i often can't deal with very well but the story is compelling and simple so i carried on also there isn't a lot of exposition which is refreshing and i found that i had to keep reading just to see if i could figure out what was going on which sounds bad but it really isn't the first section takes place in africa and describes the everyday movements of a group of children living in zimbabwe while the conditions are dire it is clear that these are children and children are children no matter what their circumstances they will find ways to have fun and amuse themselves they are matter of fact about their lives even while the outside observer is shocked and sometimes horrified i found myself wondering whether children in africa or at least zimbabwe are actually given names such as darling and godknows and chibo or if that is an artifice constructed by the author to illustrate the profound differentness between that world and this one the author's own name noviolet implies that it is a truth but i still don't know it would be easy enough to find out i suppose but i don't really want to know as a conceit it works and i see no reason to mess with it the second half takes darling to america where she is thrown headlong into american culture in detroit of all places into a community that is populated both with immigrants from her own country and other countries in africa and with american teenage girls who could not be more different or similar to her she describes a variety of situations some which she seems to deal with circumspectly others which leave her baffled all the time she feels an undercurrent of yearning of guilt and a sense of responsibility to her friends and family back home yet always the knowledge that due to the vagaries of the immigration system or how it is perceived by these newcomers she may never go home lest she be denied re entry and as much as she is a fish out of water the water in america is much sweeter than that in africa and the struggles are worth the sacrifice the language and story ultimately drew me in and the abrupt ending made me want to know more about darling and how her life turns out","1165":"fantastic novel about an african girl that travels to america to find a new life she describes with candor how the new big and opulent country is so different from what she is so used to and how the life in it slowly absorbs her until there is almost nothing of her old self left this writer's style is fantastic and i think she is going to write very good novels in the future i am willing to read them all i hope she wins that man bookers prize on oct 15 we'll see","1166":" early into this book i stopped reading it to find out more about zimbabwe although bulawayo drops cultural references into the first half that identify the time frame i found i wanted more information about what had happened in that country the first half of the book is about darling a girl in zimbabwe and her group of friends they entertain themselves with stealing guavas and playing simple games when her country is throw into chaos darling is given a chance to live with relatives in america the contrast between darling's life in africa and in america is startling in america she and her new friends amuse themselves by looking at porn on the internet and wandering through the mall trying on clothes the book is a good picture of the contrast between emerging africa and america poverty and abundance and a stark contrast of cultures","1167":"this is an amazing first book and the language is beyond beautiful i feel like she capture the spirit of growing up in a transition between countries perfectly and i loved it","1168":"there were moments of genius in this book but at other times it was tedious at about the halfway stage there is an amazing passage about life in the us which was beautifully heart rending and then it went back to being mundane right at the point where i had become hooked","1169":"the strongest chapters in this novel about a girl's life in zimbabwe and later in michigan remind me of the best of junot diaz or sandra cisneros","1170":"the story of so many people beautifully told","1171":"although we need new names is a small book there were so many themes explored that it virtually made my head spin quite frankly it was a bit too much for me i wanted to settle down and get a good sense of zimbabwe but the narrative was so jolting from one heartache the characters experienced to another that it was just not possible despite this there were many good things about this book noviolet bulawayo shins in so many of her depictions of her protagonist darling that i couldn't help but feel in many aspects it was based on her own experiences her insights into darling's immigrant experience and more importantly how american's view africa were very insightful and thought provoking really made me stop and think how ignorant americans are","1172":"underwhelming though prize winning novel about africa america u0026amp immigration click here to read my full review on my book blog","1173":"this book gives insight into how children cope with the civil disruption on africa and how the adjust to a new way of life in america powerful insightful not an easy read","1174":"darling is ten a child of zimbabwe she and her friends play in the streets steal guavas imitate their elders as best they can they are children though still piecing together their understanding of the world stina said a country is a coca cola bottle that can smash on the floor and disappoint you when a bottle smashes you cannot put it back together 162 zimbabwe is not an easy place for any of them to live there are those who are far better off but they are mostly white people living in gated communities to darling america--where her aunt now lives--is the epitome of luxury and want not she knows that when she goes to america her life will get infinitely easier in america roads are like the devil's hands like god's love reaching all over just the sad thing is they won't really take me home 193 it does get easier and it doesn't in america darling never wants for food she can go to school eventually she knows she will be able to go to college but it is lonely without her mother and her friends michigan is cold and grey much of the year and as it turns out you can't go home again especially when your visa has expired and you are not in the country legally this book was one that worked for me for the same reasons that it didn't and so my initially enthusiastic response grew more guarded as i read the story is linear in that it takes darling from childhood on up through her teenage years but darling is in a way the only constant unlike most novels although quite like real life many things happen that could be the start of something big but aren't darling's eleven year old friend chipo is pregnant and the girls try to 'get rid of her stomach' the kids find a hanged woman ngo workers come and go darling and co wander around a chinese construction site and the ransacked house of a white couple in america aunt fostalina tries to show up a bride at a wedding darling and her new friends go for a joyride relatives call and call and call always with requests any of these could be the catalyst for conflict for a sustained narrative arc they aren't though we learn more about some of those things as the book progresses but not in a dramatic way--it's just how it is to me it is a strength and a weakness of the book on the one hand i love that it's not so much about events and dramatic things as it is about broader themes like fitting in and where 'home' is on the other hand the book didn't really go anywhere or not in the traditional sense anyway still it's an interesting look at a time and place and at an immigrant experience of a child--an experience that does not match the american dream look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth lest they be mistaken for those who want to claim the land as theirs look at them leaving in droves arm in arm with loss and lost look at them leaving in droves 148","1175":"well crafted but at times hard to read in part because of the heartbreaking content and in part because it felt a bit meandering without a real goal or ending but i loved the description and the dialogue between the kids when darling is still in zimbabwe everything felt so raw and real","1176":"an interesting look at growing up in zimbabwe and immigrating to the u s the observations the character makes about the u s are spot on and enlightening it's okay to laugh at how ridiculous american culture is it's a challenging read but i would recommend it","1177":"can't decide between two and three stars for the most part i was kind of like where's the story but i think maybe that was me failing to appreciate the subtleties of the emotional journey rather than the book it's self being crap in hindsight it probably was quite interesting really ok fine it can have three stars","1178":"if you have ever had a negative thought about immigrants in north america this book would help you understand their difficulties the author also has great talent for writing from different age perspectives","1179":" i really liked this book from a young author i hadn't ever heard of before until the novel was shortlisted for this year's 2013 man booker prize bulawayo has a powerful writing which catches your attention and you can't leave the book until the end and it's a book that doesn't seem to have a clear story indeed even though there is a succession of facts it is not a linear telling of events it's more like a painter with a brush putting some colour here then some colour there and eventually you have a painting which makes sense from a village in a country with no name which we know is noviolet's own country to kalamazoo usa from children playing and stealing guavas for lack of other things to do like attending school to the promised land of the usa we see the same girl darling losing her hopes and her world into a complex reality noviolet plays with names for instance when choosing the title of the book or calling the derelict village paradise or giving names to the children like bastard or bornfree or having darling travel to destroyedmichygen it is particularly interesting how bulawayo converts a hope for a better life into a mousetrap where people are paralysed between those who think they are in the country of plenty and the reality of hard life without papers this book is a shout into each reader's conscience written with a lively style in first person as spoken by a young girl lovely","1180":" i remember being really disappointed by the white tiger which won the booker a few years ago because it spent more time making its point than telling a story i learnt a lot about class and identity in india but i found it hard to get through as the writing was patchy and the main character was basically a huge jerk i was worried this book might be the same but i shouldn't have been it's the most moving book i've ever read on living cross culturally and it's beautifully written i get comments from others that it felt piecy or didn't read like a novel the first half reads like a story but the second is more like vignettes i felt that worked well due to the whole my home is where i feel real factor the second half took on a dreamy quality sometimes that made sense to me it also allowed characters to feel confused or detail hard things without being whiny i was surprised to hear that the author is working on an autobiographical project this one felt so true to life i assumed it was based on some of her own experience look forward to reading it","1181":"i loved this book at some point i kept asking myself where is the story in this book but the flow of events was well planned i liked how each chapter was a full story by itself i was shocked at how it ended did not expect it at all best of all it was hilarious with amazing expressions that i will start using myself","1182":"interesting and insightful reflection on immigration conveyed in a subtle authentic way that's personal and poignant really great bit disappointed with ending though","1183":"a really great first novel of violence and brutality seen through the eyes of a child i couldn't put it down","1184":"i nearly ditched this book before the halfway mark but i kept on going as i wanted to read about her us experiences i enjoyed some of the prose some absolutely beautiful imagery and description but the book overall did not appeal the passages about homesickness and not really belonging in either culture were very emotive and well written","1185":"this book really makes me think it's like reading a diary and it gave me some really interesting insights on what it would mean to immigrate to this country the characters are intriguing sad funny and compelling","1186":"i read this book soon after returning to the states after spending five months in zimbabwe the book really conveyed the essence of zimbabwe following the political history the aids epidemic and the resilience of the people through the eyes of children i very much enjoyed reminiscing about my travels through this book","1187":"i loved this book somehow i've read a lot of books about the white experience in zimbabwe and it was really interesting to read about the flip side i especially enjoyed darling's take on american culture as a teenage immigrant the tone and prose is reminiscent of a junot diaz novel","1188":"read my thoughts on noviolet bulawayo's great book we need new names at mylittleheartmelodies com","1189":" this is one of those novels that's either going to hit you right or not and boy did it ever hit me right the first compliment i'll give it is that it's easily my favorite piece of african fiction and certainly much more successful and powerful than an overly praised novel about some nigerian anglers that came out last year but i digress i want to go bigger though if bulawayo builds on the promise of this deeply affecting debut novel she might just become one of my favorite writers period the unnamed country here is zimbabwe fairly close to the present day in the advanced stages of sociopolitical meltdown under mugabe's ham handed iron fisted rule darling is a ten year old girl living in a shantytown called note the irony paradise after its residents were brutally displaced from their middle class neighborhood darling and her group of friends with glorious sounding names such as godknows bastard sbho and chipo have no school to go to anymore and are almost always unsupervised and hungry they roam through nearby affluent neighborhoods looking to steal guavas off trees they play games that quickly turn dark in ways that for me evoked lord of the flies they witness too many disturbing scenes of societal breakdown and ethnic tension one of the ten year olds is pregnant and if that's not discomfiting enough for ya wait until you find out who the father is it's a harsh reality one that bulawayo renders with some of the strongest most potent writing i've read that she's managed to write so beautifully about such starkness without mismatching tone and topic is one of the things that blew me away about this book then at around the halfway point darling gets sent to america destroyedmichygen to live with her aunt fostalina the latter half chronicles her living out her teenage years as an immigrant there while the american half is perhaps not quite as engaging as the zimbabwean half of the tale i did find that bulawayo was equally insightful at capturing this experience too the plot follows at least the broad outlines of noviolet bulawayo's life some readers complain about the episodic anecdotal loose structure of the novel not me it's perfect for representing a young woman's window on one world coming apart and her putting herself back together in a new one we need new names can be seen as a raucous meditation on how home or its absence shapes lives i'll end my review with this quote a way into the heart of the novel there are three homes inside mother's and aunt fostalina's heads home before independence before i was born when black people and white people were fighting over the country home after independence when black people won the country and then the home of things falling apart which made aunt fostalina leave and come here home one home two and home three there are four homes inside mother of bones' head home before the white people came to steal the country and a king ruled home when the white people came to steal the country and then there was war home when black people got our stolen country back after independence and then the home of now home one home two home three home four when somebody talks about home you have to listen carefully so you know exactly which one the person is referring to","1190":"a poignant and powerful story of darling a child who moves from a zimbabwe shanty to america noviolet bulawayo's writing is on parr with maya angelou emotional and enlightening","1191":"this book clearly paints a picture of the challenges hope and dreams of rural africans turn migrants the theme centres on life and it's harsh realities everybody should read this","1192":" wow what a unique voice ms bulawayo has i've never read a novelty quite like this at first i was totally put off and wondered if i could get through this book with the narrator being darling a ten year old girl living in a shanty town in zimbabwe darling and her friends all used to have real houses but their houses were all razed their school gone and now they all live in a shanty town called paradise they spend their days stealing guavas playing games and dreaming of escaping to other countries like america dubai or europe darling is consisted one of the lucky ones when she does get a chance to escape but does her new home in detroit michigan bring her all the happiness she used to dream of the issues the author brings to light first a child living in a country that is falling apart around her then as an immigrant without the proper papers in a foreign country are so powerfully worded they almost demand the reader to sit up straight and pay attention","1193":"i enjoyed this book short glimpses into darling's life as she grows from a child in war ravaged zimbabwe to becoming an american teen pivotal snapshots from stealing guavas and witnessing horrible violence to shopping at the mall with her middle school friends in a stolen car watching porn on tv after school and texting at times some of the descriptions made me cringe in their awful clarity of what was to come see chapter entitled we need new names and often i laughed out loud","1194":"though my own personal experiences are different i can still strongly relate to this story on many different levels i absolutely loved this book also loved the reference to chinua achebe's things fall apart numerous times","1195":"i gave the first part of the book a 5 out of 5 and the second part a 3 out of 5 i loved the first part of names and liked the second half noviolet has a gift and i cant wait to see what she will bring to her future books","1196":"maybe 4 1 2 stars is more like it this author is brilliant it took me a long time to get into this book but when i did it grabbed me completely the chapter how they lived can stand alone as a testimony to the experiences of an undocumented immigrant","1197":"t what i expected nice book very interesting topic especially at these days but nothing breathless the second part of the book was better but it wasn't what i expected nice book very interesting topic especially at these days but nothing breathless","1198":"solid coming of age novel","1199":" i enjoyed this and didn't find any drawbacks i'm conscious of the need to read more books from outside my own cultural experience i think this is the first novel i have read by an african woman although i have read a very small number by black british and black usa women writers but probably not as many as i have by white african writers it's a really good example of book that arguably doesn't have a plot i worry when attempting to write that if things don't reach a dramatic climax and denouement it's a failure i worry when it doesn't have suspense in it but actually this is a good example of how to structure a book it reminds me slightly of olive kitteridge in that it's really a series of short stories that show progress through time character's life and character development but are basically narratives of incidents it's set partly in zimbabwe and partly in michigan usa although she doesn't name zimbabwe or mugabe it simply can't be anywhere else given its historical and geographical context anyway i know she is from zim and mentions it in her acknowledgements as i was reading this it struck me that zimbabwe hasn't been on the news recently and the events alluded to here seem so long ago the book describes the life of an 11 year old in zim one who lived in a shanty after her family had been forced out of their comfortable middle class house the second half describes her life in kalamazoo michigan living with her aunt who arranged her migration the main theme is the story of the migrant who doesn't feel she belongs either to her homeland or her new place of abode it's a nice story easy to read with some vivid portraits of a quite a wide cast of supporting characters if i were to make a criticism it would be its surprising lack of emotion she seems to have a stoic almost passive acceptance of life and gets on with it in zim despite the shanty town despite the starvation and the threats from mugabe's louts life didn't seem all that bad in michigan they seemed to do all right not suffer either deprivation or discrimination in a way you'd expect to see in a story of migrants","1200":"i thought this was good if a bit incomplete i'd be surprised if this wins the man booker tomorrow although not entirely shocked","1201":"vital intermittently hilarious and utterly heartbreaking","1202":"i found myself immediately immersed in the lives of these characters i was drawn into their lives and in that way connected to a piece of the world that i could have only understood academically zimbabwe through the eyes of its children america through the eyes of a young african woman escaping with the dreams of a little girl and the hopes of her entire family and though i won't pretend to understand what that's like this story made me feel closer to it in a way that will make you smile laugh cry and hopefully care a little bit more about what the people who come from someplace else than you do might be carrying on their shoulders a fantastic little piece of the truth","1203":"this is the first book i've ever won in a goodreads give away so i really wanted to love it i unfortunately didn't i can see how lots of people will love this one but for me it was just too scattered i wanted more character development and to know what happens to the kids who are left in africa it did open my eyes to the extreme cultural differences","1204":"well everything you can imagine has been thrown into this book and then the story doesn't go anywhere or come to a satisfactory conclusion i thought that the writing style was lazy for the first half of the book but it improved towards the end","1205":"i think this might be the best book i've read all year","1206":"this book never grabbed me i was going to stop reading it numerous times but decided i couldn't give it a proper rating if i didn't finish it i didn't enjoy the language or characters there didn't seem to be much of a story to get wrapped up in this one was just not for me","1207":" this book is about a girl named darling who is living in africa i read the whole book without knowing which part of africa she is from she refers to the country as paradise which it obviously is not i didn't figure out that it was zimbabwe until i read the review and alcolades at the end of the book it wasn't quite what i expected i thought it would be more about her life in america being from africa and finding out that it is not all that it is cracked up to be i got that from a review before i read this but she doesn't actually come to america until halfway through the book she starts out with a rowdy group of kids that steal guavas from homes in budapest despite this novel being about a young girl it is definitely an adult read it was an interesting experience and i recommend it to someone who is interested in african authors","1208":"the audio book was fantastic","1209":"i'm impressed the random pieces that make this puzzle are unique and with such sensitive social themes what i admired the most was the complete lack of hypocrisy","1210":" the best part of this book is the first half a collection of linked stories about a little girl and her gang of friends poor and starving in zimbabwe a decade or so ago even this summary assumes things which are left somewhat ambiguous zimbabwe is never named and the time frame is flexible but the evocative descriptions of the gang's experiences are unforgettable sometimes funny sometimes heartbreaking never sentimental if you have ever wondered what's going through the minds of the little kids you see in news clips swarming after food distribution trucks waving laughing begging desperate the answer is here the emotions are many and complicated and gratitude doesn't come into it i will never forget this half then the narrator goes to live with her aunt in the united states and the book seems to lose focus becoming more heavy handed and polemical partly she is becoming a teenager and therefore becoming more selfish and bitter and partly she has a much larger variety of emotions and attitudes to try to report but none of the scenes resonate the way the earlier ones do and she starts lecturing the reader in ways that become a bit tiresome finally the book seems to have no particular shape and the stories just stop i confess i never really understood the significance of the title but the first half is so well done in every way that these objections are easy to let go","1211":"http bookreviewsbycharles wordpress","1212":"the first half set in a town bulawayo in zimbabwe is magnificent the horror of a 9 year old girl's running through a township slowly filter through the american section not as convincing but told with great insight of the plight of illegal u0026amp exploited shadow workers","1213":"bulawayo has written an amazing novel told through the voice of darling who will remain with me for a long time darling is tough unsentimental harsh funny resilient and her story of life in zimbabwe and later in america is haunting","1214":"i was a bit disappointed by the book and feel that it was overhyped though i found a lot of the typical themes revolving around africa quite relatable the use of a narrator does give the story a different perspective","1215":"i enjoyed the childlike prose some of the places it felt like i was home","1216":"man i want to give this all of the stars but the second half is so scattered and tries to pack too much contemporary american bench markers into darling's immigrant experience this book probably has the distinction of being the first published mainstream novel to mention redtube noviolet bulawayo is a fantastic writer clearly heir to junot diaz which is never bad and i will read anything she writes","1217":"rating 4 7 this book is heartfelt and depressing and absolutely true in so many ways as a daughter of an african immigrant myself a lot of these things kind of spoke to me i do love the way she describes things her imagery is always interesting and unique but the book is also sad and some of the things are difficult to come to term with but it really is life","1218":"excellent couldn't put it down read it in one day i like how the story is told from darling's perspective","1219":"the chapter titled how they left is heartbreaking","1220":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2013 04","1221":"not an easy book to read and difficult to relate to quite powerful but harsh language certainly not an enjoyable read","1222":"such an interesting story told by a magnetic narrator darling truly was darling and i enjoyed learning about zimbabwe through her eyes certain things which i find completely ordinary took on great significance and a childhood i never could have dreamed of suddenly seemed imaginable the book just sort of ends in my opinion it could have kept going we could have kept learning more about darling and having more adventures together i liked how more general non darling specific chapters were sprinkled in to give readers an idea of the african experience and the african american no hyphen experience however this doesn't help the problem addressed in the book of people acting and speaking like africa is a country instead of a continent made up of so many diverse countries bulawayo's language was stunning with such beautiful phrases some favorites her smooth skin that doesn't even have a scar to show she is a living person eating it is really a disappointing thing it feels like i'm just insulting my teeth","1223":" 3 5 starsalthough it initially felt a little slow for me and i had to adjust to the novel being written in the present tense by page 30 i became somewhat invested in the story and by page 52 i was really getting into it and had fully committed the social commentary throughout the book is just really great and at those two points in particular religion and developed nations' attitudes towards developing nations respectively are called into question perfectly this careful analysis is told from the perspective of darling who while very insightful is also very ignorant taking only one of these aspects of her personality into consideration does her character an injustice she has opinions which are sometimes misguided she is cliquey like children often are she is easily influenced by her friends and the myth of america she is insensitive even when she gets a little older but she can also be empathetic and she has a conscience and she can think critically about situations she is a very realistic character which i appreciated darling never actually mentions her country's name and i think this does two things for one it makes you see her country more broadly although we are reminded not to think of africa as a single country or to give it a single story and that the countries are each different and have different issues to deal with at the same time it doesn't matter which specific one she comes from in fact she could almost be coming from a different continent altogether - certain central strains of the story would be the same - it just so happens to be a country in africa it is a story of immigration and the desire for better things secondly this purposeful omission seems more obvious when contrasted with all the other things darling is very specific about soda brands store names phone and laptop brands etc while in general it actually annoys me to see cultural references especially current ones littered throughout a novel it dates the book and feels distracting to me one has to assume it was done to contrast the absence of these things or the difference in the way they might appear where darling is from i think darling's vagueness about her country paints it with a sort of fantasy and intrigue especially when contrasted by the brashness of american consumerism in the latter half of the novel view spoiler i don't think it matters but we can safely say the african country in question is zimbabwe where bulawayo is from there is mention of rhodesia at one point and i'm sure other more subtle cultural cues would reveal that too hide spoiler there are no surprises in this story really pretty much all the pieces of your quintessential immigrant story are there but it is full of beautiful similes metaphors and juxtapositions that perfectly describe a very specific sort of feeling or that expose a certain way of thinking a set of culturally constructed priorities and while i wasn't completely blown away by the book overall i really valued the way it was told and i think bulawayo's criticism is demonstrated effectively through the scenes characters and happenings described please read my full only slightly longer review along with claire's on bitches with books because i had a little more to say about it there","1224":"i loved this book have not read many africans authors but would recommend this book author before the main character darling comes to live in destroyedmichygen with aunt fostalina you meet and her friends trying to survive in a poor section in zimbabwe her friends includebastard godknows sbho chipo and stina there are many life changing events that lead her to leave her native country to better her life in america think this would be a good book for any book club as there are a lot of discussable topics","1225":"it took me awhile to get into this story while there were parts of it that really drew me in i found myself looking to see how many pages were left far too often to be able to say that i loved the book i think i picked it up because of a comment by a reviewer of americanah which i thought was so much better","1226":"the story itself is a good one the style of writing is one that i don't enjoy","1227":"the children of zimbabwe live in poverty and despair without an education or chance of improvement we follow darling's escapes from this life to live in detroit michigan","1228":"this debut novel was slow going for me at first as it took me a while to get used to the narrative voice but it had sunk its claws into me by page 80 or so and from then on proved basically un put downable for me the novel's primary strength is its focus and insistence on the particularity and singularity of its 10 year old heroine darling she is not a stand in for all africans or for all immigrants to the u s though facets of her story certainly invite broader interpretation filtered through her experiences this novel is unsparing in its verbal spankings of anyone who would reduce africa in all its diversity and complexity to a single idea or image overall heartfelt humorous horrifying and thankfully never ham fisted","1229":" noviolet bulawyo's we need new names is a powerful and beautifully written debut novel darling and her friends run wild through the countryside governed by their parents only slightly better than their tumultuously led country of zimbabwe their jubilant voices and childish energy contrast starkly with the scenes they encounter such as a woman hanging from a tree having chosen a quick death over the slow painful death as a victim of the aids epidemic the children are horrified but their desperation is clear when they return for her shoes to trade for food in another scene they watch from a tree as a mob destroys the home of second generation boer family while shouting africa for africans while the mob is not treated sympathetically the stark injustice of the system is apparent when darling and her friends explore the ruins and open the refrigerator to encounter more food than they had ever seen halfway through the book darling is transported to america to live with her aunt who works two jobs to survive and send money back to zimbabwe here we see the starkly limited opportunities of the immigrant and the pain of not belonging in america or back home the only thing that does not change is darling's delightful voice at once innocent perceptive and acerbic the style of the novel is unique with each chapter taking on a slightly different angle almost like a collection of short stories interspersed with essays some of the passages made me want to be back in the classroom exposing teens to important ideas written in beautiful prose i think if i had chosen a better time to read this i would have rated it a five it is the kind a book most enjoyed by immersing in it and not suitable for a beach vacation with friends","1230":"now this is a book to make you think not only how lucky we are living in a mostly fair democracy but also not to be hindered in our fortunes by being illegal immigrants with unbelievable pressures on us this could have been a political treatise about the horrors of living in zimbabwe under mugabwe today but it's not neither country nor ruler is mentioned although we can easily see where our heroine is from in truth it is the wonderful story of darling friend of bastard et al growing up in the only environment they know they steal guavas to eat despite the effect on their bowels play in the streets and fields and generally survive in a very poor region of africa we do see the political dangers in the adults' problems and they notice neighbours going missing but this is mentioned briefly and indirectly through the eyes of the ten to twelve year olds eventually darling is taken away by her aunt to live in the usa and her teenage years are spent adapting to a totally new life from being taunted about her accent and ignorance of certain foods to learning about sex with her new friends using internet porn sites and having to cope with her elders who fail to adapt she is made to feel guilt when skyping her relatives back home but without the cards to make her legal she is unable to return to africa as they demand so she stays in a less than perfect america having to learn fast about what to say when to keep quiet and how not to chastise badly behaved children it is the world view of the at first innocent darling that makes this book so enjoyable and as the pace increases in the later chapters and time moves on apace her predicament becomes more fixed and the outcome more certain i really enjoyed this book and have few reservations just a trivial one here will suffice why please do we have the confusing trend to omit speech marks altogether there were several times in the early chapters especially when i was fed up having to work out what was dialogue and what narrative it is very irritating but the story is enlightening and the telling of it admirable","1231":"very honest and funny book","1232":" this is a book of two halves i struggled to read the first half and the book took me a look longer to read than usual as i kept putting it down and moving on to other novels i realise now having completed it that the whole works better than the halves and the different writing styles were a clever ploy by the author to indicate a change in circumstances for the main character the first piecemeal and confusing narrative fits the piecemeal and confusing life for a young child living in poverty in zimbabwe and introduces us in a colourful way to her friends and family the second clear and tidy narrative fits the new pattern of her life as an american teen with regularity and routine this novel works well as an account of the difficulties faced by immigrants in the usa and i was struck by the lack of contact with her mother and the realism and matter of fact nature of the tale however i found the writing style difficult to get to grips with","1233":"i felt like this book was fairly slow particularly in the beginning but i really can't give fewer than 4 stars to any book that moves me to tears","1234":"a beautiful important book about childhood poverty immigration and what it means to be from someplace i learned a lot more about the horrific violence in zimbabwe because of this book and i really think it should be taught in schools although it's also intensely readable with wonderful vivid characters not a homework book at all","1235":"cocky darling","1236":"i thoroughly enjoyed this novel for its humor it's honesty and sadness i was taken aback when my hometown became part of the book but it had a positive effect on me i do not know much about the writer but she has amazing talent and i look forward to her upcoming work","1237":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here if scout had grown up in zimbabwe she might have sounded a lot like darling observant unpretentiously intelligent with a combination of an innocent mind commenting without self pity on the far from innocent events her childhood has hosted her move to america brings a more subtle layer of loss her culture and village her sense of place to see the modern urban wasteland through her clear eyes was to see the combination of excess and emptiness we have too much and mean too little darlin if scout had grown up in zimbabwe she might have sounded a lot like darling observant unpretentiously intelligent with a combination of an innocent mind commenting without self pity on the far from innocent events her childhood has hosted her move to america brings a more subtle layer of loss her culture and village her sense of place to see the modern urban wasteland through her clear eyes was to see the combination of excess and emptiness we have too much and mean too little darling and her friends coming home from school an educational opportunity that could be the envy of the world but diluted and diminished by mass production and apathy to the point that darling finds it all too easy they watch pornography videos on a macbook in alphabetical order and gleefully provide the females' vocal soundtrack she works sorting recycled cans and bottles her student visa long expired and now she can't return home but this is not home either this place of noise and nonsense is this what our wealthy nation means and does to the immigrants who come here for safety and hope more","1238":"chapter 16 chapter 16 [?] more","1239":" i received a copy of this book for free from netgalley in exchange for an honest review also posted on my blog rinn reads initially i was a little put off of this book when i started reading it because of the lack of speech marks - which may seem like a petty thing but it's not a device i particularly like to me it makes the text run into itself and can sometimes make it difficult to tell who is talking however i quickly got over this small hiccup due to noviolet bulawayo's gift for prose her writing is visual and vivid shocking and touching but also honest i felt just as gripped by darling's simple life of stealing fruit and inventing new games to play with her friends as i would be with some epic quest filled fantasy or giant space opera i was drawn into darling's world where every little thing seemed to have so much meaning and significance however this book was not just about a ten year old girl in zimbabwe passing her days playing games with her friends there were so many serious issues - politics poverty aids rape child pregnancy racism - covered within the book the portrayal of these issues through the eyes of an innocent child made them all the more shocking such as darling's emotionless reaction to her father dying of aids darling's main ambition is to move to america and live with her aunt in detroit referred to by darling and her friends as 'destroyedmicheygen' eventually she is able to join her aunt in the us and this is where noviolet bulawayo demonstrates fantastic character progression darling's language changes as she ages and adapts to the usa she picks up slang she is suddenly surrounded by technology and supermarkets and other things that were missing or less common in her life in zimbabwe as she grows we see her lose her curiosity in things we see how many people like darling move to the states with big hopes and dreams with the aim of providing for their family and then can never return home because if they do they cannot re enter the states therefore they must sacrifice this connection with their family for the ability to provide for them we need new names was an absolutely beautiful book in both prose and subject matter we see darling change from a curious young girl to a hard working woman working her way towards community college and also sending money back home for her mother friends and other people from her village the book felt both sad and joyful at the same time in that darling achieved her goals but for that she had to sacrifice her connection to her homeland definitely highly recommended to all","1240":"touching all engaging alarming a book that demands your whole attention","1241":"santa clara valley reads book for 2015 i find this a disturbing book... but i do not mean that as something bad it is not a comfortable book to read it does not follow the traditional thoughts we have about africa immigrants and right vs wrong it makes the reader think because of my personal background i was not shocked by comments made in the novel - even though i did not like having to really face what i knew to be true it is a brick wrapped in a velvet almost humorous coating it hits hard at preconceived notions i would have preferred to just skim read this book without having to think about it but knowing i'll have to talk to my friends u0026amp perhaps my book club about it made me pay more attention to it well worth reading and coming to grips with the content i do have some negative comments about the style of the book there are no quotes around dialog making it sometimes difficult to follow the story several times i found i had to go back and figure out who was saying what also there are abrupt changes of place and time without any warning the only clue is an occasional mention of darlings' age main character particularly confusing was the part at the end of the chapter named \"for real \" brutal fight among the children there is a big skip between that time and all of a sudden darling is in detroit michigan just maybe these lapses in grammar time segue are meant to cause the reader to say \"whoa now... what's happening here\" and to think about the content more but i found it annoying","1242":"a little bit disappointed with this book not really sure what i was expecting but maybe something more than just a series of scenes from darling's life","1243":"very interesting read","1244":"incredible book the writing style took me a while to get used to there are passages of absolute breathtaking beauty brilliant read","1245":" rating we need new names by noviolet bulawayo proved to be a difficult task i finally settled for 3 stars as i feel ms bulawayo's descriptions of life in zimbabwe and of the immigrant's experience in america are well written and could have been rated 4 5 i found the flow of her story to be more difficult and at times i had to just grit it out and keep reading i did hear ms bulawayo speak at a book talk at santa clara university she made her story come alive for me of the three silicon valley reads book selections this year i believe this one will stay with me the longest i know very little about the struggle for independence in zimbabwe and am now interested in learning more","1246":"interesting to learn about the experience of a girl from zimbabwe living through social upheaval and then moving to detroit usa and the culture shock both places seem really bleak and meaningless esp american life","1247":"noviolet bulawayo's ten year old darling tells her story with all the sassy and vibrant honesty of a young girl who is fully accepting of and in love with the precarious life she is offered growing up largely unsupervised and in a greatly changing zimbabwe when darling moves to the united states readers are treated to an illumining funny heartbreaking and eye opening look at two cultural perspectives on friendship family and consumerism","1248":" excellent novel though written almost as a string of related short stories our narrator a young woman starts off in extreme poverty in southern africa illustrating corrupt politics aids fathers working in south africa hunger rape child pregnancy but with friendship and neighbors and family she then moves to america detroit where certainly she has enough to eat but still struggles as an illegal refugee her aunt's family with whom she lives drifts apart there is material comfort but little spiritual solace sounds bleak but it's not just challenging","1249":"loved darling she was so funny and fresh and real even though much of what was describing going through was actually quite sad great first novel from this author looking forward to reading more of her stuff","1250":"at times beautifully written at others it felt cliched this is a lovely collection of vignettes but it never really comes together as a coherent whole","1251":"3 5this one is hard to rate for some reason i really struggled with it possibly due to the format it's less a novel and more a collection of short stories albeit with the same narrator protagonist but there were many passages that were so damn powerful i had to read them out loud to whomever happened to be in the same room with me","1252":"a book that is dizzying and desperate and alive","1253":"this was a fantastic insight into the life of a young girl her family and friends in a newly independent zimbabwe in the 1980s the story was told with grace humour and a delicious turn of phrase the book is obviously based on the life of the author in the second part the main character darling grapples in a poignant way with the difficulties faced by migrants illegal or otherwise when faced with life in a country such as america and with the separation from family and friends i was completely transported into this world and sorry when i finished the book","1254":" this is an immigrant story it is by turns disturbing alarming funny sad touching beautiful gross and cryptic the writing itself is worth checking out the life in the story is definitely in the first part when the narrator darling is still living in zimbabwe the life described there is all about reckless survival feckless humanitarian efforts people like darling and her friends and family getting by on their wits and little else as her opportunity to come to america advances darling muses on a fantasy of having been chosen by angelina jolie and imagines her life would be so sweet this real world awareness is at the heart of this modern in your face story of the immigrant's quandary where do i belong this question is pushed to the forefront as darling spends her teen years getting by in the upper midwest part of a loosely held together family of immigrants once again darling is left to her own devices and her feckless ways take a new turn the structure of family life and the morals and habits of a strong culture once again eluding her","1255":" i liked the first half of this book the language is rich the characters realistic and the main character's voice seems to soar off of the page the novel starts off in zimbabwe in the late 90's where we first meet darling a likeable whip smart young girl living in a shantytown ironically called paradise along with her interestingly named friends bastard sbho godknows bulawayo does not give us a pretty picture of paradise however there is crippling poverty daily starvation darling and her friends steal fruit from trees to survive the government's systematic destruction of what little homes they have and one of her 11 year old friends is pregnant presumably from a rape by a family member despite the bleak landscape of the novel i loved the fact that bulawayo chose to portray her child narrator with equal parts of innocence and resiliency there was a fair share of times within the book where i found myself laughing out loud at darling's observations a trip to church with her grandmother the ngo workers who take pictures of them and give them loads of things they don't need it's a harsh world but a beautiful one in which the children dreamingly drift away their days without school playing games and eating fruit about mid way through the book darling immigrates to america here though her voice becomes disconnected from the rest of the narrative while i imagine that a certain degree of this is intentional bulawayo is mirroring the voicelessness of the immigrant experience it is not particularly interesting to read the first part of the book crackled with energy and it was such a let down to read the second half mostly darling's blandly prescribed accounts of fat americans the appearance of snow going to the mall and watching porn with her friends i wouldn't advise people not to read this book bulawayo does not waste words each chapter was strong enough to stand as a short story on its own bulawayo is a good writer and i loved the solidness of her prose i look forward to her further writing in the future she is definitely one to watch","1256":"inventive and moving relatively weak narrative more than compensated for by fizzing language and the interest of the cross cultural story childhood chapters in zimbabwe are specially good","1257":"such raw pain in this novel","1258":"young darling gives us her story life in zimbabwe after the mugabe regime destroys the expanding middle class and later when she emigrates to america as a middle schooler to live with her aunt her voice is awesomely honest her story riveting","1259":" listening to the book read aloud let me hear the accent of the narrator change from her childhood voice when she was still living in zimbabwe to her adolescent more americanized voice as she needed to adapt to teen conventions in her new place the voiceover artist captures the clear eyed observation skills of a girl living through a troubled period of history when her people are displaced abused and when the so called solution does not relieve the suffering but makes it worse even though darling's story is personal this is a historical novel since it takes place during operation murambatsvina in 2008 when zimbabwe's president mugabe in order to suppress the many poor who disagreed with his policies cleared slums by destroying their houses leaving 700 000 people homeless and jobless darling reports on her day to day life with gripping detail when she is homeless eleven years old and starving feeding only on the guavas she and her friends steal from people's gardens these scenes are unforgettable in their lack of self pity and demonstrate the children's sheer will to survive adults are not present the children seem almost feral there is a feeling of community of adults being just over there and there must have been somewhere to sleep but it is not described later when the children come upon a revolutionary army evicting a white family from their home it is clear that cruelty goes both ways those to whom evil is done do evil in return as auden put it the children invent games imitating the warlike behavior of the soldiers the callous disregard for people's suffering when darling moves to the united states to live with her aunt in michigan she adapts to the new place and shows her acumen for survival her ability to skate through tricky situations yet remain her fundamental self when she phones home to talk to her mother and ends up talking to an old friend instead she gets the chastising of her life darling had meant to express her sympathy for the hard times chipo was going through but chipo lets her have it what makes you think i am suffering how dare you talk to me about suffering all across the world there is suffering bulawayo captures the condescension of white people who encounter darling in us how they lump every country under the name of africa how they patronize charities and say how cute the children are etc bulawayo seems to be telling the truth only toward the end when she was editorializing a bit much did i enjoy it less as a fiction writer through she is supreme i look forward to reading more from her","1260":" i don't remember the last time i read a book in a single afternoon no matter its size this book moved me and i hadn't expected to be moved i put aside my entire day everything i had planned because i was in zimbabwe and america with darling feeling her feelings and thinking her thoughts i suppose it's also true that she told the story that i expected to hear i have never believed that the zimbabwean president's robin hood approach to the land redistribution could truly be a good thing for the people even though i fully understand the triumph of taking back what should always have been ours i think many africans are like uncle kojo admiring of his gall but the reality is likely that there was more lost on both sides than there was gained i am glad noviolet shared this story","1261":"a wonderful read a 3 hour train journey vanished","1262":" we need new names works in two halves darling's childhood in zimbabwe and teen years after moving to america to live with her aunt bulawayo had some fun ideas i liked the depictions of darling's adventures and games with her childhood friends the western journalists and ngo staff as a source of humor and the universal experience of kids being bored in church the second half of the book darling's life in michigan seemed to lag i feel like other novelists have explored the immigration experience and the feeling of belonging to two cultures and no culture in more interesting ways as a greedy reader i longed to know more about darling's childhood friends how was chipa handling motherhood did bastard ever harnass his innate charisma and leadership skills and couldn't seem to care about darling's quiet cousin or generic high school classmates even the more interesting storylines and anecdotes from this half the man at the nursing home darling's fractured relationship with her mother were undeveloped and never reached the same emotional poignancy as the group of children illicitly climbing trees to pick guavas thanks to this book i'm now eager to pick up other novels or short stories about zimbabwe's political history economic issues and immigration to from other countries i kept finding myself being frustrated at the child narrator when bulawayo was delivering exposition about the worthless old currency anti colonial movements and the zimbabwean voting system note not a critique of the book the child narrator worked well i just have too many gaps in my knowledge about history can anyone offer recommendations","1263":" when i reached the end of this book i had a feeling of wait what but only because i had been so enjoying the ride the ending felt out of place to me like it wasn't ready to stop there i'm not saying it needs a tidy bow to tie everything off but it felt undone but not in a good way as i said before i really enjoyed the story through darling's eyes this is a great book to get an insight into the immigrant experience the author makes it clear that darling's experience mirrors that of other immigrants there's an especially poetic chapter that describes these communities and shows how they are linked overall i was wrapped up in the story and style of writing i recommend this book to others","1264":"i loved the piece that took place in zimbabwe and some of the later chapters too but i wanted a bit more story i highly recommend the book despite that","1265":"despite the fact that this book was chock full of painful complicated heart breaking issues i loved it the voice of 11 year old zimbabwe refuge darling was frank evocative and still innocent eye opening perspective on the challenges immigrants face when coming to america but could someone please tell me the point of the story of the dog at the end and the smell of bread this is definitely a book that needs to be talked about","1266":"sorry but i could not get even half way through it","1267":" this book has a real beauty to it the dialect takes some getting used to but it's a great story of the confusing role of an immigrant to a new country especially one who has such mixed emotions about the place they're from bulawayo does a great job of capturing that dichotomy of a love and excitement for new opportunities and a new place and the leaving the tragic homeland full of violence and unpredictability and yet the only place you've known and where your mother is this book totally leaves an impression","1268":" old dummer book club read however christine n wanted me to read it generally not my kind of book however enjoyed some nostalgia in the similarities between the innocence of childhood in zim u0026amp my own sa childhood interesting to read a black person's account of their childhood and sociopolitical and economic events as perceived by them particularly so being on the other side of the fence ie a white child resulting from sa and uk parentage and growing up in neighbouring sa albeit a few years before darling the main character could identify with some of darling's feelings relating to her friends back home once she'd been living in the us for a while its very true that when one moves away from where you originated as a child you miss your friends terribly but also find it difficult to relate to them as your experiences are so far beyond anything those that stay behind can ever understand whilst likewise you never quite feel that original connection again with your new friends there are however a few special friendships from both original and new homes that seem to transcend these challenges and i am waiting to see if darling finds these did find the teenage porn bit a little ott perhaps teenagers in america do watch that amount of graphic porn and if so that's disturbing to say the least despite darling's hopes of studying u0026amp aspirations for a big job she is ultimately more trapped in america than she was in zimbabwe as an illegal immigrant job options are limited to cleaning u0026amp other cash in hand work the realisation at some point that her aunt works more to give those back in zim a better life than anything else is sad u0026amp clearly the cycle is set to repeat itself whilst those back in zim simply come to expect the money u0026amp the life it buys them without any idea of the work it takes to provide that money","1269":"quick read i enjoyed the book found it rather funny her choice of words is interesting","1270":"3 pages in and i know this is a great work of fiction when we were little we used to play in the wind whenever it came we would run outside to meet it hands outstretched like wings bodies balanced on tiptoe and reaching toward the sky","1271":"this book was fascinating and hard to read at the same time it was like looking over someone's shoulder and knowing all the things they knew good and bad horrifying and embarrassing and unjust all at the same time i'm still processing it","1272":"maybe it was me but i just couldn't get stuck into this led to an interesting book club discussion though","1273":"a lovely funny little book darling is an amusing and interesting narrator i'm not sure i've ever enjoyed being inside someone's head so much the tale itself is a bit more like a collection of chronological vignettes that's appropriate because there's not too much to the plot instead it is more of a rumination on immigration opportunity what home means despite the poignant topic i laughed often and loudly highly recommended","1274":"the narrator of we need new names is a teenager called darling her gang prowls the streets of a zimbabwean shanty town called paradise they're not a particularly bad gang their crimes don't really get any worse than raiding the rich houses of neighbouring budapest for guavas darling's aunt has emigrated to the usa and darling dreams of the life she might have there the dream is eventually realised when she gets a school visa and joins her aunt in michigan darling's transition to becoming a typical american kid is really the centrepiece of the novel it's a perfect illustration of how a person is shaped by the culture they are surrounded by darling remains the same girl at heart but her view of the world and the way she interacts with it gradually changes as she becomes more entrenched in her new home darling's narration contains a lot of the features that i often dislike i've read a lot of books in recent times with a child narrator and they generally tend to deploy the 'out of the mouths of babes' approach that's where an adult concept is explained through the eyes of the child not quite correctly and with humorous results this was enchanting the first time i'd seen it but seems a little stale now i sometimes found the device to be a little awkward in we need new names because darling was a little too old to really get away with it but it still generally engaged me in this book another thing that i generally dislike is when an author abandons the story for a chapter bulawayo does that here with a couple of chapters that can only be described as stand alone essays that convey her feelings on topics that are relevant to the themes of the novel i would generally consider this to be a mortal sin but the essays were brilliant in their own right and actually contributed greatly to my overall experience with this book even the totally egregious crime of abandoning quotation marks seemed like a perfectly fine choice for this novel i don't know why but it worked i'll finish this review with a couple of my favourite passages i think they both capture the tone of the novel the first is a line that stopped me in my tracks it's incredibly simple but at the same time evocative it's talking about a couple that have fallen out of love now they were just living together like neighbouring countries the second is a brave criticism of a literary classic the last book i read was that jane eyre one where the long meandering sentences and everything just bored me and that jane just kept irritating me with her stupid decisions and the whole lame story made me want to throw the book away apologies to jane eyre fans but i think that's hilarious","1275":" we need new names was very good it was powerful and well written the story follows 10 year old darling from zimbabwe to america it is a look at 'abandoning' a home country to come to the country of possibilities just to realize that what you dreamed in africa will never happen in america you will not become famous become a doctor live in a mansion you are illegal you will take the worst jobs and live in poverty yet you know that this poverty is nothing like the poverty in zimbabwe it is a look at how hard it is to be an immigrant how frustrating it can be not barely speak the language and then to have your friends in your home country feel like you abandoned them a good analogy in the novel if if you leave your burning house without trying to put out the fire is it still your house can you really complain about it burning down the story is also about the hardships of living in africa there are two extremely powerful scenes one when they try to give an 10 or 11 year old girl an abortion with a wire hanger another when an african gang attacks a white couple they were both very hard to read but extremely well written","1276":"darling is a dispossessed soul in conflict with everything she ever knew she grew up in buluwayo zimbabwe but never really names the country or its leader until in her acknowledgement at the end of the book in truly picturesque prose darling shares her memories of violence pseudo religious events headed by prophet revelations bitchington mborro on the mountain and numerous incidences of hunger and the joy of their childhood games like 'catching osama ben ladin 'country game and vasco da gama cultural practices are embedded in her psyche since birth when a child's umbilical cord is buried in the ground to ensure the new baby's covenant with the soil and the forefathers blessings are spread with the ritual pouring of tobacco and beer on the ground their shanty town after their more affluent home was destroyed in the suburbs was called paradise and the group of childhood friends constantly went back to an affluent suburb called budapest to steel guavas it was often their only way of getting something to eat for days on end her childhood friends and family have endearing names such as godknows chipo stina sbho nomoretroubles bastard his little sister fraction mother of bones and messenger expressions such as'i'm not talking to you chapped buttocks' and 'i don't need any kaka school to make money you goat teeth' and 'i really think flat face peeping buttocks godknows is only saying it to please ugly face bastard' and 'hey cabbage ears what are you bathing for ' ensure that the journey through this book becomes a warm colorful one despite the dark sad undertones with her aunt fostelina living in america married to a ganaian darling gets a chance to escape to a better life although she is an illegal immigrant her experience of a united nations of people around her in the usa is shared with wonder and nostalgia she is a member of the generation being born after the colonialist came to steal their country after the fall of colonialism and now the brutal regime of robert mugabe people are murdered including naturally born white zimbabweans the school system collapse and all services crash down with the chinese moving in to reap the benefits of a destroyed nation in dire poverty and despair the country's leader has been widely accused of ethnic cleansing orchestrating political violence and serial cheating at the polls millions of the inhabitants are fleeing in all wind directions to escape their own government troups how they leftlook at the children of the land leaving in droves leaving their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies and shock on their faces and blood in their hearts and hunger in their stomachs and grief in their footsteps leaving their mothers and fathers and children behind leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth leaving everything that makes them who and what they are leaving because it is no longer possible to stay they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth in america she goes to school and does very well but due to the high tuition fees slapped on foreign students she struggles to get a good education and works illegally to make ends meet she feels enslaved in a system that might throw her out at any moment her soul remains in transition forever since she floats between two worlds which took away her freedom of choice in zimbabwe she has no future neither in america with her illegal status no prosperity awaits her which ever choice she makes after thirteen years she feels disconnected from her old as well as new world my commentsit is an insightful read and an eye opening journey through the true suffering of immigrants i recommend this read to anybody who would like to experience the true feelings and thoughts of people in flight one little gripe the reading was very confusing since dialogue mixed in with the rest of the text without any warning it made it very difficult to distinguish between conversations and narrative the method in this madness passed me by at first it worked since a nine year old girl shared her memories but then she becomes a grown up and by the time this tale is told she is already on her way to college yet the confusion remained in the text however the underlying sadness of the loss of identity and constant feelings of longing of a displaced person spoke to me the author captures the perpetual mourning of all first generation immigrants very well the detailed descriptions of darling's environment were excellent i am glad i read this book about a young girl who had one leg in her motherland which gave her 'story swag and soul' and her other leg in america who gave her the opportunity to tell her story her journey gave her hope and strength of character noviolet buluwayo is the pseudonym of elizabeth tshele who changed her name to honor her mother and her home city 'no violet' means 'with violet' in ndebele the title reflects on her change of perception about her country her new destiny and the changes it all brought in her life a new name calls for new beginnings and to leave the past behind however difficult it seems to be her generation was born free and cannot blame the devastation on the past but want to address the problems that was created in their own life times the implication is that her generation wants to get rid of a leader who ruled for too long and destroyed everything it was a good read indeed i loved this book","1277":" this is a work of eccentric prose that's bound to resonate with anyone who's grown up in third world africa and arouse the imagination of those who haven't it is funny in a way other novels cannot be as it's literally narrated in the words of a girl growing into her teenage years this sort of narration sets it apart as an avant garde of contemporary african writing and it's clear why it made noviolet bulawayo the first black african woman to be short listed for the man booker 2013 darling will endear you with her innocence in paradise make you laugh with her clever imagery and annoy you with her american arrogance all in all great book highly recommended i'd give it 5 stars but it's not without flaw spoilers below i read this book right after chimamanda's americanah many times i was compelled to pause and juxtapose the two as much as there are striking similarities between the two the differences are equally palpable americanah was deep engaging thought provoking and to some extent didactic in its tone chimamanda brought out issues of race social relationships family and even hair politics in the eyes of a middle class nigerian lady who's grown up in nsukka nigeria and matriculated in princeton u s a names on the other hand narrates darling's a 10 year old zimbabwean girl experiences in poverty stricken paradise a shanty slum in zimbabwe she's lucky enough to move in with her aunt in the u s where she's to discover that her preconceptions were not entirely accurate unlike americanah names feels a bit incomplete darling is still an unsettled teenager out of touch with her roots back home a truth she admits but deeply regrets she reacted furiously when on a phone call chipo a childhood friend from paradise called her out for fleeing her country adopting their ways accents and all and yet claiming her country as hers it actually felt like i was just half way into the story when the novel ends abruptly like maybe a deadline expired as darling would put it","1278":"simply amazing terrifying hilarious expansive and educational for a dumb white boy like me besides the bad things that keeping happening to dogs throughout the book it's a fantastic solid enveloping story","1279":"certain chapters in this book read like poetry and like some poems you just don't fully understand what you are reading while i found many descriptions and phrasing in this novel to be beautiful i was left feeling confused at the end","1280":"while each chapter read more as a short story than part of a novel the exuberance of this book carried it along from chapter to chapter the story of an african in america is different than the stories of african americans an eye opening book i want to read more by this author","1281":"i received this book as a giveaway from goodread's first reads very interesting read from a first time author whose voice will be one to watch in the future darling the 10 year old protagonist stays with you because of what she sees every day violence hunger and political instability are issues that effect her everyday life in zimbabwe darling has the opportunity to leave this environment for a better life in the united states darling may have physically left zimbabwe behind her emotionally she is still there her struggles to find her place are what make this book so compelling and well worth the investment","1282":"this was a wonderful book that was a joy and a pleasure to read i don't think i had read any novels that were based initially in zimbabwe but if noviolet writes another one i am buying it","1283":"the writing in the first half of the book the part describing the narrator's childhood in zimbabwe is quite wonderful the second half after darling's move to michigan with an aunt is more uneven but we get a good glimpse of the immigrant's life she is homesick yet knows she can't go back mainly because she doesn't have papers it is an intriguing book but perhaps she covers too many bases","1284":" this one was recommended by rick riordan and it had an interesting premise see growing up in zimbabwe through the eyes of a child and then see that child adjust to life in america i will not be reading any more of his recommended books some parts of the book are beautifully described but it doesn't balance the disturbing images or language used this one is a graphic reminder of why i choose to stick with children's lit lots of casual swearing and things i do not want to deal with i skipped several pages when they started describing the porn on tv they'd watch when the aunt wasn't at home even though i skipped around i did finish i thought it should have ended with her skype call with her friend a painful reminder of how good we have it here in the usa","1285":"4 5 stars based on the last 50 pages alone lots of great content and language here","1286":"sections of this book are direct and powerful the main character's voice is well drawn fresh and full of insight the structure is comprised of tightly written episodes with an indeterminate time frame separating each chapter sometimes this works quite well and other times it is a bit disjointed the us section has a different rhythm as a first novel very good work","1287":"much to consider storng passages when home isn't home things fall apart cited sporadically as almost a mantra who suffers how","1288":"the story both of the lost generation of zimbabwe and its refugees and of one girl who leaves it behind to move to america and assimilate we need new names is gorgeous heartbreaking and engrossing it is a beautiful book","1289":"i thought this was a great book","1290":"i thought it was a difficult book to read it was disjointed at several points and it was hard to tell what darling was thinking talking about","1291":"i enjoyed the perspective of this book but i found it a little hard to follow i'm not sure if it's because i was listening to the audiobook but i often felt confused about jumps in the story and feeling like i kept missing something but still a unique perspective on immigration","1292":"three and a half stars i really liked the first part set in zimbabwe but then it kind of lost a bit of steam for me the narrative just got too muddled she didn't need to go so far into darling's time line i would have liked more scenes from school and with her friends in america otherwise it all rang very true","1293":" it is one of the gem storytelling experiences to arise from a zimbabwe on the verge of great change having undergone tumultuous changes since independence the write's mastery in storytelling shines through as she uses the \"eyes\" and childhood experiences of the main character \"darling\" to illustrate life during the elections where for the first time the word change was banded the suffering of the zimbabwean people through poverty hunger no education no freedom of speech - simple basic deprivation of human rights is lightly narrated through the main character's childlike voice darling's childlike explanation of the redistribution of land in zimbabwe after independence is craftily narrated through the following excerpt if you're stealing something its better if its small and hideable or something you can eat quickly be done with like guavas so i don't know what the white people were trying to do in the 1st place stealing not just a tiny piece but a whole country begins to reveal a mature comprehension of the colonial evils and long term effects every child character reveals different effects the autocratic mugabe regime had on families the zimbabwean names evermore revealing the underlying thoughts and feelings of parents as they named their children names like darling bastard chipo godknows sbho and stina as the story unfolds to darling's exodus to america my america and her awakening realisation and disappointment of discovering the reality of finding a \"promised land\" in america her adult mature voice begins to mourn the death of the identity of most zimbabwean people tracing back the struggle for freedom against the western colonises through to her \"self imposed\" exile in america when things fall apart children of the land scurry scatter like birds escaping a burning sky look at the children of the land leaving in droves their own land with bleeding wounds on their bodies shock on their faces blood in their hearts hunger in their stomachs grief in their footsteps leaving their umbilical cords underneath the soil leaving the bones of their ancestors in the earth the writer cleverly weaves the american election of their first president obama into the story and the destructive act of the usa invasion of iraq when her cousin tk joins the army and her uncle who is a ghanain born immigrant's slowly begins to self destruct through alcohol abuse and \"getting lost the usual gathering of african communities in foreign places is beautifully described through family events with dance music and loud sounds of native languages the description of the zimbabwean dancing is creatively told as a story with structure nuance rhythm climax and purpose the abundance of food in america is not sufficient for those who yearn for the place where their umbilical cords are buried the view of fat people in america is seen as greed whereas anyone fat in zimbabwe is seen as \"well off\" throughout the story one is swept away with magnificent storytelling of places people and of identity and reminded that when all is lost the story remains","1294":" i really enjoyed this book especially the freshness energy and edgy humour of the first section set in the ironically named township of paradise where the teenage narrator darling has come to live the current of darkness and heartbreak that runs beneath this first section carries over into the second section where darling is once more displaced this time into detroit intercut with two short poetic chapters this novel is as angry funny and intelligent as its central protagonist a howl of wit and rage it feels authentic and heartfelt i highly recommend it","1295":"a quietly powerful and lyrical coming of age immigrant story that would pair well with americanah i hope that folks on the ala alex committee take a close look at this one","1296":"i thoroughly enjoyed reading this disturbing and wonderful account of one immigrant's experience bulawayo eloquently describes the longing her heroine feels for home and the ugly realities of her new life in america neither place is truly a sanctuary for her loneliness lovely writing","1297":"tough read pov of 10yo girl at the start of the novel she is in her teens by the end of the novel moves from africa to michigan great depictions of the disorientation she experiences and the feeling of being lost in america","1298":"this is one of those books you wish had come into your life earlier it's just honest and lovely and terrifying i wish my teenage self could have read this book","1299":"this first novel is more like a collection of interconnected short stories i was looking forward to this as i encounter a lot of african immigrants through volunteering but it left me a little cold i understand the modern immigrant perspective better but i could get that from non fiction i look for a greater depth of truth in fiction this author may get there next time but i don't think she's there yet","1300":"the first part of the novel takes place in zimbabwe where 10 year old darling and her friends run free after their homes have been bulldozed and schools closed large jumps of time occur between episodes and then darling finds herself living with an aunt in detroit she is bright but becomes a tough teenager the writing is engaging but there was a feeling of distance from the characters' problems","1301":"a beautiful debut told in total honesty life in zimbabwe for darling and her uniquely named friends is vividly brought to life in the opening passage and those images stay with you once she makes it to america her options are only somewhat better bulawayo is a spectacular new talent to be made aware of","1302":" we need new names started out slow but picked up in the second half reminded me somewhat of americanah but the protagonist is from zimbabwe instead of nigeria in that it includes both perspectives growing up in africa and immigrant experience in the u s however this book did not have the multiple layers of americanah and was much shorter so less character development and no racial or tribal analysis i thought it ironic that the book referred to the many problems in zimbabwe and somewhat laid them at the feet of the president but never once mentioned mugabe's name overall a good first novel and i look forward to reading more from noviolet bulawayo","1303":"i was excited going into this and it started out well it was interesting and very poetic the words just flying through my head but eventually i realized that there is no story it is entirely a novel of observation and detailing the ways of life and how people are affected by the events of the world the main character has almost no characterization that distinguishes her from the rest and it almost becomes a novel written in the plural pov indeed a part was written with we as the subject and then another with they so without anything to latch onto it felt impersonal which made it uncomfortable to feel detached from the story when the story is an important one to tell","1304":" this book enthralled me with its rhythmic telling and gritty edge in many ways noviolet bulawayo's voice is the voice of every soul who has left a country that is no longer hospitable to its own people for one reason or another and immigrated to america for a better life and finds that yes life in america is better in some ways but not better in other ways and often strange but her voice is also a very unique one as she blends modern and old new and traditional in telling the story of darling's youth in zimbabwe then in michigan away from her mother and friends where she adapts to a new way of life while experiencing moments of extreme longing for the life she left behind darling is the right amount of both tough and sensitive so that it's easy to empathize with her as she finds her way through the oddities of a new culture blunders a little here and there and finally realizes that going back home and being who she was is no longer a possibility there is some wonderful penetrating writing in this novel and amid the losses of those who stayed and those who left their country the author gives us a good dose of humor","1305":" another book club selection i found this book so painful to read the lives of darling and her friends are brutal and bulawayo tells the story with plainness and an attention to detail that does not spare the reader's squeamishness on the other hand darling has a voice that is mischievous and curious witty and imaginative so that it is hard to stop reading about her i had to take breaks from reading but i always found i wanted to go back for more the story starts out in zimbabwe with darling living in a shantytown running wild with a bunch of other shantytown children she's hungry and feral but she knows who she is and how she belongs to her place the second half of the book takes place in america with darling adjusting to life as a teenaged immigrant with an expired visa she's aware that she's not at home she's homesick but she can't go back without giving up her chance to escape the brutal life she left behind both halves of the book are heartbreaking but in a way the second half is more heartbreaking even though it contains what we might think of as the hope that darling might truly escape the brutality of her old life most of the book is written in the voice of darling but there are a couple of chapters that are told from a collective voice although this book tells a painful story there is a lot of pleasure in reading it because of the precision and originality of noviolet bulawayo's writing","1306":"fiction i read this for the faculty book group read around the world for february 2015 this work takes place in zimabwe in an impoverished neighborhood with the protagonist darling who is a ten year old girl the novel follows darling and her friends around town as they search for guavas to steal out of the trees in more well to do areas her very young and pregnant friend the sleazy clergy and the corrupt paramilitary police it is a sad story and a sad life and eventually darling goes to america to live with her aunt and we hope this will make life better for her but she is faced with a much different way of living and a much different view of how children behave in the two different worlds i think it is important that these stories are told but i feel i have read so many of them and they are all so sad and depressing it weighs on you to read them over and over again it did lead us to a good discussion about the nature of violence how it is passed on and what people deem as acceptable and that is what this felt like a way to address issues of poverty in africa the difficulty immigrants face legal and illegal and how do we view violence it did not feel like a novel it was depressing it was not cohesive and i don't feel it offered something new nor did it offer any possible suggestions or solutions to such problems in the world i would recommend it only if you have not read the same type of thing before or if you are in a book group that wants to discuss these specific issues","1307":" the story centers around darling and her band of oddly named friends growing up in zimbabwe she details their adventures in the shanty town that they live in the story is vivid colorful witty yet intensely sad at the same time noviolet describes the political down slide of her home country through darling's child's voice without it being bitter and or necessarily judgmental of the circumstance what she does is let the truth and reality of what ordinary zimbabweans are facing corrupt extreme poverty and desperation tell the story darling eventually moves to the us where she continues telling her story of being in exile and trying to fit in as a teenage girl in the us as much as i enjoyed the story though i felt that the book could have been better edited overall a good read","1308":"this is her debut novel and before i came across an extract of it in granta about a year ago i had never heard her name before it is a beauty anyhow in one word bulawayo is fearless and even when i was only halfway through the book every time i read it i couldn't get over the sense that this might be the best thing i'd ever read it's narrated by this girl darling who spends most of her time hanging out with a group of kids in paradise which is this 'refuge' kind of place in an unnamed african country zimbabwe basically and while the story's outwardly about her journey out of africa and the us most of what they do is kid around and deal with one atrocity after another in their own colourful way even though really at the end of the day the story's about anything but kidding around and the writing's so so bold from of course the names e g bastard godknows darling sbho bornfree prophet revelations bitchington mborro--and a nearby city is called budapest while a building site is shanghai and the graveyard is heavenway and furthermore another place is destroyedmichygen to the description at one point the dress of a woman hanged from a tree is painted as swinging ever so lightly in the breeze like maybe a baby angel is busy playing with it while at another they're watching a man and can tell from his face that this one can pinch a rock and make it wince to the patois which is by no means pervasive to darling and the rest of the kids' particular perspective on current cultural and political and religious affairs to just the book cover itself devoid of anything but the title of the novel the author's name and a short quotation from the novel then we are rushing then we are running then we are running and laughing and laughing and laughing also it's almost three hundred pages technically but the font and the margins are surprisingly big which means the pages are flying by it's really quite refreshing minor spoilers from here on out finally to a certain extent it is very much a two parter and i do feel like if bulawayo had just made that clear from the get go it wouldn't have been an issue at all essentially one half takes place in the african country and one in the us and all through the first half darling the narrator takes it for granted that she'll be going to the us to live with her aunt and to be honest i assumed it would never happen that did surprise me and it did leave a sense of something i wouldn't call it disappointment but perhaps disappointment's cousin things aren't as fresh in the second part either stylistically this is most likely because well during the first part the reader is the one who gets to explore new things strange things wonderful things in this mystical landscape filled with strange new wonderful people while in the second it's darling who gets to do most of this and we get to watch her do it which is different yes but again fra from disappointing mostly it's just unexpected and perhaps bulawayo wanted it that way--in many ways the story is also about being snatched away or snatching yourself away from home and snatchings ever only happen in a flash also time speeds up during the second part which means darling grows older and her voice takes on a few kilos becomes more knotted and you know grown up it's still a beacon though the book an absolute star","1309":"i devoured this book what a great voice i want more","1310":"i liked it for its energy and i liked it for introducing me to a newish perspective i wished there had been more characterization","1311":"interesting perspective and it's appearing on plenty of must read lists but i found it meandering and voiceless interesting in spurts the characters were lacking depth and forgettable","1312":"a story about the making and experience of migration of political and economic asylum seeking the first half of the novel is set in zimbabwe and largely told in the voice of a 10 year old girl darling she hangs out with her friends they live in a shanty town and are constantly hungry they visit the wealthier area of budapest to look for guavas etc the narrative follows a series of incidents told in casual colloquial english but behind their childhood activities are the political events of zimbabwe a zanu sponsored mob rampage into the white district of budapest an opposition activist is killed and in a couple of short chapters the destruction of darling's previous home by government forces is described although the novel shifts to a third person narrator for these last two sections the division between the children's lives and the political events can also be seen in a broader context the book constantly separates the children from the adults adults are worn down by poverty and worry darling's father returns from south africa with aids adults are constant disciplinarians there is very little evidence of an emotional existence shared by children and adults at first i liked the life in the descriptions of the children and their shared lives but i found the background stuff all a bit obvious a crude nudging us to notice the big themes and as it went on i became less certain unsure whether the scenes were developing into anything beyond a series of described events yet there are a number of powerful passages such as the children's enactment of the arrest questioning torture and killing of the political activist as a pantomime game or when the girls with the advice and support of a slightly older girl attempt to rid one of their friends of her pregnancy in both scenes the children's actions echo the adult world creating an unnerving duplication of meanings in the second half of the novel darling has moved to the united states to live with her aunt the novel continues as a series of incidents although now they are spread across a number of years as darling moves into and through her teenage years the big theme here is the experience of the migrant in the new country but i found much of it too obvious things stated rather than enacted one exception is the scene during a wedding reception when darling slaps a misbehaving toddler and then realizes she has broken all the boundaries of acceptable behaviour there remains the same sense of alienation between the youngsters and the adults both living separate and often secret lives this has a potential interest as the older generation look back to their original homelands while the youngsters become more american - and there is a chapter that generalizes the experience still written in first person it no longer seems to be darling's voice but rather the voice of a symbolic immigrant or maybe the author's i find this clumsy rather than powerful the attitudes of the book are often contradictory but in a confused not an interesting way at times the novel seems to imply that the failures of the family in the new world is due to a failure of parental authority yet this alienation of children from parents is just a continuation of the alienation of children and adults shown in the zimbabwean section of the book overall i found it an unsatisfactory book its themes often becoming obvious points yet it does have a number of powerful passages that show that noviolet bulawayo is a promising young author","1313":"i had really high expectations about this book and maybe that was part of the problem i got it on audible because these days i find it easier to listen to audiobooks that to read the traditional way anyway maybe that was also part of the problem the presumably caucasian woman doing the african accent didn't help matters it was really slow at the beginning and as much as i tried to get into it i just couldn't i gave up after the first few chapters because it just was not interesting and i really have no time to spend on fictional literature that i don't find interesting i might try to read it again when i have more time and this time i will read an actual paperback or epub version","1314":" this is a debut novel by noviolet bulawayo who is a zimbabwean expatriate currently staying in the united states of america the novel tells the story of darling and her friends a bunch of ten year olds who roam the streets in zimbabwe as their school teacher has left and have nothing better to do than to play silly games and steal guavas from the richer neighborhood told in first person the author hints at the social and political injustices in her country the second part of this novel is from the point of view of darling as an immigrant in america it's a touching narrative of the difficulties of setting in and the feeling of inescapably this book was nominated for the booker's prize in 2013 it's extraordinary in parts and overall good a 4 5 read","1315":" i do believe this book was worth reading and it was educational and enlightening in many senses but on a pure pleasure of reading level it didn't rank high for me i think the biggest reason for that is that i found it a bit inconsistent some chapters were beautifully told and strikingly poetic and others were quite weak and almost crude i think i would have enjoyed this book more if read for a course and or book club discussion certainly would have enhanced my reading of this novel having said that despite my low rating there is one chapter that i would have rated as a 4 or 5 how they lived that was an incredibly powerful chapter and very moving it really helped me to see how we often behave as americans i also think that this book would be very deserving of inclusion in any course on african literature","1316":" this was a heart wrenching read though i pushed myself to read 2 3 of it all at once to meet a deadline i would have had to do this even on my own time there was no where to stop comfortably from the moment you meet darling you are endeared to her she is an honest rambunctious and curious ten year old girl who has lived a life of such violence that even the most horrific acts are approached with innocence and an unnerving sense of calm as she grows and learns more about herself her home country and america i felt a severe desire to hug her i needed to make sure she was okay and so i kept reading noviolet bulawayo writes in a stunning voice and with such rawness though i found the book extremely hard to read emotionally i do truly appreciate the bravery that lingers within the pages","1317":"it was interesting but the book is too short and she doesn't dive deep into a lot of issues","1318":"gorgeous u0026amp remarkable i want to read everything about noviolet bulawayo and how she came to make this story really great","1319":"a zimbabwean girl leaves her politically tumultuous country and life in paradise a shanty for the us though she dreamed of a better life there she realises that material wealth also brings in its wake different deprivations the cultural differences between what is valued back home and in her new land erodes identity not only for herself but for the others like her homes names worlds are linked with changing identities","1320":"this book was just so beautifully observed with such poignant slices of childhood at the interstices of the most seriously messed up images of a nationhood and adulthood i kept reading parts aloud to my husband both of us with great lumps in our throats","1321":"what a challenging read a version and a voice of zimbabwe that i had not previously been exposed to and it was uncomfortable and unsettling and wonderful the chapters is america were a little less resonant but the way she describes the experience of being a migrant and especially a scattering of africa were disconcerting true","1322":" although i enjoyed this book overall it did not inspire me and felt quite stilted particularly in the second half the first half of the book in zimbabwe is full of short stories depicting life in a country crippled by corruption this section is particularly well written and comes across as believable with lots of interesting characters however i found the book lost its edge following the move to detroit whilst i loved the exploration of the dislocation these first generation immigrants i thought the characters lost their shine","1323":"pretty good i would love to read her memoir","1324":"this book provides clear and straightforward insight into the experience of children growing up in zimbabwe on a more personal level i resonated with the protagonist's experience of moving to an entirely new context and realizing you can never go back despite your love and nostalgia for where you came from it made me cry so clearly the author did something right","1325":"i read this in two big gulps over two days unprecedented when it often takes me weeks to finish a regular sized novel i've been having a hard time finding interesting books for my no white dudes and preferable queer and or trans and or women of colour reading goals at my small library 3 4 of the fiction is french and so i snatched this up when i saw it being something that i've heard high praise for and then it snatched up my heart and i haven't been able to work on anything i should be doing because i have been reading and now i have that horrible pit in my stomach when a book guts you and i don't know what to do about it bulawayo's characters' voices cut me deep but also held me at arms length lest i lapsed into the pity voyeurism of white north american women cornering children in bathrooms to lament about how horrible it is 'over there' like it fixed me with a talking eye as darling says saying i see you out there listening and just because i'm telling you all this doesn't mean you really know how it is i feel like that is a very personal interpretation on my part as well as a white north american and i can imagine that every reader would engaged with this in really different ways i don't know i just i won't be forgetting this book","1326":"i've been making a bit of a thing over the last couple of years to try and vary my reading i've read more prize nominated books than i used to and i've been trawling literary 'best book' lists this is one such book the reason it appealed to me is the subject matter i don't read a lot of books about other cultures and displacement that's something i want to change it sounded really appealing and the cover's i've seen are beautiful i'm going to have to get the print version of the book so it can sit on my shelf the story is about darling who originally comes from zimbabwe and it's split into two times her childhood in zimbabwe and her teens in america she has a growing narrative voice meaning that it is sometimes hard to understand the earlier chapters and as her language develops with age the prose does too the main drive force of the novel is the idea of escape to another place in zimbabwe she dreams of living in america in america she is nostalgic for home in zimbabwe it's a very subtle and bitter sweet story i can't really comment on how it is like to leave a place you call home i've lived in the same house all my life and when i finally did venture out for university i went to a university half an hour a way from home i've never had that feeling of not belonging to a place for that i'm fortunate but what i got from this book was a little bit of understanding i really empathised with darling and what she felt and went through some parts of the book were horrifying i still can't get over the scene with chimpo's belly it chilled me in terms of an enjoyable read i wouldn't put it up there as a favourite but i have a feeling it has a lot to be gained through rereading it is another book i would like to analyse a little bit more maybe next year i'll read it again","1327":" i've been eyeing noviolet bulawayo's book ever since it was launched early last year the striking name of the book coupled with the catchy name of the author this was book that was screaming to be read finding the first chapter online as a short story that won the cain prize for african writing also helped the funny thing is - i don't own a copy i have gifted it to two people and read the library copy it seems some stories come to me without the book the story starts in zimbabwe reeling under years of colonialism followed by internal instability it's the year the us starts searching for its former ally bin laden the kids of paradise a ghetto somewhere in zimbabwe turn this bit of news into a game 'finding bin laden' to fill their days which were formerly spent being at school as the society fractures bit by bit schools are closed homes destroyed and livelihoods snatched adults become a shadow of themselves and the children think of leaving the country to a better life in america several mentions of 'things falling apart' made me think of chinua achebe darling our ten year old narrator tells us her story she tells us of the adventures which she finds along with the boys quiet stina know it all bastard and talkative godknows and the girls pretty sbho and pregnant chipo as they roam through paradise which is anything but and visit budapest the rich neighbourhood to steal and eat guavas to satiate their gnawing hunger these guavas hang over the durawalls of the richest homes and are too tempting to resist darling and her friends spend what they don't know to be the best years of their life in spite of eleven year old chipo being pregnant the sickness aids running amok no hope of any future except the shimmering mirage of america darling dreams of a comfortable life with her mother's twin aunt fostalina who works in 'destroyedmichygen' as a nurse when she gets there she discovers the cold that she can't stand an america that's not quite what it is made out to be and an ache that she cannot quite get rid of the book is divided into two sections the first one is in zimbabwe and the second in america it's more a mental division rather than a physical one in zimbabwe darling's life is rich even though she does not have any physical comfort at all her mother works in another city and visits rarely and when she does she has boyfriends who spend the night with her in the same bed as her daughter her father is a broken man who couldn't handle their destitution and went to work in south africa but comes back broken in mind and body darling is looked after by mother of bones her grandmother when she gets to america her illusion shatters she gets used to the american way of life one she finds sterile but which she cannot escape for legal reasons our precocious and perceptive narrator's story is in the first person interspersed with the chapters that deal with darling's life are chapters spoken by a multitude of voices in the first person plural they tell a story of a community they tell the story that darling might be too far away or too close to understand i heard a chorus of voices as i read those chapters they function somewhat like the greek chorus which comment on the action on stage repetition and rhythm in these first person plural narratives give a folklore ish feel to the chapters look at them leaving in drives the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves those with nothing are crossing borders those with strength are crossing borders those with ambitions are crossing borders those with loss are crossing borders those in pain are crossing borders... bulawayo 145 and when they asked us where we were from we exchanged glances and smiled with the shyness of child brides they said africa we nodded yes what part of africa we smiled is it that part where vultures wait for famished children to die we smiled where the life expectancy is thirty five years we smiled is it where dissidents shove ak 47s between women's legs we smiled where people run about naked we smiled that part where they massacred each other we smiled... bulawayo 237 the repetition makes each of these chapters seem like a chant a chant of pain loss and suffering the non linear narrative has no neat divisions keeping darling story central there is the broad division - before paradise and after darling's memories her flashbacks her thoughts take us from the insipid present to her intense past with regular frequency the idea of home or homes or homelessness is a running theme in one passage darling talks about the different kinds of homes that people carry around in their head she has two homes - one before paradise and one after before paradise she used to go to school had food on the table and her parents were happy after paradise she has no food five friends and mother of bones her mother has three homes - one after independence from white rule one before paradise and one after her grandmother mother of bones has four homes - one before independence from white rule one after independence from white rule one before paradise and one after darling says one has to listen hard to know the home that each refers to the arc of the story connects several states of homelessness darling loses her physical home first when the men come and destroy her home then she makes paradise a home and that is lost as well when she moves to america in deciding to move she loses the connection to the land - another loss of a home finally in america she creates this imaginary homeland of her memories which towards the end of the book is destroyed when chipo confronts her over a skype call chipo taunts darling about leaving and therefore abandoning zimbabwe her homeland and since she has abandoned it darling can no longer call the country her home when she hears this darling loses all sense of herself and throws the laptop she has been tolerating all kinds of loss but this loss of her mental home i e her homeland zimbabwe is the last thing that can cannot bear this gets me thinking of salman rushdie's imaginary homelands he suggests that we accept the situation of the exile even though it is painful and not try to 'return' to the country which is futile because when we leave we can never come back to the country we have left the state of being in exile can be claimed as a home of sorts holding it altogether is the sparkling language that bulawayo excels at there is nothing like biting into the richness and meatiness of her similes and metaphors they are so unique and striking that i forget the story and concentrate on her language i could read the book again just to be able to bite into that language another time just look at this description 'i look closely at her long hand at the thing she is eating it's flat and the outer part is crusty the top is creamish and looks fluffy and soft and there are coin like things on it a deep pink the color of burn wounds i also see sprinkles of red and green and yellow and finally the brown bumps that look like pimples ' bulawayo 6 'the color of burn wounds' i won't be able to eat another pizza without thinking of this phrase again the entire book is full of startling descriptions like this and which force me to look at my world again and be surprised each time read noviolet bulawayo because she speaks of loss and suffering in such beautiful language and through such sad stories","1328":"we need new namesby noviolet bulawayo4 stars305 pp publication date may 21 2013we need new names by noviolet bulawayo shortlisted for the booker is a simultaneously endearing and heart breaking coming of age story of darling it begins with 10 year old darling and her friends foraging for guavas to sate their hunger in a wealthy area of zimbabwe called budapest these children no longer go to school because their school teachers have all escaped from the country and school has closed so they occupy themselves by finding much needed food and playing invented games like name the country and find bin laden the children are likeable and endearing and the stories of their escapades enjoyable poignant heart breaking moments are added to the mix 11 year old shibo is pregnant and the children attempt to remove her belly because they are afraid she will die if she has the baby darling's father returns from the mines of south africa dying of aids after every few chapters of darling's story is a chapter which tells the story of zimbabwe these are quite powerfully written as can be seen by the beginning of one of those chapters look at them leaving in droves the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves those with nothing are crossing borders those with strength are crossing borders those with ambitions are crossing borders those with hopes are crossing borders those with loss are crossing borders those in pain are crossing borders moving running emigrating going deserting walking quitting flying fleeing--to all over to countries near and far to countries unheard of to countries whose names they cannot pronounce they are leaving in droves i loved this compelling book and do not hesitate to recommend it","1329":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here best chapter on what it is to be an african moved illegally to us how they lived revealing and disturbing","1330":"more like 2 5 stars toe but i rounded up because i liked the africa part","1331":"would really rate 3 5 out of 5 stars","1332":" one enjoyable part about setting yourself the goal of reading all the man booker prize longlist each year is the fact you come across new authors new voices you hear stories from diverse regions of the commonwealth whereas some of the novels may not be as challenging or diverse as some of the selection from the independent foreign fiction prize you still manage to find a few areas of literature that you haven't explored before noviolet bulawayo is a zimbabwean author who moved to michigan when she was eighteen years of age and she is currently s stegner fellow at stanford university in california in 2011 she won the caine prize for african writing and in 2009 she was shortlisted for the south african pen studzinsi award a pretty impressive resume and this is her first novel straight onto the man booker prize longlist our novel is narrated by darling who we follow through the ardour of growing up in zimbabwe and follow to schooling and work in america with the usual themes of displacement not having a homeland being rejected by your adopted country etc this could be classed as standard booker prize fare look at \"the garden of evening mists\" by tan twan eng last year or \"pigeon english\" by stephen kelman the year before or \"half blood blues\" or right back to 1971 and v s naipaul's \"in a free state\" the list of similar themes in endless but the difference here is the story told in zimbabwe where local currency is worthless human life is worthless a country in total decline where locals are taking back the land from the white people for my full review visit my blog at http messybooker blogspot com au","1333":"what i absolutely love about this book i love the first part of the novel where darling and her friends parent themselves and try to live their childhood in the shanty town of paradise i loved the raw and honest narrative as well as the imagery i really did feel like i was part of darling's world and i did get to live out her experiences hear her accent and even got to smell the unique smells of her world i remember in literature class in secondary school reading the poem poetic license \"i have a poetic license i write what i like my commas go where i want \" i think that this poem best describes noviolet's art the writing is bold she is not overly concerned with showing me how well she can write but she is more concerned with conveying an authentic expression i swear to you as a young girl growing up in southern africa i see so much of myself in young darling and her friends minus the shanty town experience in the games they played and in the words they use the american part was not my favorite not because it was not well written but because the first part of the book had that wow factor that i sought of expected throughout the whole book it was however intriguing to see the immigrant's america through darling's eyes i love noviolet the way she approached the immigrant's story was refreshing there was none of that apologizing too much that most africans do before they approach such a topic there was just observations made and a story told which for me was more than enough although this is an amazing novel that is well written i could not help but feel that the author had a lot of issues she needed to raise through her book and i sometimes felt that the issues became more important than the story in which they were being told and that made me feel at times like i was taking a break from the novel to read more on the issues at some point there was aids then the chinese who are taking over africa political violence displacement poverty etc which i thought was way too much crammed into two hundred and ninety some pages but do not worry because all this is told with such beautiful words like pictures and a great sense of humor i think we have moved from \"should africans really have to write about poverty aids political instability and so on for their works of art to be considered authentic and to be celebrated\" to just embracing the fact that some africans do tell that african story really well if you haven't read this novel yet i say to you you are really cheating yourself out of one of the greatest pieces of art to come out of africa it was not the greatest book i have ever read but it was by far the most original and daring piece of literature i have read in a while","1334":" liked the voice of darling the young zimbabwean child who finds herself and family suddenly homeless after their suburb is destroyed by the government her description of her life in the shanty town paradise is evocative funny poignant and real she and her friends jump off the page however the second half of the novel in america whilst raising many issues facing refugees has none of the energy of the early sections it dragged there was little cohesion overall worth reading but many weaknesses","1335":" let me make this clear despite what the goodreads four star rating says i did not like this book at all in fact i'm quite glad to be done with it and will be delighted never to read it again and the copy editor in me went nuts over the fact that none of the dialogue has quotation marks at all maddening but it got four stars from me because i absolutely respect it it's like my reaction to freedom i hated that book immensely but it pushed me to feel and think and grow in new ways when a book does that it deserves high ratings because that's what books are supposed to do sometimes bulawayo weaves a complicated series of what feels like disconnected essays surrounding the growing up process of darling first a child in zimbabwe and then a teen and young adult in america her bluntness is hard to take i will never stop being livid about the scene with the possessed woman in the hilltop church of the incredibly false prophet revelations bitchington mbarro but absolutely appropriate to the lack of subtlety children have bulawayo's writing style changes as darling grows and picks up more americanized english which is a difficult thing to do as a writer applause for that and also for her tumbling vistas of prose that ache in all the places of the soul connected to home and belonging this book made me want to write and that is much of what i can ever ask of a book it also made me angry it made me angry at bastard and his arrogance it made me angry at the fools who tore the white couple out of their house simply because they were white it made me angry at the way a lot of white people treat africa as a conglomerated missionary theme park this lost continent we conveniently forget is lost because europe's masses stomped out its way home it made me angry that these type of white folk overshadowed the white folk who actually do see the people they're trying to help and that some people are working with rather than for it made me angry that the one halfway sympathetic white character darling's boss's anorexic daughter is made to be nothing because not eating is utter foolishness to a woman who knows true starvation as though either is more severe than the other instead of both being brokennesses that tear out the human heart i really appreciated bulawayo's honesty in giving her characters space america is not everything darling had hoped for because no country is the perfect place you dream of her friends back in zimbabwe have little patience for her as she becomes more americanized darling gets caught in between the two countries neither of one nor the other one of the other hard parts for me was that the book was in real places part of it was in zimbabwe but the american part was in michigan i've lived in michigan in kalamazoo in fact so i knew the things darling was referencing but her city was not my city partly because we were there at different times but also because we saw it with very different eyes and fiction is harder to skirt around i find when parts of it are real and filled with your own memories and stories it was an intense book it made me uncomfortable and unhappy and indignant but it also pushed me to see new things to hear a new voice that rattled up my own it engaged me not positively most of the time but fully i can't recommend it as a fun read or a perfect one but i can recommend it as an important one","1336":"i love the way it's written and the amazing way that the protagonist sees the world i only gave this a three star rather than a four because the story and characters just didn't move me i didn't feel them","1337":"it's weird how the books i read consecutively seem to have themes a while ago it was twins now i've got immigrants speaking in the first person plural it's only a chapter here but it was still a weird overlap this was a more unusual take on the immigrant experience book though because it gave you a picture of the character's life in africa before immigration and then there was her totally different way to look at snow might be worth reading for that alone if you're in the mood for a depressing read","1338":"bulawayo uses gorgeous powerful language and a wonderfully executed childs eye view of zimbabwe under the harsh rule of mugabwe to introduce the reader to the life of darling a girl of 10 living in a shantytown called paradise the second half of the novel takes place in the united states where teenage darling has gone to live with her aunt fostalina darling's longing to belong is heartrending the novel gracefully and deeply makes you think of notions of home what it means to be far from the place you were born and raised and what you give up by relocating the title we need new names refers to a game played by darling and her young friends but can of course be seen as a metaphor for immigrants' loss of identity the fraught ties to one's home country especially a home country where friends and family left behind suffer is beautifully explored in a nuanced thoughtful way darling is unhappy in america but she is unhappy about the conditions in zimbabwe she feels bad for those still there but is told that it's no longer her country beautifully put by her friend on a skype call it's the wound that knows the texture of the pain nothing in darling's life is easy there are no easy answers to anything bulawayao is a marvellous writer and beautifully and honestly tells a sad moving complicated story of immigration and alienation that i think will stay with me in the way that very good books do","1339":" on the surface this is the story of a zimbabwean girl who moves from an african slum where she runs free with her small gang of friends to kalamazoo michigan where she struggles to adjust to life in the us but this book is much more than a story of an immigrant it is a symphony bulawayo's words are so lyrically musical you can hear them in your head like a symphony there are great shouts of musical joy followed by movements of reflection and calm before the storm when there are cymbals crashing and tympanis banging and the low brass plays cries of anguish before moving into the next movement of poignant longing and darling's deep and terrible longing for home is painful her observations of how america has changed those around her without ever realizing it has changed her until a friend from her childhood pack points it out devastating darling i was moved by the ideas and the story but ultimately most moved by the music with which this story was told near the end the novel suddenly switched to a plural narrator speaking as the voice of all immigrants i felt this was the weakest section as it tried to generalize something too deeply and it ended up sounding discordant because it could not convey the story of all immigrants honestly it's not the normal cold that you could just complain about and then move on to other things no this cold is not like that it's the cold to stop life to cut you open and blaze your bones","1340":" this book has haunted me since i finished it the author used wonderfully descriptive languagewhen telling of her childhood living in a shanty town paradise after tehywere evicted from their original homes it hits very close to the bone when she describes how they plan an abortion on one of their friends using a coat hanger the scary part about it is that this happens in real life her shame when her father comes home sick and she can't tell anyone why she can't come and play their country game where they dream of living in another country america being the most valued then the awfulness of her life when she does get to america where she is neither fish nor fowl she isn't american yet she is no longer a zimbabwean she hates the people in america who generalise when they talk about the terrible things that are happening in africa but feels so alienated when in a phone call home she is accused of running away from her country if it's your country you have to love it live in it and not leave it you have to fight for it no matter what prophetic words","1341":"3 starsthe writing was something else the first 50% that deals with darling and her friends bastard godknows bornfree etc was amazing i absolutely loved it and i think if you have a connection with zimbabwe or africa you will probably like me have a deeper connection to the story i saw a lot of hidden meaning in what these kids saw told and played they run wild every day in their shanty town stealing guavas from the rich houses playing games like find bin laden with no idea what th 3  1\/2  starsthe writing was something else the first 50% that deals with darling and her friends bastard godknows bornfree etc was amazing i absolutely loved it and i think if you have a connection with zimbabwe or africa you will probably like me have a deeper connection to the story i saw a lot of hidden meaning in what these kids saw told and played they run wild every day in their shanty town stealing guavas from the rich houses playing games like find bin laden with no idea what that means and making a general nuisance of themselves everywhere the neglectful adults are too busy searching for work in the mines and the borders to spare time for the children and because the voice of darling is so strong and matter of fact the neglect and abuse some of these kids experienced creeped up on you with no warning i also think there was a gentle poking of fun at western help for zimbabwe i am not saying the help is unappreciated i am only saying that sometimes western countries do not always understand what really is needed in struggling 3rd world countries i want to address something that seems to have come up in a lot of negative reviews and that is the perception that the author deliberately wanted to portray americans as ignorant and stupid i think that the author did a sterling job balancing both sides showing the unrealistic expectations of darling representing all immigrants of the land of plenty that america is and the american people's ignorance about what really matters to an immigrant why their yardstick for prosperity is not the same as that of a child of africa the storyline once darling has emigrated to america was still good and at times very funny yet some of the magic was left behind on african soil interspersed throughout the 2nd half of the book were chapters that speak in the collective voice of immigrants and these sections were gutpunchingly powerful at birger king we worshiped the whopper at kfc we mauled bucket chicken we ate for our past hunger for our parents and brothers and sisters and relatives who were still stuck back there we uttered their names between mouthfuls conjured up their hungry faces and chapped lips...if only our country could see us in america see us eat like kings in a land that was not ours...... and the jobs we worked jesus - jesus the jobs we worked low paying jobs backbreaking jobs jobs that gnawed at the bones of our dignity devoured the meat tongued the marrow we took scalding irons and ironed our pride flat the author dropped the ball a bit during the last 15% of the book but as this is her debut novel i can't wait to see how her writing matures because she has undeniable talent more","1342":"super easy quick read fascinating to see the upheaval in zimbabwe from a child's perspective immigration to the us and dealing with a new culture how to be a part of both the old and the new or perhaps not succeeding at doing so in either are always interesting to me the ending was not very satisfying however it just stops but not a seemingly natural breaking point","1343":" i wanted to love this book and ended up liking it for the author's memorable phrases and the names of darling's band of pals the pacing threw me off why did the book spend so much time in zimbabwe which was much more interesting than the us chapters without much of a transition to darling's new noncountry then in the us i kept waiting for something significant to happen and got internet porn and then the ending is an anecdote an ending destroyedmichigan this food is an insult to my teeth brings up really important information about immigration sorry for the random review could be a good book club book needs to be discussed","1344":" despite the absence of quotation marks why noviolet bulawayo's novel we need new names is wonderfully compelling and engrossing in the first half of the novel we are introduced to darling and her friends in zimbabwe in south africa and through her eyes we are presented her childhood that is both horrific with violence and hunger but also because she is just a child playful and full of adventures darling's narrative voice is unique and refreshing showcasing bulawayo's extensive writing skills the second half of the novel follows darling to america to live with her aunt fostalina in destroyedmichygen detroit here is where the reader sees the familiar through the eyes of a stranger here is where we learn about parts of our own country sub cultures in our own neighborhoods that we don't know about if we are not recent immigrants ourselves we experience darling's assimilation as she goes from climbing trees to steal guavas to texting her friends and trying on clothes at the mall bulawayo is a gifted writer her prose is lyrical musical and the story she has to tell is important i was glad to read that she is working on a new novel","1345":"oh my goodness an outstanding example of excellent writing i am holding back from immediately rereading this book i absolutely loved it and i am in awe of the author's use of language what talent i am so happy to end my year's reading on such a high note","1346":"excellent first novel about darling's immigration from zimbabwe as a child to detroit","1347":"\"then we are rushing then we are running then we are running and laughing and laughing and laughing \" backcover of we need new names the truth comes from the mouths of babes is what kept coming to mind as i was reading this captivating story we need new names struck me at first with much sadness shock and horror but most of all it sparked my interest to learn more about the history of zimbabwe the main character darling narrates the hardship of her life in zimbabwe with the language of a child everything we learn in the first 60 pages of the book is recounted simply and directly it almost makes things feel even stronger and terrible coming from her in such an innocent way there are moments when the tension is so potent that i found myself squirming in my seat dreading what was coming next go to the following link for the rest of the review http didibooksenglish wordpress com","1348":"i did not love this book i found the language unique but at times difficult to follow i also did not like the way the story ended there were parts of this book that i could relate to and that made me realize how lucky i am that my parents were able to come from uganda and make a good life for my sisters and i overall i am not sure i would recommend this book","1349":"i'm sure it's a fantastic book but i didn't manage to get interested in the characters' lives i read a review on the guardian that sums up what i think she tries to show too many of the current problems that poor african young people face and it makes it somehow less powerful there's aids rape death war pooverty all at once i think i would have managed better if the book chose one of these topics mainly and focused on it because they are all so important but to be fair the book also has its charm it's colourful full of humour and i think many people would like it but i didn't","1350":"an eye opening story the main character is a child growing up in a changed for the worse zimbabwe who highlights her life growing up there and as an illegal immigrant in america there is a chapter near the end that outlines the immigrant experience and left me feeling deep emotions of anger sorrow and a general of uneasiness in my bones the book doesn't sugarcoat anything but it's also not graphic with details that could be gory everything isn't left tied up in a neat bow either it's a very real read","1351":" the second part of the novel spoke to me on a deeply personal level it felt like an ode to immigrants it succinctly described what immigrants feel well this particular immigrant of being torn between two countries the homeland and this new land of having opposing ideals and realities of realizing that the grass is never quite greener on the other side and that you give and sacrifice more than you will ever receive that a sense of contentment will never be fully achieved that for the rest of your life you will be in a state of confusion whether you stop paying attention to it or not that nothing will ever be the same that you can't go back to the time when you weren't here that you will just have to live with your decision until you die that this is home now and there is nothing you can go back to that you wouldn't even want to go back anymore and pretty much like every other identity you'll never fully understand how an immigrant feels unless you are one","1352":" i won my copy from goodreads i liked this book i wanted to love it and i've never read anything quite like it but parts of it flummoxed me enough that there was a frustration that kept me from loving it i would probably lean more towards 3 5 stars though instead of 3 darling will stay with me a long time as will a few different parts of this book her view of my world destroyedmichygen was fascinating and telling her calm view of her own world back home was cold no nonsense and unemotional and very very grown up an old soul in a child's body i wanted to know her i wanted to help her although she no doubt would not have wanted any help let alone mine this book will win accolades and acclaim as well it should i look forward to reading more from noviolet bulawayo","1353":"the ideas were great and bulawayo makes some good points about being an immigrant as an immigrant myself i agreed with her take on speaking english in an anglo saxon country even though all my schooling was in north america and i can barely speak my first language i still get a lot of condescending mildly xenophobic comments i also liked how she portrayed what it is like to come to a rich country and how family back home misunderstands what a step backwards an immigrant takes in their new country generally it takes the average immigrant ten to fifteen years in the new country to reach a comfortable economic level how many of us from poorer countries have acquaintances and family who suspect we are now instead rich everyone in the book club that assigned this book loved it i wasn't as crazy about the style or the amount of information left out for example the main character was from zimbabwe but this was never mentioned and yet as bulawayo stated that this book could be representative of many immigrants' experience there are many instances where it seems specifically zimbabwean ps there was a character called prophet revelations bitchington mborro a mean character with an apt name","1354":" the book was structured more as a novel in stories than a plain novel most of the chapters read as short stories i've previously read one of the chapters stories and liked it but i wasn't really feeling this book at all all of the characters including darling seemed to be in service to the story i was not able to connect with any of them for longer than a portion of a chapter story i think this is where the book structure was a drawback i saw darling and her friends and family in different situations each chapter story but overall story arc was weak the messaging was so heavy handed and repetitious another drawback of book structure the us is about consumerism materialism exceptionalism ignorance superficiality and when people immigrate to the us the work hard at dirty jobs in zimbabwe there are shady ngos shady religious leaders shady men in your family and political instability just exacerbates all this shadiness so many good critiques but i don't think it was well executed and thus distracting from the beautiful writing relatedly the child's voice was not convincing to me...this book was recommended to me as a way to learn about good sentence structure in writing it was a good recommendation on that basis even with all my misgivings about this novel i still believe in noviolet i'm looking forward to whatever she produces after this","1355":"there has been considerable mostly friendly disagreement about this book among members of an fb reading group to which i belong many hold it to be more than worthy of its man booker shortlisting others are unimpressed one criticism has been that it's as if the author wrote with a checklist of african 'issues' ticking as she went poverty despotic leaders aids however some these things are often linked and can easily impinge on a single life and not necessarily only an african life we meet darling as a young child in zimbabwe and part company with her several years on in the us there has also been discussion as to which half of the story loses readers the african chapters or those set in the us i found the contrast telling the zim chapters pulse with life often wrenching and always vibrant darling's life in the us and her homesickness are poignant western lack of understanding of africa many seeing the continent as a single country is illustrated here and together with darling's inability to empathise with an anorexic american girl this book says everything about the huge divide between the worlds portrayed here the book's opening chapter hitting budapest was the short story that won the 2011 caine prize in fact every chapter here could stand alone as a short story in this way the book is essentially a series of scenes from darling's life original and moving","1356":"1 2 for fans of chimamanda ngozi adichie teju cole and other writers of african descent powerful immigrant story about the call of america and the call of home","1357":"i enjoyed the honesty of the main character darling it captures the childhood in a typical african slum and the children's free spirit it broke my heart about darlings father dying and chipo's pregnancy at 11 years but then this is the very thing that happens in a normal slum 'the ngo people ' who came to help but did not want to be touched it was a good read i wish it told more about life in america","1358":"if it wasn't for book club and being stuck on a plane with the book i don't know that i would have finished this one","1359":"if you love immigrant stories if you love stories about fearless joyful children who refuse to be intimidated by abject poverty and war or if you just love a tale of resilience and adaptability then you will love this novel like all good reads it makes you want to know more about the non fiction version of events civil war in zimbabwe i listened to the audio version and the voice actor was one of the best i ever listened to","1360":" another book that should enter the cannon of must read for humans and general literature courses and or freshman reading requirements the perspective of a ten year old girl who ages throughout the book on her life in a slum in zimbabwe and her later life in the us are breathtaking and the insights that unique perspective offers are invaluable the raw data she provides through the eyes of a child and her child like interpretations of things help us to experience the bewilderment of the experiences better than any other pov or genre for that matter could have i found particularly important her chapters that dealt with dashed hope voting change as well as with ngo culture i loved the entire work and can't wait to read anything else bulawayo puts out","1361":" this book has one of the most original narrators i've encountered in a long time her description of growing up in a shantytown in zimbabwe is amazing though sometimes disturbing and based on the author blurb i'm guessing it is somewhat autobiographical as a young teen the author and the main character moved to join family in michigan and her insights into the african ex pat community were pretty interesting too i had a hard time putting this down this may be the best novel i've read this year","1362":"sadly not for me i gave up just before the first half of the book may come back to it sometime","1363":"the first section of the book while sometimes slow had me wondering what interesting stories could be told from the perspectives of the people in the protagonist's life this was not something i tend to think about when reading a novel and it tickled me the latter section of the book brought the narrative into bracing focus i raced to finish the book awash in bittersweet affection for darling incredibly curious to see what unfolded for her she felt very real","1364":"i thought it was fresh and eye opening and heart breaking i enjoyed it very much","1365":"okay i enjoyed the first half of the book with tales of being 10 in a small village in zimbabwe which the author never names as the home country but it is excruciatingly obvious so why not name it hmmm there are some funny friends with names like godknows and bastard and some horrible scenes of white folks being victimized and black people too then the book heads to the us a la americanah yet the narrator is younger at 13 and it all seems completely banal and stereotypical immigrant doesn't fit in misses home then realizes home is not home and new home is not home either i bought this one because it is a nyt notable book for 2013 not totally in agreement actually and hated the final scene","1366":"worthy booker longlisted but i don't think it'll win a good read though","1367":"the book is written beautifully and is a celebration of the resilience of children in difficult circumstances while at the same time a melancholy reflection about the challenges of life in unstable countries and the difficulties of starting over in new places","1368":"every person who has an opinion on american immigration should read this beautiful poignant book read the entire thing so that when you get to the chapter how they lived near the end of the book you can truly empathize","1369":" this was an incredible novel i found it very hard to put down and it has popped into my head even in the days since i finished it it was very difficult to decide whether to give it 4 or 5 stars but i ended up with a 4 for one very notable reason it does not read like a single book it features two distinctly different parts of the protagonist's life and each part tackles very different issues either story on their own would be more than deserving of 5 stars but the progression from one part to the other is not as smooth as it could be","1370":"lovely book thoroughly recommended especially for anyone who wants to get a feel for a country","1371":"this is perhaps the best book i've read in a long time it is beautiful heartbreaking hilarious and true the zimbabwe and america that bulawayo describes here is as honest as it is engaging i didn't want the book to end and am hoping my husband will use it as a text in his africa and communication class","1372":"there are passages in this book that should be cut and pasted onto every hate filled facebook page twitter feed media outlet that spews poison into the world in the hope that somebody out there will stop and think about the people on the other side of their xenophobia","1373":"beautifully written and descriptive novel immigration is always much tougher than you can ever imagine and we see this again in this book","1374":" really interesting and moving book the upheavals in zimbabwe's recent history and its effect on normal people the book is to a large part told from the view of a young girl living in a ghetto due to mugabe's brutality to its own people she tells of her friends her environment the adults in her life and you learn to appreciate how hard it is for people to survive there are parts like when the group of children decide to help their 12 year old friend who has been raped by her own grandfather to get rid of her stomach to save her from a possible death from childbirth the second part is when the girl is older and tries to come to terms with living in america felt the second part whilst really interesting and well done in part just didn't quite have the same impact very good first book for an author who is very promising","1375":"both hilarious and heartbreaking great voice","1376":"this book grew on me as i read it a moving telling of a tale of immigration from zimbabwe to the u s through the voice of a young woman from ten years old through the next ten years or so a very intelligent voice for whom i felt enormous empathy and liking","1377":"enjoyed the first part but the part staged in the usa get's a little boring","1378":" those who leave cannot return they have travelled too far those who leave will not return they have lost who they were look at them leaving in droves the children of the land just look at them leaving in droves those with nothing are crossing borders those with strength are crossing borders those with hopes are crossing borders those with loss are crossing borders those in pain are crossing borders moving running emigrating going deserting walking quitting flying fleeing to all over to countries near and far to countries unheard of to countries whose names they cannot pronounce they are leaving in droves when things fall apart the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky they flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified iinforeign lands their tears wiped away in strange lands the wounds of their despair bandaged in foreign lands their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands look at them leaving in droves despite knowing they will be welcomed with restraint in those strange lands because they do not belong knowing they will have to sit on one buttock because they must not sit comfortably lest they be asked to rise and leave knowing they will speak in dampened whispers because they must not let their voices drown those of the owners of the land knowing they will have to walk on their toes because they must not leave footprints on the new earth lest they be mistaken for those who want to claim the land as theirs look at them leaving in droves arm in arm with loss and lost look at them leaving in droves","1379":"this one was a little bit strange just in terms of the style but it was intensely enjoyable and i really think it's worth reading","1380":"i didn't care for the second half set in the us as much as the vibrancy of the first half","1381":" a very credible first novel for the author noviolet bulawayo the first half of the novel takes place in zimbabwe well after independence and deals with a group of street kids centering on one girl in particular named darling wandering about the town looking for food and things to do since life doesn't really offer all that much of either school is no longer an option and life is very precarious at best for these kids living in a shanty town after being pushed out of their houses by the local authorities parents are powerless and largely absent from the story line it's a pretty grim picture but it certainly feels quite honest enough you get a pretty gritty look at life in zimbabwe for those not allied with mugabe including an incident with a white middle class family suddenly pushed out of their house as well later a primarily european ngo comes around the area dropping off a few toys and clothes solving nothing in particular somehow or another darling manages to do to visit relatives in the detroit area and becomes yet another african in more or less permanent exile from the homeland for me it's such a twist that the book feels more like two almost unconnected stories the transition doesn't really flow but there are lots of interesting moments in america as well so it retains interest the book is well worth reading although it may take a little effort to get past the first chapter or two but keep an eye out for this author in the future","1382":" noviolet bulawayo is an ambitious fearless writer we need new names begins with a small group of near feral children in the economic wasteland of robert mugabe's zimbabwe the members of that group chipo sbho stina and the exquisitely named bastard godknows and darling the narrator confront everything death racism brutal poverty absent or inept parenting predatory religion aids sex and they do so more or less together bulawayo is too much of a realist to fall into any of the traps of adults writing about children they are neither little saints defending each other against the predatory world nor african versions of the boys in lord of the flies and above all they are never adults in adolescent bodies bulawayo is disciplined the zimbabwean sections are all the more harrowing because they come from the narrow not very articulate voice of a young girl bulawayo indulges herself with a few lyrical departures that are written strictly from an authorial perspective and i suppose their eloquence is necessary to leaven the raw narrative that surrounds them darling leaves zimbabwe courtesy of an aunt settled in detroit but her new land is not a promised one detroit presents moral social spiritual and economic quandaries of its own if at better and more consistent pay in exchange for leaving her continent darling leaves behind the support of the members of her group and chipo makes clear her identity as a zimbabwean and her home bulawayo is too smart a writer to make the immigrant story one of salvation or to romanticize the past as better than a present that is also bleak just in different ways detroit is not better or worse than zimbabwe it is better and worse","1383":"in america the fatness is not the fatness i was used to at home over there the fatness was of bigness just ordinary fatness you could understand because it meant the person ate well fatness you could even envy it was fatness that did not interfere with the body a neck was still a neck a stomach a stomach an arm an arm a buttock a buttock but this american fatness takes it to a whole 'nother level the body is turned into something else the neck becomes a thigh the stomach becomes an anthill an arm a thing a buttock a i don't even know what","1384":"beautiful horrifying funny thoughtful story of a poor ten year old girl in zimbabwe and then a few years later as an immigrant teenager in michigan great first novel i'm waiting for her next work","1385":"this was one of those books that i struggled to finish not necessarily because it was a bad book but just because it was so strange for me but on reflection i think the author was trying to convey the strangeness of moving to another land another country another language some of the writing is beautiful for me chapter 16 was the best and contained powerful writing e g and when these words tumbled from their lips like crushed bricks or when we spoke our voices came out bruised when we talked our tongues thrashed madly in our mouths staggered like drunken men when we were alone we summoned the horses of our languages and mounted their backs and galloped past skyscrapers wonderful stuff","1386":"don't look for a comforting story of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps in noviolet bulawayo's debut novel we need new names writing about the political chaos destroying lives in her native zimbabwe bulawayo pulls no punches and spares no horror one of the children who witness zimbabwe's poverty darling nonkululeko nkala whose last name is not written until the very last chapter manages to go to america because she has an aunt there she's no longer hungry enough to steal guavas from budapest but america is far from perfect the novel is comprised of a series of episodes rather than a sustained narrative darling witnesses a horrifying exorcism helps her eleven year old friend abort her child visits the site of a chinese building project looking for freebies gets food from an ngo and both witnesses and enacts the lynching of white zimbabweans--all in separate chapters then she goes to america throws away her amulet weapons deals with her ghanaian uncle in law and his son learns to watch porn learns not to discipline american children makes friends works a poverty level dead end job calls home--all in separate chapters there is a narrative arc in that darling's story is more or less chronological at \"home\"--the shantytown in zimbabwe her parents were displaced to--she's lost because she's young and hungry and lacking leadership from the shattered adults of zimbabwe in her new home destroyedmichygen she's lost because america is not her home and never really will be the great strength of we need new names is the short interspersed chapters in which the whole community speaks what's in their hearts they are a reminder of the oral literature tradition of southeast africa you may have seen examples of this before in alan paton's lyrical cry the beloved country a quotation and when they asked us where we were from we exchanged glances and smiled with the shyness of child brides they said africa we nodded yes what part of africa we smiled is it that part where vultures wait for famished children to die we smiled where the life expectancy is thirty five years we smiled is it there where dissidents shove ak 47s between women's legs we smiled where people run about naked we smiled that part there they massacred each other we smiled is it where the president rigged the election and people were tortured and killed and a whole bunch of them put in prison and all there where they are dying of cholera--oh my god yes we've seen your country it's been on the news and when these words tumbled from their lips like crushed bricks we exchanged glances again and the water in our eyes broke our smiles melted like dying shadows and we wept wept for our blessed wretched country we wept and wept and they pitied us and said it's okay--it's okay you are in america now and still we wept and wept and wept and they gave us soft little thingies and said here is some kleenex here and we took the soft thingies and put them in our pockets to look at later and we wept still wept like widows wept like orphans","1387":"this book heavily focuses on belonging and fitting in the narrative is great and i enjoyed the bit in africa but after that it got a little monotonous and had a few too many characters","1388":" a great new writer and one who i feel really captured the feelings of alienation that go with living in a foreign country which in this case is a young girl from a slum in zimbabwe who moves to michigan to live with an aunt after her country is devastated by war and instability in this case i feel that the whole was not as great as the sum of the parts as it were while the story was good it was a few really incisive scenes that struck a chord a priest rapes a woman as part of an exorcism ngo workers come to deliver toys and food to the slum a mob motivated by anti colonialism attacks a white african family","1389":"stunning journey from africa to america i was totally transfixed by this book","1390":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i loved this book i am so glad it's the summer because i had time to read this book in a little over a day the first part is the story of a ten year old girl living in poverty in zimbabwe with her friends she lives in a shantytown they call paradise which is made up of tin shacks no running water very little food she hasn't always lived there previously she and her friends lived in nice houses and went to school before zimbabwe gained its independence and the families were forced ou i loved this book i am so glad it's the summer because i had time to read this book in a little over a day the first part is the story of a ten year old girl living in poverty in zimbabwe with her friends she lives in a shantytown they call paradise which is made up of tin shacks no running water very little food she hasn't always lived there previously she and her friends lived in nice houses and went to school before zimbabwe gained its independence and the families were forced out of their homes and neighborhoods and into shantytowns the adults voted and expected change to come but nothing changed darling invents games with her friends and is feisty and dream of going to america to become a doctor or a well educated young woman eventually she does move to the united states lives with an aunt and uncle working minimum wages jobs for salaries that seem high by the shantytown population but are really low for living in detroit the apartment they live in is dim and ugly not the beautiful house she had dreamed about and she is tired all the time she does not meet any white people because detroit is primarily black and the people with whom she works are also black she hates the weather there and says that the sky is not pretty like it is at home where it is blue almost all the time then when she wants to make a visit home her aunt tells her that she cannot she is in the us on a visitors' permit and if she leaves she will not be able to return so in zimbabwe she had fun sun but no work no food no school in detroit and then in kalamazoo she has work money a room of her own goes to school sends money home and dreams of being back in zimbabwe and the people back home do not understand why she does not return to visit they continue to think that everyone in america is rich lives in beautiful houses wear beautiful clothes darling does not tell them that none of that is true instead she listens to their dreams and sends money home she sorts bottles and cans at the local supermarket cleans houses and helps her aunt with a crazy uncle then she gets married has children gives them american names and they have no understanding of what life was like back in zimbabwe these children are completely american and they think their parents are odd and old fashioned noviolet bulawayo writes beautifully so that even though the reader is reading about total poverty in zimbabwe and depression in detroit her writing is so lyrical and beautiful that she makes it all sound lovely this was and is a mesmerizing book and made me realize that i know next to nothing about african countries their politics and their lives it made me want to know more this is a beautiful book and a cautionary tale about illegal immigrants and low paying jobs and then assimilation more","1391":" i enjoyed this novel set in zimbabwe it follows darling and her gang of friends living in the shantytown no longer living in their first homes and no longer going to school they try to make sense of their lives through play darling's life is upended when she moves to michigan and adapts to life in america the chapters don't flow seamlessly and i sometimes felt like each chapter could stand as a short story especially strong was how they lived which the novel changes from first person to third person plural we a promising new writer to follow","1392":"a beautiful story and protagonist darling weaves a compelling story of her life experiences in post colonial zimbabwe and starting a new life in detroit mi a timeless and borderless story of immigration and what it means to find home","1393":" darling is a wonderful character she grows up in zimbabwe with her friends all with hilarious names like bastard and chipo she's so matter of fact about the family's poverty in a pure child's way her father is in south africa and only returns with aids the children frequently visit fancier parts of town i e white and steal guavas she moves to the u s michigan to live with her aunt and grows up there her entire family circle in the u s are living there on expired travel visas so they can't go home to visit because entry back into the u s is prohibited bulawayo draws a wonderful picture of how a person can be betwixt and between darling feels zimbabwean and misses her country but her friends at home don't see her as one of them any more either she belongs to both countries or to neither there is no sense by those left in africa that americans are anything but rich even though as illegal immigrants their options are limited and money is always short","1394":" 5 stars to the first portion in africa where the late childhood experiences of the narrator are the most interesting blend of terrible and funny brutally honest and very warm in the way only childhood early adolescence can be the second half america i didn't love as much not as much warmth and lots of time being covered well written and but much less hopeful in tone however an emphatic 5 stars to the portion in the second half written in plural that was something like ginsburg's howl for immigrants and also something like whitman amazing prose poetry","1395":"having been to villages in africa similar to what the author describes gave me more interest in this book than just wanting to read about her experiences i really liked it for her writing style as much as the substance it's well written i am anxious to see what her next book will be about","1396":"amazing couldn't put it down what an incredible voice highly recommend highly","1397":"i couldn't finish it i just couldn't get into the characters there were odd times where i thought the writing was brilliant but then it didn't carry on at the same level and i ended just losing interest i read it as a member of a book club and it is the first book i couldn't finish","1398":"we dropped our heads because we were no longer people we were now illegals raw searing read the chapter titled how they lived so heartbreakingly describes the undocumented human experience that it brought me to tears","1399":" i thought i was going to love this book and was really looking forward to reading it but sadly it didn't quite live up to my expectations the first half of the book set in zimbabwe was more interesting and gave a vivid account of life and the daily struggles the native people face quite brutal and unsettling at times the second half of the book takes place in the usa and is an account of the trials faced by immigrants the book wasn't hard to read and there were a few times when darling's thoughts resonated with my own i found her description of her father particularly moving later i found myself irritated by the jarring conflict between how she felt for her country of origin as to the usa how her relatives and friends at home felt about her leaving the lack in my opinion of honesty between people who supposedly loved and cared for each other i was also somewhat uncomfortable with her take on kate's anorexia the comparison with never being a famine victim i thought a bit insensitive am i wrong on that possibly i can sort of see the point but it left me thinking hang on a minute that's going a bit far people should read it and it will provoke discussion but ultimately i have a feeling of disappointment","1400":"a different kind of budapest the playful writing style made for a great read","1401":"i was on a very meh streak and this broke it wide open it's got beautiful language fresh metaphors and some very memorable storytelling before the protagonist gets to america when she gets to america it's not as interesting primarily because i live there i really liked traveling to africa also she's rather abruptly in america without a lot of explanation","1402":"noviolet bulawayo writes well she relates in vivid details a childhood in zimbabwe that evokes all the senses and is so intimately descripitive and alive that it has to be autibiographical her novel is about how things falling apart in zimbabwe and then a story of the alientating narrative of migration to the u s as breten bretenbach said when in exile my heart a dying root and this sad story she tells with anger sadness and desperation her novel is gripping and definitely worthwhile being selected as a finalist for the booker but it falls short at the end when it suddenly finishes leaving one feeling like the last few pages were ripped out which i imagine indeed her editor did or perhaps she become too emotionally involved in her story as she relates her family and fellow migrant friend's undoing as they stuggle to fit into what she describes as a sadly lacking american society a very strong novel that indeed has made a literary contribution in that it beautifully and poetically relates in first person an untold narrative of a young girl living in an informal settlement a voice for sure on the margins","1403":"parts of this are 5 star editing","1404":" noviolet bulawayo came to attention with her win for the 2011 caine prize for african writing for her short story hitting budapest that short story detailed the lives of street children in a zimbabwean shantytown we need new names the debut novel from bulawayo expands that short story darling and her friends live in a place called paradise it is a messy sort of place impoverished rural the sort of places that breeds boredom in its children darling and her friends make up games to pass the time - find bin laden for instance - or steal guavas from their neighbours then one day the adult residents of places like paradise and its surrounding shantytowns decide to reclaim their country from the white men that live there too and paradise soon descends into violence violence is omnipresent in the first half of bulawayo's novel the violence is often seen by darling and her friends in brief snapshots - they never truly understand what it is they are seeing - but the reader knows and this lack of knowledge in the children and the knowledge the reader has of what bloodshed is to come gives we need new names some incredibly palm sweating pages especially when a gang of men begin to threaten a family to her credit bulawayo doesn't allow darling to become witness to the sheer brutality that rages but more impressively allows darling and her friends to witness the aftermath in interesting ways they break into the home of the family that have been evicted and undoubtedly murdered where darling answers a telephone call from the missing family's relatives such perspectives shake up bulawayo's novel and allow us another perspective on a story we think we know however just as bulawayo's novel seems to be taking us towards a dark heart in africa darling is whipped away to destroyedmichygan or detroit michigan to everyone else and the characters lives and stories of paradise are forgotten so bulawayo can tell the story of a young girl adrift in a very different unknowable to her country this tears a hole right in the middle of we need new names - and this proves both good and bad for the novel the insights into american culture darling has are often illuminating but her lack of engagement with many of the new characters bulawayo must introduce means that the second half of the novel remains distant to the reader in a way in which paradise never was africa is a huge continent with many problems and sometimes in her novel bulawayo seems like she's throwing everything at the page at once we have racial and political violence childhood pregnancy bodies hanging from trees the spectre of aids darling's father is dying from it street children and incest - and sometimes this overwhelming torrent of 'issues' means that we need new names can read like a playlist of all the big issues on that continent what stops we need new names from falling apart due to this rupture is the sheer verve of bulawayo's prose she is an extremely talented novelist her sentences fizz and pop on the page they crackle with energy it is not all fireworks though for she proves equally adept at creating characters and the friendship between darling and her gang is wonderfully drawn","1405":"i would have given this book 5 stars except the author totally lost her way anyway lost me after darling moves to america the zimbabwe story was captivating i wanted it to continue","1406":"i won this in a goodreads giveaway a truly lovely novel with wonderful themes and great characters","1407":"read and fall in love with the spirit","1408":" i'm ambivalent the writing is good especially the short chapter that is not from darling's perspective talking about what it was like for immigrants like her but i found it to be more of a short story cycle than a novel each chapter is sort of a separate vignette as we move through the life of darling and like a collection of short stories it never really felt like it was going anywhere in particular which is not to say that's bad just not my preference darling felt very detached from the events in her life like she was one of us an outsider looking in at it without any real connection which maybe is intentional showing detachment as a coping strategy for someone who's been through awful things but again i just prefer to be able to connect with my characters more","1409":"noviolet bulawayo does a great job of portraying darling's character as it changes at the beginning she is a child who plays games and innocently goes about her life trying to forget her traumatic memories when she moves to america she starts trying to assimilate herself meticulously perfecting her american accent she neglects her old friends her innocence is ripped from her by her new friends at the end she is stuck between two identities the child who is used to suffering and laughs at those who pamper themselves and a teenager who skips school for the mall and has lost all naivete through the internet this novel is a powerful reminder of the suffering of others and that perspective can change everything","1410":"fantastic read the storytelling is superb and i didn't want this book to end i want to know how darling's life goes right up until she dies that's how good this book is","1411":"brings the violence of civil war into wrenching perspective not just the bombing but the destruction of communities great insight into the process of moving between cultures","1412":" i don't know what to say this book speaks to me on so many levels it's tragic all the way through everything darling goes through in the first half of the book when she is in her home country apart from the attack on the homes of the whites i have seen spoken about or experienced in my time in uganda and while i am not an immigrant like darling i have so many pages marked from the second half of the book of events she experiences and conversations she has that i share as well this book was beautiful i would want anyone who travels to uganda with me to read it as well wow this is a book i will keep","1413":"i have no idea how to review this book so apologies if this is terrible or convoluted this 'novel' grew out of noviolet bulawayo's caine prize winning short story hitting budapest i use 'novel' there because i feel this book is really more a series of connected stories it may be neither here nor there for you as a reader but for me the structure created a strange flow to it quite abrupt at moments 10yo darling is our narrator she and her young friends are navigating a fragile and violent world in zimbabwe their own homes part of a shantytown ironically named 'paradise' they visit 'budapest' a more affluent neighbourhood where they pick guava from trees to fill the hunger in their bellies willing to deal with the digestive consequences the children grasp at memories of before before their homes were destroyed by paramilitary policemen before the school closed before the fathers left for work in other countries some within africa some abroad darling is a wise and observant girl and even though they live with such uncertainty and amid such chaos the kids do have dreams of better lives lives where even a lamborghini reventon might be possible darling has a chance to join her aunt in america so she travels to this new 'home' in search of its famous abundance only to find that her options as an immigrant are perilously few and fitting in is a monumental challenge home and belonging are important ideas in this book darling's place in zimbabwe not really a home any longer creates a rootlessness many people are looking to elsewhere for their futures in america darling also feels out of place and now that she has left zimbabwe she is emotionally homeless in two countries with time and not a lot of it her connections to paradise thin but her american connections are only ever tenuous and her official status as an immigrant is it seems nonexistent noviolet bulawayo i think hits every single socio economic political cultural problem in writing about zimbabwe and africa colonialism aids western world ngos political unrest street children unrelenting poverty and hunger darling's 11yo friend chibo is pregnant raped by her grandfather female genital mutilation also appears it's an overwhelming group of subjects i felt the zimbabwe part of the book was amazing it was vivid and poignant the book lost momentum for me with the shift to america though but i am really having trouble putting my finger on where this went sideways for me i did like the book and i think bulawayo's writing is wonderful i will definitely read more from her i was left curious about whether bulawayo will continue darling's story man this is a mess sorry i will be thinking on this book some more edited to add i forgot to make note of this which is more for my own curiosity to remember this fact bulawayo uses the phrase 'things fall apart' or variations like falling apart fell apart 9 times in this book hard to ignore for me and so things fall apart was often brought to mind i can only assume this was an acknowledgment on bulawayo's part and have yet to find any specific articles where she talks about it #stilllooking","1414":" beautiful powerful and painful prose noviolet bulawayo is a voice to pay attention to she writes a book filled with equal parts of sadness horror laughter hope denial and acceptance the vivid language used allows for staggering scenes that grab the reader's attention and refuse to let go it would have been the easy course for bulawayo to tell the reader what to think and feel by using overly or even mildly sentimental prose she does not do this and the novel reading experience is all the better because of this","1415":" this is probably the best book i've read this year bulawayo writes so exquisitely in hurts her imagery is always both surprising and perfect i too live outside my homeland although mine is much closer and i can easily return when i choose she captures with such clarity the pain of being a foreigner along with the pain of no longer belonging in your homeland one of my favourite scenes is when her aunt tries to order a victoria's secret bra over the phone bulawayo perfectly captures both the hilarity and heartbreak they're so closely tied of having to function day in day out in a language that is not your mother tongue","1416":" the children in the slums of robert mugabe's zimbabwe hustle for food but play street games like children everywhere their names are darling bastard chipo godknows and they live in paradise their games are find bin laden country game there is no school no food fathers are gone abroad to search for work darling's dream is to reach her aunt in the u s in destroyedmichygen this dream comes true but in the details darling finds herself in the american world of poor schools and kids with lots of time on their hands and zimbabwe is very far away the chapter how they lived is a terse description of the immigrant experience in america i found this book to be powerful and at times disturbing and difficult to read each chapter could be read individually in any order as a stand alone piece","1417":"probably a 3 5sometimes a little tedious but often very rewarding good balance of humorous child view vs devastating 3rd world realities i would definitely read more from her","1418":"very thoughtful and illuminating portrayal of the immigrant experience although the narrator makes it clear that her situation doesn't even reflect all africans there are themes that i think many can relate to tough but worth it","1419":"the world was just rough well written but wearing","1420":"didn't like it as well as i'd hoped it was good for slice of life portraits but the lack of story or narrative made it hard for me to connect","1421":"look at the children of the land leaving in droves they will never be the same again because you just cannot be the same once you leave behind who and what you are you just cannot be the same pg 148 i really liked this book but it just left me feeling sad i loved the descriptions of darling's childhood in zimbabwe and her innocent interpretations of the political events it made me wish i had some understanding of the history to put it into context but when she leaves for america it just gets sad and there's no reprieve by the end of the book it certainly communicates the deep sense of loss felt by those who have left their homelands for a better life only to be trapped by that life every effort darling makes to assimilate in america represents another small loss of her home u0026amp family until she doesn't really fit it either world it bothers me that there's no hope offered but maybe that is the point simply to empathize with that type of grief regardless i found it to be a book worth reading","1422":"parts of we need new names deserved ten stars but other parts seemed tedious that so many reviewers have drawn parallels to junot diaz comes as no surprise to me there's no doubt that both authors are quite good at vividly illustrating the immigrant experience but i also tend to find them a little self indulgent both are also well worth reading for the nuggets of literary gold but it often takes a lot of of sifting to find them","1423":"this was a good interesting read","1424":"this is a delightful journey of a 10 year old girl from her home in zimbabwe to michigan usa and it is so much more it offers a glimpse of the sacrifices she must make in order to assimilate to her new life i so much want darling to succeed and to stay connected to the time before a good read","1425":"the setting of the first half of this book is gripping however it's misleading to call the book a novel for my full review in the washington independent review of books click this link http www washingtonindependentrevie","1426":" i am doing something i've never tried before listening to the audio cds while reading the book so i hear the words and read it at the same time this is cool since i see the writing style is not only different but unable to tell when someone is speaking no quotes but while listening to audio i can tell when someone was speaking dialogue and narration the opening is interesting and curious how this book will play out first reading the odd names see why they may need new names bastard stina godknows chipo shbo and darling they are young children that adventure budapest like adults or older teens only between the ages of 9 11 this reads like a biopic memoir and would love to see this on lifetime movies or dvd it relates to the different cultures adaptation between two places america versus africa paradise but the kids always speak of budapest european country this book is creatively uniquely combines american culture as of today and africa as of some things we think we know i loved the audio book read while looking at hardcover book from time to time which made it very enjoyable read otherwise i would've skimmed through it vastly in large amounts at a time leisure read 2014 lfpc book read 2013 adrienna turnerwww dream4more org for dream4more reviews","1427":"very interesting to read this after americanah a childhood in an african village i assume it was in zimbabwe and a real inside view equal parts shocking and yet believable being on the inside of something so different to that which we know the child voice is haunting then being transplanted to america and not able to return yet another perspective never as it has been imagined my full review here at word by word","1428":"such a spectacular work i can't wait to cull various chapters for my students to read i particularly like blak power and destroyedmichygan all the cultural nuance that young readers should and could understand occupy the pages of this text that nuance between being a black american and being an african in america reads with humor as well as biting truth","1429":" i've not read a book written as though someone was casually speaking their language to themselves there are no big words to trouble oneself with as the language is quite simple it's like a child was telling a story the style of writing is new to me especially given the context african writing it is interesting to note that hitherto this book all the african works i have read are quite strict as regards grammar and diction for example conversation is clearly marked with either quotation marks or italics in this book there is none of that however it is not as though you will not know i think it's a brave piece of work noviolet's theme is a very popular african theme exodus in this book she portrays the life of a zimbabwean girl before and after she leaves her native home for the united states of america it's a melodramatic tale that has some very low points some very high points plus some very awkward points it's easy to relate with what she's talking about which gives credence to the term africa is a country as she writes you realise that most african countries share the same history political and cultural context so she might as well be talking about uganda as she talks about zimbabwe noviolet is not shy when it comes to putting one on tension there are two particular parts in the story that made me want to stop reading close my eyes and jump to the next chapter some vivid pictures that were just too in your face to face her descriptions are fresh there is a part where she describes dance it is written so creatively that every word dictates an image that makes you smile when you think about it on reading the acknowledgement i understood that perhaps some of the best told stories are those that are our own lives maybe her characters are invented but you cannot help but think the girl in the story is herself and many others brought together the book without being too sombre or too comic asks the question to the african not living in africa can yo call this home when you do not live here pgyou might wonder why i add this but a thought came to me about the book being put in literature class maybe in zimbabwe or uganda i thought to myself would i be comfortable with the many sexual connotations it is littered with i went through an entire chapter describe a porn site not that i have not been to one and not that many of the reactions expressed in the book were the ones i expressed however in younger hands is this material harmless maybe that's my own insecurities nonetheless we need new names is surely one of the best representations of current african writing","1430":"phew that was a hard one to read very well written interesting narrative voice plenty of opportunity for discussion at book group it definitely affected my mood for a while though","1431":"fundamentally moving and engaging but i felt that the more overt intentions of the author both in constructing darling's voice and placing judgements both in the us and in zimbabwe got in the way of the story","1432":"very interesting book with strengths and weaknesses strengths the writing is good as is the characterisation and it pulls you along i also liked the two contrasting views of zimbabwe the first half from inside and the second half a nostalgic longing and the distortions of non zimbabwean's idea of the country weaknesses i would have liked more or a sense of if not resolution the then a stage having been reached as it was i felt that i just abandoned darling rootless in america the second part in america seemed even more episodic with the chapters feeling more like snapshots rather than a clear sense of plot character development i would read more by this author","1433":"closer to 4 5 this is a story about place and identity and how we are shaped by all of our individual versions of home powerful imagery bulawayo really knows how to paint a picture i found the chapter toward the end in which tshaka zulu sort of takes over as narrator really compelling especially the way he describes the proper way in zimbabwe to mourn the death of a loved one his fear that his soul will be doomed to wander without peace because certain customs won't be upheld by his american children the style is refreshing fluid without being haphazard definitely moving in a direction the chapter names are apt and provide enough set up without giving away the themes i had left the last 5 pages or so for myself to read before leaving for work this morning for some reason i was running late but sat to finish anyway this book lured me in like that","1434":"a bittersweet story about loss hope and belonging it changes pace from the innocence of childhood which is actually where the most bleak incidents occur in the book but are the more bearable because of the child's resilience to the harsh reality of adulthood where the dark and sad plot lines in the book were much harder to cope with as a reader because there is no escape excellent writing but it didn't quite win me over too much in one story perhaps","1435":"delightful witty at times i laughed so hard i was crying","1436":" i'm torn between three and four stars i enjoyed the book more as it went on and perspective became more mature i do like that the author kept the child's pov childlike and not precocious i also really enjoyed what i learned how to dance toyi toyi etc granted these are not explained in the book but i looked them up and i like doing that i am still reflecting on the character's thoughts judgments on americans smiling i'm still thinking on that one however i appreciate any book that pokes a hole in my cognitive dissonance and cultural blinders i read for a book club i think it will be an interesting conversation next week","1437":" darling is a character i will never forget she is young and blunt and has such an interesting view of her world this book starts out with darling and her friends in the daily routine of their lives as children in zimbabwe each child a force of their own the characters in this book are rich and eloquent and funny i had a lot of moments where i burst out laughing the imagery was crisp and noviolet's description of things is absolutely remarkable the book takes a very serious route when darling moves to america and it was tough to see her new reality it is a story that had to be told watching darling yearn for her days on the streets of paradise and budapest with her friends and at the same time accept her life in america a land that will never be hers i love this book so much","1438":"it was a brilliant book it took me back to my childhood days in limpopo south africa i thoroughly enjoyed it","1439":"i really liked this book the story was beautifully written and left me with a lot to think about","1440":"parts of this are fantastic others have criticized the disjointed quality of the novel as a whole i feel it reinforces the theme of not belonging anywhere definitely worth a read","1441":" reading through some of the reviews for this book has really annoyed me i can appreciate a well thought through negative review even if the opinions differ from my own but these just display an incredibly ignorant readership we need new names is not supposed to be a sweet little story with happy characters and happy endings it has been a long time since i have read anything this real so what if you don't like darling or aunt fostalina how many people in real life are truly likable in any case this is not a made up little story the characters might be fictional but nothing in this book is a lie it is not a story that follows a nice meandering road and if that is what you want in a book then this is not what you should be reading more than a concrete novel this book is a collection of stories with a hint of stream of consciousness you won't be spoon fed what happens so maybe you'll need to read up a little about what exactly happened in zimbabwe is that such a trainsmash this book is not written to explain a sequence of events that is easily accessible on the internet and put your pride in your pockets about darling's disdain for america so what should people start pooping rainbows just because they get to live in america it doesn't matter how perfect the country is it is not home and until you have been removed from the country of your blood you will not understand how it is possible to long for a place so marred with poverty and violence truly if you are not willing to have your mind opened don't read this book this review brought to you by the effort not to spew negativity on other people's reviews","1442":"many people say that this book covered too much and that's why they gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 i give it only 4 because i didn't think it covered quite enough i would have liked a little more satisfying ending i also think that in some years it may not be possible to so easily identify what country the main character is from but still i think the characters and the story will stay with me which is what i like most in a book","1443":"one of the best fiction books i've read in a while if you know zimbabwe you will recognize it but in some ways it could be about almost any country in africa","1444":"enlightening about the culture in africa well written i enjoyed reading","1445":"i greatly enjoyed this novel bulawayo's writing is easy and charming which is an extremely difficult feat very interested in reading more from her","1446":"it was super good","1447":" noviolet's beginning started out very strong however when darling moved to destroyedmichygen to live with aunt fostalina the book went downhill she didn't give us information on why her childhood friends were given names like bastard godknows nomoreproblems etc not too many details about how they ended up were revealed which was odd because these were the same kids that shared a tender moment with her father when he was bed ridden and dying from aids although i was disappointed i can use a few excerpts in my 8th grade english class or girls group to address such issues as african american and african relations in america particularly in urban centers and our lack of constructive communication why the king's english doesn't suit urban america foreign initiatives in africa incest the poor quality of products made in foreign countries for american consumption specifically china and the question of why foreigners believe that america is this paradise with no crime poverty or problems and are utterly shocked when they discover it has some of the same problems as back home i recommended this book for my book club but i would not recommend it for mature adults it was an extremely easy read it is possibly suitable for 7th and 8th grade foreign students coping with their new life somewhere in america","1448":" i didn't know what to expect of this book other than i had seen it crop up over and over again on best of lists and recommendation sites i was so pleasantly surprised at the honesty innocence and imagination of this novel i was captivated from the very beginning darling is 10 years old and lives in a slum in zimbabwe she and her friends including her 11 year old pregnant friend no longer go to school because there is no more school instead they steal guavas from the richer folks the help staunch their hunger and generally cause mischief this all happens after their homes were bulldozed and they were left with nothing each child dreams of leaving and darling finally does she moves to michigan to live with her aunt and discovers that the life of an immigrant isn't the idealized life she imagined while she was in zimbabwe she faces a lack of papers inability to pay for school adolescence as a foreigner learning to perfect a new language missing her family trying to lose her accent and americanize herself later it is mind numbing jobs abusive bosses and a desire to do more with herself bulawayo sums up the immigrant experience so well without it ever getting maudlin though some parts are definitely cringe worthy darling's character is created with humor and obvious affection a truly enjoyable read","1449":"i had hoped this ended more differently","1450":"beautifully written and devastating","1451":"wonderful in every way the violent political landscape of zimbabe and the unsettling experiences of being a new comer to america is brilliantly told through the voice of an honest and funny ten year old","1452":"book on my nook which took me a while to get through it was quite a different type of story told from a child's point of view in a country which is never explicitly names but is zimbabwe and then their move to america didn't really enjoy it but it was interesting","1453":"bulawayo writes poetry the conflict of the young girl darling between her ties with zimbabwe and her being a virtual hostage in america her descriptions of zimbabwe the people america are vivid and beautiful i had tears in my eyes most of the book","1454":"we dropped our heads because we were no longer people we were now illegals the chapter titled how they lived really brought this book home for me it shows emigration not so much as a means to freedom but as a sacrifice with wars of its own for the first time i am led to think about the lives of immigrants their struggles as humans who have been labelled as somewhat less than human an illegal","1455":" www readingloves blogspot comwe need new names is an exemplary piece of post colonial fiction but even that understates its personality it eloquently questions how we develop concepts of home when the country we knew is not only far away but unbelievably unfamiliar within a new cultural experience this wonderful strangeness of foreign viewpoints is magnified by the narrators' youth in bulawayo's vibrant debut novel starting in zimbabwe as a young girl darling traverses her territory with street smarts from having experienced too much political upheaval and bloodshed accompanied by her gang of friends that however different their geography would resemble any gang of children anywhere in the world the novel sees her through immigrating to america to a place her friends back home only know as destroyedmichygen where darling believes her life will be full of lamborghinis and kim kardashian despite a landscape marred by decades of post colonial political unrest and aids the novel begins with the camaraderie of darling's friends scavenging for guavas they naively mock foreign affairs and international power structures with their country game aware that countries like the united states or france mean strength to the international community whereas their own country is broken and poor they innocently hope that getting rid of chipo's stomach means she will no longer be pregnant at an age when american children would be attending middle school a pregnancy brought upon her by her own grandfather readers experience the sadness of watching children stealing guavas from neighborhoods where food is thrown away in large quantities political groups destroy an entire community's housing clothing falls apart to the point of no longer being functional and children tend to parents ravaged by aids yet darling's gang perseveres dreaming of sports cars and lady gaga the youthful misunderstandings of english and pop culture bring another layer of wry commentary and linguistic brilliance on the part of bulawayo creating humorous anecdotes amidst despair the problem with english for herself and many africans darling says is that when we talked our tongues thrashed madly in our mouths staggered like drunken men it is when darling moves to detroit to be with her aunt that the pigeoning begins to be buffed out as she learns how out of her depth she is her dreams of hollywood personalities and ipods tempered by snow and gang violence on the streets she dreads relaying the truth of life in america to her mother and friends back home the gap that was once just geography widens with experiences they cannot share with darling as she comes of age in michigan with president obama's campaign and earlier years in office internet pornography and shopping malls yet not even in this new country does she feel that she belongs constantly belittled by strangers whose ignorance of african politics and diversity confuses and alienates darling at a wedding she is needlessly questioned about the state of things in the congo as if being of the african continent make her an emissary of all countries and perhaps worse a young girl would want to chit chat about the violence and chaos that made her virtually a refugee with a total stranger her boss at the grocery store she clerks at during high school joins in with the patronizing talk i know you've seen all sorts of crazy shit over there bulawayo captures the frustration of trying to fit in with great authenticity darling brims with strength and dignity and noviolet bulawayo's debut unfolds intelligently ushering in a youthful perspective on the modern trials that face immigrants coming to america this is a novel that proves that while we may live in a world that seems smaller thanks to skype international phones and enhanced communications we can still be separated by immense barriers and typically have far more to learn from the rest of the world than we may be conscious of thankfully here is a fierce sharp author happy to remind us who i am thrilled to see short listed for the 2013 man booker www readingloves blogspot com","1456":"first of all the actual rating is 3 5 but goodreads won't let me give it half a star so bah to them that aside onwards with the review we need new names tells the story of darling who lives in paradise anything but along with her friends her days are spent playing country game a game i remember playing as a child incidentally find bin laden and stealing guavas from rich houses zimbabwe is undergoing changes however and darling dreams of going to live with her aunt in michigan where everything will be better while the adults reminisce about the struggle to overthrow british rule and hope that the democratic process will bring about change all the while hundreds and thousands of men leaving for south africa in search of work darling and her friends see things differently for them if they can only make it out of paradise to the us to dubai to england everything will turn out okay for darling her wish to make it to detroit michigan does come true but with it comes a new set of challenges the book was shortlisted for the man booker prize 2013 it lost to the luminaries a book i felt didn't really deserve it and the etisalat prize for fiction where it did win and it's not hard to see why it's an emotional tale told through the eyes of a girl who wants what most other people do a better life for herself some of the most harrowing scenes in the book a woman who hung herself as she suffers from hiv aids a group of black revolutionaries attacking a white couple in their home darling's own father come home to die from the sickness are portrayed in exactly the way a child would understand it seems almost too real and bulawayo has captured that innocence perfectly darling is hopeful not naive the latter half of the book follows her in the us her attempts to integrated and find a place for herself while also keeping hold of her ties to zimbabwe to me this is where the book truly shines if the first part sets the scene and places darling firmly in her society a society of inequality and ngos full of white people who feel some t shirts and toys are a replacement for better food and healthcare the latter part deals with the immigrant view the feeling of never truly belonging of always being apart from others the fear of legislation turning against you but also the longing and loneliness for darling like for millions of others like her it is the fear of never being able to return home because she would never be let back into the us but also of being found out and deported i myself have immigrated albeit legally without fear of prosecution and with the support of my family and i can understand the fear of never returning or having to return due to things outside your control like the uk voting to leave the eu i can also understand that idealism that somewhere life will be better just because and that you will find happiness in another land it took me a long time to realise that i have to work for that happiness and that things aren't always that easy i wanted to give this book the full 5 stars but what ultimately undoes it is the ending for the last 20 or so pages things start to wind down without any full resolution so as i turned the final page it felt like the more things change the more they stay the same darling's story isn't over but it feels like it short of a sequel i guess except it didn't feel satisfactory it didn't feel like it addressed some of the biggest questions in the book and for me that's a disappointment i can understand an open ending where i am left to imagine the very best for darling but when it all ends the way this book does i just feel unfulfilled would i recommend it yes but don't expect a happy ending or even much of an ending at all","1457":"quite a nice book although i wouldn't call it a novel it contains very strong stuff but it is a bit like the writer didn't know what to do with it a nice start anyway pleasant funny voice very passionate","1458":" this is one of the best novels i've read in recent memory while i understand the criticism lobbed against the book how much the author crams into one book the moments where she speaks for an entire displaced people the second half of the book which is more a series of stories than a cohesive narrative arc i don't think any of those points are true impediments to the story especially not in this author's capable hands the voice was lyrical and raw and constantly compelling the characters were vibrant and memorable every time i placed the book down i felt compelled to pick it back up and read just a little bit more and that vague abstract inchoate feeling is what i most look for in a book","1459":" told from the perspective of 10 year old darling we need new names tells the story of her life growing up in zimbabwe and later her life as an immigrant in america the chapters are like short stories that could stand alone and this means that there isn't a particular story line that runs through the book instead we get to read about different events at different stages of her life they do not feel disconnected from each other though and the book flows easily i couldn't stop reading it at times the adventures of the children at the beginning are entertaining and funny but can quickly go to heart breaking before you know it although the no nonsense tone of the book never wavers which gives the feeling of this is just how it is for them which in itself is extremely poignant the characters are interesting especially the children but because of the way the book is separated into the different stories they are not fleshed out enough for me but then i always want to know more the second half of the book is about adjusting to life in america as an immigrant and how the reality did not compare to darling's perception of what it would be like obviously this is a completely different setting and while it might not have had the vibrancy of the first half it was still interesting engaging and probably relevant to many people reading it the chapter the book gets it's name from is outstanding and actually gave me goosebumps the book definitely got me interested in the life and culture of zimbabwe as well as the politics i read someone said that the book should have had footnotes to explain certain things but i love researching things myself so had no issue with it a great debut from noviolet bulawayo would definitely like to read more from her","1460":"i'm a little new to the reading game sporadic at best until i got this ipad and the npr app lol i tend probably to overrate and i only rate on here the books that i really liked when i read pigeon english by steven kelman i thought that was the best book i've ever read it was i loved it read it four times so far lolwe need new names is different it makes me feel differently it makes me never want to read another book because there is not another book that can be better than this nothing that can recreate the bliss i'm feeling right now not a starbucks clover press french roast not a pint of ben and jerry's new york super fudge chunk not the smell of a newly opened can of tennis balls nothing it's bliss i'm going to take a brake from reading to savor this this new favorite book of mine we need new names is bliss and i'm just gonna stay blissful for a while","1461":"noviolet bulawayo's debut is a raw yet lyrical coming of age debut told from the perspective of a young girl darling growing up first in zimbabwe then in the usa bulawayo depicts the struggles of trying to forge a life apart from one's country","1462":" in my opinion this book was a much needed voice telling stories that have slipped past our attention bulawayo tells the story of darling a young zimbabwean girl struggling to thrive with her friends in the wake of colonialism induced damage she dreams of leaving zimbabwe for the united states a land of prosperity and promise view spoiler however america is not all she expected it to be it contains its own set of struggles challenges of belonging and being torn between the two nations she calls home view spoiler i felt this book ended slightly abruptly hide spoiler hide spoiler the pace of this book isn't constant which i think sums up the whirlwind of experiences darling faces throughout the novel it is real interesting and presents a different lens through which we perceive 'western' society","1463":"i saw this book to be a series of short stories each chapter featuring the main character darling as she moves from a 10 year old in zimbabwe running free with her friends but in a country that is broken to her new life in america where she lives with her auntie as an illegal immigrant the crux of the book comes in the last four chapters as darling grapples with living in a country of plenty where people are less happy than where she left she is amazed at a girl she meets who is rich goes to cornell has a dog who has its own bedroom and wardrobe a fridge full of food but has chosen to be anorexic to be more beautiful she yearns for what she has left has guilt because she knows she cannot return and maintain hope that things will get better lovely use of language especially in the spoken words from the children in the early chapters","1464":"i listened to this audiobook first some thoughts on the audiobook itself i really enjoyed the experience of having this book read to me the reader brought accents and mood and sang the songs i feel silly saying the accents brought the book to life for me but they really helped me realize when american english jarred against darling's language and after she'd been in the states some years her accent slipped away the quote about language is the most favorited one from the book so check it out that said with this book i wanted to pay more attention than i guess i usually do to audiobooks sometimes i would be distracted and miss a sentence and be lost for awhile and there were so many times when i wanted to highlight and reread and dog ear and i couldn't do that with an audiobook then the story itself i'm surprised it isn't more highly reviewed here perhaps i would've had a different experience if i had read the words on the page instead of hearing them the story was amazing the chapters could be read as a collection of short stories which didn't bother me darling's childhood in zimbabwe during the post independence unsettled time post 2000 maybe as told through a child's eyes we saw death starvation aids incest horrible things told as part of daily life and often incorporated into childhood games like others i agree that the second half of the story is less engaging especially the very last few chapters but i really appreciated the immigrant perspective of american culture contrasted to her and the friends who stayed home initial glorified ideas of how everyone in america is rich and happy and successful","1465":" in we need new names noviolet bulawayo weaves together a powerful story linking zimbabwe to america through snapshots of a young girl's life it is a coming of age story set against the backdrop of a comparison between the very different realities of two countries but really it's so much more than that the author is a master of her craft at times her prose sings like poetry and brings words to the collective voices of a human heart she possesses a keen insight into our world that lends understanding depth and wisdom to her words view spoiler lines such as the following illustrate my point what exactly is an african godknows asks pg 119on the surface it appears to be just a child asking for clarification after hearing men shout africa for africans but in the context of the scene with the white people being removed from their home the question posed is more complex than it first seems what does it mean to be african these people were born in africa but are they african i don't know the answer but the question left a huge impact on me and proved to me that this is an author that knows what she's doing hide spoiler the contrast and exploration of zimbabwean life versus that in the u s a is stark and real there is no over glorification or softening of the reality truth shines from the heart of this novel and therein lies the source of the very real emotions that bleed from the characters it's no surprise that the people in this book feel as real as anyone i've ever known poignant and moving this story poses many questions about what it means to suffer the definition of home immigration leaving the past behind and much more but most importantly what it means to be human and how for all our differences we are more similar than not","1466":"the chapter titled 'how they lived' is lyrical and among the best things i have read","1467":"this is not a novel about zimbabwe's heartbreak mugabe colonialism immigration or the struggles of the undocumented in america it is a story of identity and how little control one has over it darling's story is the story of 21st century immigration which severs ties to the homeland without forging a new one to one's adopted home these are people without a people the novel's story is remarkably and hilariously told collapsing the seeming distance between corrupt zimbabwe or other failed african states and the united states and dispensing with typical somber overly sentimental stories of poor poor africa half the time it seems life in destroyedmichegan what the zimbabwean children call detroit is far worse than life back home can't wait to see what bulawayo writes next","1468":" astounding bulawayo takes hard things conflict in africa child narrators of adult fiction telling an all too common story in a new and brilliant way and makes an incredible debut novel the language the voice the characters all were incredible read this book for all of it even if you just read it for two separate short chapters that read like prose poems read it you will feel feels and be inspired by the good books like this that are in the world and maybe also be inspired to make change in the actual world that makes books like these true and necessary","1469":"having spent some time in southern africa i think this book tells an important story about the lives of ordinary people who live in a time of upheaval and violence","1470":"this started off so strong i felt it lagged a bit in the latter half","1471":"it's really a 3 5 for me i almost gave up on the book due to the slow beginning but i stuck with it after a day's break","1472":"it is the story of darling she is born in zimbabwe and in the first part of the book she is ten years old darling and her gang of friends chipo godknows bastard stina and sbho do pretty much what children left to their own devices will do in terms of games adventures and getting into trouble the first part of this book was my favorite when she is young and in her country","1473":"beautiful writing in places does a great job of helping you feel an immigrant's displacement no longer at home in their country of origin nor in their new country","1474":"another wow book for me","1475":"more like 4 5 i hate that goodreads doesn't have half points i enjoyed reading his darling comes to america for a better life from zimbabwe but it's not the paradise she expected she's an immigrant so she struggles to fit into america as well as dealing with leaving her homeland when she skyps with her old friend at the end of the book it's this stark realization and both unfair and real she left zimbabwe can she still call it her home country because if not can she call america that great read and wonderfully written","1476":" excellent debut novel about the central character's childhood in zimbabwe and eventual life in the united states the author has a very sharp eye there are lots of sardonic observations about life in the us through the eyes of the narrator who has experienced real suffering i enjoyed the novel in its childhood chapters but my favourite sections were the later parts the novels observations made me look at my own surroundings with the fresh pair of eyes of an african child don't be put off by the serious sounding subject matter this novel has loads of laugh out loud funny moments i'll definitely look forward to more from this writer","1477":"i was glued to the ebb i loved the book","1478":"loved it well deserved pmace on booker longlist","1479":"first things first noviolet bulawayo's we need new names from a technical point of view is very well written novel it's from the protagonst's darling's pov from the ages of 10 17 starting off in her town of paradise in zimbabwe and ending in america as she prepares to go to college darling describes the heartbreaking circumstances and culture of her little shanytown and the heartbreaking circumstances and culture shock of being in america and realizing that the american dream is nothing but a dream the character of darling is incredibly bright sort of skating on that mary sue territory but never quite entering actually i was reminded of those smart aleck y bratty kids i realy want want to smack so kudos to bulwayo for her authenticity i enjoyed reading about paradise and budapest from darling's eyes sometimes children aren't given enough credit and are perceptive as darling demostrated but lack the wherewithal to do something about it such as when darling's pregnant school friend chipo explained the circumstances of how she became pregnant darling had no idea what to say and she really shouldn't have i resonated with darling over her anger over her father returning him sick from south africa something about it i related to it was a bit chilling i liked that although things are very different in america darling stayed true to herself she acclimated to the culture but she never lost herself i did feel bad for her over that disconnect of culture the argument that chipo and her have is brutal and i know that she was right but because of the brutality i was on darling's side we need new names was good it was a simple story yet it was complex it was a quick read and i can't wait to see more from bulwayo","1480":"this young writer is remarkable one can see the environment hear the children her powers of description are great i also learned something about zimbabwe and about america","1481":"fabulous book beautifully written so many times i wanted to weep the chapter about not being able to go home but not really belonging in america was so sad being familiar with and fond of zimabwe made it even sadder i can't wait for her to write more","1482":"probably a 3 5 pretty uneven as it is really a collection of linked short stories some have real power and some fall flat bulawayo can certainly write and her use of english to capture different voices with entirely different linguistic backgrounds is really quite beautiful but i felt that there were an awful lot of cliches jammed into one book everyone acts like you expect them to act that said i like the young female take on the immigrant experience and also that it's midwestern so many of the immigrant stories you read are new york focused","1483":" a rare insight into life in zimbabwe in recent years i have found this a challenge to review as at times i found it fascinating at others confusing there are two distinct phases the first where the narrator darling is growing up in a shanty town after her family's home was destroyed has an exuberance about it as childhood games intersperse with shocking and violent events the second has a sort of bleak eloquence as darling starts a new life in the usa living with relatives and reflecting on the effect on her culture of the mass exodus of people as conditions back home become steadily more intolerable there were many sections i found striking one in particular was where darling reflects on the history of her country there are four homes inside mother of bones's head home before the white people came to steal the country and a king ruled home when the white people came to steal the country and then there was war home when black people got our stolen country back after independence and then the home of now it brought into focus the turbulent history of zimbabwe just within living memory there were times though when i feared i was not really getting the message of this novel no more so than at the end the image with which it leaves its readers is such that some interpretation is needed and i guess it comes down to the confidence with which you make that interpretation whether you feel a sense of closure or not","1484":" i liked the author's approach in this novel of capturing the reader by prose and circumstance this is not a plot driven read characters are developed throughout the entire story she consistently leaves you wanting more theme of displacement prevails favorite passage \"in america we saw more food than we had seen in all our \"lives and we were so happy we rummaged through the dustbins of our souls to retrieve the stained broken pieces of god we had flung him in there way back when we were still in our own country flung him during desperate desperate moments when we were dizzy with hunger and we thought how come he will not pity us how come thought why does he not hear us why thought how come we ask and ask and ask and still are not given even a morsel how come and blind with rage we flung him away and said better no god better no god than live like this praying like this for things that will never come better no god \"excerpt from bulawayo noviolet \"we need new names \" reagan arthur books 2013 05 21 ibooks this material may be protected by copyright check out this book on the ibooks store https itunes apple com webobjects m","1485":"a difficult read the first half dealing with the poverty and despair of living in robert mugabes zimbabwe the second half deals with the alienation of living in the unites states it was well written but i have read to many depressing third world novels this year to probably fully appreciate it","1486":"i had mixed reaction to this one strong positive reaction to the style of writing what a singular way with words some meaningful and poignant expressions of the immigrant experience the negative i had serious trouble with some sections maybe i was too puritanical in my reading response but i personally did not enjoy reading the unpleasantly detailed adult x rated film scenes especially the one with the knife the inclusion of sex violence experienced by characters themselves as part of the story is something i can understand much more readily than the one step removed watched sex and violence the difference is minor but as an older reader it seemed unnecessary to include such graphic descriptions of the distasteful tv watching scene","1487":" i really liked it especially for the fact that the us portion of it takes place in detroit and kalamazoo mi when i was in law school i had several clients from africa who had resettled in that area i liked hearing about that experience from the perspective of a character who would have been in a very similar position to my clients i like the unique tone of the novel with the very conversational narrative style of the main character i liked learning about zimbabwe too the portrayal of zimbabweans as focused on getting to the us made me a little bit sad i have to say i think that goal is true of so many communities around the world unfortunately even though the us is a more stable place to live with more opportunities and i fully support the right of movement for all people it makes me sad that people around the world are not able to live comfortably and happily in their own home towns i wish there was a solution other than forced migration to improve the lives of people around the world because although migration is possible for some it is not possible for many and there have to be other ways to sustain everyone nevertheless i greatly enjoyed this book and i look forward to the next work from this author also she lives in oakland so i will be attempting to befriend her if i run into her in a coffee shop","1488":" oh stars ratings bulawayo' s writing has effectively depicted such a bleak picture in my brain of life in zimbabwe life in america life anywhere that i am thoroughly depressed and somewhat shamed this is a writer who charms you with the antics of the poor but creative and precocious children in their paradise with the clever and intelligent games they play through the memorable character of darling we experience these games and then the hard realities of coming to america bulawayo slyly strips away the american dream through darling' s observations until you recognize yourself somewhere in this farce and that is eye opening and uncomfortable and that is why the writer writes","1489":"this is an amazing book once i opened it i couldn't shut it darling and her friends navigate the slums of zim really good","1490":"and admirable first novel presenting the african immigrant experience as narrated by darling a young zimbabwe girl delightful comparison of cultural excesses and atrocities that make them seem more similar than different think of south park author's the book of mormon on steroids","1491":"one of the best books i've read in a long time much to think about and great for discussion plus met noviolet bulawayo at milpitas library as part of silicon valley reads","1492":"i have read my share of female post colonial immigrant narratives but this is a fresh raw take very powerful","1493":"a window into a very different to me human reality written with humour and from the heart highly recommended","1494":" an impressing novel this is one of those books that will stay with you long after you've finished it the story is so well written that it feels almost like you know the person and are a part of their life i like the way the author tells the story matter of factly not preaching or explaing to the reader what is going on but leaves it to the reader to think and draw their own conclusions this book depicts extremely well the basic differences between western and african thinking and it challenges you to reconsider things that you take for granted i warmly recommend this book to absolutely everyone","1495":" i am looking for new books to add to my contemporary world lit course reading list this isn't going to be one of them the book provides a much needed glimpse into the harsh conditions of the slums of zimbabwe but there is so much bitterness in this book that it became impossible to finish i actually stopped reading the book within fifty pages of the ending i can handle justified anger but without redemptive moments or glimpses of hope i can't continue to plod through it early in the novel the plot is engaging and the young characters are believable in their youthful interpretations of situations and their individual motivations however after darling reaches america the plot stalls out i understand that this part of the novel reflects the loss of connection between darling and her home that she as the cultural migrant has been displaced from her community and all that is familiar to her and she must make sense of this new place in which she is experiencing a new type of homelessness this sense of uncertainty is mirrored in the novel as toward the end the writing takes a turn away from plot and the story just tapers out one full chapter is even written in sermon form i understand that rage and frustration go hand in hand with brutal poverty violence and cultural displacement however bulawayo seems to indict everyone for this tragedy the history of colonialism modern corporations the whites of zimbabwe the blacks of zimbabwe americans cnn reporters and humanitarian workers so that there is nothing left to feel except hopelessness despite my personal distaste for the second half of the book the novel does provide eloquent insight into the complexity of the problems facing zimbabwe i wish i could give the first half of the book 5 stars and the second half of the book 1 star hence 3 stars","1496":" more like a 3 7 rating this novel was extremely well written and bulawayo has her own unique voice and absolutely wonderful ways of describing things e g ' i am also feeling this strange stirring inside me this thing without a name that makes me want to clap my hands and jump and shout and just get crazy with it like i have swallowed electricity ' darling is a captivating character as are all her friends who live in paradise and i loved that they all had names such as godknows bastard and mother of bones it is in part what lends the novel its quirkiness and humor it is a simple read i got through it in two days but explores some powerful themes such as colonization diaspora and the pain of leaving one's home country of that constant 'missing' and of changing despite yourself so that even your friends and family become strangers my only problem with we need new names is that it read more like a collection of short stories rather than a novel the lack of a linear sophisticated plot bugged me and especially the second part of the book when darling moves to america seemed more like a series of random though astute observations of an illegal immigrant than a progressing story some of which i had already heard before though i enjoyed it i'm not sure it was nuanced or sophisticated enough to justify its place on the booker prize shortlist though bulawayo is a gifted writer i'm definitely looking forward to more work from this writer","1497":"update 8 26 2015 3 5 starsreread this for my in person book group my feelings are still pretty much the same i do find this book frustrating because i think the potential for a 5 star book was there the author just tried to take on too much in less than 300 pages i thought the first part of the book about darling's childhood was the best part the book is well worth the read it just left me feeling like it could have been so much more original review 3 5 starsi'm really not sure how to talk about this book if half stars were an option i would give it 3 5 i don't generally like books with child narrators and i probably would not have picked this one up if it hadn't been short listed for the man booker prize that being said i'm not at all sorry that i did parts of it i really liked and thought that it was a heartbreaking story but it didn't feel like a novel to me more like a collection of related short stories the problem that i have with this style is that the characters never feel fully fleshed out i'm not sorry i read this as i think it discusses important topics would be a good book club choice","1498":"this is a nominee for scsu's common reading program 3 5 rounded down it was okay i liked it but just wasn't really drawn in as much as i want to i think i have trouble connecting with african style writing i just felt like the story was a little disjointed at times though the depictions of the immigrant experience and search
